FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (5): Research moves to sharper
focus - Therapeutic categories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As growth of the world's pharmaceuticals market continues to decelerate, so
research and development managers are being forced to be more focused in the
way they direct their companies R&amp;D efforts.
'I think R&amp;D spending will slow down,' says Dr Roy Vagelos, chairman and
chief executive of Merck. 'Over the last 15 years, R&amp;D has grown at about 14
per cent a year. I'd love that to continue, but it's no longer an option.'
Most groups are responding to the new environment by reducing the number of
therapeutic categories they explore. Admittedly, a few, giant groups, can
continue to cover most areas. Dr Edward Scolnick, president of Merck
Research Laboratories, says: 'You can do research in most things in most
therapeutic areas. It doesn't cost that much.'
Other companies, without the benefit of an R&amp;D budget of more than Dollars
1bn a year, and 1,800 people working in discovery, are being forced to
concentrate their efforts.
'You have to be at the leading edge of the areas you're researching and you
have to be focused,' says Mr Lodewijk de Vink, president and chief operating
officer of Warner-Lambert.
'It'll be like the biotechnology industry. You'll soon be talking about
burn-out rate for those pharmaceuticals companies still looking at all
areas.'
Choosing which therapeutic areas to investigate is far from easy - 'the
hardest decision you have to make is which areas to explore,' says Dr
William Scott, senior vice-president exploratory drug discovery research at
Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'It's like a kid going into a candy store with a
credit card. You can kill yourself. You have to be very focused.'
Many R&amp;D directors continue to duck the difficult decisions. Although they
claim they are more focused than before, the areas they continue to explore
cover most human diseases. An R&amp;D director whose researchers are looking at
inflammatory diseases can cover diseases as diverse as asthma, rheumatoid
arthritis, and inflammatory bowel syndrome.
When choosing which areas to cover, there are a large number of criteria
adopted by companies. The most important are probably medical need and
biological science, according to Dr Scolnick - 'biologically you have to
understand the basic physiology - what the disease mechanisms are. We find
projects with the right combination of scientific understanding and medical
need and then we set to work.'
Dr Takao Tanakaya, executive director drug discovery division at Fujisawa,
agrees: 'You have to understand the basic pathology of the disease. Although
Alzheimer's looks interesting because there's a huge potential market, we've
steered clear of dementia because we don't understand what's going on. That
means it's difficult to develop anything really innovative.'
Some companies also try to match unmet needs with the their expertise. At
Schering-Plough, management will only work in areas that match the company's
strengths, where the group has sufficient critical mass to make a
difference, according to Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president clinical
research.
The demand for new treatments for diseases in the elderly, such as
osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's has attracted many companies.
Dr Teruhisa Noguchi, executive vice-president for R&amp;D at Yamanouchi,
explains: 'We've decided to concentrate on cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal
and central nervous system diseases, as well as endocrinology, diabetes and
bone disorders. They're all linked to the ageing population which is a real
problem in Japan.'
But there are dangers in focusing only on untreated and unexplored areas.
Some groups see the need to balance the risks between different therapeutic
categories.
Dr Spiegel at Schering-Plough explains: 'There are some discovery areas
where we are quite comfortable that if we invest the money and have the
patience, products will come out.
'But there are others that are high risk areas that are scientifically
exciting and could be of great potential yield, if you hit it right.'
'The problem is that the new areas are really difficult,' says Dr Spiegel.
'In brand new fields, the regulatory and clinical environments are unknown.
'Take Alzheimer's: until Parke Davis had Cognex approved, nobody knew what
sort of efficacy the FDA wanted. There had never been a drug approved in
that area before. You have to have a balance of risk.'
A number of companies have cut the number of therapeutic areas in a
meaningful way. SmithKline Beecham's exit from gastro-intestinal disease
more than 12 months ago - it was an area that virtually created its
predecessor SmithKline French - was probably the most dramatic.
However, Wellcome has also moved out of tropical diseases, and Dr Trevor
Jones, director of research, development and medical, says the group will
stop developing new anaesthetics once it has completed its present
generation of products.
Dr Pierre Simon, R&amp;D director at Elf Sanofi, explains his company's decision
to concentrate on only three areas. 'Seven years ago, Sanofi was present in
all areas of research. I told the chairman it was stupid  - you can't do all
that effectively because development is becoming more and more sophisticated
and expensive. Instead, we decided to concentrate on just three areas.'
Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research
Institute, says: 'We'll have to cut some areas over the next few years. We
won't scale back on cardiovascular or oncology, and we have a very major
position in dermatology.
'We'll also stake our future on immunological areas, but in central nervous
system diseases and diagnostics we cannot lead. Now that there's a bright
light shining down on everything we do, we have to concentrate on those
areas where we are leaders and have greatest strengths.'
Once the therapeutic areas have been chosen, the R&amp;D directors next
difficulty is to decide which of the many compounds competing for limited
developed resources should be selected.
'For the last while, we have only pursued those new therapies that will
produce a clear medical benefit. We will only develop those with a distinct
advantage,' says Dr Paul Herrling, head of research at Sandoz.
'There's much more scrutiny than there used to be about the quality of the
drugs in development,' agrees Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice president
clinical research at Schering-Plough. 'You have to look at what the market
will bear for a product which is only a minor improvement.'
'The medicines have to add value, otherwise we're not prepared to spend time
and money on them,' says Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo.
Dr Scolnick agrees: 'You have to have uniqueness in discovery, otherwise you
end up selling generic drugs.'
Dr Simon adds that he recently cut some beta-blockers and H2-antagonists
from his pipeline even though they were safe and effective - 'they made no
sense because they were little better than existing therapies.' he says.
Similarly, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer last year cut a safe and effective 5HT-3
antagonist similar to Glaxo's highly successful Zofran, because it was no
better than existing compounds, according to Mr Robert Cawthorn, chief
executive.
Some groups abandon even promising and innovative projects, however. Dr
Simon at Elf Sanofi explains: 'When you are using biochemical screening you
come up with interesting compounds that do not fit exactly in the areas
where you want to work.
'We came up with a good asthma drug, but we had no intention of getting into
asthma. We want to license it out. The problem is one of timing. If you talk
to early, you haven't much to say. If you're too late you lose time. You
have to have good clinical trials to show it's good and then sell out
quickly.'
Most R&amp;D directors agree it is far easier to develop good quality drugs than
poor ones. Dr Masaji Ohno, managing director of R&amp;D at Eisai, agrees: 'Our
chairman, Mr Yuji Naito, asks us to find compounds that are so good they
develop themselves.'
At Sanofi, Dr Simon adds: 'You have to set high standards to get compounds
into development. We look at strength, oral activity, duration of action,
the toxicology and genotoxicity.
'We also make sure the molecule can be metabolised in man. The drug has to
clear the bar, even if it's set high.'
Production costs are also an important issue, according to Dr Herrling. 'You
have to look at how complicated the molecule is and how many steps it takes
to synthesise. The cost and complexity of manufacture is becoming much more
important,' he says.
Dr Stephen Carter, senior vice-president worldwide clinical research and
development at Bristol-Myers Squibb agrees: 'If it's going to takes 15
chemical steps to produce a compound, I might need 20 chemists full-time
working for a year to generate enough for a clinical trial. If that's the
case, I might not put it into development.'
The potential market of a drug is also clearly important. Dr Noguchi at
Yamanouchi says his company has set a target of minimum annual sales of Y2bn
 -about Dollars 200m - for drugs to move into development.
One consequence of the new cost-conscious environment is that decisions
about the future of molecules are made much earlier than before.
'Just recently we discontinued a couple of compounds which in earlier times
we would have continued to see what happened to them. Today, we just don't
have the luxury of doing that,' says Dr Spiegel at Schering-Plough.
However, although most companies pay lip-service to the over-riding drive
towards innovation, most R&amp;D directors admit they need to balance their
portfolios for risk. In Japan, these low-risk, low-reward, compounds are
called survival drugs, according to Dr Masaji Ohno, managing director of R&amp;D
at Eisai.
'Let's be honest about this,' agrees Dr Carter at Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'If
you just go for high-risk, high-reward blockbusters, you're just going for
home runs. That's not necessarily good for business.
'You have to have singles and doubles to support the franchises. You need to
balance across the franchises and across the risk. A Dollars 100m product in
an old franchise is more valuable than a Dollars 150m product in a new
area.'
Few companies admit setting out to create me-too drugs. However, Dr Spiegel
admits that when you set out to find something exciting you sometimes only
come up with a drug offering marginal improvements.
An important area little stressed by R&amp;D directors publicly is that of line
extensions.
'We call the process evergreening,' says Dr John Niblack, president Pfizer
central research. Dr Carter at Bristol-Myers Squibb agrees: 'Line extensions
help quality of life and generate increased exclusivity for the company.
'Besides, developing line extensions is easier than developing new compounds
because the safety is already proven - you just have to show efficacy. We
don't have to spend a lot of money on this, but it's worthwhile.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (4): Speed is imperative - Cutting
the time it takes to bring a new molecule to market remains one of the
industry's most important priorities / Bringing drugs to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is imperative to speed products to market, says Dr Stephen Carter, senior
vice president of worldwide clinical research and development - 'you're
dealing with a finite patent life during which you can market the drug
exclusively. That's the period during which you can gain a return on your
investment.
'Even if it costs more 'up front,' saving time can be worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.'
The need to accelerate drug development has become even more acute over the
last 12 months, according to Dr Edward Scolnick, president of Merck Research
Laboratories.
'Cost containment and therapeutic substitution has shortened effective
patent life,' he explains.
'Look at Pravachol and Mevacor (two cholesterol drugs) - they're competing
on price. Although its patents are still valid, they've lost their effective
patent life. When Bristol-Myers Squibb's Capoten comes off patent, we expect
the healthcare companies won't be willing to pay the difference for our
competitor product Vasotec, even though they won't be prescribing the best
medicine. We'll lose our effective patent.'
The difficulty is that although the drugs groups want to bring products to
market as quickly as possible, the regulatory hurdles facing them are
increasing all the time. The regulatory process is becoming increasingly
complex and demanding, says Dr Carter.
'Just take the fact that you now have to do trials using active control
compounds so you can compare the new molecule against the old ones.
'Now you not only have to show that the drugs work, you have to show they
work better than the existing therapies. That often means large trials
involving large numbers of patients. And the fact that regulatory
authorities are asking for clinical end-points, rather than just surrogate
markers. Add on to that the requirements for health economics data. It's
becoming really expensive and time-consuming,' he laments.
Dr Carter admits that one counter-trend is the US Food and Drug
Administration's willingness to accelerate approval for life-threatening
diseases such as Aids when there's no available therapy. But this is an
exception, he argues.
Another problem is co-ordinating development on a worldwide basis. The costs
of development are so high that it is no longer possible to achieve a
reasonable return from just the European, or Japanese, or US market.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer has taken this on board. It is throwing all its
resources at the international development of Taxotere, its new cancer
compound.
'We will be filing the new drug applications in north America, Europe and
Japan within three months of each other. We've never done that before,' says
Mr Robert Cawthorn, chief executive.
Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's director of research, development and medical,
explains: 'Five years ago, Japan wasn't even on the agenda for our company.
Now it's a central part of our thinking and we've 65 clinical scientists
working on phase III trials.'
Similarly, some Japanese groups, such as Fujisawa, are busy trying to
establish international development capabilities.
Bristol-Myers Squibb has now reached the stage where it prepares one core
dossier for Europe and the US.
'A long time ago we used to file a new drug application in the US, and then
look at Europe.
'We know what's required for the individual markets, but it's far more
efficient with a core dossier,' says Dr Carter.
When Bristol-Myers Squibb prepares assays for the European and US regulatory
authorities, it conducts them at Japanese standards, even though the drug
may never be developed for that market - 'if we do decide to take the
product to Japan, it can save us 18 months,' he says.
One of the most important elements in achieving speed to market is ensuring
the compounds picked for development are good ones.
'When the benefits of a drug are incremental rather than dramatic, then
approval becomes a lot tougher. The major breakthroughs are much quicker,'
says Dr Carter.
Once the compounds have been chosen, the R&amp;D director is then faced with the
problem of allocating scarce resources to competing projects.
'You have to prioritise. Otherwise you're dead,' says Dr Carter. 'Dollars
spent on useless compound X, means fewer dollars spent on potential
blockbuster Y'
Most drugs groups have been developing far fewer compounds than in the past.
Bristol-Myers Squibb reckons it has cut the number of compounds in the
pipeline by a third in recent years. At Upjohn, the number of compounds
being developed has been cut from 74 three years ago to 34, according to Dr
John McCall, executive director of discovery research.
Cutting drugs in development is not easy, however. 'It's really easy to
start a programme,' says Dr William Scott, senior vice-president exploratory
drug discovery research at Bristol-Myers Squibb - 'the difficult part is
knowing when to kill it. You have to set stringent go-no-go decisions. And
you have to make those decisions as early as possible. You can save a lot of
time and money that way. You have to be tough. You want to add to the
portfolio as much as possible, making it as rich as possible. So you have to
have strict criteria to make sure all the compounds are competitive,' he
says.
Dr Carter explains: 'One of the hardest problems is knowing when to say
'no'. Your teams invest years of their lives. They will come up with all
sorts of alternative approaches to save the project.
'They will always ask for one more trial. But you have to be surgical. You
have to put the bullet into the brain. Then you turn them on to something
else. You have to have a culture that says you personally have not failed,
it was the project that failed. Human nature being what it is, they tend not
to believe you. And I can't deny that success helps career development.'
Once the compounds have been chosen, all resources must be allocated to
them. Sir Richard Sykes, Glaxo chief executive, explains: 'If you have
priority molecules you have to get them to market as quickly as possible.
Take our neuraminidase inhibitor (for treating 'flu). It's important so it
gets 100 per cent attention. We will spare no expense bringing that drug
through the system.'
'Allocating resources and making these judgments is the most important part
of my job,' says Dr Scolnick. 'On the top-priority drugs, nothing should
rate-limit the process. When we were developing Mevacor (a
cholesterol-lowering drug and fourth-biggest selling medicine in 1992) there
were concerns about its safety. The drug was in limbo. So we threw resources
at it. Half of the dogs we had were allocated to testing Mevacor's safety -
you can't do that with more than two drugs.'
One rate-limiting problem can be manufacture - 'traditionally, you'd make,
say, 5kg of a drug for a trial,' says Dr Carter at Bristol-Myers Squibb.
'And if the trial looked good you'd make another 5kg. For a potential
blockbuster, we'd make it all at the start. In the past, if you didn't do
that, you'd save money, but by hedging your bets, it might take two years
longer to develop the compound. You have to plan for success rather than
failure.'
Drawing up a design for the clinical trials and then sticking to it is also
important, according to Dr Robert Spiegel, senior vice-president, clinical
research at Schering-Plough.
'The major improvement comes from having an agreed aim when you start the
process, and then - it's going to sound like a cliche - doing it right first
time. You have to make sure everyone agrees what you're trying to do and
then not make too many changes so you can avoid being forced to go back to
scratch and start again,' he says.
One technique used by European and US groups - though not Japanese ones - is
parallel development. Dr Spiegel explains: 'It depends on the product.
Either you can wait until you've completed the dose-ranging study and then
start the pivotal phase three study, or you can start the pivotal study
early, using three or four doses. That takes more resources, but it can be
really effective in compressing and telescoping the process.
'Although we might have accrued between 50 and 100 per cent more patients
than we might have done normally, and even taken a little longer over the
pivotal trial, we could shave two or even three years off waiting for the
results of the first dose-ranging trial.'
However, not all are convinced of the need to be first. Dr Roy Vagelos,
chairman and chief executive of Merck, says: 'It's nice to be first, but
it's best to be best. Our ace-inhibitor Vasotec overtook Capoten
(Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug) because it's a better drug. There's nothing
better out there.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (3): Big change in attitudes - One
of the fastest growing aspects of pharmaceutical R&amp;D is contract research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contract research has expanded from a small cottage industry in the
mid-1970s to a business whose worldwide turnover is now estimated at Dollars
3bn a year.
Contract research organisations - known generally as CROs - span the whole
spectrum of pharmaceutical R&amp;D. In the discovery phase, they synthesise tiny
quantities of research chemicals and help to elucidate the pharmacological
action of new molecules.
But their biggest contribution comes in clinical development; indeed, some
of the larger CROs have built up clinical departments as large as those in
medium-sized pharmaceutical companies. Toxicology and laboratory analysis
are the most mature sectors of the CRO market, in which companies routinely
contract out work.
A book just published* by Technomark, a London consultancy, contains what is
claimed to be the first comprehensive analysis of the international contract
research industry. It shows that there about 1,000 CROs worldwide, of which
at least 20 have revenues exceeding Dollars 20m a year.
Richard Wyse and Graham Hughes, the Technomark authors, estimate that the
European CRO industry has a turnover of about Dollars 900m, of which the UK
accounts for Dollars 400m. Britain is the preferred location for drug
development programmes, they say, because of the strength of its scientific
expertise, its health and academic infrastructure and, above all, its
favourable legislative and economic conditions.
Factors fueling the rapid growth in contracting out include:
Regulatory and legislative changes which require pharmaceutical companies to
carry out larger and more wide-ranging studies.
Globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry; CROs have local knowledge and
skills which can be very attractive to, say, a Japanese drug company trying
to expand into Europe.
Growth of biotechnology companies which have little in-house experience of
the complex process of clinical development and cannot afford to staff their
own overseas offices.
Strategic decisions by many pharmaceutical companies to use CROs for certain
areas of R&amp;D, so as to accelerate development and cut costs.
Increasing recognition by the industry that CROs represent a valuable source
of expertise.
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, explains why CROs are so useful
 -'in R&amp;D, there's a baseline level of activity and then there are peaks and
troughs. It's important not to staff up for the peaks,' he says. 'The idea
is generally to contract out for the peaks; that way we can keep a lean
machine.'
That is the classic justification for contracting-out. Dr Pierre Simon, R&amp;D
director of Elf Sanofi, puts it similarly: 'Development comes in waves. We
want to use our development capacity at 100 per cent,' he says. 'Anything
over 100 per cent and we turn to CROs. That's better than hiring new people.
This is an unstable world. I'd prefer not to hire people and then fire them
a couple of years later.'
Japanese drug companies with global ambitions have particular reason to
contract out clinical development overseas. 'We already use CROs in the US,'
says Mr Masaji Ohno, managing director for R&amp;D at Eisai. 'We aren't sure in
Europe yet. There's no tradition of CROs in Japan, but they make it very
easy to enter clinical trials. It allows us to avoid building up an
expensive infrastructure overseas.'
Mr Mitsuhiko Sentoku, director of planning and development for Daiichi,
agrees. 'We can acquire very good clinical data in London - we're putting
one of our leading products Cravit through CROs in Europe. That avoids
having to build up important infrastructure.'
Sir Richard Sykes draws a clear distinction between contracting-out and
collaborative research. 'Contracting-out is for a specific task; we lay down
the parameters and we pay for it,' he says. 'That's quite different from
collaboration, where there's a close flow of information between us and our
partners.'
In 1992/93, Glaxo spent Pounds 183m on research, of which Pounds 39m went to
external organisations - mainly collaborative partners. In the same year,
the company spent Pounds 556m on development, of which Pounds 128m was
external - mainly contracted out.
'Our major competitors are still the pharmaceutical companies themselves,
rather than other CROs,' says Dr John Mills, senior vice-president for
Europe at Besselaar - one of the largest CROs with 1,100 employees
worldwide.
'In some companies the medical directors are resistant to contracting-out
because they think they will lose control by handing work over to us. People
are not yet as open with us as they could be.'
Even so, Dr Mills says, there has been a huge change in attitudes over the
past 20 years.
'When I started out in the industry, you contracted-out the bits which you
really didn't want to do or which you were afraid might fail.
'Contracting was regarded as a rather mucky end of the business - and not
very exciting. We're much more respectable now.'
Mr Simon Garnham, who founded Chiltern International in 1982 and has seen it
grow into a substantial European CRO, describes another change.
'The market has developed from a very immature, not to say casual, situation
10 to 15 years ago when significant clinical research expenditures were
often made on the basis of discussions and a simple exchange of letters, to
a point today where sophisticated 30-page legal agreements accompanied by
full product specifications and costings are more the norm.'
Most people in the contract research industry expect it to continue growing
in the years ahead, though not as quickly as over the past two decades.
'The minimum critical mass necessary to undertake larger projects today is
somewhere of the order of 100 staff, spread amongst a balance of departments
giving really quite significant drug development capabilities,' says Mr
Garnham.
'But by trying to keep the size of functional groups modest, say between 20
and 30, it is possible for contractors to respond to clients better and for
clients to identify better with those groups who are providing services.
'Overall, the market today is still very fractured.' he says. 'In 20 years'
time, people in business schools will probably look back and refer to this
as a classic situation of an immature market developing and polarising into
a relatively small number of relatively large players who dominate the game,
together with a relatively large number of small players to provide highly
specialised services - in particular, therapeutic or geographical areas.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (2): Combination of brains and
brawn - Drug discovery, the first phase of pharmaceutical research, is being
reshaped by several strong technological forces / Research trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the most powerful factors in pharmaceutical research may seem to be
leading in different directions. One is the ability to screen vast numbers
of molecules - which may be natural products or synthetic chemicals - ever
more rapidly for useful pharmacological activity. The other is the use of
computers to design an individual molecule to fit perfectly into a
particular biochemical slot, such as a receptor site on an enzyme.
There are indeed companies focusing hard on one or other of these
approaches. For example, Affymax of Palo Alto, California, has pioneered a
technique to make and test millions of new compounds, by putting together
peptides from random combinations of amino acids. The pharmaceutical
industry is suddenly showing great interest in creating huge 'chemical
libraries' of this sort for mass screening.
At the other extreme is Agouron, based further south in La Jolla,
California. It is a leading exponent of 'rational drug design' by computer.
The company says its anti-cancer drug AG-337, now in clinical trials, is the
first in the world developed from scratch by computational chemistry,
without reference to existing compounds. Agouron designed AG-337 to inhibit
thymidylate synthase, an enzyme required by rapidlydividing cancer cells.
But most drug companies are combining brains and brawn in their approach to
drug discovery, says Dr Trevor Nicholls, European managing director of
Amersham Life Science, a UK-based supplier of research tools to the
pharmaceutical industry - 'some of our customers are using both approaches
in tandem. They look for a good shape to fit a particular receptor, through
the principles of rational drug design, and synthesise many molecules with
the same general shape. Then they use 'high throughput screening' to find
the best of this rationally chosen bunch.'
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, agrees that the use of chemical
libraries in this way has enormous potential - 'if you have a target - if
you have identified a receptor or enzyme, you can clone its gene and
crystallise the resulting protein. Then you can look at the active site and
say: this is the sort of molecule you can fit into it. With chemical
libraries, you can make thousands of variants and see whether by iteration
you can get a better and better fit.
'You're limited at the moment with chemical libraries - they consist mainly
of peptides - but as the technology develops you will be able to make
thousands of variations of these molecules instead of needing medicinal
chemists to make them. Then the fine tuning would be done by medicinal
chemists,' Sir Richard says.
Glaxo launched a chemical libraries initiative last year. In the US the
company has an ambitious programme to synthesise a million small molecules.
In the UK, Glaxo is concentrating on building up chemically diverse
collections of organic molecules that might be developed into drugs.
Sir Richard says chemical libraries and their associated technologies will
enable research chemists to spend less time on the routine aspects of
organic synthesis and more on the creative medicinal aspects of chemistry.
Meanwhile laboratory automation, together with new techniques such as
Amersham's Scintillation Proximity Assay, is rapidly speeding up the rate of
screening. 'People are regularly running assays with up to 10,000 samples on
a single screening run, which can be completed within a day,' Dr Nicholls
says. 'Some companies are now looking to increase that by a factor of 10,
for example by mixing several compounds in a single well. If you get a 'hit'
in a particular well, you then separate the compounds out and test them
individually.'
Dr John McCall, executive director of discovery research at Upjohn, says his
company is 'now using recombinant technology to screen as many as 12,000
compounds in a day - which used to take 12 to 15 months. That represents one
of the biggest revolutions in molecular biology.'
Both mass screening and rational drug design share a common underlying
technology: genetic engineering. They are feasible because 'recombinant DNA'
techniques enable researchers to clone the gene for any protein receptor and
transfer it to cells in culture, which then produce large quantities of the
pure protein.
For screening, the protein is incorporated in an assay which tests whether
candidate drugs bind to it. For drug design, X-ray crystallography is used
to obtain the protein's precise three-dimensional structure which can then
be fed into a computer programmed to carry out molecular modelling.
Agouron employs 17 X-ray crystallographers who play a central role in the
drug design process. They crystallise not only the pure target protein but
also the complex formed when the drug binds to it. Their structures are fed
back to the computer scientists, who use the detailed information about the
binding site to improve the drug further. So the design process involves an
iterative cycle between computer modelling and crystallography.
How will drug discovery develop in the future? 'Over the next few years,
we're going to see more emphasis on experiments taking place within living
cells,' predicts Dr John Maynard, research director of Amersham
International. 'You can only examine cellular expression systems by looking
at living cells.'
Sir Richard Sykes believes that it will become technically possible to
improve the structure of candidate drugs in situ, while the molecule is
actually attached to the target site, through a process of chemical
evolution - 'the long-term potential is to put some sort of evolutionary
pressure on the discovery process,' he says.
'For example, if you have an enzyme, by an evolutionary technology you would
develop the molecule within the active site. I would think this is the way
people are thinking: move away from peptides to small organic molecules and
alter them within the active site. In effect you're trying to speed up the
process of natural evolution.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (1): Survival of the fastest -
Research used to be an expense which was never questioned, but not any more.
The high costs of developing new medicines, tighter regulatory demands - and
pressures on national health budgets - mean that only those groups capable
of bringing innovative preparations quickly to the market will survive

The flow of funding for pharmaceuticals research and development - the
lifeblood of the drugs industry - is under threat. Drugs companies' ability
to raise R&amp;D spending is being undermined by healthcare reforms introduced
by cash-strapped governments around the globe.
'I've never seen the like of last year before. It was grim. Nearly every
country took one route or another to cut drugs expenditure,' laments Mr Rene
Dehecq, president of Elf Sanofi, the French group.
Last year prescription drugs sales in the top 10 markets grew only 4 per
cent, according to IMS International, the market research group. The sector
is unlikely to expand faster this year.
The mood of the industry, which has been used to growth of between 17 per
cent and 20 per cent a year, has descended into deep depression.
'The climate has changed dramatically from one of expansion to feelings of
great introspection, examination and constraint,' explains Dr Leon
Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research
Institute.
Admittedly, market growth had already been decelerating before last year but
drugs companies had previously responded by cutting manufacturing, marketing
and general administrative costs. R&amp;D had remained inviolate.
Now, the precipitous rise in pharmaceuticals R&amp;D - from Dollars 5.4bn in
1981 to Dollars 26.5bn last year according to the UK-based Centre for
Medicines Research - appears to be ending. The top 10 R&amp;D spenders last year
increased their investment by only 11.4 per cent.
The deceleration in R&amp;D growth may be inevitable, according to Prof Jurgen
Drews, president of international R&amp;D at Roche, the Swiss healthcare group.
'The industry has clearly been over-spending. Global prescription sales
would need to reach about Dollars 280bn a year within 10 years to justify
the present levels of investment. The chances of reaching that figure are
more than low - they are non-existent,' warns Prof Drews.
The 10 largest prescription drugs markets - representing more than 90 per
cent of the world market - were worth Dollars 114.9bn last year.
Dr Rosenberg concludes: 'The worst case scenario would be that the
pharmaceuticals industry as we know it disappears because companies no
longer believe that there is a likelihood of generating a reasonable return
on money put into research. The heady days of R&amp;D are over.'
The impact of healthcare reform and the consequent slowing of sales growth
on R&amp;D spending can be seen in the table (see page two), compiled by the
Financial Times.
A few groups, mostly European companies with strong volume growth, have
managed to avoid slowing their investment. For example, Sweden's Astra, and
three British companies - Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - increased
their spending by more than 20 per cent last year.
Most companies registered only single-digit R&amp;D growth, and a few - for the
first time in recent memory - actually cut R&amp;D spending last year. Among the
top 40-odd pharmaceuticals groups, five companies - three in the US, one in
Europe and one in Japan - were forced to reduce expenditure in not only
real, but also nominal, terms.
Mr Lodewijk de Vink, president and chief operating officer at
Warner-Lambert, whose drugs subsidiary Parke Davis cut its budget, explains:
'R&amp;D used to be a cost-centre that was never questioned. But the days of
macho spending are over. Current levels of spending are clearly
unsustainable and there will be more companies out there cutting R&amp;D. More
is not necessarily better.'
The dangers of cutting research and development are considerable, however.
For some groups it could prove terminal.
'Once a company starts cutting R&amp;D, then it's over. It's the lifeblood of a
pharmaceuticals company,' warns Dr Edward Scolnick, president of Merck
Research Laboratories, the US's biggest drugs group.
Mr Bill Steere, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer of the US and
chairman of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, explains:
'Those companies without anything in their pipeline and with slowing sales
are going to find it increasingly difficult to justify funding R&amp;D
aggressively.
'They're going to get more and more frightened as their income recedes and
that will set up some kind of synergistic death spiral as they cut R&amp;D
because their income is dropping. They'll be killing themselves.'
The irony is that at the same time as R&amp;D spending growth is decelerating,
the scientific opportunities for creating innovative new medicines are
expanding rapidly.
Biotechnology and a greater understanding of the life and death of the cell
are opening up vast new scientific and medical horizons, according to Sir
Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group.
'The basic biology of cellular mechanisms is becoming more and more
understood. Drug design is becoming more of a science than an art,' he says.
Dr William Scott, senior vice-president of exploratory drug discovery
research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, explains: 'The opportunities for making
better drugs are greater than ever before. In a short period of time, most
genes in the human body will be sequenced. Once we can identify the
molecular basis of diseases, then we can begin to treat them.'
The problem of how to access such new technologies is exercising the minds
of all research directors. Many are clearly irked by the view propagated by
small biotechnology pharmaceuticals groups are being left behind.
Although a few groups such as Roche and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer have acquired
biotechnology companies, others have limited themselves to small
joint-ventures, adopting a portfolio approach.
The difficulty for the pharmaceuticals companies is creating the in-house
expertise capable of judging which projects to pick.
Dr Hiroyki Nagasako, board director for corporate planning at Daiichi, the
Japanese group, explains why his company has no plans to link up with
biotechnology companies: 'There are exciting things happening in the US
biotechnology industry but frankly you need to develop proper levels of
expertise to manage these technologies and unfortunately we do not have
these skills. It's an expensive business and you can waste a lot of money.'
Given the increasingly difficult environment for pharmaceuticals companies,
only those capable of discovering and rapidly developing innovative drugs on
a global basis will survive.
Dr John McCall, executive director of discovery research at Upjohn in the
US, says: 'The right response to the new environment is clearly to develop
novel compounds. They're more fun to work with, easier to register with the
regulatory authorities and more profitable. There will be no place for
me-too, copy-cat, drugs in the future.'
Targeting innovative drugs is a high-risk, high reward strategy.
'Development is going to be riskier,' says Dr Robert Spiegel, senior
vice-president of clinical research at Schering-Plough research institute in
the US.
'There will be companies capable of discovering innovative profitable
compounds that allow them to fund further research, and then there are
others who are just going to go down the tubes.'
Meanwhile, given the deteriorating operating environment, company boards are
now insisting that money spent on R&amp;D is invested increasingly productively.
Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's director of research, development and medical
UK, admits: 'Until recently the pressure to look very hard at what we ought
to do has simply not been there.'
Almost all R&amp;D directors are focusing their efforts, cutting the number of
therapeutic areas they explore. They are also concentrating their resources,
taking fewer but more innovative compounds from the laboratory into clinical
trials.
They aim to develop drugs as quickly as possible in the three main markets,
the US, Japan and Europe so that the huge costs of developing the medicines
can be recouped.
The regulatory environment is not conducive to rapid development, however.
Regulatory authorities now require more than simple data proving a drug is
safe and effective. They are already demanding further data to demonstrate a
new compound is better than existing therapies.
In addition, pharmaceuticals companies are also being drawn into the
statistical and methodological quagmire of health economics as the
authorities demand data proving a medicine is cost-effective. Both trends
add time to the cost and duration of a drug's development.
Given the increasing cost of drug development and the need to focus
resources, a number of pharmaceuticals companies have reacted by forging
alliances in particular therapeutic categories.
'We need to collaborate more, not compete in basic research,' explains Mr
Robert Cawthorn, chief executive of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
However, greater scientific collaboration, cost-cutting, and better use of
existing resources can only go so far.
'It's going to be a lot smaller industry. There's going to be a lot of
consolidation,' says Mr Steere at Pfizer.
Second tier companies will need to allocate their resources carefully,
employ considerable skill and enjoy a great deal of luck if they are to
develop the next generation of products capable of ensuring their survival
in this ever-harshening healthcare environment.
The stakes involved in playing molecular roulette are higher than ever
before. Few of those that fail to develop innovative drugs will be
independent by the end of the decade.

FT  23 MAR 94 / British Rail franchise sell-off to be delayed by up to a
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The privatisation of British Rail is to be delayed by up to a year as
government and rail authorities work through the detailed preparations
needed to begin the sale of franchises.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, disclosed yesterday that the
government did not expect to sell off the first six franchises until some
time before the end of 1995. It had originally hoped to sell the franchise
for the Gatwick Express, running between London Victoria and Gatwick
Airport, this autumn and a further six franchises early next year.
'We did indicate an earlier timetable when the Railways Bill was going
through the House but that was before we had done detailed work,' Mr
MacGregor said. News of the delay came less than two weeks before the
creation of separate companies to own BR's track and signalling and to lease
rolling stock.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman, said: 'The Tories' plans for
rail privatisation are falling apart before they've even started.'
Despite the delay, the government still hopes to have privatised more than
half of BR's passenger rail services by April 1996.
The first six franchises to be sold off are expected to be Gatwick Express;
the east coast main line between London and Scotland; the Great Western main
line; the London, Tilbury and Southend line; south-western division; and
ScotRail.
The Isle of Wight line will be sold off later because it will operate as a
single unit including both train operations and track.
Apart from Gatwick Express, which is already operating as an independent
company within BR, the first six franchises will start operating as 'shadow
franchises' from April 1 this year with the remaining 19 due to start in
October. These will be run by their existing management as independent
operations to establish how attractive they might be for private bidders.
A fear of some potential bidders is that the government might reduce or
remove subsidies for lossmaking lines during the life of a franchise. Mr
Roger Freeman, transport minister, indicated that the Treasury would be
expected to maintain subsidies.
The privatisation timetable announcement coincided with the launch of a
campaign against the rail programme by Save our Railways, a protest group,
the Labour party and the three transport unions.

FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 3,200 mark challenged in
nervous trade - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A highly-charged session saw the UK stock market struggle to hold on to the
3,200 mark on the FT-SE Index as it closed just ahead of the US Federal
Reserve's decision to signal a modest rise in short-term interest rates.
In mid-afternoon, the London stock market plunged sharply to a new trading
low for the year of 3,186.9 in the face of a sell-off in stock index
futures.
The market was dominated throughout the day by the prospects for the meeting
of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC). London closed a few
minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve's actions in the US money markets, and
UK analysts were left to ponder the implications overnight.
The session opened strongly, with UK government bonds leading equities ahead
and interest rate confidence heartened in Europe by the Bundesbank
announcement of another variable rate money market repos tender today. UK
company news also continued to help sentiment, as Prudential, the UK life
and general insurance group, joined the list of leading British companies to
increase its dividend payment; but the Prudential share price became a
casualty of the market setback later in the day.
Although trading volume was unimpressive at this stage, the Footsie climbed
by more than 22 points and the market appeared confident in spite of the
uncertainty ahead of the FOMC meeting.
But the stock market was halted in its tracks and then driven sharply
downwards when the June futures contract on the Footsie ran into trouble.
Although selling of the contract, still in its early days, was not heavy,
the price quickly fell through the 3,200 mark and took the underlying stock
market with it.
Traders suspected that futures selling came from securities houses suddenly
nervous ahead of the FOMC meeting. The stock market fell into important
support territory before rallying, once again taking its lead from the stock
index futures sector.
Concern was expressed at the evident power of derivatives markets to
influence the underlying stock market. In part, this reflected the lack of
volume and nervousness in equities while bond markets remain so fickle.
The FT-SE Index struggled back into positive territory to close at 3,201.5,
a net gain of 3.5 on the day. London traders were then left on the sidelines
to watch the response of the US credit markets to the Federal Reserve's
actions which, it was then clear, were likely to lead to an early tightening
in credit policies in the US. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the market
trend, ending the day with a loss of 1.4 at 3,853.1. Seaq volume picked up
in the second half of the session to record a total of 678m shares, a third
higher than on Monday, when retail business in equities was worth Pounds
1.19bn.
The retail number, the most significant guide to genuine investment activity
in the stock market, was at the lower end of daily averages for the past
twelve months.
While some Far Eastern stocks rebounded strongly behind the 4 per cent
upturn in the Hong Kong market, the rest of the UK market was unable to
escape from the shadow cast ahead of the FOMC meeting. The erratic
performance from bond markets over the past week has underlined the
dependence of equities on the interest rate drama currently being acted out
in Europe and the US.

FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A squeeze in stock index futures at the close of trading enlivened what had
been an erratic session in derivatives. The late rally in futures fuelled
strong buying of the underling FT-SE 100 Index ahead of the close of the
stock market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,211, which was about 2 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 10 points, with the strong finish
attributed to a late advance in UK gilts. Volume at the official close was
10,275 lots.
Bonds had also been firmer earlier in the day when June opened at 3,208, and
good buying drove the contract to the day's peak of 3,229.
However, a bout of nervous trading ahead of the US Federal Open Market
Committee meeting saw June surrender early gains and it fell to a low of
3,183 in the early afternoon.
In Liffe FT-SE Mid-250, June traded 97 contracts and it closed at 3,850. The
screen showed no turnover in the same contract on the OMLX.
In Liffe traded options, turnover improved to 43,697 contracts ahead of
today's expiry of the March stock options. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option
was 17,973 lots and 2,594 in the Euro FT-SE option. Bid speculation made
Argyll Group the busiest stock option with a total of 4,530 lots.

FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Prudential concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential, the UK's biggest general insurer was the market's second
heaviest-traded stock with more than 12m shares changing hands after better
than expected preliminary results. Prudential shares touched 343p
immediately the figures were published but subsequently closed 2 1/2 off at
331 1/2 p.
Mr Trevor May, insurance analyst at BZW, increased his current year forecast
for Prudential from Pounds 565m to Pounds 650 after the results, but said
sentiment in the market remained affected by worries about pension
transfers.
Marketmakers said Prudential shares were still affected by the sale early
last month of a near 2.5 per cent stake in the company, some 46m shares, at
350p a share.
Food retailer Argyll saw huge options turnover - 4,530 contracts, equivalent
to 4.5m shares - encouraging speculation that a bid may be in the offing.
KKR, the US leveraged buy-out specialist, was one name being rumoured as
taking a keen interest in the UK group, whose shares have been strong
performers recently.
Argyll shares retreated 3 to 256p in a generally weak food retail sector as
investors were reminded of the industry's problems following results from
Iceland. Continuing margin pressure and sales growth decline were worse than
the market had been expecting and the shares retreated 4 to 153p.
Turnover in aero-engines group Rolls-Royce rose to 16.2m, with buyers
encouraged by an upbeat presentation to institutions on Monday.
Hoare Govett, the group's broker, was said to have had a big buyer, and US
investment bank Lehman Brothers was also reported to have been a keen
purchaser early in the session. The shares, up initially closed 2 1/2 off at
189 1/2 p.
Stocks with a substantial exposure to Hong Kong responded to the big rally
on that market overnight, with HSBC jumping 23 to 783p.
There was an element of unease surrounding NatWest's acquisition of Citizens
First, the US bank, for Dollars 500m. NatWest shares slipped 8 to 464p on
heavy turnover of 10m shares.
Sun Alliance slipped 4 to 325p ahead of tomorrow's preliminary results which
are expected to reveal profits recovering strongly to around the Pounds
175m-Pounds 190m mark, against last year's Pounds 129m loss.
Water stocks were the best performers in a generally strong utilities sector
following a buy recommendation from BZW. The broker's utilities team was
said to have pinpointed dividend potential in the sector, and highlighted
the attractions of Anglian, 510p, North West, 543p and Severn Trent, 572p,
all of which rose 8 on the day.
The power generators also moved ahead strongly, with PowerGen driven by a
Kleinwort Benson buy note. The shares put on 5 to 565p.
Oil shares responded to the latest rise in crude oil prices, to above the
Dollars 14 a barrel level ahead of Friday's Opec meeting in Geneva.
Marketmakers were said to have moved quickly to fill in their short trading
position in the various stocks, driving BP up 6 1/2 to 377 1/2.
Clyde Petroleum slipped 2 1/2 to 34p following results described as
disappointing by some analysts. However, Hoare Govett, Clyde's broker, said
the shares were 'obviously oversold compared with their peers.' Lasmo dipped
late to close 3 off at 128p with the market braced for a possible cut in the
dividend and big underlying losses.
News that metals group Johnson Matthey had signed a collaboration deal with
Canada's Ballard Power Systems boosted the stock and the shares put on 8 to
590p.
Weak bond markets continued to undermine property stocks, with Panmure
Gordon taking a more cautious view on the sector. Land Securities fell 6 to
680p, MEPC 6 to 478p and Slough Estates 10 to 252p.
Packaging group RPC was heavily traded after agency broker Charterhouse
Tilney crossed just over 4m shares, equivalent to 6 per cent of the company.
Dealers said the trade was priced at 162p and the shares closed 3 lower at
that level.
Trinity International the newspaper and packaging group, improved 3 to 458p
on increased profits. SG Warburg raised its 1994 forecast by Pounds 0.5m to
Pounds 23m.
Unilever was said to have benefited from switch advice out of the NV shares
from NatWest Securities.

FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bowater tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paper and packaging company Bowater was the big casualty in the Footsie as
consideration of annual figures prompted concern over profitability. The
shares fell 39 to 453p, a slide of around 8 per cent, with 7.8m traded.
Despite increased profits, reduced gearing and an increased dividend,
underlying profits were flat once gains from currency shifts and
acquisitions had been stripped out. There were also worries that Bowater
would not be able to pass on the rise in paper prices to its customers, and
concern over the short-term future for the company was highlighted by a
change of stance from SG Warburg which has been recommending the shares for
the past five years. The house is believed to be worried that consolidation
among Bowater's customers means that contracts are bigger but rarer and much
more competitive.
There also concerns that Bowater is about to return to the acquisition
trail. However, Ms Chris Munro at house broker Hoare Govett said: 'Bowater
has positioned itself very well for long term growth.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by Zantac challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo, which has one of the highest market
capitalisations of UK quoted companies, fell sharply yesterday as a fresh
challenge was launched at its top selling product.
Geneva Pharmaceutical, an arm of Ciba-Geigy, one of the leading global drugs
groups, has filed an application with the US Food and Drug Administration to
produce a new rival for Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which makes up around 43
per cent of Glaxo's sales. It claims the product would not infringe Glaxo's
patent which expires in 2002.
Bearish analysts, particularly those from US houses, said the news was a
severe blow partly because it constituted a completely new challenge to
Zantac and partly because of the status of the challenger. Ms Jo Walton of
Lehman Brothers said 'The result is further uncertainty making it very
difficult for investors to be clear how long the Zantac franchise will
remain.' A Glaxo spokesman said the company was considering legal action
against the Geneva application.
Very heavy selling after the news broke sent the shares down 21 to 662p on
turnover of 11m, and busy trade in options. Ciba shares were up SFr40 at
SFr855.

FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Stocks react calmly to FOMC
rise in rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks reacted with relative calm yesterday to a signal by the Federal
Reserve that it had decided to nudge up short-term interest rates, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.30 lower to 3,862.55, after
jumping about seven points on the Fed's announcement that its policy-making
committee had voted to add reserves to the banking system. Analysts said the
statement was an indication that the central bank was lifting its target for
the federal funds rate for the second time in two months.
Other important market indices also showed little change on the day, defying
forecasts of a sharp downturn on the news of a rate increase. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.26 better at 468.80, while the
American SE composite inched 0.96 ahead to 471.73. The Nasdaq composite
slipped 0.95 to 796.35.
NYSE volume, at 282m shares, was moderate. Advancing issues led declines,
1,015 to 929.
Investors were tentative as the market opened, as attention was fixed on a
policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in Washington.
Most analysts were expecting the members of FOMC to vote for a further
tightening. But the morning brought no indication of a shift to tighter
money, and blue-chip stocks, in parallel with bonds, moved moderately higher
in early trading.
The Fed's announcement finally came during the mid-afternoon and the
reaction was immediate. In the bond market, prices across the yield curve
jumped amid relief that the long-anticipated Fed action had finally come to
pass. Stocks also improved, but the upturn was more modest and short-lived.
By the close, the Dow industrials were barely changed on the day.
Among individual issues, Alcoa added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 78 3/8 and
Disney was up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 , but Philip Morris lost
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 52 1/8 on news of a congressional recommendation to
raise federal taxes on cigarettes. In pharmaceuticals, Merck dropped Dollars
1 5/8 to Dollars 30 1/2 on reports that its cholesterol-reducing drug would
soon face competition from a cheaper product from Sandoz. Bristol-Myers
Squibb, down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 53 1/8 , was also hit hard by the
news.
On the Nasdaq, investors showed a lack of confidence in Novell's decision to
mount a challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the market for personal
computer software. The stock slumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 20.
Mexico
Mexican stock prices rallied sharply after Mr Manuel Camacho Solis announced
he would not run for the president, putting to rest speculation that has
rattled the bolsa in recent weeks. The key IPC index of 36 leading shares
gained 128.91 points or 5.41 per cent to end at 2,511.92. It was the biggest
one-day percentage rise since January 1991.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed higher in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite
index was up 28.38 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 4,551.88, with advances
edging declines 424 to 423. Volume rose to 67.28m shares from 62.36 shares.
Trading value was CDollars 706.8m.

FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mark time awaiting US
news
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European equity markets marked time yesterday in advance of the decision by
the US Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC), to raise the federal funds rate by from 3.25 to 3.50 per
cent, as they watched for clues from Washington. Before the close of trading
on European bourses the only guidance available was that the committee was
still reviewing economic conditions and had not yet discussed the direction
it wanted to set for interest rates over the coming eight-week period.
FRANKFURT consolidated its position with a day's gain in the Dax index of
10.06 to 2,141.34, but off from the session high of 2,155.31.
Traders said that a weakening in the futures market contributed to the
easing.
Turnover was modest at DM7.6bn.
The banking sector attracted attention with further results due out in the
next couple of weeks. James Capel, in a research note issued on Monday,
noted that its forecasts for 1994-95 had been shaded down for two main
reasons. It said: 'We have probably been too optimistic for the pace of
recovery in terms of lending growth and falling bad debts.' The note added:
'This years trading profits have been adversely affected by the markets'
reaction to the trend reversal in US interest rates'.
Bayerishe Hypo, which pleased the market with results yesterday, added
DM1.50 to DM469, while Bayerishe Vereinsbank, results due later this week,
gained DM2 to DM491. Volkswagen, up DM3.50 at DM490.50, strengthened on
hopes of good 1993 figures due tomorrow.
ZURICH finished higher as domestic institutional buyers returned at current
lower prices but the day's best levels were not maintained. The SMI index
rose 20.4 to 2,824.7, after a high of 2,843.3.
Ciba registered rose SFr40 to SFr855: the company has filed an application
with the US Food and Drug Administration to produce a rival to Glaxo's
Zantac anti-ulcer drug. Nestle, with results due this week put on SFr21 to
SFr1,241.
Sandoz, with results scheduled for tomorrow, rose SFr50 to SFr3,920 amid
suggestions that the introduction of its Lescol cholesterol drug could spark
a price war in the US.
Georg Fischer rose SFr50 to SFr1,310: the mechanical engineering group said
it expected to break even in this year after a 1993 loss of SFr34m.
Holderbank rose SFr3 to SFr963 in response to its 12.3 per cent rise in 1993
net profit.
PARIS fell back from its session high in a volatile session, the CAC-40
index finally closing down 2.01 at 2,200.68. The index moved between a high
of 2,222.52 and a low of 2,196.12.
BNP, which the government said would have its stake in UAP cut from 19 per
cent to 15 per cent as part of the insurers privatisation, lost FFr2.70 to
FFr251.80. UAP was unchanged at FFr189.90.
AMSTERDAM drifted down, with the AEX index losing 1.91 to 414.33. Pakhoed,
the storage and transport group, which repeated its forecast that 1994
earnings per share were set to rise, lost Fl 1.50 to Fl 53.80.
In a separate development PTT, the Dutch post and telephone utility,
announced that its first tranche of shares could be floated on June 7.
MILAN was steady, helped by the positive early tone in other European
markets and having found technical support at Monday's lower levels. The
Comit index edged 0.34 lower to 664.68 as election uncertainties remained at
the centre of attention.
Industrials led the way. Fiat rose L61 to L4,999, Pirelli L58 to L2,431 and
Montedison L43 to L1,238. Olivetti put on L65 to L2,593 as hopes remained
high for a swift decision on Italy's second mobile telephone licence.
ISTANBUL fell 4.8 per cent, wiping out Monday's gains, in uncertain trade
ahead of Monday's local elections. The composite index lost 747.76 to
14,838. The elections are viewed as a key test of whether Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller's coalition government can be trusted to tackle the looming
economic crisis.
Analysts agree that the election will be followed by sharp price rises as
the government relaxes restraints on loss making state run companies, but
observers are divided on what effect the polls will have on financial
markets, hit by a plunging lira and soaring interest rates.

FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Lower bonds hit Tokyo as
Hong Kong rebounds 4%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp sell off in the bond market prompted by concerns over rising
tensions in the Korean peninsula and higher US interest rates affected
investor confidence, and the Nikkei index closed lower amid low volumes,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average declined 215.92, or 1.1 per cent, to 20,253.53 after
a high of 20,458.55 and a low of 20,202.42. Falls in the futures market
prompted arbitrage selling, while small lot profit-taking also depressed
share prices.
Volume was 360m shares as investors refrained from activity ahead of last
trading day for March settlements on Friday. Buying by foreign investors
also declined from previous weeks.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 19.23 to 1,628.01 while the
Nikkei 300 declined 3.42 to 299.27. Losers led gainers by 826 to 247, with
111 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.67 to 1,344.28.
North Korea's rejection of full international inspection of its nuclear
facilities and the subsequent decisions by the US to deploy missiles in
Seoul fueled fears of growing tensions in the Korean peninsula. Such
uncertainty coupled with speculation of a further rise in US interest rates
hurt the bond market, which in turn dampened the share prices.
Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, said that Japanese institutions
may choose to invest in the bond market if long term interest rates rise
further. He expects volatility on the bond market to affect share prices on
the short term and sees the Nikkei index closing this business year between
19,500 and 20,000.
Interest rate sensitive shares lost ground in anticipation of higher long
term interest rates. Nippon Steel fell Y4 to Y350 and Tokyo Electric Power
by Y80 to Y3,290.
Banks were lower on profit-taking with Industrial Bank of Japan down Y100 to
Y3,210 and Sumitomo Bank off Y30 to Y2,170.
Bakery and flour mill stocks were once again sought by speculators due to
the continued rice shortage. Retailers are reporting a rise in sales of
bread and noodles and Yamazaki Baking rose Y30 to Y2,100 and Nitto Flour
Milling gained Y20 to Y550.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 196.17 to 22,349.87 in volume of 92.2m
shares. Aoki International, a retailer of office workers' uniform blue
suits, plunged Y240 to Y3,300.
Roundup
Regional markets adopted sharply divergent routes.
HONG KONG rebounded, the Hang Seng index gaining 4 per cent to finish above
9,000 as bargain hunters sent prices up after the recent losses, and with a
rise in US rates already discounted.
The index jumped 345.14 to end a volatile day at 9,012.17, having swung from
a low of 8,533 to a high of 9,150 as Japanese funds were seen returning as
buyers.
Preliminary turnover was a healthy HKDollars 6.34bn against Monday's
HKDollars 6.52bn.
The turnaround came as Mr Stuart Cook of Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities
said that the Hang Seng was unlikely to hit its January 4 high of 12,599
again this year, but it could rebound to 10,000-12,000 by the end of the
year.
He said that the market was still attractive with strong corporate earnings
anticipated. Interest rates would remain low, and it was unlikely that
property prices would crash in the next 12 months.
However, Morgan Stanley has reiterated its view that the index could touch
or pass the 7,000 level as a result of bloated property prices, the Deng
succession and MFN status for China. 'At the 7,000 level we would recommend
buying stocks heavily. The long term story on China is still intact and as
attractive as ever.'
KUALA LUMPUR picked up 1.4 per cent after recent sell-offs as bargain
hunting lifted the composite index 13.30 to 967.48. The index hit a low of
936.80 in early trade after falling 92.30 points over the previous three
trading days.
SINGAPORE was firmer in a technical rebound after Monday's sharp falls and
the Straits Times Industrials index rose 8.74 to 2,045.04 after hitting an
intra-day low of 1,990.37.
AUSTRALIA saw late bargain hunting pick shares up from their lows, leaving
the All Ordinaries index to finish 0.3 firmer at 2,140.8, having been 14.7
points down at one stage.
SEOUL closed easier in weak trading as mild selective buying centred on some
blue chips was wiped out by selling pressure caused by growing tension over
North Korea's nuclear row. The composite index eased 7.70 to 877.95.
NEW ZEALAND was unnerved by weakness elsewhere and the NZSE-40 capital index
fell 48.41 or 2.2 per cent to 2,206.93 in moderate turnover of NZDollars
44m.
MANILA recouped some of its sharp early losses after Hong Kong's rebound and
the composite index finished 34.97 or 1.3 lower at 2,563.60, after a low of
2,503.
BOMBAY was lower in nervous trade triggered by the Bombay Stock Exchange
declaring a local stock broker defaulter.
The BSE 30-share index closed 28.95 lower at 3,791.78.
COLOMBO was lower again prompting speculation that the correction which
began on March 1 would continue at least until after tomorrow's southern
provincial council election. The all-share index fell 10.01 to 1,256.48.

FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Swedish bull run may be coming to an
end - Emphasis will be on corporate earnings in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bull run dating from late 1992 may finally be coming to an end for Swedish
equities.
Long-term interest rates are heading upwards, thanks to turbulence in
international markets and worries about higher US interest rates, At the
same time a stream of rights issues is soaking up liquidity. The two trends
have combined to bring the most unsettled market conditions for nearly 18
months.
Shares have generally fallen in recent days, but even so the Affarsvarlden
index remains up some 4 per cent since the beginning of the year.
The turbulence may just be temporary: Goldman Sachs in London, for example,
anticipates a 20 per cent rise in the market over the next 12 months.
To some extent, the bourse has been a victim of its own success.
What began as a trickle of companies seeking new equity from their
shareholders has turned into a flood. The government is also making heavy
demands on the market with its privatisation programme, the most recent
being its SKr8bn (Dollars 1bn) sell-off of a 49 per cent stake in forestry
group AssiDoman. Some observers are suggesting that the state's planned late
spring disposal of its stake in Pharmacia - for an estimated SKr14bn-16bn -
should be delayed.
Skandia, the insurance group, and Avesta Sheffield, the stainless steel
producer, are the latest big companies to announce rights issues. According
to one estimate, rights issues and privatisations may soak up as much as
SKr50bn this year, equal to some 3.4 per cent of GDP, and dwarfing the
SKr27bn raised in 1993.
The demand is huge, but supply from both foreign and domestic sources
remains healthy. Last year foreigners bought a net SKr30.8bn of Swedish
shares, taking their ownership of the stock market to nearly 25 per cent.
There has been no sign of a let up in 1994, with a further SKr3.95bn of net
purchases by foreigners in January.
Mr Bjorn Karlin, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Share
Promotion, expects overseas institutions to make SKr30bn of net purchases in
1994 simply because many are still adjusting their portfolio weightings
after Sweden relaxed restrictions on foreign share ownership in January
1993.
He also expects a big inflow of funds from domestic institutions and
households because of higher personal savings, new individual pension
schemes, and changed tax treatment for dividends and capital gains.
Most analysts are agreed that the fundamentals will remain strong in 1994.
However, the driving factor this year will be corporate earnings, rather
than lower interest rates, even though the trend for the latter is expected
to be downward.
Corporate results for 1993 generally met or exceeded expectations, and
further gains are anticipated this year as companies benefit from the three
hard years of cost-cutting and a generally weak currency. One big difference
in 1994 is that currency flows have been hedged at much more attractive
rates.
The general economic picture is also much more encouraging, with positive
GDP growth expected in 1994 for the first year since 1990.
The recovery was triggered by strong growth in exports, following a 20 per
cent depreciation in the krona last year, but is now spreading to the
domestic economy.
The improved economic outlook has brought a strengthening of the krona since
the beginning of the year. This will be positive for foreign interest in the
market, according to Mr Christian Diebitsch, Swedish analyst with Kleinwort
Benson in London.
'I don't think we will see the market rise another 54 per cent rise in local
currencies, like last year, but a strong krona is certainly positive from a
foreign perspective,' he states.
On the negative side, Sweden's huge budget deficit - one of the highest in
the OECD - and an unemployment rate of around 14 per cent will continue to
cause concern about the state of the country's finances.
Uncertainty will also increase as the year progresses, with both a general
election and a referendum on entry into the European Union due before the
end of the year. A 'no' vote in the EU referendum, in particular, would
damage confidence.
These factors aside, there is the market's vulnerability to developments in
the international arena: a vulnerability which has been enhanced by the
increased levels of foreign ownership.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Fed lifts interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve yesterday confirmed US interest rates are on a
gradual upward path when it tightened monetary policy for the second time in
two months, writes Philip Gawith.
The Fed did not specify the extent of the move, but it was taken for granted
in the market that the announcement involves a 25 basis points increase in
the federal funds rate, to 3.50 per cent. This follows a similar rise to
3.25 per cent on February 4th.
The tightening had been largely discounted in the market and there was
little reaction. The dollar rose just over half a pfennig to trade at
DM1.6870 from DM1.68 before the announcement. It was little changed against
the yen hovering at the Y106 level.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman, said the Fed's policy-making Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) had decided to increase pressure on bank reserves in
order to raise interest rates.
'This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in
short-term money market interest rates,' said Mr Greenspan. The announcement
was made after the FOMC meeting at 19h20 GMT.
Attention will now switch to the Bundesbank which is today expected to
announce a further cut in its repo rate. The combination of a rise in US
rates and a lowering of German rates could well give the dollar a
significant upward lift.
In the UK, meanwhile, the release of the February retail price index is
keenly awaited. Some observers believe a good number could trigger a cut in
interest rates, but this is a minority view.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Fed's
action 'confirms that Greenspan is still in a gradualist mode. The strong
implication is that it is a 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate,
not an increase in the (more significant) discount rate.'
Mr Hannah said the nature of the Fed's move also 'adds a degree of
predictability about the timing of Fed interest rate moves. This could help
the markets to settle down a bit.' The February 4th tightening - the first
increase in US rates in five years - sent financial markets into turmoil
with bond yields rising sharply in all western countries.
For the second time in a row the central bank acted after an FOMC meeting,
in the process also showing that it was not responding to specific economic
data. The IBJ analyst described the Fed's move as 'not so much tightening as
normalising on a gradualist path.' Mr Greenspan made clear in February that
he felt real interest rates had fallen to abnormally low levels.
The timing of the move caught the market slightly off-guard. Earlier in the
day the Fed had, in its normal open market operations, added reserves with
two-day system repos which suggested no change in monetary policy. This led
many to believe that the Fed would not act until today.
The dollar continues to be wrapped in bearish sentiment. With last night's
Fed tightening already in the market, one view was that the fate of the
dollar was more in the hands of the Bundesbank than the Fed.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe),
commented: 'What really matters is if the Fed can tighten in tandem with a
Bundesbank move. That is the only thing that will lend significance to a 25
basis point Fed tightening.'
Ahead of the Fed announcement, the D-Mark was firmer across the board in
Europe. It closed at FFr3.418 from FFr3.407 on Monday against the French
franc. Analysts warned that if the Bundesbank did not quicken the pace of
monetary easing, the steady weakening over the past week of the franc could
continue.
The Bundesbank announced it was holding another variable rate repo. The
lowest bid accepted last week was 5.88 per cent, a reduction of six basis
points in the repo rate. Analysts are predicting a fall of up to ten basis
points.
Overnight rates firmed slightly, from 5.70/5.80 per cent to 5.80/5.90 ahead
of the repo, but analysts doubted whether this would have any adverse
effect.
Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, noted that the mid-point
of the overnight rate was still below the repo rate and this normally
favoured a larger drop in the repo rate. 'Banks tend to be quite ambitious
on the bidding,' she said. Last week the overnight rate fell to the repo
rate level only at the time of the auction.
Sterling finished more than a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark, closing in
London at DM2.5094 from DM2.5205. Traders said the UK currency was being
affected by speculation about an interest rate cut.
Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan, warned there was a
danger of a rate cut backfiring. If it upsets the gilts market, this will
put upward pressure on mortgage rates.
In the discount market the Bank of England dispatched a shortage of Pounds
750m without difficulty. Sterling futures firmed slightly with the June
contract a basis point up at 94.85.

FT  23 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Silver leads gold to two-month
high - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London GOLD price was fixed at the highest level since January 20 after
a buying spree, which started in the silver pit of the New York Commodity
Exchange, set-off buying stop-loss orders.
The yellow metal ended at Dollars 389.25 a troy ounce, while SILVER was up
16 cents at Dollars 5.57 1/2 an ounce.
The market had been very steady before the futures opened, buoyed by
continuing tensions in South Africa and concerns over the deployment of US
missiles in South Korea.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER edged up on the back of commission house
and merchant buying, although the move failed above Dollars 1,950 a tonne,
for three months delivery, which dampened sentiment in other metals.
Three months ALUMINIUM ended the day at Dollars 1,334 a tonne, down from its
high of Dollars 1,340 but up on Monday's Dollars 1,328 close. Speculative
and merchant sales were blamed for the late fall.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures set fresh highs, the May position
climbing to Dollars 1,355 a tonne before ending the day at Dollars 1,354, up
Dollars 23.
Some dealers said they were slightly surprised by the rise, which they
thought might reflect a trade house buying in London and selling in New
York.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels' cheese-paring
irritates Italians - John Simkins reports on resistance to a proposal to
reduce the country's milk quota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's milk producers are strongly resisting a proposal by the European
Commission to reduce an increase in their quota just as they believe they
are getting back on track after years of over-production.
Their anger is directed at Mr Rene Steichen, the agriculture commissioner,
who has decided that an agreed increase of 900,000 tonnes in Italy's annual
milk quota, taking it to a total of 9.9m tonnes, should be reduced by
350,000 tonnes in 1994-95.
A hot reception awaited Mr Steichen earlier this month when he was to attend
the opening of Italy's agricultural trade fair in Verona, but the
commissioner had second thoughts and stayed away. In response, Italy's three
big farming associations also boycotted the event. However, the producers
are likely to confront him at Brussels on March 28 and 29 when the European
Union's agriculture ministers will discuss the Italian quota.
Italy, which is a net importer of milk, admits to having violated milk
quotas for much of the 1980s and Denmark, Britain and the Netherlands were
reluctant to see its quota increased. But the 9.9m tonne quota was granted
in the light of Italian commitments to bring production down from an
estimated 11.5m to 9.9m by the end of March 1995. As a first stage, Italy
was expected to reduce production to 10.6m by the end of this month.
The commission believes Italy is not meeting the demands made of it. Whereas
Spain and Greece have had quota increases confirmed - the latter only
provisionally - it has therefore shaved Italy's.
The decision will make it easier for the commission to win the approval of
the 12 EU countries for a suggested 1 per cent cut in quotas in 1994-95.
'The market is fragile and balance is maintained by quotas on the one hand
and subsidising outlets on the other,' according to a spokesman for the
agriculture commissioner. 'There is no guarantee the balance will continue
and there is a serious danger of intervention stocks building up without the
cut in quota.'
Mr Alfredo Diana, Italy's agriculture minister, retorts that Mr Steichen has
acted too hastily and that Italy had until the end of this month to present
evidence of the results of a costly overhaul by the ministry, which has
subjected 130,000 milk producers to quota controls. The Italians hope that
this data will enable Mr Steichen to amend his proposal and he is in close
touch with Mr Diana. However, if the cut is confirmed, Italy may face more
financial penalties on top of the L2,800bn (Pounds 1.12bn) that
Confagricoltura, the farming association, estimates it must pay for
violating past quotas.
The herd-by-herd examination revealed widespread abuses, such as quotas
being claimed by defunct businesses, which disqualified 35,000 farms. The
commission claims that at one time quotas were issued for over 12m tonnes,
compared with production estimated by the Italians at 11.5m, and
Confagricoltura admits that the abuses date back to a period when Italy
'paid too little attention to quotas'.
Mr Steichen has complimented Mr Diana on the progress made but it is only in
the past 18 months that Italy has signalled a serious attempt to get output
in line with quotas. Italy has always objected to the system, mainly because
it imports 60 per cent of its annual 18m tonne consumption and has not
wished to curb development of its domestic producers. Production is
concentrated in the north and transport costs make fresh milk expensive in
much of the south.
'It seems nonsense to cut 350,000 tonnes of quotas from a country that
imports,' says Mr Walter Luchetti, a director general at the agriculture
ministry. Mr Luchetti rejects suggestions that Mr Diana's efforts to reduce
production have met with resistance within Italy's fragmented milk industry.
'Our producers have accepted the regulations and are making great efforts to
comply,' he says.
Confagricoltura says that much of Italy's milk is used to make cheese, which
is not in surplus in the EU, and is sceptical about the effectiveness of
quotas as a method of balancing the market.
'But we are serious about resolving the milk issue because this is essential
to give us negotiating influence in other agriculture reforms,' says the
association.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price reaches Dollars 14
ahead of Opec meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices edged upwards yesterday in advance of the meeting in Geneva on
Friday of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for May was hovering just above the
Dollars 14 a barrel level in late London trading yesterday. That compares
with a closing price of Dollars 13.77 on Monday.
Part of the price increase was attributed to storms in the North Sea, which
prevented tankers from loading at Norway's Statfjord and Gullfaks fields.
Loading operations at Norway's two onshore terminals, Mongstad and Sture,
were also affected by bad weather.
Mr Peter Gignoux, a trader at the London office of Smith Barney, said
evidence of 'a bit more demand from refiners' was also helping to underpin
the market.
The firmer price coincided with a growing belief in the markets that Opec
oil ministers may choose to roll over the present production quota of 24.52m
barrels a day, rather than try to engineer a cut in output to boost prices.
'They are waiting for demand to bring the price up,' according to Mr Joseph
Stanislaw at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. He said that an
extension of the quota for at least the next two quarters could be portrayed
in a 'constructive and positive' light. 'The longer they say this is the
right quota the better it would be for the markets,' he added.
Unlike previous Opec meetings there has been little public evidence of
pre-meeting consultations between member states. Nevertheless analysts say
the roll-over may emerge as the preferred option because a small cut in
quotas of, say, 500,000 b/d would be unlikely to have a lasting impact on
prices and would simply give away market share to independent producers.
A larger cut of 1m-1.5m b/d could provoke a sharp rise in prices, but it
would also raise doubts whether some Opec producers would abide by it.

for 1994-95

<TEXT>
World commodity prices are forecast to rise by 6 per cent in 1994-95,
regaining with interest the estimated overall fall of 2 per cent seen in
1993-94.
According to a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics, commodity prices overall reached a nadir in the first
half of 1993-94, but recovered with a 6 per cent rise in the first quarter
of this year and are expected to show a further 1 per cent increase in the
second quarter. In the next fiscal year Abare suggests demand will
strengthen as more countries move out of recession, and tighter supply
conditions persist, particularly for rural products like sugar, cotton and
rice.
As far as specific commodities are concerned, Abare predicts that the world
gold price should rise by about 7 per cent in 1994, to average USDollars 385
an ounce over the year (close to the present level). The forecasters suggest
that the price rise will result from increased jewellery fabrication and
investment demand, spurred by the general improvement in economic
conditions.
Abare also sees a firming of the wool prices in 1994-95, as strengthening
demand from western Europe and, to a lesser extent, Japan outweighs some
upward revisions to expected level of the Australian wool production. It
suggests that the market indicator price could increase by about 9 per cent,
to average ADollars 5.30 a kilogram clean. However, the average market
indicator for 1993-94 is put at around Dollars 4.85, still marginally below
the previous year's figure.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP set to explore in China's
Tarim basin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum has become the latest international oil company to secure
an agreement to explore for oil in the remote Tarim basin in western China.
Under the terms of the agreement with the China National Petroleum
Corporation BP Exploration and four Japanese partners will spend three years
on a seismic programme, after which they will have an option to begin
exploration drilling.
The consortium's commitment is on a relatively small scale, thought to be
around Dollars 3m for the seismic operation. Other foreign companies which
have recently reached exploration agreements in the area include Exxon and
Texaco of the US, Agip of Italy and a number of Japanese companies.
The Tarim Basin has long been viewed with interest by foreign companies, but
its remote location and lack of infrastructure means development of any oil
finds are likely to be long-term prospects.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Underbidders hope for Chilean
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magma Copper of the US and Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest
company, still hoped to win control of the El Abra project in Chile, one of
the world's biggest undeveloped copper deposits, Mr Burgess Winter, the
president of Magma, said yesterday.
Codelco, the state-owned Chilean copper group, put 51 per cent of El Abra
out to tender last year and in October Cyprus Amax of the US with its
partner Lac Minerals of Canada, was first past the post offering USDollars
404m and an undertaking to spend Dollars 307m on the project.
However, in February, Cyprus and Lac said tests they had made to confirm
previous estimates showed reserves at El Abra might be significantly lower
than previous data suggested and they might have to renegotiate the deal.
Codelco has given them until May 15 to complete.
Mr Winter said that, if negotiations between Codelco and Cyprus-Lac broke
down, Magma-BHP would press for El Abra to pass to them as the
second-highest bidders rather than be put out to tender again.
He said Magma-BHP had bid high for El Abra, offering USDollars 240m, some
Dollars 10m ahead of RTZ of the UK, third past the post. The gap between the
Magma-BHP and Cyprus-Lac bids was explained by the fact that Magma-BHP's
test work suggested that El Abra could support annual output of 160,000
tonnes of copper whereas the highest bidders were looking originally for
225,000 tonnes. 'We thought that was impossible,' said Mr Winter.
Under the rules Codelco set for the tender, failure to conclude a deal with
the highest bidder was to have resulted automatically in the start of
negotiations with the underbidder.
However, Mr Winter pointed out that Chile's recently-elected new government
had changed virtually all of Codelco's senior executives 'so at the moment
it is difficult to find someone to talk to'.
Some analysts have suggested that the disagreement over El Abra is extremely
embarrassing for Codelco as the deal, the first sale of a big ore body by
the group, was supposed to set a pattern for other privatisations. It also
coincided with revelations that a relatively junior executive had lost
USDollars 207m in copper futures trading.
Mr Winter, in London to speak to investors, said Magma expected the copper
price to reach Dollars 1 a lb by the end of this year against last night's
London Metal Exchange three-month price of 88.6 cents.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries jump as Fed nudges rates
higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bond prices jumped yesterday afternoon amid relief that the
Federal Reserve had ended weeks of anticipation by signalling a small
increase in short-term interest rates.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/32 higher
at 92 11/32 , with the yield easing by about 10 basis points to 6.853 per
cent.
At the short end, the two-year note was  7/32 better at 99 11/32 , to yield
4.948 per cent.
The rally, especially at the short end of the yield curve, was surprising.
It suggested that the market had already factored a rate increase into bond
prices.
News of the move came in a mid-afternoon announcement by the Fed that its
policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had decided to increase
'slightly' reserves in the banking system.
Analysts interpreted the statement as an indication that the FOMC had voted
to lift its target for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 per
cent.
Early on, bond traders were content to remain on the sidelines until the Fed
made clear its intentions.
Prices across the yield curve were showing moderate improvement in light
trading before the announcement.
The reaction to the Fed's decision was immediate. Institutional investors
poured money into the market, suggesting that yields, after moving markedly
higher over the past few weeks, were attractive at current levels.
The results of the Treasury's auction of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes
suggested as much. The offering, which was awarded at 5.15 per cent only
minutes before the Fed's move, drew good demand even though confusion over
monetary policy still reigned.
European government bond markets pared their gains yesterday afternoon
following early indications that the US Fed might leave monetary policy
unchanged.
Analysts had been surprised by the Fed's lack of action in the morning
session, since most traders had expected it to sanction a rise of a
quarter-point in the Fed funds rate to 3.5 per cent.
The lack of a morning move by the Fed extended the markets' long vigil for
evidence that European bonds were in the process of de-coupling from the US
market.
Analysts said that if the Fed had left monetary policy unchanged, it would
have been easier for the Bundesbank to cut its repo rate today.
The market had expected the Bundesbank to lower the rate by up to eight
basis points from 5.88 per cent.
UK gilts generally outperformed other European government bond markets,
supported by hopes of favourable inflation data for February due to be
released today.
The market expects a monthly rise of 0.4 per cent in the retail prices
index, bringing the annual rate, excluding mortgages, down to 2.6 per cent
from 2.8 per cent in January.
Media reports of a Gallup poll showing consumer confidence at a four-year
low also supported gilt prices since the findings kept hopes of a further
cut in interest rates alive.
The June long gilt future on Liffe traded at 109 in the late afternoon, up
17/32 on the day, off the day's high of 109 31/32 but well up on the worst
level of 109 5/32 .
Analysts expressed disappointment at the size of the Bank of England's first
floating-rate gilt for 15 years.
They had been confident that the novelty value of the issue would encourage
the Bank to set the amount at between Pounds 3bn to Pounds 3.5bn. However,
the Bank chose to raise only Pounds 2.5bn, indicating to the market that it
was comfortable with its funding programme.
The other terms of the issue were in line with market expectations - a
minimum price of 99.50, a coupon of three-month Libid less  1/8 point and a
five-year maturity.
German government bond prices see-sawed after news of the Fed's inaction.
The June bund future on Liffe stood just under a half-point higher at 96.45
in the late afternoon, below the day's high of 96.60 but off the low of
95.84.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea plans to ease rules on domestic company financing through
securities markets and allow securities houses to expand their operations,
Reuter reports from Seoul.
From April 1, manufacturing companies and small and medium-sized companies
will be able to issue unlimited amounts of corporate bonds, the finance
ministry said.
Manufacturing companies will also be free to raise capital via rights
issues, while securities firms will no longer need prior approval to
relocate branches, change names or invest in other brokers, the ministry
said.
At present, the finance ministry sets limits on total corporate issues for a
month. There are similar restrictions on rights issues.
In addition, the government will no longer require institutional investors
to buy more shares than they sell or make capital contributions to the stock
market stabilisation fund.
To encourage overseas portfolio investment, the ministry will adopt a
'negative system', in which securities companies will now be able to engage
in all foreign exchange dealings except for those prohibited by law.
Currently, the ministry has a 'positive system' which bans all offshore
portfolio investment unless otherwise permitted by the law.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Credit Agricole in venture
with Lazard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Agricole and the Lazard group have set up a joint company
specialising in structured finance.
Credit Agricole-Lazard Financial Products, based in London, will offer a
wide range of financial techniques to large international companies.
Unlike the financial products subsidiaries set up by CS First Boston and
Merrill Lynch, the unit is not designed as a vehicle for trading derivative
instruments.
An increasing proportion of corporate finance, including mergers and
acquisitions business, now involves structured transactions, often using
derivative instruments.
Mr Edouard Stern, a partner of Lazard Freres, cited Viacom's Dollars 9.5bn
agreed takeover of Paramount, which was helped by the offer of contingent
value rights, structured using derivatives, to Paramount shareholders.
Lazard was Paramount's adviser.
In the past, Lazard has used other houses for derivative transactions.
Credit Agricole, France's largest bank, is already a significant participant
in the debt and derivative markets, but has not been active in corporate
finance.
Under the partnership, Credit Agricole will provide the necessary capital
and trading muscle, while Lazard will provide the client list and corporate
finance expertise.
The amount of capital provided for the joint company was not disclosed, but
75 per cent is provided by the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole and 25
per cent by the Lazard houses of London, Paris and New York.
The board of directors is made up equally of representatives of the two
shareholders.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Turkey's foreign debt rating
lowered by S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered Turkey's foreign currency debt rating from
triple-B minus to double-B, taking the country's credit below investment
grade.
Turkey was also placed on CreditWatch suggesting that its rating may be
lowered further. S&amp;P cited delays in implementing an austerity plan to
tackle Turkey's economic crisis.
Earlier this week, the Treasury came close to defaulting on some Dollars
415m-worth of lira-denominated government bonds issued by the state-owned
Public Participation Administration.
Banks involved say the PPA settled the amount in full, but only after a
seven-hour delay. This was too late for many banks to transfer the funds
electronically, so they incurred the cost of overnight borrowing to cover
their positions.
Government finances are facing a growing liquidity shortage. However this is
the first time Turkey has appeared close to a default.
The crisis came after the Treasury refused to provide finance, forcing the
PPA into the interbank markets for an estimated Dollars 200m. This resulted
in a scramble for funds pushing up interbank rates, which yesterday touched
450 per cent.
The PPA has an estimated Dollars 1bn of outstanding revenue sharing bonds.
The two-year bonds are lira-based, dollar-indexed and redeemable at the
central bank fixing rate.
Bankers say it is moot point whether they are considered foreign or domestic
liabilities but the incident renewed bankers' concerns about Turkey's
ability to service its foreign debt, which was about Dollars 64bn at
end-1993.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Poland considers borrowing over Dollars
1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and ANTHONY ROBINSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland plans to borrow over Dollars 1bn on the international capital markets
following the successful conclusion of its London Club negotiations for a
reduction of up to 45 per cent in its Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt
earlier this month.
Mr Henryk Chmeliak, the acting finance minister, told an FT conference in
Warsaw that the Polish government was exploring the possibility of raising
Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn through foreign bonds now that the London Club
agreement has re-opened Poland's access to international markets on normal
commercial terms.
According to Mr Ian Hume, director of the World Bank's Warsaw office, Poland
needs higher foreign investment to fund the infrastructure investments
needed to underpin sustained rapid growth. But the bulk of Poland's current
Dollars 14bn to Dollars 16bn annual investment will continue to be financed
domestically, he said, with an increasing proportion coming from domestic
bank lending, re-invested profits and other non-bank finance.
At the same time, the relative importance of funding by international
financial institutions will decline, while foreign direct investment will
continue to rise sharply, he added.
Meanwhile, the Eurobond market's tense vigil for the US Federal Reserve's
Open Market Committee meeting kept issuers and investors sidelined. Although
the Fed's afternoon open-market operation indicated an unchanged policy
stance, traders still expect an imminent tightening and predicted that,
until it arrives, the primary market will remain deadly quiet.
What little demand there is remains focused on floating-rate notes, which
are less sensitive to interest rate uncertainty than fixed-rate bonds.
This encouraged the Southern Australian Government Finance Authority to
issue Dollars 500m of two-year FRNs paying three-month Libor flat, with a
par issue price.
While some traders said the pricing was on the tight side, an official with
lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said the deal met solid demand,
benefiting from the recent 'demise of the fixed-rate market' and the recent
build-up in cash by money market funds and bond investors looking for
short-dated investments.
By late afternoon,it was trading around 99.95, he said.
Germany's Landwirtschaftliche Rentenbank yesterday signed a Euro medium-term
note programme worth Dollars 2bn, arranged by Merrill Lynch, and plans to
issue an inaugural benchmark Eurobond within the next few weeks, it said.
The bank is a central refinancing institution for the German agriculture and
food industries, channelling loans through commercial banks. S&amp;P recently
assigned a triple-A rating to its long-term debt. It is a frequent borrower
in the German domestic market, where it has DM21.5bn of bonds outstanding.
Moody's has upgraded to A3 from Baa1 the long-term debt ratings of the
Birmingham Midshires Building Society, citing the company's improving
profitability and financial fundamentals. Some Pounds 200m of debt is
affected.
Moody's has also placed the credit ratings of the three UK mortgage-backed
securities under review for possible upgrade. They are: Collateralised
Mortgage Securities (No 4), rated Aa3; Platform Home Mortgage Securities No
1 plc, rated Aa1; and Stars 1 plc, rated Aa1. Around Pounds 780m in
long-term debt is affected.

Citicorp expects 'significantly' improved earnings in 1994 and 1995,
according to chairman Mr John Reed, Reuter reports from New York.
The top US bank earned a record Dollars 2.2bn in 1993. Mr Reed said the
improved earnings for the next two years would be driven by revenue growth,
especially in the developing world, cost-savings, and a continued
improvement in credit quality.
He said the 1994-1995 budget called for lower trading results.
Mr Reed also expects 'fairly significant' credit improvement during the two
years. Total expenses will stay relatively flat, he said.
Mr Reed stressed that Citicorp had a renewed emphasis on risk management and
controls. 'We have been humbled by our historic experience and we would just
as soon be on a more cautious and conservative stance going forward,' he
said.
He said Citicorp had no plans to participate in the ongoing consolidation of
the US banking industry. Instead of US acquisitions, Citicorp would focus
its investments on the faster-growing developing world.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hydro-Quebec advances 5.1%

<TEXT>
Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's biggest electric power utilities, posted net
profit of CDollars 761m (USDollars 567.9m) for 1993, up 5.1 per cent from
1992.
Favourable natural conditions, tighter cost control and lower interest rates
helped the advance. The utility derives nearly all its power production from
hydro-generating sites.
Total electricity sales were up 5.2 per cent, mainly due to higher
industrial demand and higher exports to the US. Total sales revenue rose 3.5
per cent to CDollars 7bn.
Operating expenses, fuel, depreciation, amortisation and taxes totalled
CDollars 3.76bn, up 3.6 per cent but operating expenses alone rose 1.7 per
cent.
Taxes plus debt guarantee fees totalled CDollars 650m, up from CDollars 594m
in 1992.
Financing activities reduced the weighted average interest rate on long-term
debt to 9.24 per cent from 9.79 per cent. Exchange losses were down 52 per
cent to CDollars 31m.
Total investment was CDollars 4bn, slightly lower than 1992. Most of the
money went to the new generating capacity in the James Bay area.
Hydro-Quebec said its financial ratios remained steady compared with 1992.
Its capitalisation ratio was 23.9 per cent, compared with 23.7 per cent in
1992. Being under the minimum 25 per cent threshold, no dividend will be
paid.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Worldwide accounting standard
moves closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International accounting standards-setters are to work with their US
counterparts to develop the reporting of earnings per share.
The US plans to move away from its current disclosure of primary earnings
per share towards the international emphasis on the disclosure of basic
earnings.
The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) said it expected to
issue an exposure draft standard later this year, which would lead to a
final standard in 1995. The US Financial Accounting Standards Board plans a
similar timetable.
The move represents a shift towards greater co-operation as
standards-setters attempt to harmonise financial reporting around the world.
It comes as the IASC is pressing for wholescale ratification of its
standards by Iosco, the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions, which could lead to companies using IASC standards gaining
quotations in stock exchanges.
A number of the national accounting standards-setting bodies, including
those in the UK, Canada, US and Australia, are beginning to develop projects
jointly.

<TEXT>
Marui, the big Japanese department store group, suffered sharp falls in
non-consolidated profit and sales for the year ended January as consumer
confidence continued to wane.
The retailer said parent pre-tax profits fell 14.9 per cent to Y29.8bn
(Dollars 280m), while sales declined 6 per cent to Y506.8bn.
Japan's department stores have been hit by competition from discount
retailers, with consumers opting for value at the expense of higher margin
items. Mr Tadao Aoi, Marui's president, said the retailer will try to
prevent further declines in sales.
A fall in interest income due to the fall in interest rates also hurt
profits, with after-tax profits down 12 per cent to Y16.5bn.
For the current year, Marui expects profits to decline further. It predicts
a 12.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y26bn on a 0.6 per cent rise in
sales to Y510bn.
Aoyama Trading, the Japanese retailer of discount men's suits, said it will
tie up with JC Penney, the leading US department store, to set up a men's
casual wear chain in Japan.
Aoyama plans to open the first store in the autumn and expects to expand the
chain to 50 to 70 stores during the year ending March, 1995.

Jardine Fleming yesterday cemented its position at the top of Hong Kong's
merchant banking league, posting a 166 per cent rise in 1993 net earnings to
USDollars 202m from Dollars 76m in 1992.
The company - a joint venture brokerage between Jardine Matheson and UK
merchant bank Robert Fleming - is strongest in investment management,
broking and corporate finance.
Commenting on his company's results, Mr Alan Smith, executive chairman,
said: 'What I think these results show is this is Asia and this is where you
should be.'
Mr Smith said that for the past decade Jardine Fleming had made an average
60 per cent annual return on shareholders' funds. In 1993, the return was 91
per cent on funds of Dollars 303m.
Last year funds under management more than doubled to Dollars 21.3bn on the
back of strongly rising share prices in most Asian markets.
Inflows were particularly strong in Hong Kong, where sales of unit trust
products reached Dollars 3.7bn. A flood of applications at the beginning of
this year forced the company to place a temporary halt on new subscriptions.
The company said that it achieved a higher share of agency broking business
last year and was active in introducing new products, particularly
derivatives and Euro-instruments. It claimed it held first position in the
trading of 'B' shares in Shanghai.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Star TV changes tack to attract
Asia's middle class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Star TV, News Corporation's Asian satellite television arm, is to change its
business strategy radically in an attempt to broaden its appeal to Asian
viewers.
Mr Gary Davey, chief executive, said Star would change from being a
broadcaster which attempted to lure the top 5 per cent of viewers in Asia to
one which attracted the region's growing middle class. Star currently has an
estimated 200m viewers in Asia.
To achieve this, Mr Davey said Star would change from a predominately
English-language broadcaster to one that offered viewers programmes in their
own language. He said the change reflected Star's new management taking 'a
fresh but realistic look at the market'.
Mr Davey, speaking at a media conference in Hong Kong, also foreshadowed the
introduction of pay-TV on Star. He said Star was about to launch pay-TV
channels, although he did not specify their number or type.
Until recently it had been thought that the formidable problems of fee
collection across the vast and varied terrain which Star covers would
prevent the early introduction of pay-TV.
Mr Davey underlined Star TV's appreciation of the special cultural and
political circumstances in which it was broadcasting.
Star would 'pay greater attention to local needs, tastes and sensitivities,'
he said.
'In this region we fully recognise our responsibilities to cater to local
needs. In a region with far greater political and cultural diversity than
Europe, any broadcaster must be conscious of these sen-sitivities and
operate accordingly.'
Earlier this week it was announced that the BBC would cease transmitting its
World Service Television news on Star TV's 'northern beam'. This covers
China, Mongolia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan.
Since his move to Hong Kong, Mr Rupert Murdoch, News Corp's chairman, has
sought to impress China's Communist rulers and other Asian political
leaders. He hopes that by sacking the BBC his cause may be served.

Mandarin Oriental Inter, the hotel group controlled by Jardine Matheson,
yesterday announced unchanged net earnings of USDollars 40.8m for 1993,
compared with Dollars 40.3m the previous year.
Improved contributions from the Hong Kong hotels were offset by weak
performances in most other markets, the company said.
The results fell short of expectations, and the group has been hit by a fall
in hotel visitors. For 1989, profits totalled HKDollars 392.8m (USDollars
50.8m).
Some 64 per cent of profits before interest and tax came from Hong Kong and
Macao last year, and Mr Robert Riley, managing director, earmarked the
colony as one of next year's better performers, due to shrinking supply as
hotels are pulled down and converted into office blocks.
Mr Riley said the average room rate at the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong
was lower than it was in 1989, during which time inflation in the colony had
risen more than 50 per cent. This year he sees rates outpacing inflation as
the sector attempts to catch up.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'The company's two hotels in Hong Kong
should benefit from stronger demand in 1994.
'While the immediate outlook is mixed in the group's other markets, the
groundwork has been laid for future growth and the prospects for Mandarin
Oriental remain encouraging.'
Earning per share were 6 US cents, against 5.94 cents. The group is
maintaining a 5 cents a share dividend.

<TEXT>
Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking boutique, announced yesterday
that Mr Fred Seegal had joined the firm as co-president. He had been joint
head of domestic corporate finance at Salomon Brothers.
Mr Seegal's appointment - the latest in a series of defections by top Wall
Street investment bankers working in the booming mergers and acquisitions
business - is Wasserstein Perella's first significant hiring since
co-founder Mr Joseph Perella left the firm last July.
After the departure of Mr Perella - who has since moved to Morgan Stanley -
the firm quickly lost another senior executive when its president, Mr
Charles Ward, went to First Boston. Mr Bruce Wasserstein, the current
chairman, and founder of the advisory boutique with Mr Perella and two other
First Boston executives in 1988, has been running the firm on his own since
then.
Mr Seegal, who worked at Lehman Brothers before joining Salomon in 1990, is
a specialist in advising companies in the media, telecommunications and
entertainment industries. However, it is likely he has been hired as much
for his management skills as for his experience in the advisory and
financing business. He will share the responsibility for managing
Wasserstein Perella with Mr Wasserstein. Mr Gary Parr, head of the financial
institutions business, is the firm's other co-president.
Mr Seegal arrives at a crucial juncture for Wasserstein Perella, which has
seen its position in the highly-competitive M&amp;A business slip badly.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Programmed for the Microsoft
challenge - Novell's expansion has pitted it directly against the market
leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The balance of power in the computer software industry has shifted
unexpectedly towards the state of Utah, home of Novell, the leading supplier
of software for personal computer networks.
Novell announced late on Monday that it planned to acquire WordPerfect, a
Utah neighbour, for Dollars 1.4bn in stock. At the same time, Novell has
purchased the rights to a popular spreadsheet program called Quattro Pro
from Borland International for Dollars 145m in cash.
Novell shares closed down in heavy trading yesterday, at Dollars 20 from
Dollars 23 3/4 on Monday.
The moves give Novell an instant stake in the market for application
programs, with WordPerfect's word processors and Borland's spreadsheet.
They also transform Novell into a software powerhouse with annual revenues
of close to Dollars 2bn, second only to Microsoft, the world's largest
software company with revenues last year of Dollars 3.75bn.
For the first time, Microsoft will face competition from a company with the
size and breadth of products to challenge its own market dominance.
Novell seems to relish the opportunity for a market battle. There is no love
lost between Novell and 'the boys from Seattle', as Mr Raymond Noorda,
Novell chief executive, calls Microsoft's youthful executives.
Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has charged that Novell 'has a vendetta
against us', and Mr Noorda has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive
business practices.
Microsoft is being investigated by the US Justice Department, and Novell has
played an active role in providing information to the anti-trust
investigators. Novell has also filed an anti-trust complaint against
Microsoft in Europe.
However, Mr Noorda carefully avoided any comment on Microsoft yesterday, and
analysts said his plans to expand Novell may shift attention away from
Microsoft's market dominance.
Until now, Novell has competed with Microsoft only in the area of operating
systems, the software that controls the basic functions of a computer or
network of computers.
Novell's Netware is the leading network operating system. Last year, Novell
also acquired Unix, a computer operating system widely used in 'open
systems' computing. Novell faces increasing competition, however, from
Microsoft's recently-introduced Windows NT, an operating system for
networked computer systems.
With its acquisition of WordPerfect and purchase of Borland's spreadsheet,
Novell will now go head to head with Microsoft in the booming market for
office software 'suites', or bundles of business software applications,
including word-processing, spreadsheets and database management.
Novell also plans to leverage its leadership in networking software to
create a class of applications products called 'groupware', aimed at teams
of workers.
Such software would include messaging, task management, document management
and workflow tools, Novell said. In this market segment, Novell will compete
with Microsoft and Lotus Development, the third-largest personal computer
software company.
'The era of stand-alone personal computing is evolving into group
collaboration that connects individuals, groups and companies,' said Mr
Noorda. 'Novell's objective is to accelerate this market transition.'
Yet Novell's expansionary moves also reflect tough times in the software
industry, as smaller companies find it increasingly difficult to compete
with 'mighty Microsoft', with its broad distribution and marketing clout,
and to keep pace with a price war.
WordPerfect and Borland have both lost market share over the past year,
according to market analysts. WordPerfect has recently laid off more than
1,000 employees, or 17 per cent of its workforce. Borland has faced cashflow
problems as it slashed prices in an attempt to gain market share. Borland
said on Monday it would restructure its operations, following the sale to
Novell of its leading product. Large staff cuts are expected.
Novell's extensive distribution network, with 25,000 resellers worldwide,
could breath new life into WordPerfect and Borland's spreadsheet business,
industry analysts say.
Novell faces the challenge, however, of integrating the new businesses into
its established operations. 'Mergers are difficult in any industry, but more
so in software because you have to combine different code bases, as well as
different cultures,' said Mr Pete Higgins, Microsoft vice-president.
However, Novell is not new to these challenges. Over the past 10 years the
company has acquired no fewer than 15 software companies, although none the
size of WordPerfect.
And Mr Noorda says long-standing friendships between executives of the two
companies, whose offices are just a few miles apart, will help to make the
combination 'a natural merger'.
A more pressing problem for Novell is who will replace Mr Noorda, who at 69
is about to retire. 'We are on track to find my successor by mid-June,' said
Mr Noorda, who has been talking to several industry executives outside the
company.
Thus, although Mr Noorda may have realised his dream of creating a new
'software powerhouse', the newly-expanded Novell faces significant
uncertainties. It also remains to be seen how Lotus Development will react
to Novell's expansion plans.
Four years ago, Lotus and Novell aborted a planned merger, after the two
companies failed to agree on who should head the merged businesses. Mr
Noorda says he recently rejected an attempt by Lotus to resurrect talks.
Novell's acquisitions do, however, confirm a broad trend in the software
industry toward consolidation. Last week, Aldus and Adobe Systems, two
leaders in desktop publishing software, also announced plans to merge.

State Farm, the US insurer with the biggest exposure to January's
Californian earthquake, is unlikely to adjust substantially its Dollars 600m
estimate of losses from the disaster.
The group said yesterday it did not expect to have to change the figure
much.
Other insurers have greatly increased their estimates of losses in recent
days, putting the total costs of the earthquake to the insurance industry at
as much as Dollars 4bn, roughly the same as the costs of Hurricane Hugo.
Allstate, the second-largest issuer of homeowners' insurance policies in the
state, raised its estimate of its losses from Dollars 350m to Dollars 600m
on Monday.
State Farm said it had already carried out detailed inspections on around 90
per cent of the claims it had received.
These had revealed damage which was broadly in line with what it had
estimated.

The board of R. H. Macy, the US department store chain which is in Chapter
11 protection, yesterday approved a reorganisation plan after apparently
resolving a last-minute rift which threatened the retailer's independence.
The company said the plan saw Macy's emergence from protection in January
1995, but gave no further details.
The proposals were submitted to Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US secretary of
state appointed by a federal bankruptcy court to lead the negotiating
process. Macy's creditors, which are owed Dollars 6bn, were due to review
them today. On Monday, Mr Vance granted the board a one-day extension to
submit a plan after it failed to settle its differences.
The board disagreement centred on the valuation the company would place on
itself. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of Loews and CBS, was leading one
faction in pushing for a Dollars 3.8bn valuation, which would result in a
greater return on claims by public bondholders and other junior creditors.
Macy's management was urging a Dollars 3.5bn valuation, which would benefit
senior creditors.

<TEXT>
Canada's federal government and the state of Quebec are trying to find ways
to re-open the Hyundai car assembly plant near Montreal.
The South Korean group's CDollars 400m (USDollars 294.1m) plant was closed
temporarily last summer because of poor sales of the Sonata car. It was to
be re-tooled for assembly, from mid-1995, of the 1996 Elantra for the North
American and European markets.
Hyundai, however, maintains it can only build the Elantra economically in
Korea.
A weak Canadian dollar has driven up the cost of parts purchased in US
dollars, and the North American Free Trade Agreement has raised duties on
all imported parts.
Hyundai said the Bromont plant would stay shut indefinitely. An Ontario
wheel plant, meanwhile, will be shut down completely and sold.
In Ottawa Mr Paul Martin, federal finance minister, said he had raised the
Bromont closure with the Korean government. 'We're actively seeking
alternative uses,' he said.
The Quebec government hinted it might be willing to help if Hyundai agreed
to re-open the plant.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq Computer of the US is to build a Dollars 15m assembly plant in
Brazil. It should become operational by September, Reuter reports from Sao
Paulo.
'Brazil will play a key role for our growth in Latin America,' said Mr
Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive officer.
He said the plant, which will be located on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, will
serve the Latin America and Caribbean region outside Mexico.
It will begin by producing desktop models and eventually assemble the full
line of Compaq products.
Mr Pfeiffer described the planned Brazilian plant as one of 'high volume
manufacturing capacity' that would eventually employ around 400 people.
He would not comment on production numbers, except to say that it would be
in the 'hundreds of thousands of units'.
A regional plant should represent substantial production and operational
cost-savings, which would be passed on to the consumer, he said.
He said the plant was the result of a policy of installing manufacturing
operations 'at the heart of our markets'.
Compaq has three manufacturing plants - in Texas, Singapore and Scotland -
and recently announced plans to open a fourth, in China.
Mr Pfeiffer said although the Brazilian plant was due to begin manufacturing
by September, the location had not been finalised. The company was looking
for an existing building.
He said computer peripherals would be provided by traditional suppliers, but
added that the company would look into the possibility of buying equipment
from Brazilian manufacturers.
Mr Manuel Parra, vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean, said
Compaq held around 12 per cent of the 400,000-unit Brazilian personal
computer market.

<TEXT>
Borland International, the US personal computer software company which is
selling its spreadsheet product Quattro Pro to Novell for Dollars 145m,
warned it would report significantly lower revenues and a 'substantial'
operating loss in the quarter ending March 31. It also announced the
resignation of its finance chief.
Borland said it would incur a charge in the next quarter, to cover the
corporate restructuring that followed the Quattro Pro sale and its poor
recent earnings performance.
It said it had not yet determined the extent of the charge.
The latest developments follow last week's appointment of Mr Keith Maib as
Borland's first chief operating officer. Mr Maib, a former partner at the
accountancy firm Price Waterhouse spent the weeks before his appointment
examining in detail Borland's business. He is now running the day-to-day
management of the company.
The arrival of Mr Maib followed a period of turmoil among the company's
senior management.
The resignation of Mr Alan Henricks, who stepped down as chief financial
officer 'to pursue other interests', was only the latest in a line of recent
departures by senior executives. Last Wednesday, the head of the company's
product division resigned.
The sale of Quattro Pro, the arrival of Mr Maib, and the planned
restructuring are all part of an attempt by Mr Philip Kahn, Borland's chief
executive, to ensure the company survives a price war in the increasingly
competitive software market.
Borland incurred a loss of Dollars 49m for its 1993 fiscal year, and in the
latest quarter reported only modest profits.

Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, has named a veteran of
Honeywell's European restructuring programme to head J. I. Case, Tenneco's
largest division.
Mr Jean-Pierre Rosso, 53, from Vichy, France, will succeed Mr Edward
Campbell as Case's president. Mr Campbell will retire on March 31.
Mr Rosso's appointment is seen as a sign that Case is about to proceed with
an extensive rationalisation of its European operations, where its
construction and agricultural equipment lines have been battered by
competition and shrinking markets.
Case has just completed the first year of a three-year, Dollars 920m
restructuring programme designed to rescue it from losses of Dollars 1bn in
1992. To date, the bulk of Case's rationalisations and plant closings have
been in North America.
Announcing the appointment, Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's president, said 'a
substantial amount of restructuring steps remain across all of Case's
worldwide operations'.

Linde, the German engineering concern, yesterday announced the acquisition
of a Hungarian facility producing industrial gases.
The German group is to take over the air separation and oxygen production
works in Dunaujvaros in central Hungary, previously operated by Dunaferr,
the state-owned steel producer.
Although the purchase price was not disclosed, Linde said the acquisition
and other developments planned for 1994 would take their total investment to
DM125m (Dollars 73.5m) for Hungary and DM400m for the central-east European
region as a whole.
Linde outbid Messer Griesheim, the subsidiary of German chemical group
Hoechst, to win the Dunaferr assets. The deal leaves the Hungarian
industrial gases market divided primarily between the two German groups.
Mr Gunnar Eggendorfer, Linde board member, said demand for industrial gases
was expected to grow faster than the economy as a whole. He said Linde hoped
to extend the use of the products made at the facility.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: BCH to cancel capital after
Pta26bn buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano (BCH) plans to cancel some 5 per cent of its share
capital after being forced to buy back its own stock from the markets to
support the price. BCH shares came under pressure after the collapse of
rival bank Banesto at the end of last year.
Officials at BCH, which owns the biggest branch network in Spain,
acknowledged yesterday the bank had spent some Pta26bn (Dollars 187m)
supporting its share price.
BCH equity owned by the bank has risen since December from 0.2 per cent of
the total number of shares on the market to close to the 5 per cent limit
set by the authorities.
The board will seek authorisation from the annual meeting next month to
write off the equity it now owns. The amortisation would reduce the number
of BCH shares to 551,619 from 578,959 and the bank estimates the
cancellation will raise income per share from to Pta296 from Pta281.
BCH shares, which traded at Pta3,380 at the beginning of this year, fell
earlier this month to Pta2,755 and have steadied to Pta2,850, representing a
15 per cent discount on the estimated book value.
Investor confidence in BCH waned in the second half of last year and fell
further following the troubles at Banesto. BCH's net interest income shrunk
by 4.8 per cent last year although its operating profit was up by 11.8 per
cent due, in part, to non-recurring foreign exchange and public debt
trading.
The bank's profile was further dented recently by credit rating agencies.
Moody's has placed BCH under review for a possible downgrade and IBCA, the
London-based agency, last week adjusted the bank's short-term commercial
paper from A1+ to A1 and its long-term debt from AA- to A+. Both agencies
cited flat core earnings at the bank, concern over asset quality and the
slow progress of cost reductions as reasons for the revision.
The bank's move was welcomed yesterday by market analysts. 'In the
circumstances it is a well thought-out move, and there could be further
cancellations of stock over the year,' said Mr Robert Maxwell of Madrid
brokers Maxwell and Espinosa.
BCH officials insist any link between Banesto's troubles and possible
difficulties at BCH is wholly out of place. Nevertheless, the buy-back and
write-off moves are part of several initiatives to restore investor
confidence.
BCH is streamlining its decision-taking process. Mr Jose Mara Amusategui,
chairman, is pruning his board to 28 members from 39 and his executive
committee to 14 from 19.
The bank plans to raise income by disposing of part of its industrial
assets, although it intends to keep control of the prime companies in its
portfolio. This week it will realise about Dollars 104m through the
placement of 13.5 per cent of Aumar, a toll-motorway operator, in which it
holds a 67 per cent stake.
In the second half of this year the bank will tap the markets for some
Pta70bn in three issues of subordinated debt. 'We are very capitalised in
tier one, core capital, so we can afford to cancel and what we want is a
better mix, with more subordinated debt,' said a senior BCH executive.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Profits advance 67% at Incentive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring, cost-cutting and a boost from the fall in value of the
Swedish krona pushed up results at Incentive, the Swedish industrial group
controlled by the Wallenberg family. Profits jumped by 67 per cent to
SKr620m (Dollars 78.57m) in 1993 from SKr371m in 1992, excluding associated
companies.
Group sales, however, were up just 4 per cent at SKr12.27bn from SKr11.77bn
due to the weakness of the company's European markets and divestments
related to Incentive's move to narrow its focus on engineering.
But a smaller rise in costs and a positive effect from the devaluation of
the krona worth SKr100m helped produce the sharp improvement in profits.
Profits after counting in contributions from associated companies rose to
SKr1.85bn from SKr1.27bn. The dividend is raised to SKr7 per share from SKr6
last year. The result underlined an improving trend in the Wallenberg empire
after several tough years.
Incentive said the prospects for 1994 were 'relatively favourable,' with
higher volumes, improved margins and lower costs set to improve earnings.
Earlier this month, Investor, the senior of the Wallenberg companies, said
it expected rising profits in 1994, following a sharp turnround in the last
quarter of 1993.
Incentive said a recently-announced decision to sell the glass-making
company Orrefors to Incentive's shareholders would complete a programme of
restructuring carried out since Incentive was listed in 1991 after emerging
from under the wing of Asea, the Swedish half-owner of Asea Brown Boveri,
the Swiss-Swedish engineering group.
Charges of around SKr100m were made against 1993 earnings against costs of
breaking up the Hagglunds subsidiary, parts of which were sold off.
Last year, Incentive also spent around SKr500m last year acquiring
MacGregor-Navire, the shipboard cargo handler, from the Finnish group Kone.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Loan losses hit Gota Bank
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gota Bank, merged by the government at the turn of the year with fellow
state-owned Nordbanken, yesterday reported an operating loss in 1993 of
SKr13.57bn (Dollars 1.71bn) reflecting the damage wreaked by loan losses on
Sweden's banks. This was more than five times its 1992 loss of SKr2.4bn.
The loss came despite the transfer during the year of SKr38.3bn out of
Gota's total loan portfolio of SKr78.4bn into a separately-run, so-called
bad bank called Retriva. The transferred loans included SKr23.4bn out of
Gota's SKr27.2bn problem loan book.
Despite this, credit losses - mostly from the property sector - stood at
SKr11.98bn in 1993, including the write-down of assets transferred to
Retriva. The figure was only slightly below the 1992 loan loss figure of
SKr12.5bn.
Net interest income also slumped by 53 per cent to SKr1.7bn, partly because
credit losses before the Retriva clean-up had to be loan-financed, pushing
up interest costs.
However, the Retriva operation meant problem loans after provisions for
losses at the year-end stood at SKr1.1bn, compared with SKr12.4bn in 1992,
out of a total outstanding loan portfolio of SKr40bn.
Apart from setting up Retriva, the state kept Gota afloat by pumping in
SKr20bn in capital. It then decided to hand over Gota to Nordbanken, which
itself was only kept afloat by huge injections of state assistance and a
similar 'bad bank' operation to deal with non-performing loans.
Nordbanken, which will report its results for 1993 later this week, has
since bounced bank into profit.
But it has already had to spend SKr3bn on a further capital infusion to keep
Gota's capital adequacy ratio above the internationally-required level of 8
per cent.

<TEXT>
Christiani &amp; Nielsen, the international contractor and property developer,
has paid DM40m (Dollars 22.7m) to acquire a 71.73 per cent stake in a DM1bn
property development close to Berlin.
Nobleclear, the development company, was previously owned by UK property
developers Mr Ronald Lyon and Mr Godfrey Bradman and East German Investment
Trust.
After the purchase East German Investment Trust will retain 18 per cent and
Mr Lyon 10.27 per cent of Nobleclear. Mr Bradman has sold his stake.
Nobleclear plans to develop the 309 acre site at a cost of DM800m over the
next four to five years.
It will provide a mix of residential, light industrial and commercial
buildings in one of the largest out-of-town developments in the region.
Christiani, the former Danish construction group, was acquired by its Thai
subsidiary for Dollars 80m at the end of 1992.
It is the second time this year that Mr Bradman, former chairman of
collapsed UK developer Rosehaugh, has decided to give up a property
development opportunity.
His plan to lead a consortium to develop a Pounds 300m (Dollars 438m) retail
and residential development at White City in west London collapsed after
British Rail and the BICC engineering group accepted an alternative offer
for the land.

<TEXT>
Renault Vehicules Industriels, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of the
French state-owned automotive group suffered a net loss of FFr1.4bn (Dollars
230m) last year compared with FFr1.62bn in 1992.
The group said it hoped to halve the loss in 1994, however, and claimed that
it could survive without an injection of new equity capital.
When Renault's planned merger with Volvo of Sweden collapsed late last year,
it was claimed that RVI would require additional capital without the support
of Volvo's stronger truck operations.
Mr Shemaya Levy, new RVI president, said that following the failure of the
merger the group's international strategy was now focused on achieving
synergies with Mack Trucks, its US subsidiary, which was expected to return
to profit in 1994 after several years of losses.
Renault was not discussing an alliance with Fiat of Italy, 'certainly not at
the level of truck-making,' he said.
RVI's consolidated turnover was virtually unchanged last year at FFr25.1bn.
The group's financial fortunes differed sharply in Europe and in North
America.
Demand for new trucks fell sharply in west Europe last year, and RVI's
turnover in Europe declined by 13 per cent, while its operating loss in the
area rose to FFr699m from FFr429m a year earlier.
'We hit the bottom of the cycle in the summer of 1993, and we are now in a
phase of slow, progressive recovery,' said Mr Levy. The European operation
was now steadily reducing its losses.
In contrast to Europe, demand for heavy trucks in the US had risen strongly.
Mack turnover increased by 24 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, and halved its
operating loss to Dollars 72m from a loss of Dollars 152m in 1992.
Mack had broken even last month, said Mr Levy, and it would achieve a profit
in the whole of 1994.
Mr Levy dismissed the suggestion that Renault trucks was the weaker part of
the French group and had had most to gain from the merger with Volvo and
most to lose from the failure of the deal.
'We have done no worse than our European competitors,' he said. 'It is true
we have not benefited like Fiat or Volvo from currency changes. But chiefly
by reducing stocks we have been able to bring down our debt from FFr3.7bn at
the end of 1992 to FFr3.1bn by the end of1993, and with a lower break-even
point, we are well placed for the recovery.'
There was no need for the capital increase that Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, his
predecessor, had talked of in the context of the merger with Volvo. 'We have
no handicap linked to our size,' he said.
He accepted, however, that RVI needed to work hard at increasing the average
3 per cent market share it has in Europe, outside France and Spain.
It had maintained its investment in research and development and had
retained the intellectual property rights to its share of the work done with
Volvo in developing a new medium-weight truck cab.
RVI would now focus on developing new engines, and possibly suspension and
brake systems, with Mack, however.
It would also seek to develop a common purchasing strategy with Mack to
exploit the fact that some components suppliers, such as Bosch and Michelin,
had operations on both sides of the Atlantic.
'This does not exclude continued co-operation with Volvo, or others, in such
areas as gearboxes, axles and transmissions,' said Mr Levy.

Vontobel, the Zurich-based private banking group, said its consolidated net
income soared 64 per cent last year to SFr40.1m (Dollars 27.6m).
The directors are recommending a 48 per cent rise in dividends to SFr20 per
bearer share and SFr4 per registered share.
The group has revealed for the first time the size of its assets under
management, SFr21.5bn, of which half are managed on a discretionary basis
and half are from private clients.
The Vontobel family, which has no heirs, has given some SFr6.8m worth of the
company's bearer shares to its 500 employees.
The main contributor to profits growth was the doubling of trading income to
SFr61.6m.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Italian car parts group drops to
L18bn for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sogefi, Italy's listed car components company controlled by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti's CIR holding company, yesterday reported net group profits of
L18.1bn (Dollars 10.7m) for 1993, down from L33.3bn the previous year,
writes John Simkins.
The 1992 earnings, however, were boosted by a L19bn extraordinary gain
through the sale of Sogefi's stake in the German Boge group to Mannesmann.
In 1993 the group made an extraordinary gain of L12.3bn through the sale of
the SVAMA distribution subsidiary. Group net borrowings fell from L116.4bn
to L38.5bn.
The company said a strong presence in the second-hand car market and the
fact that its activities were centred both on Europe and the US enabled
sales to reach L660.4bn in 1993, against L664.5bn, despite recession in the
car industry.

SKr3.95bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Telia, Sweden's state-owned telecommunications company, yesterday reported
profits after financial items more than doubled in 1993 to SKr3.95bn
(Dollars 500m) from SKr1.8bn in 1992.
Sales were up marginally to SKr35.34bn from SKr35.29bn.
The increase in profits was put down chiefly to a fall in investments, which
were down by 7 per cent to SKr7.17bn, lower debt costs and a drop in
restructuring costs.
The company said the number of subscribers fell slightly for the first time,
due to the recession in Sweden.
However, telephone traffic rose by almost 5 per cent, due chiefly to
fast-growing mobile telephone usage.
Telia became a commercially-structured, independently-run company in the
middle of last year, having previously been a directly state-run concern
called Televerket.
It faces competition in international telephone traffic, mobile telephone
networks and the supply of telecoms equipment.
The present centre-right coalition government intends to begin privatisation
as early as next year or 1996 if it wins September's general election.
However, the opposition Social Democrats, currently leading in the opinion
polls, are against any sell-off.

Olivetti, the Italian computers group, said yesterday it had set up a joint
venture with Redgate Communications of the US to exploit Europe's growing
market in multi-media services, which is expected to be worth Dollars 10bn
in 1996.
Outside Italy, the venture marks Olivetti's entry into the European market
for electronic catalogues.
Olivetti is to hold a 51 per cent stake and Redgate, a specialist
multi-media editor based in Vero Beach, Florida, will have 49 per cent.
Redgate is a venture capital based company whose investors include AT&amp;T
Ventures and Olivetti.
The first project planned for the joint venture is InStoreNet in France. The
service will give customers access on specialist retailing networks to
catalogues offering graphical, audio and video information on hardware and
software products.
Olivetti's participation, which will be managed by its recently formed
telecommunications and multi-media division, reinforces the company's shift
away from hardware to more profitable service-based activities.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Visa forms global 'electronic
purse' consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Visa International, the international payments group, and a number of
bank-led groups from around the world have agreed to work together on common
standards for so-called 'electronic purse' cards - payment cards which could
replace small-value cash transactions.
The consortium includes groups based in Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain,
Taiwan and the US, all of which have been working independently on cards
which incorporate electronic chips.
The aim is to agree a common specification for the cards, so that different
cards could all be 'swiped' through a single terminal at a retailer's desk,
Visa said.
Unlike credit or debit cards, electronic purse cards would act like cash.
The value stored on a card would be reduced with each purchase, and they
could be recharged by debiting a user's account. Issuers of cards hope they
will replace most small cash purchases.
The Visa-led consortium does not include groups in Australia and Singapore
that are developing their own smart payment cards, or a UK-based venture
announced recently between National Westminster and Midland called Mondex.
Visa said it hoped these groups would join in, along with MasterCard, the
rival international payments group.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hoechst stable in first two
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst, the German chemicals concern, yesterday reported an 'insignificant'
rise in group operating profits in the first two months of the current year,
and no change in domestic earnings or sales.
Growth of 5 per cent in turnover at the parent, Hoechst AG, was entirely due
to a 9 per cent increase in exports, according to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, the
retiring chairman.
Hoechst, the last of Germany's big three chemicals makers to report on
progress, was markedly less optimistic than Bayer, which last week
confidently predicted an earnings increase this year of up to 20 per cent.
BASF said it expected to raise profits in spite of facing a sharply higher
tax bill.
Mr Hilger restricted his forecasts to the view that the low point of the
recession had been passed and the long-awaited light on the horizon was
visible. Group orders had increased for the first time in two years,
although domestic demand was unchanged.
Mr Jurgen Dormann, finance director, who takes over from Mr Hilger next
month, was gloomy on prospects in Germany. He doubted if domestic profits
would be enough to pay a dividend. Part of this year's pay-out would have to
come from foreign earnings and an expected DM200m (Dollars 118m) residual
tax rebate.
The group, which announced a DM7 dividend for 1993, down DM2 following a 42
per cent drop in pre-tax earnings on unchanged sales of DM46bn, blamed most
of last year's downturn on poor conditions in Europe.
Operating profits in the European Union tumbled to DM289m from DM1bn in
1992. The region, accounting for 60 per cent of output, generated only 20
per cent of operating income.
Other regions, apart from Latin America, showed modest increases, while
operating profits fell in all business sectors apart from technical and
agricultural products.
Chemicals, fibres and plastics suffered from falling volumes and prices,
while business was hit by the miserable condition of the European textile
and automotive industries, Mr Hilger said. Better results were achieved from
raw materials for detergents. Carbon products had shown a real turnround,
and the plant protection business outside Europe had improved.
Mr Hilger, who said the company spent or set aside DM1bn last year for
restructuring - two-thirds within Germany - indicated that process would
continue. He gave few details, apart from warning of more job losses to
come. A reduction of 12,000 in the workforce in the past three years was to
be followed by a further 8,000 this year and next.
Total annual personnel costs would be cut by about DM1.5bn.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Czechs repurchase CSA stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech authorities yesterday ended months of negotiations by announcing
that they had agreed terms for a deal to buy back Air France's minority
stake in CSA, the Czech airline, for Dollars 27m.
Air France, which two years ago paid Dollars 30m for its 19.1 per cent
holding, had initially resisted the Czech government's attempts to force it
to sell the shares.
However, the Czechs persisted, anxious to exert greater control over the
management of the airline, which fell into the red last year and is on
course for further losses this year.
Air France will sell its entire CSA stake to Konsolidacni Banka, the
state-controlled Czech banking group.
The negotiations were complicated by the role of the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which acquired an identical 19.1 per
cent holding in CSA at the same time as Air France.
EBRD has already written off 30 per cent of this investment, but the
remainder was guaranteed by the French group.
The bank has maintained throughout the negotiations that, although it hoped
to retain its CSA stake, it would only do so if the Czech authorities took
over the guarantee.
The Czechs have reached a compromise whereby Konsolidacni Banka will have a
put option over the EBRD stake which is not exercisable until August 1997.
The EBRD board will meet tomorrow to endorse the agreement and the bank is
then expected to sign a formal accord in Prague.
Air France said it could not comment on the sale until it was finalised.
However, the Czech transport ministry yesterday said that the five Air
France representatives on the CSA board had resigned on Monday. The Czechs
now intend to wait for a year before bringing a new international investor
into CSA.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Thomson consumer arm returns to
black
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the French company that is one of the
world's largest television manufacturers, last year came back into the black
at the operating level after three years of losses, with an operating profit
of FFr155m (Dollars 26.3m) against a FFr335m deficit in 1992.
However, the company, a subsidiary of Thomson, the state-controlled
electronics group, remained in the red overall due to restructuring costs
and heavy debt. It made a net loss of FFr973m during 1993 compared with a
heavier deficit of FFr1.77bn in the previous year.
Mr Alain Prestat, chairman, described the return to operating profits as
proof that the negative trend at TCE had become positive. He said it would
take another 18 months for the group to become profitable at the net level.
'This time last year people said we were in a make-or-break situation,' he
added. 'These results show that we've made it.'
TCE, which owns a string of consumer electronics brands in Europe and North
America including RCA, Telefunken and Ferguson, has been restructured since
the arrival of Mr Prestat, 41, as chairman from his former role as a civil
servant.
Mr Prestat has cut costs and restructured TCE's operations. The number of
employees was reduced by 10 per cent to about 49,000 last year. He has
redesigned the group's products and has hired Mr Philippe Starck, the French
designer, as artistic director.
The group increased sales by 10 per cent to FFr33.48bn in 1993 from
FFr30.55bn in 1992. Mr Prestat hoped to increase sales by another 10 per
cent this year.
TCE is still struggling with heavy borrowings valued at FFr10.3bn at the end
of 1993, against FFr10.7bn a year previously. 'Of course I'd like to see a
lower level of debt, but that's a matter for our shareholder (the French
government),' said Mr Prestat.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: ZF joins forces with German
carmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's biggest vehicle makers and a leading parts supplier are planning
to join forces in an ambitious co-operative venture which could mark a
breakthrough in the automotive industry's drive to cut costs.
The scheme provides for ZF, a transmissions and steering specialist, to pool
its resources with Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz in an operation which will
supply both vehicle makers with jointly-developed steering gear.
According to ZF, which unveiled the plan yesterday, the project would reduce
steering equipment costs. It would also be open to other automotive groups,
the company said. ZF has been nominated as the project's industrial leader,
and its division based at a newly-opened factory in Schwabisch Gmund has
been designated as the manufacturing base.
If the venture is approved by the companies' boards and the cartel
authorities, it could lead to Mercedes and Volkswagen buying in most or all
of their steering gear rather than making it themselves as at present.
All German vehicle makers are keenly examining all possibilities for
reducing costs by increased out-sourcing, and greater use of common
components, especially those parts under a vehicle's bodywork which do not
directly affect a prospective buyer's judgment.
At the same time, the domestic components industry is under heavy pressure
from customers to cut costs, which has led to a wave of losses and intensive
merger and co-operation talks.
ZF, which last year made an undefined operating loss after tumbling German
sales cut its global sales by DM400m to DM5.4bn (Dollars 3.2bn), was
recently refused permission by the cartel authorities to take over General
Motors' subsidiary, Allison Transmissions.
Shortly after the refusal it announced plans to open a new factory in
Alabama to supply front and rear axles for a new Mercedes factory in the
state which is due to start production of cross-country vehicles in
mid-1997.
Daimler-Benz is to pay DM424m to buy out the Bavarian government's 8.58 per
cent holding in its aircraft and defence systems subsidiary, Deutsche
Aerospace.
The price, announced yesterday, was 'extraordinarily satisfying', said Mr
Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian prime minister, who recently suggested he was
looking for DM300m to DM350m.
The deal marks a further stage in the state's privatisation programme,
announced last year, and started earlier this month with the takeover of the
Bayernwerk energy utility by Viag for a cash consideration of DM2.3bn plus a
blocking minority stake in the enlarged Viag group.
The next move will be the disposal of a holding in the Rhine-Main-Danube
canal management company, which will complete Bavaria's assets sale.
Mr Stoiber stressed that privatisation of state and local government-owned
savings banks was out of the question. Publicly-owned banks were important
to help the financing of local small and medium-sized industries which often
entailed higher risks than those acceptable to private sector financial
institutions, he said.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: France allocates 10% of UAP to
core shareholders
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government plans within the next few days to launch a tender
offer for noyaux durs, or hard core shareholders, to invest in Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group that is due to be privatised
later this year.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, yesterday said that 10 per cent of
UAP, which is France's biggest insurer, was to be allocated to long-term
investors.
The announcement of the tender offer will mark the first step towards the
sale of the government's 50 per cent stake in UAP.
The holding is valued at between FFr25bn and FFr28bn (Dollars 4.2bn-Dollars
4.7bn).
The appointment of noyaux durs, or long-term investors that are intended to
forge strategic links with a company and to protect it against hostile
takeover bids, is a standard part of the French privatisation process.
UAP is the largest noyau dur in France, as the country's leading
institutional investor with a warren of shareholdings across the corporate
sector. Some of these companies are now expected to volunteer to become
noyaux durs in UAP.
However, Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the recently privatised French
bank that has been UAP's main financial partner, will reduce its stake to 15
per cent from 19 per cent following the privatisation.
Suez, the French holding company, and Winterthur, the Swiss insurer with
which UAP has a cross-shareholding, will retain their existing investments.
Mr Alphandery yesterday confirmed that UAP would be allowed to raise capital
as part of the privatisation. Mr Jacques Friedmann, UAP's chairman, has made
no secret of his hopes of staging a capital increase to finance the group's
international expansion. However, the size of the increase has not been
decided.
The economy minister described UAP as 'a business in sound financial shape'.
UAP on Monday announced an increase in net profits of 31.8 per cent to
FFr1.42bn in 1993 from FFr1.08bn in 1992. The group, which reported peak
profits of FFr4.2bn in 1990, hopes to continue its recovery.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air France sells duty-free chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air France, the state-controlled airline, has sold Saresco, its chain of
duty-free shops, to Vaturi-Pernod Ricard-Elig, a retail consortium that
includes Pernod Ricard, the leading French drinks group.
Saresco, which owns a number of restaurants as well as duty-free shops at
Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris and at Nice airport, is controlled by
Servair, the catering subsidiary of Air France.
Servair owns 60 per cent of the shares and Aeroports de Paris, the airport
operator, has the remaining 40 per cent.
The terms of Saresco's sale have been agreed in principle and the deal is
expected shortly to be concluded. However, the value of the transaction has
not been disclosed.
Saresco last year made sales of FFr1.33bn (Dollars 459m), an increase over
its FFr1.01bn turnover in the previous year. However, its net profits were
depressed by increased investment costs - due to the refurbishment of a
number of units - and slipped to FFr27.5m in 1993 from FFr34.4m in 1992.
The acquisition of Saresco forms part of the expansion of Vaturi-Pernod
Ricard-Elig.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Robert Wiseman Dairies valued at Pounds 64m
in float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor and distributor,
priced its flotation yesterday at 100p a share, valuing the group as a whole
at Pounds 63.7m.
A total of Pounds 16.1m has been raised through an institutional placing,
completed yesterday.
The placing gives Pounds 14.5m net new money to the group, with the sale of
15m shares, and a further 1.08m shares have been placed on behalf of family
members. The family is also taking Pounds 3.5m in a special dividend before
the current year end on April 2. The float will leave the Wiseman family
with nearly 74.8 per cent of the group, and, barring large acquisitions for
shares, the family expects to retain control for some years to come.
The group is forecasting pre-tax profits for the current year of not less
than Pounds 5.09m (Pounds 3.19m), including a Pounds 327,000 exceptional
profit on the sale of an investment. Excluding that profit, earnings per
share are forecast at 6.61p (6.14p), giving a p/e at the issue price of
15.1. The notional net dividend for the year to April 2 is 2.5p giving a
yield of 3.12 per cent, covered 2.6 times.
The group, which has just acquired Mackies dairy in Aberdeen, has 21 per
cent of the Scottish milk market, but only 2 per cent of the UK market. It
specialises in supplying multiple retailers, which now take 65 per cent by
volume of the group's milk.
Mr Alan Wiseman, executive chairman, said that by being a low cost producer,
the group could make good margins from selling to supermarkets in spite of
low prices.
Wiseman has expanded into England with the purchase of a dairy in Manchester
in 1991 and now plans a sizeable investment programme there. With the
Manchester project and other investments the group plans to spend Pounds 14m
over the next two years before any acquisitions, using the cash raised in
the float.
Dealings in the shares start on March 28. The placing was arranged by
Panmure Gordon.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bourne End reduces deficit to Pounds 55,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourne End Properties, the property investment company, achieved a small
profit in the second half of 1993, resulting in a reduced pre-tax loss of
Pounds 55,000 for the year, against a deficit of Pounds 1.17m in 1992.
The company successfully pushed through a 3-for-1 rights issue late last
year, which has transformed the company and given rise to a more aggressive
investment policy.
At the December 31 year end, borrowings had increased almost threefold to
Pounds 105m, but net asset value per share rose 12p to 85p and gearing was
more than halved from 580 per cent to 230 per cent.
During 1993, net rental income increased from Pounds 3.47m to Pounds 3.81m,
while net interest payable fell from Pounds 4.22m to Pounds 3.34m.
Mr Leo Noe, chief executive, said that rental income was currently 1.3 times
interest payable, despite a further Pounds 21m of acquisitions announced in
February. The company is comfortable with current debt levels.
'If the market continues to improve, we would be doing our shareholders a
disservice if we reduced our gearing by much,' he added.
Bourne End has renegotiated its debt, and more than half is now fixed for
between 15 and 20 years, at interest rates of below 10 per cent.
The company's property portfolio was valued at Pounds 147m in December,
representing upward valuations totalling Pounds 11.9m, of which Pounds 5.5m
was on proper-ties owned before 1993. Bourne End's net worth increased from
Pounds 39m to Pounds 45m.
Losses per share were reduced to 0.4p (8.2p) and a final dividend of 0.25p
is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 1p.

<TEXT>
Shares of Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer which
floated in February last year, fell 14p to 314p yesterday following an
adverse trading statement at the annual meeting.
Shareholders were told that the exceptionally wet winter weather had
resulted in a customer fall-off which had affected retail sales during the
opening half year.
However, this was partially offset by increased spending per head and, in
the light of an increase in the number of branches from 180 to 209, the
board said it was 'quietly confident' in the outcome for the current year.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Secure Trust edges ahead to Pounds 7.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Secure Trust, the financial services group, yesterday reported a 4 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.32m to Pounds 7.61m for 1993.
Net interest income rose to Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 3.42m), helped by the
group's acquisition of Peoples Bank during the year, which is estimated to
have contributed some Pounds 500,000 in interest income. Fees and commission
income rose to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 13.9m).
The group's main activities comprise its household cash management service,
its banking service, and motor and general insurance business.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debt fell sharply from Pounds 382,000 to
Pounds 296,000.
The board proposes a final dividend of 10.5p per share, which gives a total
of 15p (13.5p) for the year, an increase of 11 per cent. Earnings per share
rose to 35.8p (34.3p).
Mr Henry Angest, chairman and chief executive, described the profit growth
as steady rather than spectacular. He envisaged future growth coming from
the group's banking activities, through developing facilities such as the
cheque book and cash card currently available to Peoples Bank customers.
The group is also looking to expand its geographical spread beyond the
Midlands and Bradford where it is based at present.
Mr Angest acknowledged that administrative expenses, at Pounds 10.16m
(Pounds 9.21m) against an operating income of Pounds 18.54m (Pounds 17.31m),
were high, but attributed this partly to the cost of meeting regulatory
requirements.
In December the group launched a telephone-based motor and household
insurance service - SecureDirect - in response to inroads in its business
from other telephone insurance services.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lilliput grows 53% to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lilliput Group, the maker of hand-painted miniature china cottages that was
floated in November, boosted profits by 53 per cent and sales by 21 per cent
for 1993.
The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 3.08m on turnover up
from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 16.5m.
A dividend of 0.6p is proposed, in line with the prospectus forecast and
equivalent to 4.35p if the shares had been trading for a full year. Earnings
per share were 9.5p (6.7p).
Sales in the UK, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of turnover, were
up by 25 per cent. The US, the second biggest market with 27 per cent of
sales, improved by 10 per cent. In order to cope with demand, the group
created 100 new jobs in the year.
Membership of the collectors' club - a vehicle to stimulate demand for the
models - rose from 58,000 to 68,500.
Mr John Russell, chairman and chief executive, said membership had risen to
71,500 in the first two months of this year 'and the momentum is still
growing.'
Net interest receivable was Pounds 24,000, compared with payable interest of
Pounds 121,000 last time.
The Cumbria-based group ended 1993 with Pounds 4m cash. Mr Russell said it
was looking for an acquisition where it could use its skills in marketing
collectable products.
Mr Roger Fitness, chief executive, who led the group's move into the US
market, has resigned for personal reasons. He will remain as a consultant
for a minimum of three months. Mr Russell is assuming the role until a new
chief executive is appointed.

FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Acquisitions help lift Avonmore
to IPounds 29.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avonmore Foods, the expanding Irish dairy and meat processor, lifted
turnover last year by 35 per cent to more than Pounds 1bn, while pre-tax
profits rose by 17 per cent from IPounds 25m to IPounds 29.2m.
Turnover totalled IPounds 1.13bn (Pounds 1.09bn) against IPounds 831m.
Mr Brendan Graham, group secretary, described passing the Pounds 1bn
turnover mark 'as an important and significant milestone in the growth of
Avonmore as an international food group.'
More than 73 per cent of turnover was generated overseas, against 66 per
cent in 1992.
The company attributed the rise to organic growth and acquisitions, of which
the most important was the purchase last July for Pounds 21.6m of the
Birmingham area operations of Dairy Crest. This gave the group almost 8 per
cent of the UK's liquid milk market.
Total sales for the dairy group were up 35 per cent to IPounds 572m (IPounds
422m), helped by strong UK milk and US cheese sales. Operating profits on
the dairy side increased from IPounds 18.5m to IPounds 24.2m, giving margins
of 4.2 per cent.
Operating margins in the meat division improved in the second half from 1.8
per cent to 2.8 per cent - still below the 1992 levels.
Turnover for meat was 50 per cent ahead at IPounds 454m, reflecting the
integration of the acquisitions.
Earnings per share were 18.5 per cent ahead at 14.35p (12.11p). A final
dividend of 2p is proposed (1.85p), bringing the total for the year to 3.55p
(3.3p). Mr Graham said the group expected to make further advances this year
as it continued to consolidate its acquisitions.
COMMENT
The tough conditions in its markets make this a satisfactory performance for
Avonmore, which has grown rapidly through acquisition. It could be argued
that although margins are tight, the company is still making returns and has
plenty of room for improvement. The management runs a tight ship, but the
company could be said to be driving towards the big league too hard and too
fast. While the core dairy business looks good, the company has to negotiate
the changes looming in the UK milk market. It is not so familiar with the
meat sector, which appears to be giving some problems. Analysts are
expecting earnings to increase by about 9 per cent this year as the tax
charge rises, putting the company on a prospective multiple of around 10.5 -
fair value in the sector.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fags held back by lower copper prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply lower international copper prices held down the 1993 profits of
Antofagasta Holdings, which has mining, banking, rail and water distribution
interests in Chile. The group's pre-tax profits slipped from Pounds 23.5m to
Pounds 23.1m.
Earnings per share increased by 22.5 per cent to 73.5p, however, after a
strong performance by associate companies, reflecting growth in the Chilean
economy.
Antofagasta is lifting the total dividend by 1p to 21p with a final payment
of 15p (14p).
Pre-tax profits of the group's mining operations fell from Pounds 6.65m to
Pounds 1.51m. The directors pointed out that during last year the average
global copper price fell by 16 per cent from Dollars 1.03 per lb to 87
cents.
In December the group's Michilla mining operations were merged with those of
Lince, and ore from both mines is now processed through a
solvent-extraction-electro-winning plant at Lince. This process was not
previously available to Michilla.
A Pounds 7.28m provision has been made for the write-down of mining assets
associated with the previous process.
Pre-tax profits from the railway operations increased from Pounds 3.37m to
Pounds 4.1m and income from associated undertakings was up from Pounds 12.3m
to Pounds 15m.
There was an Pounds 8.25m profit on disposal of part of Banco O'Higgins,
merged last year with the Chilean subsidiary of Banco Central
Hispanoamericano of Spain (CentroHispano Bank).
Group turnover was up from Pounds 72.1m to Pounds 86.7m. Administration
expenses jumped from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 18.6m, mainly because of the
inclusion of an extra Pounds 4m costs at the Lince mine which became
operational from only the second half of 1992.
Another Pounds 1m in extra costs was incurred from the closure of Michilla.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Iceland ahead 18% to Pounds 65.2m - Buoyant
result masks a growing focus on price in the marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iceland, the frozen and chilled foods retailer, yesterday warned it was
beginning to feel the pressures of an increasingly price sensitive
environment, in spite of an 18 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits
to Pounds 65.2m.
Mr Malcolm Walker, the chairman and chief executive, said there was a
growing focus on price in the marketplace. While Iceland was insulated from
the worst effects of price cutting, by carrying a smaller proportion of the
most vulnerable items such as bread and milk, 'we are not immune from the
problem,' he said.
Like-for-like sales in existing stores in the first few weeks of the year
were running about 2 per cent lower, partly because of the effects of lower
prices. This followed a sharp slowdown in comparable sales growth last year,
from 7 per cent in the first half to 3 per cent in the second.
However, Mr Walker said he was confident the group would advance this year.
Gross margins had stabilised, and the Iceland outlets at Littlewoods were
expected to contribute profits in 1995.
Sales for the group as a whole were 14 per cent higher at Pounds 1.18bn for
the 52 weeks to January 1. The period compared with 53 weeks in 1993.
New Iceland stores contributed 8 points of the increase, with the
Littlewoods outlets a further 4 points. Like-for-like sales were 5 per cent
ahead, with nil inflation.
The group opened a record 103 new stores, including 43 Littlewoods food
halls. Mr Walker said Iceland planned to open a minimum of 50 stores this
year.
Higher capital expenditure of Pounds 110m, against Pounds 64m last time,
helped to push up debt from Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m. Debt as a proportion
of shareholders' funds fell from 40 per cent to 32 per cent.
Iceland's foray into France, which has cost Pounds 4m so far, was
disappointing. Mr Walker said Iceland would not invest any further and would
decide by the end of the year whether to remain in France.
An improved final dividend of 2.6p is proposed for a total 14 per cent
higher at 3.8p. Earnings were 14 per cent ahead to 15.68p.
COMMENT
Many analysts have been left scratching their heads after this set of
figures. Second half sales were much lower than expected and losses at
Littlewoods and in France were also higher than forecasts. Yet profits were
in line with expectations. Cost-cutting and improved buying power may
explain some of the profits achievement, but many question whether this is
sustainable. Iceland also appears to be struggling for comparable sales,
which have fallen from growth of 10 per cent to a negative 2 per cent in
less than 12 months. The bears have cut forecasts from Pounds 71m to a flat
Pounds 65m. While the multiple of 11 appears attractively low, this is
likely to reflect a degree of pessimism over the longer term.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GPT wins Pounds 40m Chinese order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPT, the UK-based telecommunications joint venture between GEC and Siemens
of Germany, has won a Chinese contract which it claims is the largest ever
awarded for the next generation of telecoms transmissions systems.
The Pounds 40m order includes equipment for a 1,400km system using
'synchronous digital hierarchy' technology, the state-of-the-art
transmission backbone for carriage of high-speed data and voice traffic.
GPT beat Alcatel of France and AT&amp;T of the US for the contract. Mr Peter
Brown, managing director of GPT's network systems division, said its success
was the result of collaboration between Siemens and GPT's UK-based
development team in a Pounds 2bn joint development programme for network
infrastructure.
GPT has a manufacturing joint venture in Shanghai, called Sidtec, but most
of the SDH equipment for the contract will be manufactured at the company's
Coventry plant.
China has less than one phone line per 100 people, but wants to quadruple
its number of lines by the year 2000.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Derwent Valley jumps to Pounds 2.54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derwent Valley Holdings, the London-focused property investment company,
reported a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 896,000 to Pounds 2.54m
in 1993, helped by lower interest payments and rising rental income.
The company, which announced a Pounds 16.9m placing last July, has seen net
asset value per share rise 8.5 per cent to 544p (501p) since the issue, and
anticipates further increases in 1994.
Mr John Ivey, chairman, said: 'Prospects for 1994 are encouraging.
Management will continue to maximise the potential of the portfolio and
acquire further properties.' The company has purchased Pounds 23.8m of
properties since July.
Net revenue from properties amounted to Pounds 7m in 1993, compared with
Pounds 6.4m in the previous year. Debt servicing costs fell from Pounds 3.1m
to Pounds 2.5m in 1993, due to falling interest rates, and the fact that
purchases were timed towards the end of 1993.
Net borrowings, however, climbed Pounds 6m to Pounds 34.7m as a result of
acquisitions, representing gearing of 55 per cent.
The company's portfolio has remained well let, with void space of 32,000 sq
ft at the year end, of which 26,600 sq ft were accounted for by newly
refurbished offices.
About 85 per cent of Derwent's portfolio is located in the West End of
London, and the company said there were already signs of an improvement in
the rental market. It has a number of planning consents for developing its
portfolio, to enhance its performance in a rising market.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 20.8p (10.2p). The directors
recommended a final dividend of 6.05p, making a total of 9.1p (8.6p) for the
year.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trinity rises 32% to Pounds 19.9m - UK
newspapers contributed lion's share of turnover and profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trinity International, the Chester-based regional newspaper publisher, made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.85m last year, an increase of 32 per cent on
1992's Pounds 15.09m, which was restated in accordance with FRS 3.
Operating profits jumped from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 20.85m, including
Pounds 418,000 from acquisitions.
Mr Philip Graf, chief executive, said: 'This is our best operational
performance to date.'
Trinity, which owns daily newspapers in Liverpool and weeklies in
Merseyside, North Wales, Canada and the US, has changed tack since 1989 by
divesting from paper making and concentrating on newspaper publishing.
Last year it fully integrated Scottish and Universal Newspapers, bought in
1992, and spent Pounds 12.4m buying Huddersfield Newspapers and Pounds 23.2m
acquiring the newspaper interests of Argus Press, based in southern and
south-east England.
Turnover advanced by 16.5 per cent from Pounds 115.4m to Pounds 134.4m with
UK newspapers responsible for Pounds 79.4m - 59 per cent of sales compared
with 54 per cent.
UK newspapers also made the lion's share of profits with Pounds 15.7m, or 75
per cent of the whole.
Canadian and US operations benefited from senior management changes, new
titles and marketing initiatives, improving profit contributions to Pounds
2.99m (Pounds 1.77m) in Canada and Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 1.81m) in the US.
Gearing rose from 14.5 per cent to 50 per cent, reflecting the latest
acquisitions which pushed up net debt to Pounds 44.2m from Pounds 11.9m.
Earnings per share show a 40 per cent rise to 20.2p (14.4p restated).
A proposed final dividend of 6.7p (6p) lifts the total by 1p to 9.7p.
Mr Graf said Trinity would be trying to expand further by innovation,
product development and acquisition, but was not at present involved in
serious discussions over buying more newspapers.
This year 'has started encouragingly.' UK advertising sales volume was
growing but the performance was mixed by category and geography.
'The strength of the economic recovery would depend on the impact of April's
tax rises on consumer confidence. Overall, the company expected 'further
progress' this year.
Analysts suggested that Trinity's prospects will be tied closely to the UK
economic upturn now that acquisitions are becoming harder to find.
It will, however, be able to squeeze more costs out of the Argus titles.
They are among the last in western Europe where journalists still use
typewriters.
Moving to computerised direct input and cutting out a stage in the
production process should yield gains in productivity and profitability over
the next two or three years.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lincat up 25% but warns on full year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lincat Group, USM-quoted designer and manufacturer of commercial catering
equipment, lifted pre-tax profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 688,000 in the
first half of 1993. But Mr Martin Craddock, chairman and chief executive,
said he was cautious about the outcome for the full year.
The shares fell 9p to 220p yesterday.
The profit was achieved on a 10 per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 6.51m
to Pounds 7.17m, but behind the result there was a mixed response from the
subsidiaries.
Mr Craddock said that the main subsidiary, Lincat, had a good first half
with turnover up 18 per cent and profit 11 per cent.
At Colnbrook turnover was held and there was a small profit compared with a
loss. Because of the way contracts fell, turnover at Corsair fell by 9 per
cent with marginally reduced profits but there was progress in most areas.
Douglas lifted turnover by 10 per cent and profit by 29 per cent. Sales of
Lincat in the US grew by 36 per cent.
Mr Craddock said current order levels were slightly lower than could
normally be expected at this time. However, the interim dividend is
increased from 2p to 2.2p, from earnings per share of 6.6p (5.4p).

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sema sells I-Linie software for Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company, has abandoned
attempts to succeed in the marketplace with I-Linie, the manufacturing
management software it hoped would be the cornerstone of its packaged
software business.
The directors said yesterday that the company had sold the I-Linie business
to CGI, a French subsidiary of International Business Machines, for about
Pounds 1.5m cash. The deal is subject to the approval of the German
competition board.
Sema, which had turnover last year in excess of Pounds 500m and pre-tax
profits of Pounds 24.9m, acquired I-Linie through the purchase of ADV Orga,
a German software packages company in 1989. It has since spent several
million pounds of research and development funds, in conjunction with IBM,
to develop the product.
I-Linie, a financial, accounting and human resources package was seen by
Sema as competition for R3, a successful package from SAP, the German
software house.
Sema's corporate plan calls for the company to achieve 60 per cent of
turnover from systems integration, 25 per cent from facilities management
and 15 per cent from software packages. The company's packages business,
excluding I-Linie, currently accounts for 5 per cent of turnover.
The directors stated that the company would retain a presence in the
software packages which it continued to see as strategic to its development.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trafficmaster for market at Pounds 28.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafficmaster, a Luton-based company which claims to offer the world's first
commercially available on-board traffic monitoring system, is coming to the
market with a capitalisation of Pounds 28.74m, writes Andrew Bolger.
Allied Provincial has placed 7.5m Trafficmaster shares with institutions at
130p each. Dealings begin on March 31.
Mr David Martell, the chief executive, said the marketing had been very well
received and the flotation would raise Pounds 7.17m in new money - more than
originally planned.
Trafficmaster has installed infra-red sensors which monitor traffic speed,
transmit it by radio to a central computer and then feed the information to
visual display units in subscribers' vehicles, advising motorists of the
average speed and direction of any hold-up.
The system already covers more than 1,000 miles of motorways and trunk roads
in the south of England and the Midlands and part of the flotation proceeds
will be used to extend the network to cover the main motorways in England,
Wales and Scotland by the end of this year, and main trunk roads during 1995
and 1996.
The directors said that once the network was complete revenue from each
subscriber should push profitability up quickly.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: MTM share placing to help fund Pounds 12m
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the chemicals company which sold most of its businesses last year to
repay its bankers, is proposing its first acquisition since its financial
reconstruction.
It is to pay up to Pounds 11.8m for Colin Stewart Minchem, a minerals and
chemicals processor which was a Pounds 5.5m management buy-out from Benjamin
Priest in 1989.
The purchase will be funded partly by a placing of 9.7m shares at 60p, for
which existing investors can apply on a 3-for-8 basis.
Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, has also placed most of the shares which
MTM's bankers agreed to swap for Pounds 28.9m of their loans last April.
In August, MTM outlined a new strategy of acquiring technology-related
businesses which are either profitable, cash-generative and with a strong
management team, or are emerging businesses which are expected to be
profitable within 12 months.
Colin Stewart Minchem falls into the first category. Based in Winsford,
Cheshire, it processes minerals and chemicals mainly for the detergent
industry which accounts for 80 per cent of its sales.
One of the three leading detergent companies provides a 'substantial'
proportion of its gross profits.
Ignoring one large contract in 1991 sales and operating profits of CSM have
risen steadily, reaching Pounds 10.7m and Pounds 2.08m respectively in the
12 months to March 1993.
Mr David Swallow, MTM chairman, said the initial consideration of Pounds
10.5m represented 9.5 times fully taxed earnings for last year with the
multiple dropping to 6 if the vendors earn the additional consideration of
Pounds 1.3m. This requires operating profits of Pounds 2.8m next year.
After the acquisition MTM will have net cash of Pounds 5m and net assets of
Pounds 15.8m.
MTM also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 12m for 1993, down from Pounds
59.2m in 1992. The remaining agrochemicals business made an operating profit
of Pounds 300,000 on turnover of Pounds 21.1m.
After head office costs the continuing activities made an operating loss of
Pounds 818,000.
Broker Hoare Govett is provisionally forecasting profits of Pounds 2m this
year for earnings per share of 5p after 15 per cent tax.
COMMENT
Given the valuations of most chemicals companies these days this deal looks
almost suspiciously cheap, though there is always a risk of Colin Stewart's
main customer walking away. MTM will now be hard pushed to repeat the trick
by finding a decent earnings enhancing acquisition which can be funded by
shares on a multiple of only 12. But a company fresh from a near-death
experience and still looking for a chief executive can scarcely expect much
better.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Boost from Laidlaw helps Quicks advance to
Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quicks Group, the Manchester-based motor distributor, reported a 48 per cent
increase in 1993 pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.04m yesterday, up from Pounds
2.06m the previous year.
Turnover grew by 27 per cent to Pounds 253m (Pounds 199m) almost entirely
reflecting a Pounds 52m contribution from the Laidlaw group of five Ford
main dealerships, which were acquired in July last year.
Earnings per share from the enlarged group, which now consists of 18 car
dealerships, 10 of which are Ford, increased by 22 per cent to 9.5p (7.8p)
and the final dividend is being raised to 3p (2.75p) making a 5p (4.5p)
total for the year.
Operating profits grew by 23 per cent to Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 3.66m)
including a Pounds 336,000 contribution from Laidlaw, while net interest
costs fell to Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 1.6m).
The group noted that the recovery apparent in the first half continued into
the second half with pre-tax profits, on an equivalent basis, at Pounds
1.61m compared with Pounds 950,000 for the 1992 period.
Mr Alec Murray, managing director, said that this near doubling of
second-half profits reflected the continuance of strict management controls
following the installation of the new management team in late 1991, and in
particular the profit impact of the run-down of the group's leasing
activities.
Quicks' overall new car registrations had exceeded manufacturers' targets
and the sales of used vehicles had been higher than the previous year's
total.
Despite difficult market conditions the group's service, bodywork and parts
distribution business also continued to be profitable.
Mr Murray stated that 'margins in every part of our business have remained
under pressure for the whole year', but added that 'management action to
further reduce the cost base has helped offset margin erosion.'
So far this year trading conditions had improved with registrations of both
cars and commercial vehicles ahead of last year.
'The market remains highly competitive, but it is encouraging that Ford has
begun to strengthen its position', Mr Murray said.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: RPS shows 13% growth to Pounds 825,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RPS Group, the USM-traded environmental consultancy, maintained growth in
the second half of 1993 to end the year with pre-tax profits up more than 13
per cent from Pounds 727,000 to Pounds 825,000. Turnover was Pounds 7.52m,
against Pounds 7.62m.
Mr Roger Looker, chairman, said that 'as one of the leading companies in the
sector with a strong balance sheet and positive cash balances, we will
benefit from the inevitable increase in the importance of environmental
issues.'
Trading and cash flow in the first quarter of 1994 gave cause for optimism,
he added.
Cash flow was positive for the third successive year and overall cash
balances were up by Pounds 631,000 and stood at Pounds 646,000 at the year
end. The company paid off all remaining debt in the first half and had no
debt at December 31.
Earnings per share edged ahead from 4.82p to 4.87p, while a final dividend
of 1.3p raises the total for the year to 2.4p (2.2p).

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trinity rises 32% to Pounds 19.9m - UK
newspapers contributed lion's share of turnover and profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trinity International, the Chester-based regional newspaper publisher, made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.85m last year, an increase of 32 per cent on
1992's Pounds 15.09m, which was restated in accordance with FRS 3.
Operating profits jumped from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 20.85m, including
Pounds 418,000 from acquisitions.
Mr Philip Graf, chief executive, said: 'This is our best operational
performance to date.'
Trinity, which owns daily newspapers in Liverpool and weeklies in
Merseyside, North Wales, Canada and the US, has changed tack since 1989 by
divesting from paper making and concentrating on newspaper publishing.
Last year it fully integrated Scottish and Universal Newspapers, bought in
1992, and spent Pounds 12.4m buying Huddersfield Newspapers and Pounds 23.2m
acquiring the newspaper interests of Argus Press, based in southern and
south-east England.
Turnover advanced by 16.5 per cent from Pounds 115.4m to Pounds 134.4m with
UK newspapers responsible for Pounds 79.4m - 59 per cent of sales compared
with 54 per cent.
UK newspapers also made the lion's share of profits with Pounds 15.7m, or 75
per cent of the whole.
Canadian and US operations benefited from senior management changes, new
titles and marketing initiatives, improving profit contributions to Pounds
2.99m (Pounds 1.77m) in Canada and Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 1.81m) in the US.
Mr Graf said Trinity would be trying to expand further by innovation,
product development and acquisition, but was not at present involved in
serious discussions over buying more newspapers.
Gearing rose from 14.5 per cent to 50 per cent, reflecting the latest
acquisitions.
Earnings per share show a 40 per cent rise to 20.2p (14.4p restated).
A proposed final dividend of 6.7p (6p) lifts the total by 1p to 9.7p.
COMMENT
Profitability in the regional press is notoriously dependent on local
classified advertisements for jobs, homes and second-hand cars, as well as
display advertisements by retailers. If Trinity is to keep it up, the
strength of the UK recovery will become more important as acquisitions
become harder to find. Short-term, however, Trinity has one last cost
squeeze to exploit: the Argus titles acquired in November are among the last
in western Europe where journalists still use typewriters. Moving to
computerised direct input and cutting out a stage in the production process
should yield substantial gains in productivity and profitability over the
next two or three years, though managing such change in the newspaper
industry always carries some risk of conflict and interruption to revenues.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Holders' rise held to 13%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holders Technology, the USM-quoted supplier of tools, materials and
equipment to the European printed circuit board industry, lifted pre-tax
profits by 13 per cent, from Pounds 394,000 to Pounds 446,000, in the year
ended November 30 1993.
Mr Rudolf Weinreich, chairman and chief executive, said the result was
affected by Ferranti, one of its larger UK customers, going into
receivership. That left it with a bad debt of Pounds 56,000, thus reducing
the profit growth to about half of what it would otherwise have been.
Turnover rose from Pounds 3.48m to Pounds 4m. Mr Weinreich said that in the
current year the group expected to see increasing sales of the Espanex
adhesives flexible circuit materials which it distributes across Europe.
He added that the outcome for the year would depend on the group's success
in shifting the product mix in favour of higher margin items.
Earnings per share rose to 9.23p (9.07p). An unchanged final dividend of 4p
is proposed to maintain the total at 6p.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: World of Leather in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
World of Leather, the USM-quoted furniture retailer, ended 1993 with a
pre-tax deficit of Pounds 121,000, after taking account of a Pounds 406,000
exceptional charge representing the costs of a contractual dispute with its
former warehousing and distribution company.
The dispute was resolved in an out-of-court settlement just before the year
end, and involved a Pounds 150,000 payment by World of Leather.
The pre-tax outcome compared with Pounds 44,000 profits last time and came
from turnover up from Pounds 25.6m to Pounds 27.2m. Operating profits,
before exceptional items, increased from Pounds 526,000 to Pounds 588,000.
The improvement here, the company said, was achieved through improved
margins - up from 44.8 per cent to 47.1 per cent - which more than offset
higher distribution charges and administrative costs.
On December 26 the company opened its first new store for nearly four years,
increasing the number of outlets to 29.
Losses per share came out at 2.4p (0.1p earnings). The directors said that
provided there was no deterioration in the current level of trading it was
hoped the company would return to the dividend list this year. The last
payment was in 1989.

UK Safety Group, the protective footwear maker which obtained a listing in
May last year following a reverse takeover of Television South West
Holdings, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m for the year to
end-December.
The results include the trading activities of UK Safety for the eight months
following the reverse takeover. The directors said profits of Pounds 3.65m
shown for 1992 refer to TSW and valid comparisons cannot be made.
Turnover of continuing activities totalled Pounds 21.12m. Earnings emerged
at 5.7p and a final dividend of 1.56p makes a 2.6p total.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BSG hit by slowing orders and recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSG International, the vehicle distribution, childcare products, motor and
aviation equipment group, yesterday blamed a 27 per cent decline in 1993
operating profits on falling demand for automotive and aircraft components.
The Midlands-based group saw operating profits fall Pounds 5m to Pounds
13.2m as its businesses suffered under the twin impact of recession in
continental Europe and slowing orders for new aircraft.
Although pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 10.6m from a restated Pounds 7.5m,
the group said this increase was due mainly to a Pounds 1.6m profit on the
sale of one its Midland plants and reduced interest payments.
Mr Richard Marton, chief executive, said pre-tax profits would have been
higher had it not been for Pounds 1.1m of redundancy and restructuring
costs, mostly at its Rumbold aircraft interiors subsidiary where the
workforce was cut by 10 per cent to 750.
The company, part of the group's consumer and special products division,
suffered from a 20 per cent reduction in new aircraft under construction.
The division, which also saw recession hit demand for its childcare products
in Europe, reported a 43.6 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds
4m. Automotive components, previously the group's largest division, endured
an even sharper fall as operating profits slumped 62.2 per cent to Pounds
2.7m.
Mr Marton said: 'We're being dragged down by problems in Europe. The car
market is in a mess and will remain so for the rest of this year.'
The problems were partially offset by an upturn in UK vehicle registrations
and used car sales, which helped the vehicle distribution and leasing
business increase profits by 62 per cent to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 4.1m).
Together the three divisions lifted group turnover to Pounds 573.9m (Pounds
555.1m).
Mr Marton, meanwhile, said the group was committed to disposals of
peripheral businesses. 'We want to eliminate the problem areas of the group
as far as possible,' he said.
Earnings per share came out at 2.43p (1.57p) and the final dividend in
unchanged at 2.5p, maintaining a 3.2p total.
COMMENT
Despite BSG's disappointing operating performance, its shares fell just 1
1/2 p yesterday to 77 1/2 p. The market's flat reaction reflects a
willingness to believe that BSG will make the right restructuring decisions.
Although the company remains tight-lipped about its intentions, it is
thought to be reviewing some of its operations in continental Europe and how
to extract greater earnings from its core businesses. Forecast pre-tax
profits this year of Pounds 16m indicate that BSG is at the bottom of its
business cycle and should benefit from new orders, but on a multiple of
18.9p, the shares remain an expensive option.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CMG ahead and plans flotation next spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer Management Group, a privately held computing services company
operating chiefly in the UK and continental Europe, achieved increased
turnover and profits before tax in 1993.
The company has, subject to market conditions, decided to float on the
London Stock Exchange in the spring of 1995 through a placing that will
value it at about Pounds 130m.
Turnover for 1993 reached Pounds 128.8m, an increase of 19 per cent on the
previous year's Pounds 107.8m, and pre-tax profits rose by 28 per cent to
Pounds 11.1m.
Earnings per share, however, at 35.4p fully diluted were only slightly ahead
of the 35.3p recorded last time.
Mr Chris Banks, group finance director, said that although the company had
grown some 5 per cent in Germany it had lost money there, leading to tax
charges which could not be offset against losses. As a result, the tax
charge grew from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 5.8m.
Growth had been strong in the Netherlands, helped by two small acquisitions,
but weak in the UK. There were signs that the latter was improving and the
company would continue to grow in 1994.
CMG is an employee-owned company with some 1,800 shareholders comprising
employees, former employees and close relatives. A dividend for the year of
13.1p will be paid. Dividend cover is 2.6 times.
Mr Banks said the company had decided to come to the market to improve its
scope for growth, to provide liquidity for existing shareholders and to
underline the company's public image.
Kleinwort Benson will be adviser to the flotation.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Appleyard up at Pounds 5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Appleyard Group, the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer, yesterday announced
the acquisition of five passenger car dealerships from Whitworths Holdings,
the private flour milling group, and at the same time unveiled a sharp
increase in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 223,000 to Pounds 5.12m.
The acquisition is for Pounds 10.2m cash and will be funded from the Pounds
16.4m proceeds of last September's 3-for-10 rights issue.
The mixed franchise dealerships being acquired showed a combined operating
loss of Pounds 100,000 last year on turn-over of Pounds 44.6m and had
estimated net assets of Pounds 8.9m including Pounds 5.9m of property
assets.
Mr Mike Williamson, chairman and chief executive, was confident the
financial performance of the dealerships could be improved. He said the deal
was a further step in the group's national growth strategy.
The group's profit was achieved on turnover up 20 per cent to Pounds 366.9m
(Pounds 305.5m). Operating profits were Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 1.94m).
Mr Williamson said the passenger car business benefited from the stronger
new car market while used car volumes and margins firmed as the year
progressed.
The group has continued its multi-franchising strategy and now has 15 sites
with two or more franchises - two of the Whitworths' dealerships are also
multi-franchise.
As part of the plan to widen its commercial vehicles interests the group
acquired WSM Motors, a Mercedes-Benz operation in Bristol and Yeovil in
November.
Trading profits from the group's associated contract hire and leasing
business increased by 72 per cent to Pounds 1.5m.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 3.61m).
Earnings per share increased from 0.8p to 6.8p and the final dividend is
raised to 2.9p (2.6p) making a total of 5.5p (5.2p).
COMMENT
Appleyard continues to benefit from the effects of operational gearing
following its cost reduction programme with incremental volume improvement
producing disproportionate profit gains. In terms of the outlook profits
from new and used car sales are continuing to improve and the after sales
market is strong. The group's multi-franchising strategy makes sense and the
acquisition - which looks sensibly priced  - will broaden its geographic
reach. Further acquisitions are likely. Pre-tax profits should reach Pounds
8.5m this year producing earnings per share of 9.6p and a prospective p/e of
16.1.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bupa advances 13% to Pounds 41.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bupa, Britain's largest private medical insurer, achieved a 13 per cent
improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 41.2m for the year to end-December
1993.
The figure, which compared with Pounds 36.5m for 1992, was struck after
taking account of a Pounds 4.9m rise in exceptional costs to Pounds 18.9m.
The underwriting surplus grew to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 7.6m) before
exceptionals, because of an improvement in the loss ratio, which expresses
benefits paid as a percentage of subscription income. The ratio figure for
1993 was 81.1 per cent compared with 82.2 per cent in 1992.
The results show a continued strengthening from 1990, when the association
incurred a loss of Pounds 38.2m, and 1991 when there was a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 1.3m.
Exceptional costs reflected the restructuring of Sanitas, the group's
Spanish subsidiary, and property write-downs in the UK.
Reserves grew by Pounds 79.9m to Pounds 429m last year and the group's
solvency ratio increased from 43 per cent to 53 per cent.
Operating profits from the health services division, which runs hospitals,
screening centres and nursing homes, improved from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds
25.7m. The advance was attributed mainly to greater efficiency.
Bupa's market share has fallen in recent years as new providers have entered
the market. According to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission its share has
declined from 59 per cent in 1985 to 44 per cent in 1992.
However, the group says its customer base has now stabilised and if, as
appears likely, the market has contracted overall this year, that may mean
its market share has improved slightly.
There was considerable speculation last year that Bupa was planning to swap
its provident association status for a market listing, but the group now
says it has no plans to go public in the near future.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mayborn Group, involved in the packaging and distribution of consumer goods
to the retail trade, achieved a 19 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 3.55m to Pounds 4.24m in the year to December 31.
The largest rise came from the fabric dyes division with operating profits
ahead to Pounds 1.94m (Pounds 1.52m). Baby products contributed Pounds 3m
(Pounds 2.91m) while losses at florists' sundries deepened to Pounds 28,000
(Pounds 19,000). Mr Ian Peacock, chairman, said it could be some time before
that division returned to profitability.
Turnover of this USM-quoted concern grew 11 per cent to Pounds 39.9m (Pounds
36.1m) and the pre-tax result was after net interest payable of Pounds
120,000 (Pounds 311,000).
Earnings per share were 14.3p against 12.4p and a final dividend of 3.9p
(3.4p) lifts the total to 5.7p (5p).

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Allied London leaps to Pounds 5.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied London Properties, the property investment company, yesterday
reported doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.75m in the six months to
December, against Pounds 2.89m last time.
Sir Geoffrey Leigh, the chairman, said the upswing in the property market
'accelerated in the last quarter of 1993, with an improvement in yields, and
there are also some indications of renewed tenant interest in expanding
their requirements'.
This bullish view has been reflected in the Pounds 41m invested by Allied
London since the start of the current fiscal year.
Net rental income at the interim stage was Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 9m), and the
company reported a Pounds 957,000 profit from the sale of an investment
property, and a further Pounds 695,000 from short-term investments. Interest
payments were stable at Pounds 5.4m.
Allied London has utilised cash balances, which stood at Pounds 16m in June,
to acquire Pelham Homes from the Rosehaugh receiver. The transaction was
completed in December for Pounds 3m, and Pelham carried a further Pounds 14m
of debt.
Pelham owns a substantial land bank in south east England, and Allied London
plans to add value through improved planning consents, and then trade the
sites, against the background of rapidly increasing land prices for the
housing mar-ket.
Allied London's gearing is currently around 100 per cent, but this is based
against June 30 property valuations. The company said it was actively
seeking further investment opportunities.
Allied London will pay an interim dividend of 1.18p (1.075p). Fully diluted
earnings per share amounted to 4.1p (2.5p).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Try Group yesterday became the latest company to announce a rights issue to
finance land purchases and take advantage of the housing market recovery.
The company is seeking to raise Pounds 5.6m via a 3-for-5 share issue at 23p
apiece.
Try, at the same time, announced a Pounds 2.17m pre-tax loss for the year to
end-December after property and rationalisation provisions of Pounds 1.74m.
This compares with a restated loss of Pounds 810,000 for 1992.
The scale of the losses and provisions had been signalled by the company
earlier this year, and the shares fell 3p to 30p.
Because it has taken Pounds 6.7m of accumulated losses from the housing
division onto the group balance sheet, the company has insufficient
distributable reserves to pay a final dividend leaving the total pay-out for
the year at 0.5p (1p).
In order to resume dividend payments Try is seeking shareholder and court
approval to reduce its share premium account by the appropriate amount.
Mr Peter Howell, chief executive, said it was the company's intention to pay
a total net dividend of 1p for 1994. Losses per share were 5.12p (4.23p).
Group turnover rose to Pounds 124m (Pounds 118m).
The contracting division made an operating profit of Pounds 1.24m on sales
of Pounds 116m. Two thirds of a record Pounds 126m order book was negotiated
work which tended to command higher margins than work won on competitive
tender, said Mr Howell.
Housebuilding incurred an Pounds 890,000 loss, mainly because of the timing
of developments on more expensive land bought by the group during the late
1980s. The number of homes sold also fell, from 201 to 152.
The rights issue has been underwritten by Lazards.
COMMENT
Try's decision to expand housebuilding, closing operations in East Anglia
and Scotland and concentrating in south-east England, looks a little belated
compared with others in the sector. It is a good contractor achieving better
than average profit margins throughout the recession. Its record in
residential and commercial property is less impressive. The rights price,
however, is at a sufficient discount to make this a worthwhile investment if
the new housebuilding team performs, but it is a risk. At an ex-rights price
of 29p the company is on a prospective p/e of almost 20 on pre-tax profits
of Pounds 1m in 1994 and a p/e of 11 on Pounds 2m in 1995.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dilemma of divided loyalties - Tim Burt on
the key to the outcome of GKN's bid for Westland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two institutional investors holding the key to the outcome of GKN's Pounds
497m hostile bid for Westland are about to be barraged by lobbying from the
two sides.
M&amp;G and Schroders are not relishing the prospect. As the largest
institutional shareholders in both companies, they are in the uncomfortable
situation of being asked to play King Solomon with Westland's future.
Their dilemma will be underlined by forceful lobbying by Mr Alan Jones,
Westland chairman, who claims his company's best interests lie in
independence; and by Sir David Lees, his GKN counterpart, who is seeking an
enlarged defence business.
With 12 per cent of Westland and 5.5 per cent of GKN, M&amp;G admits it could
make a case for supporting either side. The sentiment is similar at
Schroders, which has 13.5 per cent of the helicopter company and 4.4 per
cent of the engineering group. But to the chagrin of Sir David, they have so
far leant towards the Yeovil-based helicopter maker.
Their task has been made easier by GKN's 290p a share offer, launched seven
weeks ago at a 5 per cent discount to the market price. The move prompted a
sharp rise in Westland's shares to 333p, but they fell back after GKN
vigorously attacked Westland's prospects. They closed yesterday at 326p.
Before even entering into any arguments about prospective helicopter orders
or synergies with GKN's armoured vehicles business, the institutions simply
point to the price and say it is inadequate.
Mr Richard Hughes, director of investment management at M&amp;G, says: 'The
shares are trading well above 290p. We will make our decision on the offer
as Westland shareholders, irrespective of our commitment to GKN.'
Such comments - echoed at Schroders - raise the hackles of GKN executives,
who complain that the institutions must start looking at the takeover as
their shareholders too.
For them, Westland would not only immediately quadruple the turnover of its
defence business to more than Pounds 500m a year, but would transform the
tax profile of the whole group.
The helicopter group's UK profits would enable GKN to recoup a large chunk
of Advance Corporation Tax, which it has been forced to write off in the
past because of its high proportion of overseas earnings.
By increasing UK sales to 40 per cent of turnover, Westland would bring
GKN's total tax rate closer to the 33 per cent average from 38.7 per cent
last year, when it wrote off Pounds 7.9m of unrecoverable ACT.
While admitting Westland would 'impact favourably' on GKN's overall tax
rate, the Midlands-based group argues that such a marriage would also be
blessed by logistical and marketing advantages, especially in lucrative
export markets.
It has also held out the prospect of financial support to bolster Westland's
balance sheet, which it suggests may not be strong enough to sustain strong
demand for civil variants of the EH101 helicopter - should that materialise.
Defence industry analysts are not convinced. They see GKN's motives as
purely fiscal.
'If Westland is so attractive, then GKN will have to dig deeper into its
pockets and find a little more,' said one analyst.
Several analysts also suggest that the offer price reflects GKN's expertise
in extracting a good deal from United Technologies, which agreed to sell its
18.7 per cent Westland holding for Pounds 75m at 290p a share.
However, with 45 per cent of Westland under its belt, GKN appears wedded to
290p. Sir David claims the price already includes a premium to Westland's
underlying value and is a fair price in the face of uncertain future
prospects.
Helicopter orders may be picking up, he says, but they are not as rosy as
Westland claims. Describing Westland's sales estimates as over-optimistic,
Sir David warns: 'Westland does not and cannot project when profits will
support the current share price.'
He points out that Westland's prospects would have to grow remarkably from
the one delivery scheduled this year to meet in 2000 its estimated 39
deliveries of which 12 are already on order and 27 as yet prospects.
Mr Jones claims the market has already given GKN the thumbs down. He denies
suggestions that Westland's shares have been boosted by bid speculation and
its success last year in extracting a Pounds 385m damages award, still under
appeal, from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation.
'The offers were made below the market price and include no premium for our
potential, for control or for the tax advantages to GKN,' he says.
Having sparred for several weeks, the two chairmen are now putting the final
touches to their institutional presentations.
Westland is likely to promise M&amp;G and Schroders sizeable earnings growth if
they stick with the company as its production expands.
GKN will argue that Westland would fare even better as part of a larger
group, and that the institutions would benefit from its upside potential
anyway as shareholders in GKN.
Keen to win City support for its argument, the engineering group has also
pointed to a report published last week by UBS, the securities house. Taking
a forecast of orders 28 per cent higher than Westland's own, it produced a
best case scenario for the year 2002 that gave Westland's shares a present
value of 306p on a cashflow basis and 275p on an earnings basis.
The same report, however, argues: 'Westland's strong product range, cost
base, and order book is producing rapidly accelerating earnings and dividend
growth. The tax benefits available to GKN make Westland worth up to 400p per
share, rather than the 290p it has offered.'
Faced with increasingly hostile arguments, the institutions are sitting
tight and waiting for the combatants to fire the next salvo.
That is expected next Monday, the deadline for Westland to release new
information relevant to the bid. It is expected to make a buoyant trading
forecast, pointing to profits of at least Pounds 36m (Pounds 30.5m) this
year despite continuing uncertainties in the defence and aerospace market.
Despite Sir David's protestations that GKN has made a fair offer, the
institutions sense that the tax incentive will be enough to persuade him to
up his bid - albeit marginally.
'Buying a growing company at a depressed point in the market, which also
comes with tax advantages, is a very attractive option,' says one
institutional investor.
Warning GKN that there is little prospect of it accepting the current bid,
another institution warns: 'GKN and Westland are going to have to live
together whether the bid stands or falls. Sir David knows the game, and he
knows we won't accept this offer.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CE Heath decides to axe six reinsurance
jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CE Heath, the insurance broker, yesterday made six of the staff in its
reinsurance division redundant, including the joint managing director of its
LMX operations.
The surprise notification of compulsory redundancies yesterday at the
company follows restructuring over several years of similar excess insurance
divisions at many other brokers.
Mr Tim Broadhurst, managing director of Heath Fielding, confirmed that Mr
Paul McCarthy, joint managing director, one junior director and four staff
had been made redundant.
He said that there were no plans to replace these staff and that Mr Dennis
King, the other joint managing director, would take charge.
He stressed that the functions provided would continue for the foreseeable
future and that he anticipated no reduction in the volume of business. He
said that division remained 'extremely profitable.'
'There are no problems, no further redundancies and the numbers will reveal
all in due course,' he said.
'LMX is a word disappearing from our vocabulary but we will still have a
retro division.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Metalrax to expand as profits pass Pounds
8m mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metalrax Group, the precision components, houseware and storage equipment
group, yesterday said it was planning to expand its UK and North American
operations following a 7 per cent increase in profits.
The Midlands-based group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.02m in the year to
December 31, compared with a restated Pounds 7.47m last time.
The company said it was well placed to make acquisitions on both sides of
the Atlantic and was already discussing two bids.
Such acquisitions are likely to be funded from year-end net cash balance of
Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 5.3m) or by offering equity to potential subsidiaries.
Expansion of the group last year helped turnover rise 10 per cent to Pounds
71.3m.
Mr Eric Moore, managing director, said the performance of the precision
components division showed the sharpest improvement and now accounted for 50
per cent of sales and profits.
The business was augmented at the year-end by the Pounds 1m acquisition of
Western Body Hardware, the specialist locks business.
Mr Moore also hinted at further expansion of the houseware division,
representing 30 per cent of turnover, following its takeover of Fabricote,
the supplier of non-stick materials.
The new subsidiaries increased the workforce to more than 1,500.
Earnings per share were 6.36p (6.27p) and the final is raised to 3p (2.73p),
taking the total to 4p (3.64p). A 1-for-10 scrip issue is proposed.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cost-cutting helps UDO advance 32% to
Pounds 1.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UDO Holdings, the supplier of drawing office equipment and reprographic
services, yesterday hailed a cost-cutting programme and emphasis on high
margin products as the main factor behind a 32 per cent increase in interim
profits.
In the six months to January 31, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 1.85m
(Pounds 1.4m). This was despite reduced turnover of Pounds 23.1m (Pounds
23.9m) as the group's traditional businesses continued to suffer the effects
of recession.
Mr Mike Wright, chairman, said the improvement reflected savings achieved by
a redundancy programme and renewed emphasis on higher margin products.
The workforce has been cut by 10 per cent to 900, and Mr Wright said he had
been encouraged by growing demand for the group's colour imaging equipment.
'The colour imaging centres, established last year and representing a very
substantial investment, are now contributing to group profits,' he added.
Earnings per share rose to 4.25p (3.22p), and the interim dividend is up to
2.22p (2.07p).
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 14.4m and said it was
considering acquisitions.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Butte loss static at Pounds 355,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Butte Mining, the UK company whose main activity is prosecuting US lawsuits
 -it is seeking damages of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) from former
managers and promoters - has reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 355,000 for
the six months to end-December and the result for the full year is not
expected to be any worse than this.
The interim result is little changed from the Pounds 336,000 deficit in the
same period last year.
Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, said the past six months 'have been
frustrating, with no action by the Federal District Court judge in Montana
on any of the substantive motions in front of him.'
'Until the judge rules on these motions, a court date cannot be set. We have
developed an extremely strong case and look forward to the opportunity of
presenting it in court,' he added.
In the second half of this year, Butte expects to finish restructuring and
floating VAM, an Australian gold company, and to receive about ADollars
800,000 (Pounds 394,000) from this transaction.
This will provide funding to develop some of the company's property in
Montana.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bowater disappoints in spite of rise to
Pounds 212m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group, yesterday
claimed success for its 'bold' acquisitions strategy as it revealed a 44 per
cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 147m to Pounds 212m.
However, the group's shares, after an initial 10p surge, reacted badly,
closing down 39p at 453p.
Analysts said the good results had been expected and already discounted in
the share price, and the market was disappointed by a cautious statement
from Bowater.
The group said market conditions, especially in continental Europe,
continued to be difficult, and a move to shorter order books and smaller
orders had accelerated. Raw materials prices were also said to be rising,
prompting concerns about margin pressure.
But Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said demand showed some signs of
improvement.
'Demand was down in the third quarter of last year, but came back in the
fourth. Overall it's a little better.'
The profit, at the top end of expectations, included an exceptional gain of
Pounds 10.3m on business disposals, plus a Pounds 7m gain on foreign
exchange translations
Mr Lyon said last year's acquisitions, totalling Pounds 403m, of Specialty
Coatings International, the US coatings company, medical packaging company
Tower, and MiTek, the connector plate manufacturer, had been integrated
quickly and outperformed expectations.
An important task now was to exploit the links between different parts of
the business to develop 'value-added' products and ensure the group could
offer integrated solutions to customers' needs.
Group turnover for the year to December 31 increased from Pounds 1.57bn to
Pounds 2.14bn, including Pounds 318m from acquisitions.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 141m to Pounds 194m, with a Pounds 38m
contribution from the acquisitions.
Operating profits in the UK and Ireland increased from Pounds 69.5m to
Pounds 74.5m, in the Americas from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 80.7m, and in
Australasia from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 22.8m. Profits in continental Europe
fell from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 14m. Operating margins increased from 9 to
9.1 per cent.
A Pounds 61m cash inflow from operations, before acquisitions and rights
issues, helped reduce debt from Pounds 276m to Pounds 262m. Gearing fell
from 56 per cent to 40 per cent.
Bowater is proposing a final dividend of 7.25p, lifting the total from 11.1p
to 12.55p. Earnings increased from 24.4p to 28.2p a share.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Clyde Petroleum cuts loss to Pounds 23.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clyde Petroleum, the lossmaking oil and gas exploration company, yesterday
warned that a return to profitability was uncertain as long as the oil price
remained at historically low levels.
Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said that in a climate of weak oil
prices, a return to profit and to the dividend list depended on two main
factors: the speed at which Clyde could build up production and the level of
exploration write-offs.
This latter factor, which writes off unsuccessful exploration as incurred,
was 'unpredictable,' said Mr Gourlay.
The group was seeking to reduce the exposure to such factors by reining in
exploration. Expenditure on new pros-pects was Pounds 18m last year, against
Pounds 30m previously. Clyde was further reducing exploration investment to
Pounds 10m this year.
The group spent Pounds 93.6m on development, against Pounds 17.46m last
time. Some Pounds 36m was budgeted for development this year.
Clyde reported lower net losses of Pounds 23.4m for the year to December 31,
against a Pounds 39.8m deficit last time. Sales were 2 per cent lower at
Pounds 81.6m.
The company enjoyed a series of one-off gains which helped to reduce losses.
These included an Pounds 8.3m fall in exploration costs to Pounds 34m, a tax
clawback of Pounds 5m, and lower provisions of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 11m) on
the carrying value of assets.
The company also benefited from the hedging of 80 per cent of its production
at an Dollars 18 oil price. Some 24 per cent of this year's output was
hedged at Dollars 17, Mr Gourlay said.
Clyde expected to increase production by 60 per cent this year, largely
because of the inclusion for a full year of output from the North Sea
Gryphon field. Last year Clyde staged a Pounds 34m rights issue to develop
this field.
'At the moment we are disappointed that benefit comes in juxtaposition with
a historically low oil price,' Mr Gourlay said.
Analysts greeted the results with a certain degree of resignation.
Borrowings of Pounds 188.7m, representing 110 per cent of shareholders'
funds, remained higher than expected.
The group was also not showing a great deal of success in the exploration
carried out to date, even though it has been attempting to reduce the risk
through farming out interests.
As in previous years, there was no dividend. Losses per share were halved to
6.2p.
Proven and probable reserves fell by 8 per cent to 164.4m barrels of oil
equivalent.

FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Computer problems take toll on Dorling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publisher of highly illustrated reference
books, reported a 17 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.51m and
said computer problems at a distributor had affected sales growth and
increased costs.
Sales increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 45.13m in the six months to
December 31.
The publisher's shares, which more than doubled after being floated at 165p
at the end of 1993, fell sharply in December after the group issued a
profits warning. The shares yesterday closed 2p higher at 266p.
Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman and chief executive, confirmed December's
forecast that pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 were expected to be
somewhat less than the Pounds 9.65m achieved previously.
DK said it had experienced problems over distribution by Tiptree Book
Services to bookshops and, in particular, to DK Family Library, which sells
directly to homes and schools. Tiptree had been replaced as distributor for
Family Library and its services to bookshops had improved, although DK
continued to monitor the situation.
Mr Kindersley said DK was pursuing a legal claim against Tiptree for loss of
revenue and additional costs, but had been advised not to disclose its
estimate of the financial impact to date.
Tiptree, which is owned by Random House, the US publisher, said it refused
to be made a scapegoat for the failure of DK to meet the expectations which
its management had raised among shareholders. It would be misleading to
suggest that any compensation which DK might obtain from Tiptree would have
any significant impact on the bottom line of the company's performance.
Another area of disappointment was DK Education, which supplies teaching
packages to schools.
Earnings per share fell to 3.3p (4.7p), but the interim dividend was held at
1.1p.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Credit Lyonnais to get French taxpayers' cash

<TEXT>
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday confirmed that
the government plans to restructure Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making bank,
by injecting capital and floating part of its property loans into a
state-controlled shell company.
Details of the rescue package will be announced on Thursday afternoon when
Credit Lyonnais, which has been badly affected by the economic recession
after aggressive expansion in the late 1980s, will disclose a heavy net loss
for 1993, estimated by analysts at between FFr2.5bn (Pounds 280m) and
FFr5bn.
The rescue has been the subject of intense negotiation between the
government and Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the French financier appointed chairman
of Credit Lyonnais.
The package is expected to include a FFr4bn capital injection and the
removal from the banks' balance sheet of FFr25bn-FFr40bn of non-performing
property loans which will then be guaranteed by the government.
Asked whether this operation, coinciding with French requests for approval
for large amounts of state aid to Bull and Air France, might not be too much
for the European Commission to swallow, Mr Alphandery said that in the case
of Credit Lyonnais, 'the government will be carrying out its normal role as
shareholder'.
He said taking property loans off Credit Lyonnais' balance sheet 'is a
classic operation' of the kind carried out for 'other French and foreign
banks'. He would not take a final decision on Credit Lyonnais'
recapitalisation until he had seen its 1993 figures - to be presented to the
bank's board on Thursday.
Still at issue is how long the state will guarantee the property-related
loans before reintegrating them into the bank's balance sheet.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Prudential lifts payout on 45% rise: Turnround at M&amp;G
reinsurance arm helps financial services company to Pounds 589m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Corporation, the financial services and life insurance company,
has reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 589m for 1993, a 45 per cent advance,
helped by a sharply improved performance in Mercantile &amp; General, its
reinsurance subsidiary.
The final dividend rose to 8.7p, pushing the total up by almost 11 per cent
to to 13.2p.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said Prudential did not need to make
specific provisions against potential compensation claims in respect of
personal pensions sold to people transferring out of occupational schemes.
Last year it carried out some Pounds 355m pension transfer business.
Profits from the life business rose to Pounds 481m, from Pounds 444m, with
much of the increase coming from operations outside the UK. Profits from the
UK business rose just Pounds 6m to Pounds 282m.
In a sharp turnround, M&amp;G's non-life business produced a profit of Pounds 6m
in 1993, after a loss in 1992 of Pounds 143m. Mr Newmarch said this came
partly from the 'lack of catastrophes', but also from measures to correct
pricing levels, control underwriting exposure and cut costs. The full
effects would be seen this year, he said.
UK domestic insurance more than doubled profits from Pounds 27m to Pounds
55m, reflecting favourable weather and claims experience. The contribution
from Prudential's investment management rose to Pounds 23m, from Pounds 8m.
Annual premium sales of life business in the UK fell 12 per cent, though
single premium sales were up 24 per cent.
Jackson National Life, Prudential's US subsidiary, contributed profits of
Pounds 122m, though this was not directly comparable with the 1992 figure of
Pounds 86m, which included Pounds 52m related to investment gains.
Mr Newmarch said that sales of Jackson's main product - single premium
deferred annuities - had been disappointing and 38 per cent down in dollar
terms. The company has launched a new range of products and will expand into
New England this year, and open in New York.
Mr Newmarch highlighted the group's operations in southern Asia and the
Pacific as areas of future growth: it is to open offices in China and
Indonesia.
Earnings per share increased 40 per cent to 21.0p, from 15.0p.
In the alternative method of calculating life company accounts - the
accruals basis which seeks to recognise profit in the current year rather
than from business written previously - Prudential's profits rose 10 per
cent to Pounds 887m. Of this, new business represented Pounds 289m (Pounds
329m), while the investment return on shareholders' accrued interest
totalled Pounds 406m (Pounds 353m).
Prudential confirmed last night that in 1993 it sacked 23 members of staff
for misdemeanours, including falsifying customer records.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Somewhere there's a bull run seeking a china shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are tough times for the global investment strategists as the markets
seek to re-establish order and coherence after last year's bull run. Take
your pick: Morgan Stanley, for instance, which rampaged through Hong Kong so
noisily as a raging bull last autumn is now in a seriously bearish mode
globally, while on the other hand Goldman Sachs is complaining bitterly that
the markets have over-reacted to the Federal Reserve's modest tightening.
In important sections of the global securities market price leadership is
shifting from one group of investors to another - from international hedge
funds to domestic pension funds, for instance. US mutual funds have
introduced a new element of potential volatility. In the process investment
yields are taking quantum leaps to levels at which the new investors can
hope to attain their objectives.
The damage to securities prices has in some cases been substantial; to take
an extreme, the stock market in Turkey has slumped by 45 per cent from its
mid-January peak. Yet there is also the intriguing likelihood that new
anomalies are being created. UK gilts, for instance, are now providing
yields (of up to some 7.6 per cent at the long end) which the Bank of
England is apparently no longer willing to offer on new issues, hence the
floater launched yesterday.
The great divide is between the static interpretations of global valuations
and the more dynamic theories of flows of funds. On the former basis a sharp
jump in the yield on, say, long Treasury bonds is most easily explained in
terms of a significantly worsening view by investors of the prospects for
inflation. However, this makes little sense when the Fed tightening that
triggered the move was designed to head off future inflationary pressures.
Cause and effect are more easily related on a flow of funds analysis: the
Fed is in the process of shutting off the liquidity pump which inflated
securities markets worldwide. The effect of loose monetary policy is
normally evident much sooner in financial asset price inflation than in the
prices of goods and services generally. A liquidity-driven equity bull
market can be punctured more completely than one primarily supported by
growth in dividends and earnings.
Distance makes the heart grow harder: there has been a near-30 per cent
tumble in the Hong Kong equity market since the peak at the beginning of the
year, while New York's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index has only retreated some 3
per cent. The contrast is symptomatic of how last year's flows have begun to
reverse: US-based money is being withdrawn, or at least is being parked on
the sidelines.
Flows of money do not easily explain the whole confusing picture, however.
In the UK (and elsewhere in Europe) the equity and bond markets have moved
down more or less together, but in the US almost all the damage has been
suffered in bonds. As for Japan, the Nikkei Index is up some 16 per cent so
far in 1994 whereas yen bonds have slumped (the 10-year JGB yield is up by
106 basis points to 4.1 per cent over the same 12 weeks). Stick all that
into your tactical asset allocation model and watch it crash.
Well, perhaps, your model is extremely sophisticated. It might allow for the
fact that the UK stock market is yield-oriented and is thus sensitive to
long-term interest rates whereas nobody buys Japanese equities for the
income (which is still quite a long way short of 1 per cent). Some valuation
models look at the influence of short-term as well as long-term interest
rates, however: the puzzle here is that everywhere outside the US short and
long rates are moving in different directions. Again, your model will freeze
unless you have programmed in some sophisticated time lags.
Japan is the real challenge. Recovery prospects are a matter of faith, but
Tokyo is the beneficiary of setbacks elsewhere. Global investors are
seriously underweight in Japanese equities and naturally consider filling
that gap when they take profits elsewhere, and find there are no better
stories around. But as Mr Robin Griffiths, James Capel's technical analyst,
says, the views get more bullish the further you go away from Japan. In the
chaotic world of global investment there simply has to be a bull market
happening somewhere.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Favourite first past the post at Epsom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The favourite won the race for the Derby yesterday. Racecourse Holdings
Trust, owned by the Jockey Club, will be the new owner of Epsom, where the
next Derby will be run on June 1. It will also own Sandown Park and Kempton
Park.
The trust, always seen as the safest bet, made a winning bid of Pounds
30.25m. This outstripped bids from the two outsiders - Sunset + Vine, the
sports television company, and a consortium headed by Mr Stan Clarke, owner
of Uttoxeter racecourse.
The three courses were offered for sale in October by the Horse-race Betting
Levy Board, which has owned them for more than 20 years. Mr Rodney Brack,
chief executive of the board, said the race had been close. All three
candidates had satisfied the board's prime demand to safeguard the future of
quality racing at all three courses.
The Levy Board will face criticism that it has taken the safe option. The
trust, whose main shareholder is the Jockey Club, already owns nine of the
UK's 59 courses, including Cheltenham and Newmarket.
Mr David Hillyard, RHT's managing director, said he was absolutely
delighted. Anyone who accused the trust of being establishment and
unimaginative 'clearly was nowhere near Cheltenham last week' for the
three-day National Hunt Festival.
The trust will borrow about 70 per cent of the purchase price, which
includes Pounds 1m related to Derby sponsorship. The contract is expected to
be concluded by the end of next month.
A spokesman for Sunset + Vine said: 'Our bid was designed to improve and
broaden the appeal of racing to the public, bring innovation and marketing
expertise to the world of racing.'
Sunset, which has a market value of less than Pounds 10m, had lined up a
board that included Mr Robert Sangster, the millionaire racehorse owner, Mr
David Lloyd, former British Davis Cup tennis player, and racehorse trainer
Mr Luca Cumani.
Mr Stan Clarke, who has turned round Uttoxeter racecourse from losses five
years ago, put in a private bid with Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman of Singer
&amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, and Mr Andrew Cohen,
managing director of Betterware, the home shopping company.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Low-cost drug set to challenge Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zantac, Glaxo's ulcer medication which is the biggest selling drug in the
US, is facing a new challenge following an application by a generic drug
company to produce a low-cost version of the product there.
The latest assault on the dominant position of Zantac, which had sales in
the US of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) last year and worldwide sales of
Dollars 3.5bn, comes as Glaxo is battling in the courts to uphold a US
patent on the product which has eight years left to run.
Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, confirmed yesterday that its
Geneva Pharmaceuticals subsidiary had filed an application with the US Food
and Drug Administration last month to produce a version of Zantac, known as
Form 1.
This version of the ulcer drug, ranitidine hydrochloride, is thought never
have to been produced commercially. Glaxo markets a later version of the
drug, known as Form 2.
Geneva hopes to make its anti-ulcer drug available by the end of 1995, when
Glaxo's US patent on Form 1 expires. Ciba would not say what it expected to
charge for the product, but added: 'It'll certainly be cheaper than Zantac.'
The two versions of the drug are identical in their effects on patients,
according to both Glaxo and Ciba. Form 2, though, is easier to produce, and
was adopted by Glaxo as the preferred version in the early 1980s.
The UK company questioned yesterday whether a Form 1 product could be
produced commercially, and whether it could be manufactured without some
elements of Form 2 Zantac also being produced, potentially infringing its
patent. Ciba said it was confident it could make the drug.
Glaxo also challenged an attempt by Geneva to have its version of the drug
approved using a speeded-up approval process applied by the FDA for drugs
which were converting from prescription to over-the-counter status. The
procedure does not involve time-consuming and expensive trials.
Ciba said it expected no obstacles to a quick approval process. Geneva had
been involved in two precedents in the US of so-called polymorphs -
different versions of the same drug - qualifying for rapid approval, it
said.
Last summer, Glaxo won a court victory to protect its US patent on Form 2,
which expires in 2002. An appeal against this ruling is due to be heard on
April 11. Glaxo shares closed down 21 at 662p in London.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Ciskei 'homeland' leaders cede power amid widespread unrest

<TEXT>
The government of Ciskei, a nominally independent black homeland in South
Africa, last night relinquished power after widespread unrest. In the Lebowa
black homeland, the chief minister also requested assistance from Pretoria
after a civil servants' strike made it impossible to keep control.
South African troops moved into Ciskei after homeland police took senior
officers hostage claiming they had been involved in corruption. South
Africa's Foreign Affairs Ministry said Ciskei leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo
requested assistance from Pretoria. In a statement, the ministry said:
'Brigadier Gqozo telephoned to say the situation was out of hand and there
was danger of large-scale conflict and bloodshed. He indicated he had come
to the conclusion he ought to relinquish power in an attempt to reduce the
ongoing tension.'
The multi-party Transitional Executive Council said last night that two
administrators - one from the TEC and one from the South Africa government -
would administer the Ciskei until April's elections.
Three of South Africa's 10 homelands - including Bophuthatswana, whose
government fell earlier this month - have now been removed from power. The
news from Ciskei and Lebowa will substantially increase pressure on the
KwaZulu homeland.
Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who heads the KwaZulu homeland, yesterday
claimed he had a secret African National Congress document that showed the
ANC also planned to topple him from power.
Also yesterday, a multi-party task force set up by the TEC said it had
uncovered evidence linking so-called 'hit squads' operating in Natal
province to the office of Chief Buthelezi. Inkatha is not represented on the
TEC, which is dominated by the ANC.
The taskforce findings will further damage Inkatha's credibility following
allegations that South African police generals gave guns to the party.

FT  23 MAR 94 / S Korean forces go on alert as N-plant row with North grows

<TEXT>
South Korean president Kim Young-sam yesterday placed the country's military
forces on alert against a possible attack by North Korea as international
pressure intensified on that country to allow nuclear inspections.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said diplomacy had 'reached a
critical point', but Chinese officials warned that sanctions or other moves
against North Korea would only increase tension on the Korean peninsula.
The South Korean armed forces were put on alert as President Kim prepared to
leave for Japan and China tomorrow. He is expected to ask Beijing to
persuade Pyongyang to accept unhindered inspections from the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
A North Korean radio broadcast accused the US of making a 'grave threat' by
agreeing to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea. The US says the
deployment, agreed this week, is 'purely defensive'.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said the 'door is still
open' to direct negotiations with North Korea. He said if the United Nations
Security Council imposes economic sanctions, they will be introduced
gradually to give Pyongyang time to reverse its decision.
Mr Christopher said he expected the UN Security Council to consider a
resolution calling on North Korea to allow the completion of inspections.
He said: 'We've made it clear to North Korea that it must become a
responsible member of the international community or that community will
have no option but to pursue other options.'
The first UN resolution, however, is likely to contain only an indirect
threat of sanctions, as it is unlikely that China would approve sanctions
against its ally. Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, warned in Beijing
yesterday that North Korea should not be put under extreme pressure.
Differences within South Korea emerged as the opposition Democratic party
cautioned against the military measures and urged the government to seek
continued dialogue with Pyongyang.
Mr James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, repeated his
agency's estimate that North Korea had at least enough nuclear material to
make one bomb, although it was not clear if it had assembled a bomb.
'A range of countries around the world are proliferation problems, but North
Korea is in a league of its own. It is, in many respects, the pre-eminent
proliferator,' Mr Woolsey said.

FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: GKN/Westland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the niceties about strategic vision and industrial logic, GKN's bid
for Westland is settling down to an old-fashioned haggle over price.
Unfortunately, from GKN's point of view, there may well be a gap between the
price it is prepared to pay and the price which shareholders are prepared to
accept. Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman, has said repeatedly that he will not
'overpay' for Westland. That implies that any increase in the offer will be
modest. There might conceivably be some flexing of terms over the Arab
Organisation for Industrialisation settlement. GKN might, for example, keep
all of any payment in return for a higher offer. But the total package seems
unlikely to take the bid much over the current market price of 326p.
That may not be enough to dislodge Westland's heavily concentrated
shareholders, particularly since one of the largest is M&amp;G, which has a
tradition of supporting existing management. In the absence of a
substantially higher bid, institutions may also feel that they can play a
waiting game. If the projected orders turn out to be pie, rather than
helicopters, in the sky, they may think that they can sell to GKN later. Its
45 per cent holding suggests a continuing interest, and in any event,
Westland's tax advantages do not become substantial until 1996. If the
orders do materialise, however, Westland would be worth a good deal more
than 326p. The unenviable problem facing Sir David is that if he refuses to
overpay now, he may risk having to do so later.

FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater's premium rating, which has been carefully cultivated over the
years, was blown away in one puff yesterday as its shares fell 8 per cent.
That may partly reflect a cyclical reversal of fortune with Bowater's
previous virtues being transformed into present vices: defensiveness in
recession now appears dullness in recovery. Good treasury management, which
produced interest income despite year-end debt of Pounds 262m, now smacks
more of financial alchemy. Bowater's penchant for buying exhausted leveraged
buy-out companies once seemed a clever way of buying assets on the cheap.
But the drawbacks are now becoming apparent, with Bowater having to spend
much time and capital injecting vim and vigour.
The most serious worry, though, is what differential rates of inflation will
do to margins. Bowater's suppliers - most conspicuously the pulp and paper
manufacturers - are currently pushing through big price rises. But it may
prove difficult for Bowater to pass the parcel on to its customers,
producing a nasty margin squeeze. Besides, Bowater's customers are growing
ever more demanding, specifying shorter runs and higher standards. That puts
another pressure on margins, which will not quickly be reversed. With no
currency gains likely this year, Bowater's attractions as a recovery stock
have soured. But with volumes growing at a respectable 3 per cent, Bowater
still retains its longer-term appeal. After a frantic spell of corporate
activity, Bowater must now consolidate. The shares seem likely to do the
same.

FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Prudential
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If a life insurance company should be judged by its ability to sell life
insurance, Prudential still has something to prove. Yesterday's 45 per cent
rise in full-year profits owed more to recovery in general reinsurance -
which the Pru admits is peripheral to its ambitions - than underlying
momentum in long-term savings. Life insurance profits rose by 10 per cent.
But that includes taking Pounds 50m of US investment gains into profits
rather than diverting such windfalls into reserves, as was the case last
year. On the accruals accounting method favoured by the Pru, the profit
contribution from new life insurance business actually fell.
Prudential might reasonably plead special circumstances. Restructuring its
direct sales force in the UK has yielded annual cost savings of more
thanPounds 100m, but with inevitable disruption. As reorganisation comes to
an end, the sales force must start to perform. More worryingly, Jackson
National proved extremely vulnerable to low US interest rates, which made
its annuities less attractive than equity-based savings products. Perhaps an
infusion of new management and revamped product range will be enough to
reverse last year's 38 per cent drop in sales.
It is certainly too early to pass judgment on either count. In theory,
Prudential should be well placed to deal with tougher regulation at home. By
deciding not to provide against mis-selling of personal pensions, it has
shown touching faith in its record of compliance to date. While a yield 30
per cent higher than the market average might look generous in the light of
yesterday's headline figures, the uncertainties demand no less.

FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Turn of the screw
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At one level there must be some relief that the Federal Reserve has made up
its mind. Another increase in short-term interest rates had certainly been
priced into the US markets. Equities were unperturbed, the dollar scarcely
moved while US Treasury bonds rallied once the uncertainty was over. Since
they are used to taking a lead from the US, there is a chance that this
initially sanguine view may spill over into international markets too.
Paradoxically, though, both equities and bond markets outside the US have
been harder hit since the Fed first started to tighten. Any positive
response could be short-lived.
True, there is unlikely to be a repeat of the selling by highly-geared
speculative investors that greeted the Fed's first move. Some equity
markets, notably in Asia, have fallen to levels which reflect underlying
value as the froth has blown off. European bonds now offer high real yields,
but problems remain. The Fed's latest action may make the pace of German
rate cuts even more painfully slow. The fact that the US appears intent on
sticking to quarter-point rises means financial markets may soon have to
start discounting its next move.
The trouble with such a gradualist approach is that it prolongs the agony,
and can mean interest rates end up higher than would have been the case with
a short, sharp shock. Had the Fed been bolder, the markets might have been
inclined to calm down sooner.

FT  23 MAR 94 / IMF and Russians strike deal: Fund sets conditions for
release of new Dollars 1.5bn loan to Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government and the International Monetary Fund struck a deal
late last night under which the IMF expects to release a new Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1.02bn) loan soon. Under the deal, Moscow must take steps to
increase budget revenue this year and commit itself to tight monetary
policies to curb inflation.
The loan has already been held up for several months because of IMF concern
that promised economic reforms in Russia are not being carried out.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said he had thrashed out a
conditional agreement with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier. It
follows months of gruelling and often acrimonious negotiations.
Mr Camdessus said the Russian government and central bank must sign a
memorandum with the IMF committing Russia to tight monetary policies. The
memorandum - 'the thrust and detail of Russian economic policy for 1994' -
should be ready in a week.
The Russian government must follow through its pledges by signing
appropriate measures, notably covering the raising of revenue, and by
proposing any necessary legislation to parliament. But the IMF does not
appear to be insisting that legislation must be passed by parliament before
the Fund will give its formal agreement to the loan.
Mr Camdessus said 'all the measures requiring government signature are now
in place and we expect them to be done in the next few days and weeks'. Once
he was satisfied they were in place, he would recommend to the IMF board
that the Dollars 1.5bn be handed over.
The IMF would then continue talks with the government on provision of a
further stand-by loan of Dollars 4bn. This loan would probably not be paid
until next year.
News of the IMF loan deal came as allegations of a coup plot against Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, and of his failing health, were being vehemently
denied.
Mr Chernomyrdin missed a meeting with Mr Camdessus on Monday to fly to the
Black Sea resort of Sochi for unscheduled talks with Mr Yeltsin. The trip
coincided with allegations that a group of highly placed officials had been
preparing to strip Mr Yeltsin of power and name Mr Chernomyrdin as leader.
As he left Sochi yesterday morning, Mr Chernomyrdin said: 'Somebody is
interested in destabilising the situation.'
The Dollars 1.5bn IMF loan would be the second tranche of Dollars 3bn to
which Russia is entitled under the so-called Systemic Transformation
Facility, set up with loose conditions to help former communist countries
remake their economies. The IMF released the first Dollars 1.5bn tranche
last June.
Members of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, especially the
US, have at times urged the IMF to be less particular in applying conditions
on the Russian loans.

FT  23 MAR 94 / IMF gives go-ahead for Dollars 1.5bn loan to Russia: Last
minute reprieve will boost economic reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has approved a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn)
loan to help shore up Russia's economic reform after hurried talks between
Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF
managing director, in Moscow last night.
The last minute reprieve for the beleaguered Russian government came just
before Mr Camdessus was due to leave Moscow after five days tense
negotiations which had threatened to fail.
Agreement on the vital loan also helped restore some confidence in the
government as it tried for most of the day to fend off persistent
allegations that a coup plot against President Boris Yeltsin had been
uncovered over the weekend.
'Everything's been agreed,' Mr Chernomyrdin said on leaving a meeting with
Mr Camdessus. He did not say what, if any, conditions the IMF would attach
to the loan but said a memorandum would be signed later last night.
Mr Camdessus had voiced concern about rising Russian inflation that totalled
about 950 per cent for 1993.
The IMF had already lent Russia Dollars 2.5bn, but held off extending the
country more credit until Moscow showed it was serious about reforming and
stabilising its shaky economy.
IMF officials had questioned whether 1994 budget projections were realistic
and still worry that Moscow could could deliver the tough spending curbs it
promised. The Russians are understood to have told the Fund they will be
able to wrestle inflation down to 7 per cent a month by the end of the year.
News of the loan agreement came as allegations of a coup plot against Mr
Yeltsin and of his own failing health were being denied across the country's
political spectrum.
Mr Chernomyrdin said speculation on Mr Yeltsin's health was 'insulting'.
According to Mr Yeltsin's press service, the Russian president has been
officially sick for more than four weeks this year, and is still
recuperating.
Mr Chernomyrdin missed a meeting with Mr Camdessus on Monday to fly to the
Black Sea resort of Sochi for unscheduled talks with Mr Yeltsin in the midst
of a furore of allegations that a group of highly placed officials had
prepared to strip Mr Yeltsin of power and name Mr Chernomyrdin as leader of
the country.
The alleged ringleader of the plot, Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy
prime minister, has called in the state prosecutor to investigate the basis
of the report, published over the weekend in the liberal Obshchaya Gazeta
daily.
According to the official news agency Tass, Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Yeltsin
spent their time together discussing the Russian budget, relations with
Georgia and 'other economic and political issues'. As he left Sochi
yesterday morning, Mr Chernomyrdin said: 'somebody is interested in
destabilising the situation.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government faces a delicate task in the rescue of Credit
Lyonnais. It must not alienate outside investors to the point where
privatisation becomes impossible. Equally it must not show so much
favouritism that it upsets the rest of the French banking community. So far
few details have emerged, though it is clear that tomorrow's deal will
involve the transfer of non-performing property loans to a shell company.
Precedent suggests this is one way of limiting the immediate bad debt
provision - and therefore the capital injection from the government - but
there is a cost in the form of future income forgone.
If it follows the established pattern, Credit Lyonnais would lend the shell
company enough to buy both the bad debt at its value after provisions and
sufficient zero coupon bonds to finance eventual repayment of the borrowing.
But Credit Lyonnais would not receive interest on its loan to the shell
company. Since debt transfers to the shall company could exceed 2 per cent
of its loan book, that implies a drag on net interest income for years.
Credit Lyonnais would thus find it harder in the recovery to reach the
absolute levels of profitability established by other French banks. But its
own recovery will be more pronounced simply because its provisions have been
higher. And since the bank is trading at a 25 per cent discount to stated
1992 net assets, the market has priced in the risks.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Greenspan ups interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Central banking is an art, not a science. In a country with a floating
exchange rate and little faith in monetary targeting, it is an exceptionally
difficult art at that. It is one that Mr Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve
has practised adeptly in recent years. But events this year suggest it may
be losing its sureness of touch.
The case for raising short-term interest rates once more had become very
strong. Economic data since the surprise announcement, in early February, of
a quarter of a percentage point increase have underlined the strength of the
US economy.
Revised figures have shown the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per
cent in the last quarter of 1993, rather than the 5.9 per cent first
reported. Retail spending is robust. Industrial production appears to be
growing at an annual rate of 7-8 per cent this quarter, while the jobless
rate, at 6.5 per cent, is already quite low.
In addition, monetary policy has remained expansionary. The short rate of
interest has been less than half the long rate; the absolute gap between the
two has been more than 3 1/2 percentage points; and the short-term real rate
of interest has been barely positive.
Finally, the bond market decline since the last rate increase indicates
anxieties about inflation that the Federal Reserve has failed to still. A
prudent central bank, worried about its reputation and, indeed, about the
sustainability of the recovery, would want to push bond rates down once
more.
The question then is not whether the Federal Reserve should have raised its
rates, but rather by how much. What Mr Greenspan said yesterday was merely
that the central bank would tighten reserves, an action that then increased
the federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent. In its manner and its matter, this
was the very least he could have done, particularly after last Friday's
surprise meeting with President Bill Clinton, which was bound to renew
doubts about the independence of the Federal Reserve.
Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve may not have done enough. Monetary policy
remains expansionary, while markets will still be waiting for Mr Greenspan's
next shoe to fall. It might have been wiser to put interest rates at a more
obviously 'neutral' level immediately.
If rates were 4 per cent or more, nobody would expect them to rise in the
near future and few would doubt that Mr Greenspan had already done enough.
Sometimes central banks do indeed have to feel their way. But the US in
early 1994 may need more decisive treatment.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Ukraine votes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Ukraine has not yet died,' is the apt title of the Ukrainian national
anthem. As Ukrainian voters prepare for parliamentary elections on Sunday,
their nation's existence is as imperilled as ever. The elections give
Ukrainians a chance, perhaps the last, to set their political house in
order.
Optimists dream that Sunday's elections could oust Kiev's ex-communist
leadership and bring in a new guard better equipped to introduce market
reforms. The new people who might be able to lead Ukraine to the market at
last could be businessmen and factory directors from Russian-oriented
eastern Ukraine, or they might be reformist nationalist politicians from the
western and central regions of the country.
Unfortunately, these dreams are likely to remain just that. Since reform
candidates have been unable to form a single bloc, the reform vote is likely
to split, giving the victory to ex-communists. An even greater danger is
that the Sunday elections will further confuse Ukraine's already muddled
political scene.
On average, eight candidates are running in each constituency, while
Ukrainian law requires 50 per cent voter turn-out to elect a member of
parliament. An extreme possibility is that these stringent requirements will
make it impossible for voters to elect a viable parliament. Mr Kravchuk has
hinted that he would then introduce direct presidential rule, a dream for
him, but a nightmare for Ukrainians who live with the hyperinflation he has
created. More likely, the elections will produce an amorphous new
parliament, although many constituencies will first require run-off
elections between the two leading candidates. The legislature might be more
paralysed than its predecessor, which at least has a working
national-communist majority.
In any case, the new legislature will face the same political obstacle to
radical reform as the present one. Politicians fear that such reforms would
initially cause the worst pain in the Russified Donbass region. Thus the
right economic medicine would endanger Ukraine's fragile statehood.
All of this is bad news for the west, which is coming to view Ukraine as a
bulwark against Moscow's expansionism, particularly now that Russia is
taking a harder line toward the 'near abroad'. Ukraine needs political and
economic support if Russia is to be discouraged from provoking a potentially
devastating conflict with its important neighbour. Unfortunately, the
Ukrainian government is unable to use economic help constructively. Worse,
the elections are unlikely to change this unhappy situation.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Secure pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The debate over minimum solvency requirements for British pension schemes
may appear arcane, but it goes to the heart of the issue addressed by the
Goode Committee on pension law reform. How do you protect the promise
contained in the typical pension scheme trust deed to pay a given level of
pension benefit?
Setting aside money in advance from which to meet pension liabilities - in a
word, funding - provides security for present and future pensioners in the
event of the employer running into financial difficulty. The problem is to
define how much to set aside and, more specifically, to establish a minimum
solvency standard to ensure adequate protection. It is now clear that the
government is likely to reject the Goode Committee's approach to calculating
minimum solvency in favour of a watered down version developed by the
actuarial profession.
The case for compromise rests on the difficulties that could be faced by
companies and funds that are obliged to establish a new base level of
funding under the legislation that will follow Goode's recommendations. In
present UK law, there are no solvency requirements; the assets and
liabilities of most earnings related pension schemes are valued on an
ongoing basis. This requires assumptions to be made about future benefits
and about the current value of future income streams. In effect the
actuaries ignore stock market values and take a longer term view. This has
permitted the average fund to invest up to 80 per cent in equities, despite
a presumed higher risk relative to the government's gilt-edged stock. Higher
returns have thus been earned than on portfolios more heavily biased towards
gilts.
If, on the other hand, a fund is valued on the assumption that it is to be
wound up immediately - the so-called discontinuance basis - there is no
escape from applying stock market values in working out whether the scheme
can meet past service liabilities. These are valued on the basis of
calculating what it would cost to buy a deferred annuity from an insurance
company.
Until recently a valuation on an ongoing basis would usually produce a
bigger surplus than on a discontinuance basis. But benefit improvements have
eroded the margin. Meantime the gap between the returns expected on an
equity portfolio compared with the gilt returns which dictate insurers'
annuity rates has widened. So many schemes that are well funded on an
ongoing basis may be under-funded on the discontinuance basis.
The actuaries' proposed compromise involves valuing liabilities on a mixture
of the two bases. Equity-type returns will be assumed in valuing the rights
of younger members of a pension fund, while a shift will be made to a
gilts-based valuation for older members and current pensioners. But this
could lead to members receiving less than the accrued benefits promised to
them on winding up. This is better than no solvency standard. But it looks a
less than satisfactory outcome. Yet, as in the discussion over the ownership
of pension fund surpluses, the bargaining chips are all in the hands of the
employers. If the minimum solvency standard looks onerous, they will abandon
defined benefit schemes and opt for defined contributions.
That implies greater uncertainty about the value of pension benefits. And
since funds would be obliged to adopt lower risk investment strategies,
investment returns would be less in the aggregate. But there would be no
contribution holidays and far more transparency. As always in pensions, it
boils down to a search for the least bad alternative.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Personal View: Rail privatisation's difficult journey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HEATH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On April 1, British Rail is to be split asunder. A radical re-structuring of
passenger and freight services, track and rolling stock provision and a
variety of other services and maintenance activities will form the prelude
to the government's ultimate goal of privatisation. Will it work, or will it
turn out to be an April Fool?
At first sight the changes next month are a cleverly contrived continuation
of the fundamental organisational changes introduced in April 1982 and April
1992. The 27 profit centres set up two years ago will become the basis of 30
(25 passenger train operating units and five freight) separate businesses
for franchising. There will be more private sector involvement in management
and private risk capital will be introduced. Additionally, the 'internal
market', whereby the profit centres sell services to each other, will be
extended.
The 1992 changes gave the managing director of each passenger railway
business - InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional Railways - direct
control of their own infrastructure and supply of train services. A separate
Central Services organisation was also established, selling services to the
individual railway businesses in an internal market. Benefits have begun to
show; for example, staff numbers on the Gatwick Express have fallen by 25
per cent since April 1992, assets are being used more intensively and
marketing initiatives introduced.
But there are problems with the new proposals. The first is psychological.
The business managing directors, before they took direct control in 1992,
could not influence the production of railway services sufficiently to
achieve what their marketing studies showed passengers wanted. The present
changes are being imposed against strong opposition from experienced railway
managers. Moreover, the reorganisation is too soon after that of April 1992,
which involved a huge effort.
Another problem is operational. Great concern has been expressed about the
split in ownership and control between Railtrack (which assumes
responsibility for stations, track, signalling, timetabling, operating
control and safety) as an intermediate supplier and the train operating
units as train service producers. A railway is above all a systems business,
in which all the principal activities are interlocked.
Moreover, passengers are part of the production process. Unlike Marks and
Spencer, or even a 'just in time' supply of components for manufacture, any
accident, mismatch or misunderstanding between the suppliers and producers
will immediately affect them.
The greatest problem is economic. The Pounds 100m or so InterCity annual
profit will be turned into a loss because of infrastructure and rolling
stock leasing charges, and subsidy will be required. Even the Pounds 10m
profit for the coveted Gatwick Express will be extin-guished.
These seemingly high costs arise because the infrastructure capital value
was put at Pounds 6.5bn and the Treasury imposed a 5.6 per cent required
rate of return, increasing to 8 per cent. Additionally, bureaucracy and
transaction costs of the new system will be high, and safety controls will
be more expensive and complex than the present 'safety validation'
procedures.
Moreover, railway revenues tend to track fluctuations in gross domestic
product. In a downturn, unless train services can be cut (and remember
Railtrack decides the timetable) and rolling stock handed back, franchisee
profits may disappear. Private sector franchisees will only be interested if
they can see where the profits will come from. Costs in the train operating
units are already being cut. More cost savings and revenue improvements are
in the pipeline. So what leverage will be left for the private sector with
franchisees controlling only some 20 to 25 per cent of total cost due to
infrastructure and leasing charges? Subsidies may be granted, but they are
politically vulnerable (and the government's contribution is planned to be
cut by two-thirds by 1996-97 anyway).
The benefits are that the train operating units will be much smaller
businesses than the present ones, with greater freedom for innovation. Staff
can be more closely involved and costs will be more exposed. Even so, the
scope for substantial profit improvement by private franchisees is
narrowing.
Perhaps the most likely outcome is that BR will continue to be the
predominant owners, with their staff as management franchisees at the heart
of the railway system and the private sector round the periphery. In these
circumstances the Railtrack monopoly will be forced to bow to their demands.

Has the City, in succumbing to the lure of Oriental expertise in the
boardroom, been stealing a march on British industry? Or is it unduly
beguiled by eastern promise?
London's oldest merchant bank, Barings, has been endeavouring to brush up
its global street cred and, in addition to Credit Lyonnais boss Jean
Peyrelevade, has now opened its hallowed portals to Yoshihiko Miyauchi,
president of Japan's largest leasing company Orix, in a non-executive
capacity.
Last year Foreign &amp; Colonial put a former ambassador to Britain on the board
of one of its Pacific trusts and Barclays has a Japanese banker. Outside the
Square Mile there has been little such activity.
Deputy chairman Andrew Tuckey says he ran into Miyauchi on his first visit
to Japan 25 years ago when he was personal assistant to the chairman of what
was then Orient Leasing. As part of the Sanwa Bank group, with which Barings
set up a joint venture, the company was a natural port of call for the
Brits.
Tuckey, who describes a visit to the Orix Blue Wave baseball team as 'a
pleasure probably still to come', sees in Miyauchi a man with 'long exposure
to western business'.
There is no telling yet whether these sorts of relationship can really be
put to work. As well as being impressed by his connections in Tokyo,
Barings, with its emerging markets ambitions, thinks the new addition can
provide 'the Oriental perspective on China and throughout south-east Asia',
as Tuckey phrases it. Big area, tall order.

King Coal has been a long time dying; but now he really has passed away it
seems. A provisional death certificate appears on Thursday, in the form of a
book of photographs published by the Royal Commission on the Historical
Monuments of England.
The project began before British Coal's announcement in October 1992 that 31
of its remaining 50 active mines were to be closed; now just 17 remain. The
Commission's photographers, backed by archaeologists and industrial
surveyors, toured every English coalfield, recording all aspects of the
industry.
Images of Industry: Coal, will be launched at the Yorkshire Mining Museum in
Wakefield. 'The complete set of images, backed by research notes, will
become part of the National Monuments Record, where they can be consulted by
the public.' RIP.

He couldn't even muster an auf Wiedersehen. Wolfgang Hilger, dour chairman
of the Hoechst chemicals group, yesterday growled his way through his last
annual press conference in traditionally lugubrious style, only to break
with custom at the close.
While retiring German bosses are supposed to lighten up, bury the hatchet
with the hacks, and even crack the odd joke about having had tough but fair
treat-ment, Hilger was not in the mood.
Since early last year, when his lofty, technocratic response to his
company's plants' alarming tendency to leak, burn and even explode earned
Hilger a roasting, the chemistry between him and the media has been severely
awry.
A formal farewell from the floor, typically offered up on these occasions by
a venerable journalist whose career has run in - distant - parallel with the
retiring boss, also failed to materialise.
If Hilger noticed that the pack restricted itself to a single question about
yet another explosion, last Friday, which wrecked a refrigerant plant, and
once again obliged the police to tour the streets warning local residents to
close their windows and stay indoors, he did not show it.
Anyone interested could pick up a press release on the way out, but
otherwise he had nothing to add, he said.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Elections may not bridge that gap: Robert Graham examines
the divide between Italy's industrialised north and a south dependent on
state aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The saga of the Gioia Tauro steelworks in southern Italy is a sorry tale
about broken promises, ill-conceived ideas, wasted money and cynical
politicians.
It epitomises the failure of state-sponsored development to bridge the
divide between a rich, industrious north and central Italy and the world
that exists south of Rome.
Gioia Tauro is also a timely reminder, as Italy goes to the polls on Sunday,
that the political and economic problems of the south are likely to become
more complex after the elections. Here the old political order has not been
swept away, unemployment is three times greater than in the north and large
areas are in the grip of organised crime - not least at Gioia Tauro, where
the Calabrian mafia, the 'ndrangheta, moved in on the back of public works
contracts for a steel complex.
Twenty-five years ago Gioia Tauro was the most fertile coastal plain in the
region, rich with citrus and graced by ancient olive trees. Against
technical advice it was selected over 11 other potential sites as the
location for Italy's fifth integrated steel works.
Gioia Tauro lacked a port, good roads, easy access to rail links, had no
tradition of industry and was in a zone with a high risk of earthquakes.
These drawbacks were, however, outweighed by the needs of the ruling
Christian Democrat and Socialist party bosses. The steel project was
presented as the key to industrialising Calabria, the most backward southern
region.
The steelworks was never built. The 1973 oil shock cut world demand for
steel and the project became redundant. But it was only aborted after the
infrastructure had been laid. The plant was conceived on the grandest scale
imaginable to inflate the contracting business. The centrepiece was the
largest artificial port in the Mediterranean with 5km of wharves.
The port is still unused 15 years after completion. With luck it might
become a container terminal. Elsewhere on the site, fly-overs vanish into
weeds.
The nearby industrial zone is vacant save for one state-owned factory. Three
hundred jobs were promised in a venture by the arms manufacturer, Oto-Breda,
to produce a new Nato missile. By the time the plant was finished in the
early 1980s, the missile had been superceded. Oto-Breda's owner, the state
industrial holding, Efim, was placed in liquidation in 1992 and the plant is
up for sale.
For the past 12 years, successive governments have backed plans to make good
some of this waste by allowing Enel, the state electricity authority, to
build a power station.
This was blocked by environmental objections. When this hurdle was overcome,
the state had to contend with the Calabrian mafia.
In 1990 magistrates froze all construction contracts on suspicion that the
construction companies were 'nadrangheta fronts in an area where some 60
'ndrangheta families operate. The magistrates' investigations led in January
to 39 arrest warrants on corruption charges related to the contract,
including the Enel chairman.
Violent protests, meanwhile, by the jobless in Gioia Tauro forced the Ciampi
government last autumn to sanction a new start on the power station. This
was seen locally as a move to buy stability in the run-up to the elections.
Today, few believe the project will be completed because of environmental
protests, plans for Enel's privatisation, and the difficulty of ensuring
against mafia involvement.
What has happened at Gioia Tauro is a microcosm of what has been repeated in
different degrees across the south. With a third of Italy's population, it
was treated as a vital reservoir of votes by the Christian Democrats during
the postwar era to hold the Communist party at bay. It suited politicians to
create a culture of dependence - or assistenzialismo.
Transfers to the south from the central government have on average accounted
for about 60 per cent of gross domestic product since the 1950s. Income
support, direct and indirect from the state, makes up 49 per cent of the
south's GDP. According to Bank of Italy data, four-fifths of Italy's total
public deficit is attributable to the south - the centre and north shows a
surplus. The south absorbs 53 per cent of all public spending.
Initially, the south accepted this as needed assistance, but it became an
institutional habit of dependence. If the state (controlled by the local
political parties) did not provide jobs in the south, then it offered
unemployment subsidies or fake disability pensions or easy early retirement
deals. The state also agreed with the unions to maintain a national minimum
wage, even though productivity was often 20 per cent lower in the south.
Where this safety net failed, the illicit economy controlled by organised
crime helped out with income from contraband cigarettes, drugs, extortion,
racketeering, usury. Until Rome politics was shaken two years ago by
corruption scandals it suited the ruling parties to be tolerant of organised
crime: in Sicily, Calabria and the Naples area the mafia delivered votes.
The business success stories in southern Italy have been in areas close to
Rome or where the grip of organised crime is slight, as in Puglia. It is no
accident that Fiat opted to site its flagship car plant near rural Melfi in
Basilicata, central southern Italy: the area is free of mafia links. Fiat
has also been able to break away from the traditional labour market
rigidities and introduce new working practices. No state industry would dare
contemplate this, and smaller private investors lack the muscle to force
such deals through.
But the Melfi project, producing the Punto model launched last year, would
also have been impossible without the commitment of L1,400bn in state aid.
This is probably the last such act of state generosity to a private group.
Not only is Brussels on the war-path against subsidies, unions in the north
do not see why new jobs should be funded in the south when they need to
protect existing ones in Turin.
The more general debate on bankrolling the south has become central to the
political platform of the populist Northern League. The league's appeal has
evolved in good measure from the way its leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, has
articulated the frustrations of hard-working northerners, who pay taxes to a
government in Rome that squanders the money on ill-monitored transfers to
the south.
Despite these genuine objections, it is hard to see agreement on introducing
a fresh approach to the problems of the south. The league wants to cut
assistenzialismo but has no base in the south. Its allies in this election
campaign are media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement and the
neo-fascist MSI; and Mr Berlusconi is relying on the MSI structure to
deliver the votes. Both are promising more jobs and more public works
projects in the south.
The left's Progressive Alliance is also committed to the principle of
national solidarity, with the better-off regions helping the poorer, and
would not stop the flow of money to the south. As for the discredited ruling
parties in the centre, which have either recycled their candidates or picked
from similar figures whose careers have been based on patronage, they have
no interest in turning off the tap.
None of the parties looks as if it has the will and ability to combine
spending cuts with creating the conditions necessary to introduce the market
economy that operates in the rest of Italy. Budget constraints will play a
considerable part in weaning the south off state hand-outs. But this will
merely increase the income gap between the north and the south and push the
'Mezzogiorno' back to the peripheral role it played when the first republic
began after the war.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Euro-fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To the untutored eye, the effort to combat fraud against the European Union
budget can seem an elaborate and unproductive ritual. Every year, the EU
Court of Auditors chronicles waste and chicanery in the spending of official
funds and urges the European Commission to sharpen its controls. Every year,
the Commission promises to crack down and recoup missing money. Meanwhile,
large-scale abuse of the budget - especially of farm subsidies - continues
unabated.
This view may be a caricature, but it is sufficiently well established in
the minds of European citizens to have become a blot on the EU's
credibility. As pressure on the budget grows and the dismantling of borders
within the Union provides increased opportunities for fraud, the problem can
only intensify. More clearly needs to be done to tighten monitoring of the
effectiveness with which taxpayers' money is spent.
Fortunately, there are signs that the Commission and at least some member
states are showing greater attentiveness to the issue. This week, Mr Peter
Schmidhuber, EU budget commissioner, will unveil plans to step up the fight
against fraud, with additional Commission staff devoted to the task,
improved procedures for co-operation with national judicial and police
authorities, and more extensive sanctions against wrongdoers. Separately,
the British government will today put forward its own ideas, including a
proposal that fraud against the EU budget be made a criminal offence across
the Union, as is fraud against national budgets.
These are steps in the right direction, but they do not demonstrate that the
Union is treating the issue with quite the seriousness it deserves. It is
far from sure that the Council of Ministers will unanimously back the
British initiative. Nor can member governments be counted on to give the
Commission the assistance it needs, especially when it comes to extending
scrutiny from the agricultural budget to structural funds, often, perhaps
unfairly, criticised for fostering corruption in the Union's poorer regions.
Moreover, the suspicion persists that the Commission is running behind the
issue rather than giving a lead. This week it has come in for withering
criticism from the EU auditors for restricting their inquiries and behaving
as if particular problems were isolated 'accidents'. It should be clear by
now that various EU programmes offer opportunities for systematic fraud. The
Commission can set an example in combating it by showing more systematic
transparency to those with the job of monitoring its activities.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Thirsty for a potion: The Hungarian parliament yesterday
voted to apply for EU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wave after wave of applicant countries comes crashing on to the shores of
the European Union. The European Free Trade Association wave has just
broken, but behind it the central European wave already looms high and
menacing.
Mr Peter Boross, the Hungarian prime minister, faces a general election on
May 8. No one in Budapest doubts that his desire to file an EU membership
application in April is closely related to this fact.
Mr Boross's conservative nationalist party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum,
which has governed Hungary for the last four years, is struggling to climb
back from fourth place in recent opinion polls, which give the socialist
(formerly communist) party a commanding lead.
Economically, Hungary's recovery from post-communist depression has begun:
industrial production grew by four per cent in 1993, after falling steeply
in each of the three previous years. But GDP still registered a slight drop,
thanks to a collapse in agricultural output; and there is a long way to go
to get back to 1989 levels.
Most Hungarians compare their present circumstances unfavourably with those
they enjoyed under 'goulash communism' in the 1980s, even though few imagine
that it is possible to go back to that phase, during which a totalitarian
system was being gradually and hesitantly relaxed. The socialists themselves
accept that the transition to market-driven capitalism is now irreversible.
But they offer to manage the transition better and to protect the weak
against its worst effects. Such promises may be worthless, but many voters
want to believe them, or at least to see what a change of government will
bring. Mr Boross's only hope of winning back his party's supporters lies in
convincing them that the long-term strategy of his predecessor Jozsef Antall
(who died in December) is still on track. That strategy aimed to make
Hungary a fully western country, a member of the EU and Nato, by the end of
the century.
On Nato, the government is making the best of the half-success achieved at
the summit in January, when Nato promised to admit new members in the future
but avoided saying who or when. On the EU the position is slightly clearer,
since last June's Copenhagen summit explicitly offered the prospect of full
membership to those central and east European countries that have
association agreements.
Since February, Hungary has such an agreement fully in force. Filing a
membership application now will probably not affect the final outcome, or
even the timetable of negotiations, which will be determined by arguments
among the EU's existing members; but symbolically it will be an important
milestone on the road.
Opposition parties are irritated by the government's willingness to exploit
this symbolism for electoral purposes, but none of them would dream of
opposing the strategy. There is an all-party consensus on EU membership, but
few Hungarians of any party seem to have thought out the full implications,
or to have followed the arguments within the EU about the direction it
should take. Federal or confederal, deep or shallow: it makes no difference.
Hungary must be in.
An economic rationale for this attitude can be given: as a small country on
the edge of a large economic bloc, Hungary needs to be inside rather than
outside. But it is clear that that is not the main reason. What Hungarians
want above all is security.
Security from what? Russia? From their more immediate neighbours? From
themselves? Put any of these threats to them in specific terms and they will
tend to play it down. The Russian threat is in the background, but for
Hungary, much more than for Poland, it is now reasonably remote. The
suggestion that Hungary could be drawn into Balkan conflicts, by concern for
the Hungarian minorities in Serbia and Romania, is indignantly rejected; as
is any questioning of the stability or permanence of Hungary's internal
democracy.
All these are spectres which haunt the Hungarian soul in the dark hours of
night, even though in daylight they may seem far-fetched (and anyway they
should be kept out of sight for fear of scaring off investors). Or rather
they are different shapes assumed by a single, more permanent spectre that
lurks just below the surface of Hungary's collective psyche - a spectre
called 'the tragic past'; a history of war, defeat and conquest punctuated
by brief moments of glory.
That of course is something Hungary has in common with the rest of central
Europe, indeed with Europe as a whole. But it is something western Europe is
seen as having escaped from since 1945 - give or take a few nasty local
exceptions like Northern Ireland.
If western Europe has escaped, central Europeans tend to assume that it must
have done so by taking magic potions. A range of bottles is on show in the
west European pharmacist's window, and central Europe is determined to try
them all. Some, labelled Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe,
Council of Europe, North Atlantic Co-operation Council, it has already
swallowed. They taste disappointingly bland, and the latest to be pushed
across the counter at Nato's January summit, labelled 'Partnership for
Peace', smells rather similar.
But there are two bottles in the back of the shop, with very high price
tags, which the chemist seems curiously reluctant to dispense. One is Nato,
and the other has just been re-labelled 'EU'. They, surely, contain the real
stuff. At any rate, central Europeans will not be content until they have
tried them out.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sacrificed on the altar of Europhobia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D A A FAGANDINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, What I have not heard or read about regarding EU enlargement is the
unspoken perception in Europe that, if Britain were to succeed in holding
the blocking vote at 23, it would later insist that an unalterable precedent
had been created when others came to join. Four such applications are in
prospect, so Britain would thereby have transformed the EU into a virtual
free trade area, an outcome our partners know is the present government's
real aim when it speaks of being at the heart of Europe. In that sense, we
are a spear that will have to be deflected.
We may just be able to delay matters until 1996, but at vast cost in
credibility. Whatever happens, we will eventually be forced to have a
referendum to determine our future one way or the other. Until we do so, we
will have sacrificed what influence we have at present on the altar of
Europhobia and be unable to defend any of our real interests.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Language of television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOHN PARRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Dunkley (Television: March 2) bemoans the fact that his
satellite/cable equipped viewers do not have anything to watch. Perhaps this
is because the selection offered to them is so feeble.
Here in Geneva we are cabled and I have 34 channels in seven languages.
Agreed, much of it is of mind-boggling tedium; I can only take so much of
HTV for example.
But if one continues to zap around, one can find some fascinating programmes
even if one's command of the language is shaky.
The German channels, denigrated by Mr Dunkley, have excellent documentaries
in the evenings. Tiring of the interminable ice hockey on all three Swiss
channels the other night, I flipped to a German channel and found a
fascinating 45-minute documentary on the fall of East Germany which taught
me a lot that I did not know. The same channel a year or so ago had a
touching report on the Volga Germans who yearn to go 'home' but can't.
Of course, one has to speak more than one language to appreciate all this,
and I assume Mr Dunkley is telling us that his monolingual viewers can't
handle anything other than English. In that case, they are missing a lot of
good TV. But then that's all to do with the British education system, isn't
it? And that's another subject.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Treasury - masterminding the UK's
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So we are told that an influential committee of MPs is recommending
that the Post Office should be free to raise money outside the public sector
borrowing requirement to help it compete ('MPs urge more access to funds for
Post Office', March 18). At the same time the Cabinet is reportedly
deadlocked on a leasing deal that would provide London Transport's Northern
Line with badly needed new rolling stock, with the chief secretary insisting
that it would be a flagrant breach of public borrowing rules. We hear also
the armed services are considering leasing vehicles in order to save money,
although doubtless the rules will be broken.
I thought the Ryrie rules were dead, and that the prime minister, when in a
previous post, claimed to have done away with many of the restrictions that
blur public/private sector investment decision-making to the country's
disadvantage.
Or do we have to wait for Sir Alastair Morton's committee to come up with
miracles?
No, the truth of the matter is that even if they do produce some good ideas
Treasury orthodoxy will see them off. Even were there are good
infrastructure projects that earn a decent rate of return they fail to go
forward because of the dear old public sector borrowing requirement, and our
inexorable decline goes on, masterminded by the Treasury. And these are the
guys who got us into and out of the exchange rate mechanism, achieving the
proud feat of bad timing on both occasions, and who have consistently
mis-managed interest rates and exchange rates in both good times and bad.
I would like to support Sir John Banham's reported view that the Treasury
should be abolished as part of a drive to re-focus policy making ('Banham
calls for Treasury abolition', March 21).

FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unclear trend on shorter working
hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAN CORRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the short term it does seem as though the increase in part-time work
occurring in the British economy is such that average hours worked per week
are falling ('In, out, share the work about', March 15). This fairer
distribution of available work is surely to be welcomed whatever other
qualms one might have about the economy's inability to produce enough
person-hours of work in total.
The question is, however, whether the mere existence of a more flexible
labour market will mean that this trend continues as David Goodhart suggests
it will. The labour market has become more deregulated since 1979, yet
analysis in New Economy has shown that over this period average working
hours have actually increased - in stark contrast to the trend of the last
100 years or so. Certainly there have been more part-timers over this period
but there have also been more self-employed (who tend to work longer) and
also the manager and professional class have been working longer, generally
unpaid, extra hours.
We do not really understand this latter phenomenon. It may be employers
demanding more effort or it may be an increased incentive to get promotion
due to the increased monetary rewards and the hedge this gives against the
growing insecurity of any job.
Until we understand this, it will be difficult to say whether the new
deregulated labour market will of its own accord share out the work better
or whether more positive action will be needed.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: On time - but only if you move the
goal posts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW W N BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As William Waldegrave (Personal View, March 17) should know, there are
lies, damned lies, statistics and white lies.
The passenger's charter of which he is so proud falls into the latter
category. InterCity, with which I estimate I have travelled 300,000 miles in
the last six years, has achieved its targets only by moving the goal posts.
Whereas six years ago the journey time between Newark and London averaged
less than 85 minutes, it is now almost 95 minutes on the new 'faster'
trains. These increases coincided with the imposition of the charter.
Regular commuters now smile when BR tells us we are arriving two minutes
early. Six years ago this would have been eight minutes late.
Mr Waldegrave's glass may be half full, but sadly he now drinks from a
pitcher instead of a pint glass.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Global expansion to cap it all: General Electric's
fast-growing financial services offshoot is looking to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A French vehicle fleet management company, an Austrian consumer finance
business, a Swedish computer leasing concern: piece by piece, GE Capital is
stitching together one of Europe's broadest financial groups.
All three acquisitions have been announced by the financial services
subsidiary of General Electric, the US industrial giant, since last summer.
GE Capital has also helped bail out GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing group,
taken a stake in a Monaco-based ship management business, and acquired
interests in other European financial sector concerns.
Its involvement in businesses such as car sales financing, leasing lorry
trailers and servicing other companies' mortgage portfolios has not made
headline news. It tends to buy small, picking up Dollars 200m of assets
here, Dollars 300m there. But if its record in the US is anything to go by,
GE Capital's competitors in the European financial services industry have
plenty to worry about.
Last week's Dollars 2.2bn bid in the US for Kemper, a financial services
group based in Chicago, threw a rare spotlight on the company's ambitions.
If it succeeds in forcing Kemper to accept its unwanted advances, GE Capital
will emerge as one of the biggest fund management groups in the US.
GE Capital's track record in recent years is envied by rivals. While other
industrial companies that ventured into financial services in the 1980s got
their fingers burnt, GE has thrived. The assets in its main financing
operations have doubled in the past four years, reaching Dollars 118bn at
the end of last year. That does not include the assets of a specialist
insurance operation and Kidder Peabody, the investment bank it owns.
GE Capital is one of the most consistently profitable companies in the US
financial sector. While the country's commercial banks were going through
problems with real estate and leveraged buy-outs in 1990 and 1991, GE
Capital barely flinched. The company was not totally immune from such
difficulties but a policy of not lending for new construction  - which
proved the riskiest form of real estate lending - kept it away from the
worst effects of the late-1980s building boom.
Its robust balance sheet also enabled it to shrug off the problems from
leveraged lending. From 18 per cent in 1988, its post-tax return on capital
edged down to 17 per cent in 1990, but has since climbed back steadily. Last
year, it was 18.5 per cent.
The result: while other financial businesses in the US shed assets, GE
Capital has been buying. It has spent Dollars 2bn or more a year on
acquisitions in each of the past three years, preferring to pick up
businesses being discarded by others. Last year's haul included the assets
of the credit card business of oil company Exxon, and the railcar leasing
business of Chrysler.
Real estate has become a particular focus of its acquisition policy.
Apparently believing that it is buying at the bottom of the market, GE
Capital has added to its mountain of property assets in recent months,
taking advantage of the fact that banks and insurance companies are still
cutting their involvement in the sector.
In the past year GE Capital has bought Dollars 1bn of property from First
Chicago bank and Dollars 1.1bn from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the
government agency responsible for selling the assets of failed savings and
loans institutions. It also took on Dollars 1.1bn of property when it bought
two annuity companies last year, GNA and United Pacific Life.
It is still buying property: GE Capital's latest target, Kemper, has Dollars
1.7bn of property on its books. Acquiring Kemper would also mark a renewed
interest by GE Capital in the investment business. GE Capital's earlier
involvement in the sector proved disappointing. Kidder Peabody was a
loss-maker in the early-1990s, and was long rumoured to be one company that
GE would have been happy to sell. But, helped by the buoyancy of financial
markets, it made operating profits of Dollars 439m last year.
Last year, GE Capital made its first forays into the retirement savings
market, with the acquisition of an annuity business. It has also bought a
small mutual funds business, with Dollars 7bn of assets. The acquisition of
Kemper would build on this. Its Dollars 44bn of fund assets would put GE
among the 10 biggest mutual fund businesses in the US. If Kemper's life
insurance business, and GE's other fund management activities were added in,
GE would control Dollars 150bn of investments.
In Europe, GE Capital is at a much earlier stage of development. It made
some sizeable acquisitions in the 1990s, including the credit card
businesses of UK retailers Burton and House of Fraser and the vehicle fleet
services business of Avis Europe. But the spate of smaller purchases in
recent months indicates its intention to build on these interests.
With the European financial sector under recessionary pressures, the US
giant has been prowling for acquisitions: it is no coincidence that three of
its recent buys, announced last month, were the vehicle finance, computer
leasing and office equipment leasing companies of Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken, the troubled Scandinavian bank.
Europe is not the only focus of its interest, however: investments since
last summer include an automobile financing company in Thailand and a
vehicle fleet company in Canada.
In its adventures outside the US, GE Capital has three factors in its
favour:
First, it has access to a cheap supply of the basic raw material that drives
its business - cash. With a triple-A credit rating, GE Capital ranks among
the best-regarded borrowers in the capital markets (unlike banks, it does
not collect deposits to lend on to borrowers). The interest rate it paid on
its outstanding short-term debt at the end of last year was 3.39 per cent,
down from 3.57 per cent a year before. With short-term borrowings of Dollars
46bn, every hundredth of a percentage point counts.
Ironically, the more successful GE Capital becomes, the more its triple-A
rating could be at risk. The financial company relies on the backing of its
parent for its top rating. As GE Capital's profits become more important to
GE - last year they amounted to 40 per cent of the total - so the parent's
own rating becomes less robust.
'At what point does the tail start wagging the dog?' asks Mr Ray Miller of
Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency. 'That's something we're wrestling with
now.'
When it comes to buying financial assets, GE Capital's robust balance sheet
makes it one of the first on most sellers' lists. It could turn out to be
the only serious bidder for Kemper: while commercial banks have their sights
set on the mutual fund industry, few are likely to have the stomach for
Kemper's Dollars 1.5bn of under-performing real estate assets.
A second advantage, often commented upon, is the fact that GE Capital is not
a bank, and so does not suffer from the dead hand of banking regulation in
the US. In reality, this is much exaggerated. Banks also carry out their
credit card, leasing and consumer financing activities through non-bank
subsidiaries.
More significant is a third advantage: a management team with an
unparalleled reputation and record in its industry. Under Mr Gary Wendt, its
head for the past eight years, GE Capital has won a name for driving hard
bargains as a purchaser and for a fanatical attention to costs. Mr Wendt is
regarded in the industry as a close ally of Mr Jack Welch, chairman of
General Electric.
The financial services company shares the low-cost culture of the industrial
group of which it is a part. Its use of technology to reduce processing
costs and generate management information is also far in advance of the
banking industry, bemoans an executive in one of the biggest US banks.
'They think differently from us. They approach things differently,' the
executive says. It is a difference that European banks may be about to
discover.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: The Morris Minor of jazz - Garry Booth reviews Jimmy
Smith and his B3 Hammond organ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dated but lovable and reliable, it simply will not go away. Though it first
appeared over 40 years ago, the Hammond B3 organ's teeth-grating treble
sound is as popular with today's hip set as it was during the heyday of
greasy soul jazz. Given the other uses to which the instrument has been
applied - in gloomy cocktail lounges and brightly lit social clubs - it is a
wonder that every one has not been smashed up and buried in a secret place.
It is the Morris Minor of the jazz world and the reason there are still so
many on the road, held together by gaffer tape and nicotine, is that in the
right hands the Hammond can be made to swing like crazy. Few other
instruments, running on a mixture of gospel and blues, can transport a small
group to the heights a B3 can. Usually found in the company of an electric
guitar and drums (or tenor sax and drums) the Hammond driver can prod out
solos, or provide mounting excitement for other soloists to adorn, and all
the while moving things along with thick bass lines from the pedals. The
purists might even use an original Leslie speaker, a device whose spinning
reflector emphasises the already shrill vibrato. More often the original is
souped up by new technology - the young German player, Barbara Dennerlein,
heard at Dingwalls last week, makes the most of her deft left foot by using
a sampled double bass sound for the pedals.
It is unlikely that the Hammond would have got this far without the
attention of one man. Jimmy Smith single-handedly reinvented the Hammond
organ sound in the late 1950s with a series of jam session recordings for
the Blue Note label. Sizzling blues which wrung the lowdown best from horn
players like Lou Donaldson and Jackie Maclean were an instant success. Apart
from taking a wrong turning into pop-crossover in the latter part of the
1960s, Smith has been following that same, funky road since.
Seeing the youthful Smith seated behind the varnished facade of his B3 at
Dingwalls with a quartet of saxophones (Herman Riley), electric guitar
(Terry Evans) and drums (Jimmie Smith Jnr), the years roll back. The tunes
are almost irrelevant: it is the groove that is important to Smith, an
inveterate crowd pleaser. The preacher sends flurries of titillating notes
out from the right hand, a padding of droning chords from the left. His
guitarist, while not up to the kind of licks Kenny Burrell would spin from
the organist's chords, is suitably twangy and sings a passable 'Georgia';
Riley's upper register sax sound providing gritty solo parts, and jocular
conversation with the leader.
But on Monday Smith sometimes seemed too relaxed and verged dangerously
towards the cocktail lounge end of bland, tinkling improvisation. An
instinctive and competitive player, Smith always excels in tough company and
is capable of leading the best of jazz bluesmen. Hearing him in undemanding
company like this is still a joy - but what a pity Burrell cannot be prised
away from BB King for a reunion match.
Dingwalls, Camden Lock NW1 (071 267 1999) until Thursday March 24.

If you know any young people (and there seem to be lots) who are vague about
what, exactly, was so detestably inhuman about the Nazis, tell them to watch
today's Timewatch. Pawel Lozinski's documentary 'Birthplace' follows Henryk
Gryndberg as he returns to the village in Poland where he was born, and
moves from house to house trying to find some trace of his family or
information about how they died (8.00 BBC2).
It is followed by the last in the present series of Building Sights, USA.
Actor John Malkovich enthuses over the Chrysler Building which is easily the
most attractive in New York. At all times of the day or night, in all
conditions of light and weather, it is always exciting to catch sight of the
Chrysler down one of those urban canyons (8.45).
The Underworld shows how the middle class drug dealers of the 1960s have
been superseded by professional criminals (9.30 BBC1). One day perhaps
television will make a programme showing how the de-criminalisation of drugs
would, at one fell swoop, destroy most of the modern crime wave.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: The Case of Rebellious Susan - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a marvellous place the theatre must have been at the beginning of the
present century: Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Wilde, Shaw, Granville-Barker
bursting out all over. And so modern. Here were grown-up plays for grown-up
people: articulate and educated writers providing for an equally educated
audience. No doubt it was very middle class and possibly slightly earnest,
but it was theatre.
In Richmond the tradition continues. Even the revival of an almost forgotten
play - The Case of Rebellious Susan by Henry Arthur Jones - has the house
captivated almost throughout.
The piece has its faults. First performed at the Criterion in 1894, the text
was tampered with by the actor-director Charles Wyndham on the grounds that
the original might have been too shocking. In the version that has come down
to us, it is not quite clear whether Susan has committed adultery in Cairo
in order to show that what a husband can do a wife can do too. Her
disaffection may be all an elaborate pretence.
There are other ambiguities. Not all the motivations are intelligible. Who
was the only love of the divorce lawyer, Sir Richard Kato QC? Moreover, the
play ends on a note of sentimentality not wholly in line with what has gone
before. Perhaps Susan should have stuck to her rebellion.
Nevertheless, she puts up a good fight. So do some of the other women. Kato
has a young ward called Elaine Shrimpton. Her oratory leads to the storming
of the Clapham Post Office, fully reported in The Times. Admiral Darby, one
of the more unfaithful of the species, has a very forgiving wife,
significantly called Victoria. The house where the revolutionary Elaine
lives in south London is in Gladstone Road.
Clapham indeed comes in for a good deal of stick as being a boring,
conventional London suburb. This goes down extraordinarily well in front of
a Richmond audience.
One cavil. If you are going to revive a play like this, you must pay every
attention to detail. The set in the lovely, tiny Orange Tree theatre brings
it off. Yet some of the costumes do not quite fit. I cannot imagine that Sir
Richard Kato would wear a morning coat that looks as if it has been picked
up from Oxfam. Kirky, the footman, also looks a bit scruffy.
For the rest, however, this is a scintillating production directed by Auriol
Smith. Is it a comedy or a tragedy? In the course of the play Jones seeks to
answer the question himself: 'My comedy isn't a comedy at all. It's a
tragedy dressed up as a comedy.' That is about right. Sarah-Jane Fenton as
Susan becomes steadily more attractive as the piece goes on.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: Ageing into Variety - Antony Thorncroft finds
alternative comedian Paul Merton distancing himself from his television past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just like the good old days at the Palladium for the next week or so.
There is a comedian topping the bill, telling jokes, performing sketches,
getting involved in slapstick.
The fact that the jokes (Man: 'Got a copy of Psychic News? Shopkeeper: 'You
tell me'.) have the patina of history; the sketches (the blindfolded Great
Mystero just cannot conjure up a right answer for his feed) are of Victorian
vintage; and the slapstick (two men compete for the favours of a third
wearing a skimpy bikini) had them roaring at the Coliseum - in Rome - add to
the warm glow of communal memory.
The only thing slightly disturbing is that this is Paul Merton's show,
Merton the cynical, deadpan, alternative comedian.
Although Paul Merton rose to TV fame through stand-up routines in comedy
clubs, he has always been too laddish to be your typically PC-alternative
ranter. His audience is the lower middle class and it was out in force on
Monday, willing their boy on. He got there in the end, but it was a tough
battle.
Only in a protracted skit on Aladdin, with Merton somehow playing Buttons,
did the Palladium come to life. (Buttons 'I haven't got any friends'.
Audience; 'aaah'. Buttons - aggressively - 'Don't you patronise me').
Merton shares the stage with Lee Simpson and Richard Vranch. Perhaps it is
inevitable that the young Turks of comedy eventually age into variety stars,
but there is something dispiriting about watching Merton do monologues about
his school days, and Simpson and Vranch perform sketches honed in the music
halls.
What saves it, and makes for a mildly amusing evening, is Merton's aggrieved
innocence, put over with a professional precision and clarity. Many of the
one liners have his special mark on them - 'I disturbed a burglar last
night. I told him there was no God' - and when he does occasionally let rip
on the ad libs his famed stream-of-consciousness ravings show signs of
genius.
Paul Merton seems to be distancing himself from his television past - his
sparring partner on Have I Got News for You, Angus Deayton, bears the brunt
of a running joke (he is portrayed as a suspended suit), and Merton even has
a go at improvisation: 'if you can't be bothered to learn the words why do
it at all.'
But this very English, very traditional, evening hardly stretches his
talent.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: Enlightenment for all - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Did you see that excellent programme Modern Art about the Musee d'Orsay? Tim
Benton expressed the intriguing thought that the curators exhibited the
Impressionists but did not dare put out their big collection of 'pompier
art' - all that 19th century wedding cake stuff  - although they recognised
its historic importance, because they feared that people might think they
actually liked it.
And what about that documentary on the development of the bicycle, Design
Principles, which showed that some of the best designs have never been mass
produced because of bureaucratic rules about the definition of 'bicycle'?
Did you catch Ron Moody playing Aristotle, Galileo and Newton in that short
drama about the beginnings of physics, Newton's Revolution? Or see the
eye-opening programme Managing Schools which showed how the theory of
'collegiality' (oh dear) has led to committee mania with some teachers now
seeming to spend as much time referring up or down and making references
back as they spend in the classroom?
If the answer in each case is no, it is hardly surprising, because none of
those programmes was trendy or 'sexy' within television's special definition
(striking and appealingly fashionable). They were not made to win big
ratings and, since none of them appealed to the lowest common denominator,
they were not promoted by the BBC which screened them all. Indeed, the BBC
barely acknowledges their existence. They are all Open University
programmes, and consequently shown on BBC2, early in the morning or late at
night, coned off behind the OU logo.
Yet they are available to us all, and if you seek them out - loading the
video recorder each night with a three-hour tape timed to start at 6.15 in
the morning is the best way - you find yourself watching the sort of
television which you may have forgotten was possible. Television does not
have to come at you all the time like a fairground stall staffed by teenage
speed freaks. There is a calmness and an intelligence here which is
wonderfully refreshing.
Of course not all OU programmes are made to the same standard, or in the
same style, and, unless you are a true polymath, some will leave you
baffled. I stuck with Genetics - Beyond The Double Helix while they
explained how miles of DNA is coiled up neatly to get it inside a cell, but
when they began to assume that I knew the meaning of things such as 'X-ray
diffraction' I gave up. Pure Maths: Orthogonal Bases I deserted even faster
since I did not understand the symbols.
However, at the other end of the spectrum are programmes which are almost
indistinguishable from the more serious offerings in mainstream television.
Some, such as an episode in the Technology series billed as 'Eurekaargh]',
turn out to be literally indistinguishable: this was an old Horizon
programme about the exploitation of patents. Performing Art, which was
simply billed as the midnight programme on BBC2 on Tuesday last week without
any reference to the OU (probably sensible if the BBC wants to maximise its
audience) was an engrossing report on the huge success of the new Tate
Gallery in St Ives. True, it was more concerned with the creation and
organisation of the gallery than with the pictures on the walls, but it
could have stood up in any of television's arts slots. It was far more
interesting than much of the overwhelmingly metropolitan material on The
Late Show.
Filling the remarkably large central area between the bewilderingly
specialised and the universally appealling are many programmes which, while
slightly more pedagogic than we would expect these days from mainstream
television, are perfectly comprehensible to anyone with a reasonable
education. Many are on subjects which mainstream television either ignores
or treats only in a destructively reductionist manner.
Outstanding in my two-week sampling was the first in a series called
Lifestyles, Work And The Family which compared changing expectations and
social attitudes between two generations of doctors in one family and two
generations of steel workers in another. No doubt this would be considered
not punchy enough for television's normal current affairs series, yet in
terms of history, politics in the broadest sense, and sociology, it is
powerful stuff.
The episode 'It's A Lovely Day Tomorrow' in the series Science, Technology,
And Everyday Life was a startling reminder of the Pollyanna attitudes
towards scientific 'progress' in the first half of the 20th century. Best of
all, perhaps, was another episode in the Modern Art series which ranged
widely from a discussion of attitudes towards women in pictures by Degas and
his contemporaries to an exploration of the redevelopment of Paris by
Haussmann; an utterly absorbing programme.
The style may sometimes jar a little. It is usually fairly obvious that the
presenters are academics first and broadcasters second, though none that I
saw was completely inept, and presentation has improved since the early
days. Although the flared trousers and Zapata moustaches which, thanks to
repeats, appeared to survive for so long as a uniform among OU presenters,
have now (almost) all gone, you can still find yourself brought up short by
some Marxist comment which sounds endearingly dated, five years after the
fall of the Berlin Wall. Similarly you can still come across old fashioned
finger-wagging feminism, yet both are now exceptional.
There is another difference between OU material and other television
programmes. Difficult to pin down precisely, the most important aspect is
probably that OU personnel do not feel compelled to strain perpetually for
'balance', either politically or between any other schools of ideas. As
often as not the OU tone indicates the sort of detachment and scepticism
regarding all traditional and received wisdom which is such a healthy aspect
of the better sort of academic life. A little more of it in mainstream
television journalism could go a long way.

FT  23 MAR 94 / People: Graham Watson changes teams
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Graham Watson, one of Scotland's leading corporate finance specialists, has
become a partner of the accountancy firm Touche Ross. He wants to help make
its Scottish branch into a leading adviser on corporate finance north of the
border, eventually, he hopes, putting it on a par with Scottish merchant
banks such as Noble Grossart.
Watson, 36, worked at Noble Grossart for eight years after training as a CA.
In 1991 he resigned as a director to set up Carnegie, giving financial
advice to sportsmen and football and rugby clubs.
He had already come up with the debenture issue which enabled Rangers to
finance a new stand and had launched a similar issue for Arsenal, before
advising the Scottish Rugby Union on its Pounds 37m Murrayfield stadium
project. Carnegie looks after the affairs of golfer Sam Torrance and
footballer Ally McCoist.
Last October Watson unexpectedly resigned as MD of Carnegie because of
disagreement over strategy with its main shareholder, David Murray, chairman
of Murray International and of Rangers. Carnegie subsequently moved its HQ
from Edinburgh to London and opened up in New Zealand and New York.
Touche Ross already has two partners in Scotland dealing with corporate
finance, David Shearer and Peter Holmes, who last week took credit for
devising the Pounds 72m management buy-in of 25 engineering subsidiaries of
Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group.
Watson says that since firms like Touche Ross already provide companies with
tax advice and management consultancy, 'there is no reason why we should
also hand over to merchant banks the role of being corporate finance
advisers as well'.

FT  23 MAR 94 / People: Neil Richardson joins Ian Martin's Glenisla
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Neil Richardson, 37, (right) has been appointed as the first investment
director of Glenisla Group, the privately held London-based investment firm
set up last month by Ian Martin with financial backing from Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, the Wall Street leveraged buy-out specialist.
His appointment marks the first step by Martin, chairman and joint founder
of Glenisla and formerly deputy chairman of Grand Metropolitan, towards
putting together his team of financial experts.
Glenisla has been set up to seek out undervalued investment opportunities in
the UK and western Europe in a wide range of consumer and non-consumer
industries. According to Martin, Richardson will be responsible for
'identifying and developing acquisition opportunities, assessing potential
targets and overseeing transactions through to completion'.
Richardson moves from CS First Boston where he has been director of UK
mergers and acquisitions and instrumental in building up CS First Boston's
European merger and acquisition business which now employs 45 professionals
in London. At CS First Boston Richardson was responsible for creating and
overseeing transactions such as STC's sale of an 80 per cent stake in ICL to
Fujitsu, Burton Group's sale of its financial services operations to GE
Capital and House of Fraser's sale of its credit operations and recent
overall restructuring.
Over the past decade, Richardson has been involved in transactions with an
aggregate value of over Dollars 10bn. Before joining CS First Boston in New
York in 1986, he spent six years with Bain &amp; Company, the strategy
consultants.
Richardson was educated at Ashington Grammar School in Northumberland where
he was one of the first pupils to gain admission to Oxbridge. He read
chemistry at New College, Oxford, and spent his final year researching the
photochemistry of the ozone layer.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Recruitment: Nursing time for boardroom babes - Companies
are exploring new ways of using non-executive directorships to develop
talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most visible consequences of the Cadbury report on corporate
governance has been the impact on the recruitment of non-executive
directors.
The number of UK directorships within UK listed companies has grown markedly
in the last year. Some estimates put the total at between 7,000 and 8,000. I
have been unable to obtain a breakdown that shows how many individuals are
sharing those posts but the ratio of jobs to people appears to be decreasing
as it becomes less and less acceptable to collect them like scout badges.
Cadbury has opened a seam of lucrative business that the recruitment
industry has not been slow to exploit. But the fees have to be earned and
the Cadbury recommendations suggest there is room for new players to extend
the range of suitable candidates.
If Cadbury's insistence that a non-executive director should add value to a
company is to be taken seriously, it should spell the end for traditional
methods of recruitment. The telephone call to a chum and a measure of gin
and geniality over lunch at the club are becoming the exception rather than
the rule.
'It is no longer acceptable for a company to approach its merchant bank for
a recommendation. This is a serious appointment and should be treated
seriously,' says Sir Adrian Cadbury. 'What companies need to to do is to
look at the board they have, set out the kind of background, experience and
age of the person required, and ask themselves what is going to add value to
the board. That focuses the search so they are looking for a particular kind
of candidate.'
The unfocused approach whereby a non-executive chairman might be recruited
in the image of the chief executive can prove a dangerously comforting
accompaniment to potentially disastrous decisions. How many times have
non-executive directors failed to spot the danger signals? Delay or inaction
was apparent in cases such as BCCI, Maxwell, Polly Peck, Tiphook, Queens
Moat and Spring Ram.
A more questioning approach in these cases may have stopped the rot at an
earlier stage. The job can no longer be a free lunch in the diary taken in
the spirit of acquiescence. In the US, the non-executive is termed an
independent, and deservedly so, as he or she has helped to influence a
series of celebrated boardroom oustings.
What makes a good non-executive director? Sir Adrian says: 'You want people
committed to the company but you want them to be questioning. It is knowing
what question to ask and knowing how to engineer the answer that is
important.'
Where you should look may depend on how much you want to pay. Sir Adrian,
chairman of ProNed, the former Bank of England non-executive selection
operation now joined with Egon Zender, the international headhunting firm,
says that typically ProNed would supply five or six names that fitted the
specification. Since they are drawn from a list of people willing to serve
on boards, the company can make an initial choice without causing
embarrassment.
Avoiding embarrassment, a peculiarly British disease, is still an important
selling point for services such as ProNed. Headhunting companies are also
aware of the pitfalls, but the desire for complete discretion, like the old
boys' network, may be fading.
The Institute of Directors maintains a register of 3,000 names, mainly of
people in executive or executive chairman posts. Guided by the client's
specifications, names are sifted from a database. 'This method means that
most of these people will have no connection with the company,' says Alex
Lamb, head of board development at IoD.
True independence, prized by Sir Adrian, is an ideal that still has some way
to go to overtake reality but changes appear to be accelerating. Colin St
Johnston, the managing director of ProNed, says that 93 per cent of all
listed companies had non-executive directors at his count last June and he
believes that proportion may have increased.
While 12 years ago, when ProNed was formed, some 80 per cent of
non-executives would have had some previous connection with the company, the
figure is now nearer 20 per cent.
'There is still a long way to go to ensure the selection process is thorough
and professional and does not use various networks,' says St Johnston. 'But
the biggest companies are now being much more thorough and it is no longer
good enough for the board to write down names of people considered
appropriate.'
Inevitably, many lists begin to look familiar, but there are new initiatives
that may help break up the non-executive merry-go-round by applying more
imagination to the selection process.
Hanson Green, a headhunter specialising in the non-executive market, has set
up the Annexe Scheme; a sort of kindergarten for independent directors,
drawing promising young executives from leading companies and placing them
in non-executive boardroom positions.
The client in this case is not the company that receives the appointment,
but the provider company which pays a Pounds 10,000 fee. 'For this and the
sacrifice of perhaps 12 days a year, they are able to provide the sort of
practical boardroom experience for their most promising people in a
completely different corporate culture,' says John Brill, of Hanson Green.
While the hiring company will not have the experience of an old head, it
will gain enthusiasm and a fresh approach from a talented individual who
will typically be a managing director of a subsidiary.
The Annexe scheme is breaking the mould, claims Brill, providing access to
relatively unknown people who are not quite ready to move up from
subsidiaries but who have sufficient experience to attract attention within
a large group.
The suppliers can be enthusiastic recruiters too. Shortly after Hanson Green
placed Harry Richardson, a director of EDS Scicon, part of Electronic Data
Systems the information technology company, at Fletcher King, the publicly
quoted firm of chartered surveyors, Mark Sketchley - the corporate fiance
director at Robert Fleming - was given a non-executive directorship at EDS
Scicon. Annexe has about 50 candidates on its books and has placed about 20.
If Annexe is a nursery, then an even newer organisation called Prowess is
perhaps offering something nearer a baby- walking service in terms of status
and youth (some of its candidates are barely 30), although that fails to
reflect the quality of learning experience it provides.
Prowess works on a subscription basis. For about Pounds 10,000 a year,
companies join something like a club which enables them to farm out those
with fast track management potential to non-executive positions in other
companies or in the public sector. National Health Service Trusts are an
enthusiastic supporter of the service.
Organisations such as British Airways, Cable and Wireless, Kingfisher, Ernst
and Young, the NHS and the Department of Employment are sponsoring the
scheme and others have expressed interest.
Mark Scott, financial director of Prowess, sees the organisation as helping
to extend the pool of potential non-executives of the future while
broadening the experience of young executives. It has also specifically
looked at women and ethnic minorities which Scott believes are pools of
under-utilised talent.
Prowess emphasises that, unlike Annexe, it does not place individuals, but
handles the recruitment requirements of sponsors by tapping the talent of
other sponsors. If specifications cannot be met by that method, it employs
executive search.
The importing company then pays a recruiting fee of 20 per cent of the
intended director's salary. Prowess is in a different market from the top
search companies who might charge Pounds 30,000 for placing a non-executive
director - a very large proportion of salary. ProNed's service is cheaper,
about Pounds 15,000 for each non-executive.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: US finds traditional disposal
hard to beat - Strict government rules have failed to achieve their goal of
cutting the use of landfills / Worldwide waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Solid and hazardous wastes in the US have come under increasingly complex
laws and regulations. Starting with the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act of 1976, which set up a complete management system for hazardous wastes
and established disposal criteria for other categories of solid waste, the
federal government's restrictions have had far-reaching effects on waste
management.
Not all of the rulemaking has been successful. The Superfund legislation of
1980 and amendments of 1986 have had unintended consequences and have failed
to achieve their main purpose, which was to provide for the clean-up of
toxic dumps. As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency is trying to
push yet another Superfund reform through Congress.
Government efforts to direct waste management practices have also stumbled
over simple economics: traditional methods of disposal such as landfills
have remained stubbornly cheap, while favoured approaches such as recycling
have generated a glut of unsaleable materials.
The US produces around 196m tons of municipal waste a year - about 4.3lbs
per person and almost double the norm in other industrialised countries.
The EPA estimates that the US spends about Dollars 35bn (Pounds 23.9bn) a
year on collecting and disposing of municipal solid waste, managing
hazardous waste and cleaning up underground petrol and chemical storage
tanks.
Spending in these areas is rising faster than on any other category of
environmental regulation. The Congressional Budget Office calculates that
cleaning up Superfund toxic waste sites alone - excluding dumps on federal
government property - will cost a total of Dollars 75bn. A separate estimate
by the University of Tennessee puts the price at Dollars 151bn.
To deal with solid waste, the EPA has set up a hierarchy of management
techniques:
1. Reduce waste by preventing its creation;
2. Recycle and compost as much as possible;
3. Incinerate or treat waste in other ways to reduce its volume;
4. In the last resort, landfill.
Of these approaches, reducing the source of the waste may be the most
promising because the cost to businesses of installing new equipment can
often be offset by savings on reduced raw material consumption.
Environmental groups also argue for consumers to play a role in source
reduction through 'precycling': choosing products which use less packaging
or avoiding throwaway products.
Recycling has proved a more mixed blessing. Many states and cities have set
ambitious goals: between 1989 and 1992 the proportion of municipal rubbish
recycled rose from 9 per cent to 14 per cent, while the proportion sent to
landfills dropped from 84 per cent to 76 per cent, according to the World
Resources Institute's Environmental Almanac.
Seattle is often cited as the example for recycling. In 1989, the city
raised its charge for picking up a second rubbish bin from Dollars 5 to
Dollars 9 per month, and lowered charges for customers who recycled. By
1991, that fee increase had cut the proportion of households who put out a
second bin from 39 per cent to 11 per cent. With other initiatives on
recycling and source reduction, Seattle cut the solid waste it was disposing
of by a quarter.
But with a sluggish market for recyclables, it can now cost Seattle Dollars
10 a ton to get rid of recycled newspapers where it was once paid Dollars 10
a ton, and the city has had to stockpile or even landfill some recyclables
such as glass.
Critics of the EPA's insistence that recycling must come before other waste
management techniques say there is a natural limit at around 30 per cent
recycling, where simple economics override government policy.
President Bill Clinton's recent order that the federal government must
double the recycled content of its paper to 20 per cent is expected to boost
the recycled paper market.
Incineration has also gained ground in some states, especially in the
north-east. Maine and Massachusetts incinerate more than 40 per cent of
their solid waste, while Connecticut incinerates nearly two-thirds.
Incinerator construction is spurred largely by the difficulty some cities
have in persuading other localities to take their rubbish for landfilling,
but incinerators are still greeted with universal suspicion, and no one
wants them in their back yard.
Landfill ranks at the bottom of the hierarchy, and it had been widely
expected in the 1980s that tougher operating standards imposed by EPA and by
the states would also make it less attractive in financial terms.
Although the number of landfills open to receive waste fell from 20,000 in
1978 to 6,000 in 1986, the anticipated shortage of landfill space has not
materialised. With dumped volumes dropping off in the recession at the start
of the 1990s, solid waste companies have seen their earnings fall.
The one place where landfills have been filling up rapidly is in the
Mississippi basin, where last year's floods produced a morass of debris and
sodden sandbags. In most cases, however, dump operators had to waive fees.
In the end, the sheer accumulation of waste at the rate of nearly 200m tons
a year will lead to shortages of landfill space. But for the foreseeable
future, landfills remain the dominant form of waste disposal because they
are the cheapest.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Quarries head for the coast -
Proposals to limit the damage caused by extracting materials for the
building industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rock, sand and gravel, gouged or blasted out of great quarries, are
irreplaceable as basic building materials. But does Britain want large
unsightly holes scarring its countryside? And what of the environmental
damage caused by huge trucks carrying stone to build yet more roads?
UK ministers are pondering these questions as they prepare guidelines for
local authorities, which are establishing planning targets for aggregates'
extraction into the next century.
The government's findings could determine the future of hundreds of millions
of pounds of investment proposed by British building material companies for
a new generation of coastal super-quarries in Scotland and Scandinavia.
These quarries would reduce pressure on Britain's shrinking countryside in
southern England and the Midlands but would be viable only if the price of
aggregates were to rise, providing investors with an acceptable rate of
return.
A consultation paper published by the Department of the Environment 14
months ago suggested the restriction of aggregates extraction in some of the
more politically sensitive regions. It also proposed inhibiting the rise in
sea-dredged sand and gravel, partly to protect coastal fishing.
The policy would conserve valuable and irreplaceable land-based reserves,
requiring the industry to switch to other sources, the department said.
These would include Scottish quarries, imports and recycled or secondary
materials such as slate, colliery spoil and china clay waste for landfill.
Similar deliberations are taking place in other large European countries
where concern for the environment is equally high on the political agenda.
Tarmac, the construction group, which is currently considering spending up
to Pounds 75m on a Norwegian coastal quarry, says the investment would work
only if Britain and Germany took a large proportion of the output.
Publication of the British guidelines, however, is already 10 months late,
emphasising the difficulties faced by domestic politicians who wish to
display their green credentials without damaging the construction industry -
considered to be an important engine for growth for the economy.
Neither are the arguments as simple as they might first appear. Otherwise,
companies such as Tarmac would have leaped at an opportunity to raise prices
and improve margins, which have been eroded heavily during the UK recession.
The DoE consultation paper contained two options, based on forecasts of
construction demand up to 2011.
The option preferred by the department would reduce the percentage of
locally produced rock, sand and gravel in England and Wales from more than
80 per cent to 64 per cent, and cut marine-dredged aggregate from 7 per cent
to 6 per cent. Imports from Scottish quarries and elsewhere would be
expected to rise from 1 per cent to 9 per cent, while the use of secondary
and recycled materials would rise from 10 per cent to 16 per cent.
A second option, preferred by building material suppliers, would require a
more gradual reduction in land-won supplies, with the proportion of crushed
rock remaining constant at about 50 per cent but with sand and gravel,
mostly from south-east England, falling from 32 per cent to 24 per cent by
2011.
Marine-dredged sand and gravel would rise to 8 per cent, requiring a lower
increase in imports to 6 per cent by 2011, compared with 18 per cent in the
department's preferred option.
The BACMI, the British Aggregate Construction Materials Industries trade
association, says its members recognise the need to consider the environment
but that the department's option could create worse environmental problems.
Deliveries of aggregates by sea from Scotland or Scandinavia would require
large port facilities for unloading, storage and transfer to land-based
transport. Construction is a fragmented activity and most deliveries would
still need to be made by road.
Land-based quarries are traditionally within 30 miles of most of their
customers. Deliveries from coastal areas or rail depots would require much
greater lorry distances to be travelled.
Alternative materials such as slate create their own environmental problems
and often cannot replace traditional aggregates for technical or cost
reasons, the BACMI says. An attempt to use china clay sand from St Austell
in Cornwall as a substitute for embankments and fill on the new Severn
Crossing failed after it was realised that 'this would involve 500 vehicles
a day for more than a year - some 68m heavy goods/vehicle miles'.
The BACMI advocates an increase in sea-dredged aggregates which, it says,
affects only 0.03 per cent of the sea bed in the North Sea compared with 54
per cent affected by fishing. It says the Ministry of Agricultures receives
virtually no complaints from fishermen about marine dredging.
Companies say a more restrictive planning regime will not necessarily lead
to higher aggregate prices needed to make investment in Scotland and
Scandinavia attractive.
Tarmac says that at present extraction rates shortages may not start to
emerge for at least four years. Moreover there is sufficient flexibility in
existing planning permissions for operators to increase production in the
short term. Falling demand for construction during the recession has meant
that annual production of aggregates in England and Wales has fallen by 23
per cent since 1989 from 300m tonnes to 230m tonnes.
Given the uncertainty over demand and supply, it may still be difficult for
companies to commit the Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m needed to open a coastal
quarry even if a more restrictive policy is introduced.
The BACMI, which says that quarry operators have become more sensitive to
environmental considerations, favours a more gradualist approach and would
prefer a compromise between the two options.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Management: Saints and sinners - How to achieve an ethical
balance in business operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN DRUMMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most commentators accept that commercial life is increasingly hedged around
with choices about profits and ethics. But while the debate on how an
individual's standards are formed has been under way for centuries, how can
organisations sensibly develop an ethical position? The diagram alongside
shows how US academics Eric Reidenbach and Donald Robin, professors of
marketing at the University of Southern Mississippi, have established a sort
of moral pyramid to demonstrate the range of corporate attitudes. European
companies, too, can use this theoretical model as a basis for dealing with
ethical issues.
It is important to note that a multi-divisional company may occupy several
stages at the same time, and companies may also regress from higher to lower
levels. At the base are the amoral or 'ethically challenged' companies, none
of whom, one suspects, will be reading this. They are around strictly for
the short term, and are characterised by 'winning at all costs'. Obedience
is valued and rewarded and there is little concern for employees other than
their value as an economic unit of production.
The ethical climate of a stage one organisation can be summed up by phrases
like 'they'll never know', 'everybody does it', and 'we won't get caught'.
At the heart of this organisation is the philosophical conviction that
business is not subject to the same rules as individuals and that there is
no set of values other than greed.
At stage two are the legalistic organisations. They obey the law, though
ethical concerns are judged on the basis of adherence to the letter if not
the spirit of it. No breach of law often means no breach of ethics. 'If it's
legal, it's OK and if we are not sure, have the lawyers check it out,'
typifies the legalistic approach. Economic performance dominates evaluations
and rewards. A legalistic company's code of ethics - if it exists - would be
dominated by 'don't do anything to harm the organisation' statements.
Some legalistic companies have no ethics code, and do not accept the
necessity. Often they see little purpose in expressing explicit ethical
standards, and indeed some feel any such statements could lead to
difficulties and complications.
Most stage two companies would leave ethical concerns aside until they
become a problem; only then would they consider remedial action.
This ignores two crucial points. First, all organisations have ethical
standards even if they are not explicit. Some things are seen to be
acceptable, others are not. However, when there is no consistent
understanding and application of those standards the inevitable result will
be internal, and ultimately external confusion.
Second, waiting for a problem to occur is not sound management practice. And
the consequences can be very serious, particularly in terms of risk to
reputation. As never before, the media and others are now sensitive to
ethical breaches. It is increasingly unlikely that ethical transgressions
will go unnoticed. Remember the nostrum: 'News is what someone somewhere
doesn't want to see in print, anything else is advertising'.
Stage three contains the responsive companies. Managers in this category
understand the value of not acting solely on a legal basis, even though they
believe they could win. Although a reactive mentality may remain, it is
coupled with a growing sense of balance between profits and ethics.
Nonetheless, the basic premise still may be a somewhat cynical 'ethics
pays'.
Management begins to test and learn from more responsive actions. A
responsive company's ethics code would reflect a concern for other
stakeholders, but additional ethics support vehicles, such as hotlines, are
less likely to be found.
Reidenbach and Robin describe stage four companies, somewhat
controversially, as 'emerging ethical'. A better term might be 'ethically
engaged'. Managers have an active concern for ethical outcomes: 'We want to
do the 'right thing'.' Values are shared across the organisation. Ethical
perception has focus but may still lack organisation and long term planning.
Ethical values in such companies are part of the culture. Codes of ethics
are action documents, and contain statements reflecting core values. A range
of ethical support measures are normally in place, such as ethical review
committees; hotlines; ethical audits; and ethics counsellors or ombudsmen.
Problem solving is approached with an awareness of the ethical consequence
of an action as well as its potential profitability, and pains are taken to
uphold corporate values. For example, the European region of a leading
international chemical company surveys staff understanding of corporate
ethical standards and acts on any dissonances.
Most progressive European companies would, one suspects, see themselves as
stage three or four. At a minimum they do have ethics codes aimed at all
stakeholders. They recognise that ethics comes from the inside out, and that
a mission statement, for instance, is not the same as an ethics code. They
are not blind to the promotional advantages of high ethics in the 'caring
'90s' but they understand that without employee commitment, any form of
ethically orientated marketing may be at least meaningless or at worst,
counterproductive.
Stage three and four companies also accept that their code of ethics is a
starting point - any code not monitored and enforced rapidly becomes a dead
letter. One leading UK bank has put in place a range of instruments for
enlisting staff commitment to its code, including ethics hotlines and
regular assessment of code effectiveness.
Lastly, stage five represents what the researchers call the ethics
organisation. Here there is a total ethical profile, with carefully selected
core values (and an approach to hiring, training, firing and rewarding)
which reflect it.
The answer is not to attempt to turn staff and companies into saints, but
rather to strike a suitable ethical balance in business operations, to
minimise reputational risk.
The author is managing director of London-based Integrity Works. He is also
co-author of Managing Business Ethics, published this week by Butterworth
Heinemann. Price Pounds 17.95.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Management: The continuing search for excellence - Book
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Tom Peters and Robert Waterman were consultant colleagues in McKinsey &amp;
Co's organisation practice in the 1970s, Waterman played godfather to
Peters, the brilliant but reckless junior. But since they went their
separate ways after the staggering success a decade ago of their
best-seller, In Search of Excellence, it is Peters who has had the higher
profile.
His string of charismatic shockers, notably Thriving on Chaos and Liberation
Management, eclipsed the quieter Waterman's equally perceptive works, The
Renewal Factor and Adhocracy: The Power to Change.
With this latest volume*, The Frontiers of Excellence, Waterman deserves to
hit the same heights as Peters. In the US, where the book's local title is
What America Does Right, its timing is especially good: after several years
of self-doubt, American business is ripe for the same sort of
confidence-booster that In Search of Excellence proved in 1982-83.
The core of Waterman's message is captured in his subtitle: Learning From
Companies That Put People First. His argument is simple if controversial:
that today's top companies, like those which have remained successful over
the long term, do not put the shareholders first. Instead, they pay primary
attention to employees and customers. As a result they perform far more
effectively than their rivals, and thereby deliver superior results to their
shareholders.
They do this, says Waterman, by being better organised to meet the needs of
their employees, thereby motivating them unusually well; and to meet the
needs of customers by being either more innovative, more reliable or cheaper
 -or all three.
This is simple to state but difficult to achieve. Waterman devotes almost
the entire book to examining how 10 US organisations 'put people first'; how
the courier company Federal Express strikes an ideal balance between what he
calls 'potentially oppressive systems and the cheerful attitudes of a deeply
enthusiastic workforce'; how Levi Strauss, the clothing manufacturer,
creates employee commitment and a set of empowering 'shared values' in a
sweatshop industry; how household goods company Rubbermaid and consumer
products group Procter &amp; Gamble have remained so innovative for so long; how
Motorola's 50-year-old maxim of 'anticipate and commit' has inspired the
telecoms company to change its business several times and improve product
quality; and so on.
Along the way, Waterman provides several valuable insights: into the nature
of leadership in a decentralised, shallow organisation ('today's leaders
understand that you have to give up control to get results - they act as
coaches not as 'the boss''); into the importance to strategic success of
building relationships with customers and suppliers that are hard for rivals
to duplicate; and in the consequent need to organise outwards and downwards
to please customers and employees, rather than upwards to please the boss.
These principles emerge from the wealth of practical detail, so that the
reader has a sense of learning alongside Waterman rather than being
lectured.
That said, the book has minor flaws. Prime among them is Waterman's very
enthusiasm, boyishly infectious though it is for the most part. His
celebration of P&amp;G's innovation, and its history of encouraging self-managed
teams in several factories, hardly pauses to consider claims that its head
office has a Stalinist, oppressive culture.
Waterman also concentrates too much on the well-known potential for
companies to liberate the initiative of their frontline employees. Far too
little of the book deals with the trickier and more complex question of
whether middle and senior managers - those who keep their jobs - can be
liberated in similar fashion.
Waterman also ducks the thorny question of why some great companies stumble
badly, while others remain vibrant.
To conclude that we should 'learn from the best while they're good and move
on when they lose their edge' is a cop-out unworthy of the manifest
intelligence which Waterman shows in the rest of this very readable book.

FT  23 MAR 94 / TV advertising limit raised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission has decided that television
advertising sales houses will be allowed to sell airtime for TV companies up
to a limit of 25 per cent of UK television advertising revenue.
The current limit, set more than three years ago, is 25 per cent of ITV
revenue.
The liberalisation follows the line adopted by the Office of Fair Trading
when it considered the advertising sales implications of the recent spate of
ITV takeovers.
The takeovers were not to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission as long as by August 1995 none of the sales houses accounted for
more than 25 per cent of total television advertising sales.
Mr Frank Willis, ITC director of advertising and sponsorship, said yesterday
that action was being taken because 'we are conscious that Pounds 2bn of
business will be done between now and August 1995. We have a regulatory
responsibility and believe that people should not feel they can do what they
like between now and 1995'.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Radio frequencies may be auctioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering radical proposals for management of the radio
spectrum including the possibility of holding auctions and even creating a
secondary market in spectrum assignments.
The possibility of radical change came yesterday in a consultative document
from the Department of Trade and Industry.
The radio spectrum is the complete range of useful radio frequencies
governing everything from radio and television to mobile communications,
microwave telecommunications links and satellite services.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that the
document envisaged 'an extended role for the private sector in planning the
spectrum and assigning frequencies'.
The Radiocommunications Agency, which assigns frequencies now, would retain
responsibility for a number of core activities that had to be performed by
the government.
The document comes eight years after a DTI report by consultants CSP
International argued that the allocation of frequencies through licences
designed to meet only the cost of regulation had led to the inefficient use
of a scarce resource.
The report suggested that the existing method of allocation should be
progressively replaced by one 'which gives greater scope for the operation
of market forces'. The DTI said yesterday that there had since been a big
increase in demand on the radio spectrum.
The DTI is asking for comments on two main options for the future,
administrative pricing or selective auctions.
Setting flexible fees linked to the types of frequency bands used or the
efficiency of equipment would encourage users to apply for and retain only
the spectrum they needed.
What the DTI describes as 'a more radical approach' would involve the
creation of a system of tradeable property rights in the spectrum.
Auctions could either sell parts of the spectrum direct to users or rights
could be sold to a private spectrum management organisation which would
assign licences in either the fixed link or private mobile radio bands on a
commercial basis.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Lawyers say Lords unlikely to hear Paramount appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers close to the Paramount Airways action said yesterday that the House
of Lords was unlikely to hear their appeal in the case, which has thrown
eight years of insolvency practice into doubt, before the autumn. The appeal
was formally launched yesterday by administrators at accountancy firm Touche
Ross.
The delay means a period of uncertainty for receivers and administrators
before they know whether they will face claims from thousands of employees
in companies which have run into difficulties.
The details emerged as the insolvency (No 2) bill was debated in the House
of Lords yesterday after passing its Commons stages on Monday. It will
ensure that only employees' wages, salaries and pension contributions will
rank as preferential creditors to companies in receivership and
administration.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Hunt launches drive for more skilled workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fourteen industrial and commercial sectors were selected yesterday by Mr
David Hunt, the employment secretary, as prototypes for the government's
'modern apprenticeship scheme'.
The scheme aims to create a new generation of skilled workers.
Industry trainers in sectors including information technology, chemicals and
agriculture will work with employers and Training and Enterprise Councils -
which deliver government training - to recruit 2,000 young people in England
and Wales to be trained to technician and supervisory levels.
When fully operational next year the Pounds 1.25bn scheme will offer up to
50 per cent more public money than is now available to training
organisations. This has been made possible by a combination of declining
numbers of young people on Youth Training and a small amount of new money.
Mr Hunt said the response to the scheme from employers had been
'overwhelming'. But employers said yesterday many of them were waiting for
funding details before making formal commitments.
The Engineering Training Authority said: 'The government will have to make a
big marketing effort to get both employers and young people on board.'
It is intended that when the modern apprenticeship is fully operational up
to half of 16- to 19-year-olds on government training schemes will achieve
Level Three national vocational qualifications, the vocational equivalent of
two A levels. At present most participants on YT attain Level Two NVQs, the
vocational equivalent of four GCSEs.
The scheme forms part of the government's drive to meet national targets for
the attainment of vocational qualifications. One of these is that by 2000,
half of young people should reach NVQ Level Three or its academic
equivalent.
At present 37 per cent of young people have achieved this skill level.
Recently the employer-led National Advisory Council for Education and
Training Targets said the UK should be aiming higher.
It added: 'International comparisons point to the need to do so. In Japan 80
per cent of young people reached a comparable level in 1986.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Insolvency move not ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government made clear last night that it had not ruled out the
possibility of retrospective legislation to safeguard the position of
insolvency practitioners appointed as administrators and receivers to
companies in trouble.
At the same time it successfully called on the House of Lords to follow the
example of the Commons by rejecting amendments seeking to make the
Insolvency (No 2) bill effective from December 30 1986.
Peers rushed the bill through and it should receive royal assent today or
tomorrow.
The bill provides protection from Tuesday of last week for administrators
and receivers from the consequences of a Court of Appeal ruling on Paramount
Airways which, in effect, made them responsible for the contractual
employment obligations of a company after 14 days.
Lord Strathclyde, chief government spokesman on the bill, gave an assurance
to peers who warned that insolvency practitioners could face claims of up to
Pounds 1bn - possibly involving the bankruptcy of some small- and
medium-sized accountancy firms. He said ministers would closely watch how
the situation developed.
He refused to be drawn on whether the government was likely to introduce
further emergency legislation.
Lord Donaldson of Lymington, a former Master of the Rolls, criticised the
hasty manner in which parliament had been asked to approve the bill, but
insisted that it would be wrong to provide blanket retrospection. He
suggested that it would have been more satisfactory if it had been delayed
for a week to enable the main 1986 Insolvency Act to be amended.
Lord Donaldson suggested that a provision should be introduced requiring
insolvency practitioners to inform each employee of the company concerned
whether they were adopting or disclaiming employees' contracts.
He had not introduced such a provision 'because I am not certain of my
ability to amend the bill on the hoof'.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Channel 5 television 'should be digital'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to launch television channels using existing technology should be
frozen until a full analysis can be carried out of the economics of digital
television, a report being published today suggests.
Mr Dermot Nolan, a director of Convergent Decisions Group, a new
consultancy, argues that the launch of a new Channel 5 service in the UK
using present analogue technology would be trapped in 'a twilight era'.
Mr Nolan, who until recently specialised in digital broadcasting and
telecommunications issues at consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says digital
channels - broadcast from terrestrial transmitters - will be operational in
five years.
The Independent Television Commission has made it clear that it wants to
readvertise a Channel 5 licence but it has asked the government if the
frequencies are still available.
Both the National Heritage Department and the Department of Trade and
Industry are looking into the issues involved.
There is a growing belief in industrialised countries that the radio
spectrum is a vital resource and that it is inefficient to use it for
analogue rather than digital television.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Debts of Labour councils attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, yesterday said debt-ridden
Labour councils were a 'national disgrace' as the campaign for May's local
elections continued to stress financial issues.
Mr Curry said 18 of the 20 English councils with the highest debt were
Labour-controlled. Brent, the only Conservative council on the list, had
been Labour-controlled until 1990.
The Conservatives printed a league table comparing Labour councils' debt
with third-world countries. Manchester and Birmingham, with debts of Pounds
1.326bn and Pounds 1.233bn respectively, had higher external debts than
Paraguay, Niger and Nepal.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, described Mr Curry's
claims as 'an embarrassing own-goal', saying that the UK's current borrowing
 -Pounds 50bn in one year - was more than China had borrowed in 50 years.
Mr Curry said local authority debt could not be compared with the public
sector borrowing requirement because it did not have to perform
'macroeconomic policy'. He said local government finance should be directed
at 'extremely well-defined statutory res-ponses'.
Mr David Thomas, head of local government for the Chartered Institute of
Public Finance and Accountancy, suggested that local authority debt did not
necessarily reflect poor management. 'Local authority debt is really there
because that authority has responded to need.'
He added that it could only be accumulated for capital spending
requirements, rather than day-to-day revenue expenditure.
He added, however, that the 21 debt-free councils would have more
flexibility to use capital receipts. According to Mr Curry's figures only
one of these is Labour while 10 are Conservative and two are Liberal
Democrat.
Mr Curry announced that the government would make no further announcements
on counties so far affected by the local government review until after the
May elections.

Both the national heritage department and the Department of Trade and
Industry are looking into the issues involved.
Mr Nolan concedes that going ahead with Channel 5 would cause very little
disruption to the roll out of digital terrestrial television.
The average number of national digital channels available would be reduced
from 10 to eight in a period when existing channels - such as BBC1 - would
still have to be transmitted in the old form. This would cater for those who
did not have digital receivers.
There is a growing belief in industrialised countries that the radio
spectrum is a vital resource and that it is inefficient to use it for
analogue rather than digital television.
Mr Nolan says: 'A fundamental overhaul of broadcasting and
telecom-munications legislation is now required to retain UK competitiveness
in broad-casting and telecommuni-cations, in order to exploit the benefits
of digital television.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / TV advertising limit is raised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission has decided that television
advertising sales houses will be allowed to sell airtime for TV companies up
to a limit of 25 per cent of total UK television advertising revenue.
The current limit, set more than three years ago, is 25 per cent of ITV
revenue.
The liberalisation follows the line adopted by the Office of Fair Trading
when it considered the advertising sales implications of the recent spate of
ITV takeovers, such as the Carlton Communications purchase of Central.
The takeovers were not to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission as long as by August 1995 none of the sales houses accounted for
more than 25 per cent of total television advertising sales.
Mr Frank Willis, ITC director of advertising and sponsorship, said yesterday
that action was being taken immediately because 'we are conscious that
Pounds 2bn of business will be done between now and August 1995. We have a
regulatory responsibility and believe that people should not feel they can
do what they like between now and 1995.'
ITC consent will still be needed on most ITV sales operations and a single
organisation will not be allowed to sell both ITV and Channel 4.
The commission is seeking views on two outstanding issues - whether there
should be flexibility around the 25 per cent threshold and the future
treatment of Channel 5.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Housing upturn confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of recovery in the housing market came yesterday from a Law
Society study showing a steady increase in the number of conveyancing
transactions.
The society said the number of transactions was likely to return this year
to 1990 levels at about 1.4m. The number peaked in 1988 at 2.15m and fell to
1.1m in 1991.
the number of solicitors' firms in business continued to rise during the
recession while conveyancing prices and overall income from conveyancing
fell sharply. Since 1986 the real cost of conveying an averagely-priced
house in the Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 50,000 bracket has fallen 53 per cent
and for houses in the Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000 range 45 per cent.
Last year the average price of conveying a Pounds 60,000 house for a buyer
was Pounds 299 plus vat.
Sixty-eight per cent of clients felt they received good or very good value
for money. Next week the society will publish a working party report on
conveyancing services.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Ferranti managers plan two buy-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management teams running different parts of Ferranti International will this
week attempt two separate buy-outs from the receiver.
One team wants to buy Ferranti's components division in Oldham, Greater
Manchester. The other, based in Bracknell, Berkshire, wants to buy the
software division and enter a supply agreement for hardware from Oldham.
Arthur Andersen, the receiver, said yesterday there was outside interest in
buying the business whole, which might prove more convenient and attractive.
Andersen suggested potential buyers were not necessarily interested in
manufacturing and might subsequently divest from Oldham, where 450 people
are employed, possibly selling to the management.
The Oldham buy-out team, led by Mr Angus Mincher, managing director, has
made a bid after securing equity finance last week.
Mr Ian Sinderson of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm acting as the team's
corporate finance adviser, said three banks were competing to provide loan
and working capital.
The Bracknell buy-out team is being led by Mr Phil Burton, the local chief
executive. Finance is almost in place and the team expects to make a bid
this week.
The Ferranti group employs about 2,150 - a tenth of the payroll at its peak.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Bar is again accused of race bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh allegations of racial discrimination were levelled at the Bar last
night over its new system for selecting students for the barristers' finals
course.
The new system, based on a mixture of academic qualifications and
psychometric tests, has resulted in just 91 places on next year's finals
course being offered to black and ethnic minority candidates out of a total
of 882.
Mrs Justice Booth, chairman of the Bar school's central selection board,
defended the system as 'fair and valid'. All answers to the tests which were
based on skills identified by psychometric researchers as required by
barristers were double marked blind, she said. Markers had no access to
information about the gender or ethnic origin of can-didates.
But Mr Makbool Javaid, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, said the
results were clearly discriminatory. He said: 'It cannot be the case that
such a low percentage of black and ethnic minority candidates are judged fit
and suitable to become barristers.'
Mr Javaid, a solicitor, said the society had warned the Bar last year that
the tests had the potential for bias and that it would consider seeking
judicial review of the results.
Women also fared badly under the new system. Out of 2,290 applicants, 1,764
were white, 481 black (45 did not disclose their ethnic origin) and 922 were
women. Of the 882 offers made, 774 were to white candidates, 91 to black or
ethnic minority candidates and 17 to those who did not disclose ethnic
origin. Offers were made to 301 women.
This is the second time in just over a year that the Bar has been involved
in a row over race discrimination. Last year it was accused of
discriminating against ethnic minority candidates in marking its finals
examination. An inquiry set up by the Bar school found no evidence of direct
discrimination.
The new selection system was introduced because too many students were
qualifying on academic grounds for a place on the finals course. Part of the
Bar's problem, however, is that its finals course is available only through
the Bar school.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has condemned this
monopoly on training barristers as anti-competitive.
A Bar report on barrister's training to be published later this week is
expected to acknowledge that it may now have to validate courses at other
centres already licensed to run the solicitors' vocational course.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Repackaging is needed to shift Red Star: Why a British Rail
offshoot is proving difficult to sell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Red Star, British Rail's express parcels delivery service, is proving one of
the most troublesome parts to privatise.
It is not the only division of BR to make losses, but the size of its
deficit - Pounds 9m last year on turnover of Pounds 43m - has proved a
barrier to sale.
One rival said: 'You would have to give me the business plus Pounds 20m to
make it worthwhile.'
It was put up for sale last June and taken out of the shop window in
December when a suitable offer failed to materialise. Earlier this month BR
was forced to acknowledge that a sale would be impossible without big
changes.
Red Star, which claims to be the UK market leader in same-day deliveries, is
to shed 500 of its 1,280 staff and drop a large chunk of its next-day
business, which accounts for 30 per cent of turnover.
It has fallen victim to a general retrenchment in the Pounds 1.8bn parcels
sector and to its own high cost base. Rapid growth generally in express
deliveries in the late 1980s led to overcapacity and fierce price
competition. Growth has slowed to between 2 per cent and 3 per cent a year
while prices have been falling.
Of particular concern to Red Star was the shift away from premium services
promising delivery on the same day or early the next day. Customers whose
margins were under pressure opted for cheaper services providing delivery
the next afternoon or later.
Red Star is gambling that, with the UK recession apparently ending, this
period of cheap-rate buying has come to an end. It is planning to exploit
its main advantage, the use of the BR rail network which allows rapid
deliveries across the country on the same day or by 9am the next day. It
will drop its slower services providing next-day delivery by noon or 5.30pm.
Other parcels groups are not barred from using rail and some do for
occasional deliveries. But they have to use the Red Star service and either
slap a charge on top of the Red Star rate or take a smaller cut themselves.
Mr Bill Tyler, head of BR's vendor unit, said: 'No one can match us on
same-day city-to-city business.'
Red Star may regard the rail link as its main advantage but others are less
convinced.
One rival which used Red Star on a trial basis said it had dropped it
because of the poor level of service.
Red Star is not the only victim of the pressure in the parcels sector. Elan
International, an express freight and parcels company with turnover of
Pounds 28m, collapsed last month with debts of Pounds 6m and the loss of
more than 700 jobs.
Other companies are rethinking their strategies. Parcelforce, the parcels
arm of the Post Office and the largest company in the parcels market, is
streamlining its depot network and merging some services.
A survey of express delivery services by Marketing Strategies for Industry,
a consultancy, forecasts modest growth for the sector with a 9 per cent
increase by 1996 in the number of packages delivered. But profits will
improve only if the industry can provide more high-value services, it warns.
MSI says simple deli-veries are no longer enough. Companies are increasingly
carrying out processing and printing of despatch documents, inventory
management and invoicing.
Mr Tyler remains optimistic about finding a buyer for Red Star. He said:
'The move to premium services will lead to a significant improvement in
profits.'
But he was unable to say when Red Star would move into the black.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Poll rejects Scottish water plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 97 per cent of voters in a Strathclyde region referendum have
overwhelmingly rejected plans to remove the Scottish water industry from
local authority control.
The government proposals were rejected by 97.2 per cent of the 1.2m who
voted in a postal ballot. Papers were returned by 71.5 per cent of those who
received them - a high turnout for recent UK referendums. Strathclyde region
includes almost half the population of Scotland.
Mr Robert Gould, convener of Strathclyde regional council, which organised
the referendum, called the result 'sensational'. He said the government
'would be very unwise to proceed with their water legislation with less than
3 per cent supporting it'.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, called the referendum 'pseudo-democratic'
and 'meaningless'. The ballot paper had not explained that the status quo in
the water industry could not continue when local government was reorganised.
He attacked the region for spending more than Pounds 500,000 on the
referendum.
In a System Three poll in yesterday's Herald newspaper only 10 per cent
supported the government's plans and 81 per cent were opposed.
The government proposes removing water from the nine regional and three
island councils and putting it in the hands of three state-owned authorities
with boards appointed by the Scottish secretary.
A Commons committee considering the bill to reform Scottish local government
will discuss the water industry clauses tomorrow.
Last year the government dropped the idea of privatising the Scottish water
industry after opinion polls and responses to a consultation paper showed
very strong opposition.
Many in Scotland object to the plan for water authorities because they would
not be directly under democratic control, and they believe that the
government would eventually privatise water.
Scottish Office ministers say the industry must be restructured because the
regions and the 53 district councils will be replaced by 30 unitary
councils.
Labour said this week that if it came to power it would fill the boards of
the authorities with elected councillors, while the Liberal Democrats would
create joint boards of the new councils to run water services.
Mr Lang said in an interview with the Financial Times last month: 'I don't
believe people worry so much about the democratic control of water as about
the fact that it is delivered cleanly and cheaply.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Payouts challenge allowed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The TUC and 10 unions yesterday won the right to bring a legal challenge to
government plans to reform the criminal injuries compensation system. It
intends to replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff from April 1.
Mr Justice Owen granted leave in the High Court for the unions to bring
judicial review proceedings and said the hearing should take place as soon
as possible.
Mr Guy Sankey, QC for Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said the
application was misconceived. But he did not oppose the application for
leave as he accepted there was an arguable issue of public interest.
He gave an assurance that no final award would be made to any claimant until
the courts had decided the matter.
Mr Andrew Dismore, solicitor for the TUC and the unions, said: 'The unions
are very concerned about the effect on their members who face daily risks of
being attacked in their jobs.'

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday named retired Admiral William Crowe, 69, to
be the next ambassador in London in succession to Mr Raymond Seitz, subject
to confirmation by the Senate.
The choice of Admiral Crowe - chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the US
military high command, from 1985-89 - has been an open secret.
He earned a particular place in Mr Clinton's affection early in the 1992
presidential campaign. In the first public endorsement by a top ranking
active or former officer, he said Mr Clinton's avoidance of military service
at the time of the Vietnam War did not render him unfit to be president.
He declined offers from President Clinton to run the Central Iintelligence
Agency and be ambassador to Moscow, but has been serving as chairman of the
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
Admiral Crowe lived in London for six months in 1965 while researching his
doctorate on the Royal Navy and was a frequent visitor from 1980 to 1983,
when he was Nato commander in southern Europe.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Smith aims at Eastleigh Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday launched the party's high-risk
campaign for the Eastleigh by-election by urging Conservative voters not to
switch to the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Smith said that either Labour or the Liberal Democrats could win in
Eastleigh, the Hampshire seat which became vacant when Stephen Milligan, the
Conservative MP, was found dead last month.
But he told a public meeting in the constituency that only a Labour victory
could prepare the ground for a change of government at the next general
election.
Labour is planning a high-profile campaign designed to demonstrate that the
party remains capable of winning seats from the Conservatives in the south
of England.
The campaign risks backfiring if the Liberal Democrat party, which came
second in the 1990 general election, succeeds in winning the seat.
The Conservatives are defending a majority of more than 17,000 - less than
the margin overturned by the Liberal Democrats in a by-election last year in
nearby Christchurch.
Mr Smith accused the Liberal Democrats of spreading a 'myth' that Labour was
bound to fail in the south. He said that Liberal Democrat by-election
victories had failed to change government policies.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Howe pins dam blame on Younger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, said yesterday that the decision to
link an offer of aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam project with a Pounds 1bn
defence contract was taken entirely by Lord Younger, his cabinet colleague
in 1988.
He said a protocol signed by Lord Younger, who was defence secretary at the
time, and the Malaysian government in March of that year had caused
'animation', 'astonishment' and 'dismay' in Whitehall when its contents
became known.
In recent months the focus in the affair has been on claims that the linkage
between the aid and defence deals could have broken established government
guidelines prohibiting such entanglement.
Lord Howe yesterday revealed to the Commons foreign affairs committee that
one of his principal concerns at the time was that the protocol, which he
said made 'a substantial moral commitment' to offer aid, could have allowed
the Malaysians to make a considerable call on funds from Britain's aid
budget.
In particular, Lord Howe supported claims that Lord Younger had risked
committing the government's entire budget for aid and trade provision to
Malaysia for three years when he secured a contract to sell defence
equipment in 1988, according to evidence given yesterday to MPs.
He said that, under the terms of the protocol, the UK 'took note' of the
Malaysian government's wish that a promise of aid in support of non-military
projects should amount to no less than 20 per cent of the defence sales.
He pointed out that - with a defence deal potentially worth Pounds 1.5bn in
the making - this would immediately have committed the UK to grant Malaysia
Pounds 300m in cash, three times the annual budget of the scheme which gives
aid to developing countries so that they can secure British contracts. 'We
had to limit the financial commitment involved,' Lord Howe said.
He said that he understood Lord Younger's determination to secure the
defence contract. 'In retrospect we can say it was an error of judgment, but
at the time the main thing was that he got the deal.'
He outlined how senior figures from five Whitehall departments - including
Mr John Major, the then chief secretary to the Treasury - tried to
disentangle the connection between the defence and aid deals after Lord
Younger returned from Kuala Lumpur.
He was also critical of Sir Nicholas Spreckley, Britain's former high
commissioner to Malaysia, saying that he was 'slightly surprised' not to
have received a memorandum on the deal that Lord Younger was planning to
sign.
The commitment to offer Pounds 300m could have undermined contracts signed
with Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Thailand and other developing countries.
It is understood that, under the regulations of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, an aid and trade provision grant can
comprise at most 35 per cent of a total package, the rest of which must be
made up of private-sector money. Lord Younger's commitment might therefore
have forced Britain to find private backers for Pounds 1.5bn of non-military
projects in Malaysia.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Rifkind joins privacy campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The furore over the recent resignation of Air Marshal Sir Peter Harding as
chief of defence staff has won an influential convert to the cause of
privacy legislation.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has decided that the government
should push for privacy laws even if it risks a head-on clash with the
press.
Mr Rifkind is understood to think the security angle used by some newspapers
to justify dwelling on the affair is preposterous.
The government has been determined for some time to introduce criminal
offences for electronic eavesdropping and the use of long-range lenses to
take photographs on private property. These would apply to everyone, and not
just to journalists.
But its original timetable has been subject to numerous delays. It could be
summer before a white paper is published - nearly a year after it was
promised.
The prime minister may, however, decide not to include new privacy measures
in the 1994-95 legislative timetable, in line with a strategy of shelving
radical legislation being urged on him by an influential group of cabinet
ministers.
Sir Peter resigned earlier this month after a newspaper alleged that he was
having an affair with the former wife of a retired Conservative politician.

FT  23 MAR 94 / BCCI auditor defends acceptance of loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, received loans or credit facilities
in two African countries from Bank of Credit and Commerce International, its
audit client, in possible contravention of professional ethical rules.
Mr Graham Stacey, a PW partner in London, said yesterday that he was not
embarrassed by the loans and that they reflected the fact that there were
relatively few banks audited by other firms in the regions in question.
The firm said yesterday that it had also received loans from BCCI in Panama
and Barbados, and that two of its partners in the Cayman Islands had
deposits with the bank.
It said that these transactions had been on normal commercial terms and had
in no way affected its audit judgments on BCCI.
In addition, PW confirmed that one of its partners auditing BCCI's
operations in the United Arab Emirates had been given a Dollars 600 (Pounds
410) carpet by the bank's managing director. It said the partner notified PW
and paid the firm this sum to keep the gift rather than risk offending the
client.
The UK chartered accountants rules that applied at the time state that
'objectivity may be threatened or appear to be threatened by a loan to or
from an audit client'.
They also state that 'objectivity may be threatened or appear to be
threatened by acceptance of goods, services or hospitality from an audit
client' unless the value of any benefit is 'modest'.
BCCI approved a (US) Dollars 215,000 credit facility in 1985 from its
Liberian operation to PW, the local auditors. In the same year it approved a
Pula 100,000 (about Dollars 53,000) loan from its Botswana operation to PW,
the local auditors, for the purchase of a residential property for one of
the firm's partners.
A document outlining the loan in January 1985 includes a handwritten note
that a copy was given to Mr Richard Fear, a PW partner in the Cayman
Islands, for his comments. Both he and Mr Richard Harris, then accountants
with PW in the Caymans and who worked on the BCCI audit, had deposits with
the bank there.
The two African transactions are in addition to loans previously reported of
nearly (Barbados) Dollars 600,000 in Barbados in 1987 and of up to
(US)Dollars 50,000 in Panama by 1985.

FT  23 MAR 94 / MPs 'nowhere near' decision on CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of a Commons committee considering the Pounds 2bn CrossRail
plan for an east-west underground railway link across London yesterday
dismissed claims that the project is doomed.
Mr Tony Marlow, chairman of a committee of MPs considering a bill providing
for the link between British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street
stations, said the committee was 'nowhere near reaching any decision on
anything'.
Mr Marlow, the Conservative MP for Northampton North, spoke after reports
that the committee had accepted evidence that the link would be uneconomic.
His assurance was welcomed by London Transport and British Rail, the
promoters of the bill, which was tabled after Mr John Major, prime minister,
overruled a Treasury attempt to block the project.
The link is regarded as essential by British Rail but Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary to the Treasury, argued that the benefits would not justify
the proposed public investment of Pounds 1bn.
Observers of the committee, which has been sitting for several weeks, say
members have, however, taken a sceptical approach to the project.
The main critic of the bill, Tower Hamlets council in east London, says the
link would cause more congestion than it would relieve.
The council argues that the link should join the proposed high-speed rail
line from London to the Channel tunnel at Stratford, in east London.
The committee is expected to take a decision on the Tower Hamlets argument
after Easter, after further evidence from British Rail and London Transport.
But Mr Marlow told Mr Steven Norris, the London Transport minister, last
Wednesday that the project might not 'stand up' unless this link was agreed.
The bill's promoters yesterday argued that CrossRail would provide greater
benefits than projects such as London's Victoria Line and the Newcastle
Metro. Tower Hamlets disputed the promoters' figures.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Nissan case jury 'misled'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jury in the Nissan UK corporation tax fraud trial was misled over the
guilty plea entered by Mr Frank Shannon, the company's former finance
director, the Court of Appeal was told yesterday.
The claim was made by Mr Alun Jones QC, appearing for Mr Michael Hunt, the
managing director of the former car importer, who was jailed for eight years
last July after being convicted of a Pounds 55m tax fraud against the Inland
Revenue. Mr Hunt is appealing against both his conviction and the length of
his sentence.
Mr Jones said the offence Mr Shannon admitted to - one of cheating the
Revenue - should be declared null and void because the particulars of what
he admitted did not amount to cheating the Revenue.
Mr Shannon made the confession only as the result of a bargain with the
Revenue in which he agreed to settle his outstanding tax liabilities and
plead guilty to the one offence, he said.
The jury hearing the case against Mr Hunt was told, however, that Mr Shannon
had pleaded guilty to a similar charge to one of those brought against Mr
Hunt.
Mr Jones said: 'The jury have simply been misled about what the plea of
guilty is.' Mr Hunt's conviction should therefore be overturned.
The hearing is expected to last five days.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Householders get free legal service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A free legal service has been launched for people living in an area of
Newcastle upon Tyne where harassment, vandalism and other crime has
frightened local residents and driven some from their homes.
The service, set up by Newcastle solicitors Pearson &amp; Caulfield, has been
initiated by Newcastle City Challenge and funded by a Pounds 30,000 grant
from a charitable trust, which requested anonymity.
Mr Jonathan Blackie, Newcastle director of City Challenge, the
government-backed scheme to regenerate urban areas, said he believed the
problems which north Benwell had faced in the last few years were
unparalleled in an area with mixed, predominantly privately-owned, housing.
He said the free legal service would use every device within the law to take
action against criminals.
It will help residents take legal action against the effects of crime and
harassment, and against absent owners and landlords of derelict property,
anti-social residents and statutory bodies if they fail to take necessary
action. This could include Northumbria police and Newcastle city council.
Leaflets about the service, to be launched officially on Monday, are being
circulated to all 2,500 North Benwell residents.
Mr Blackie said: 'We believe it's the first time the residents of an area
have been offered a completely free legal service to tackle their particular
problems.'
North Benwell's difficulties have caused property values to fall, leaving
some owner-occupiers trapped.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Major defends Ulster policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday promised to try to improve Anglo-Irish security
co-operation, as fresh misgivings about the government's Northern Ireland
policy surfaced on the Conservative back benches.
Mr John Wilkinson, Tory MP for Ruislip Northwood, said recent terrorist
attacks showed Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, was right to
say that December's Downing Street declaration had 'run its course'.
Mr Wilkinson said: 'Political progress is dependent on progress on the
security front.'
But Mr Major told MPs he would continue a twin-track approach of pursuing
talks while cracking down on terrorism through cross-border security
co-operation.
This was currently 'at an all-time high', he said. 'We propose to build on
that security co-operation. . . There have been welcome recent successes on
both sides of the border.'
The Commons exchanges came after Irish police announced the discovery of a
suspected IRA weapons hoard near Skreen, County Sligo.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Tory MPs again refuse to list Lloyd's stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, is among nine MPs who are
persisting in refusing to comply with parliamentary rules on the disclosure
of financial dealings in a supplement to the Commons register of members'
interests published yesterday.
The supplement includes declarations by three of 12 MPs who were criticised
by the Commons committee on members' interests for failing to comply with
rules requiring disclosure of dealings with the Lloyd's insurance market.
The 12 MPs, all Conservatives, were urged by the committee to comply without
delay. Only Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, Mr Richard Needham, trade
minister, and Mr Hartley Booth, MP for Finchley, have done so.
Like other Lloyd's members the three MPs have declared the numbers of
Lloyd's syndicates to which they belong, but not details of their personal
exposure or of reinsurance arrangements through stop-loss insurance
policies.
The MPs who have not complied are Mr David Ashby (North West
Leicestershire), Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Michael Colvin
(Romsey and Waterside), Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk North), Mr Roger Knapman
(Stroud), Mr Anthony Steen (South Hams), Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth), Sir
Jerry Wiggin (Weston-super-Mare) and Sir Edward (Old Bexley and Sidcup).
The members' interests committee decided last night to debate the failure of
the MPs to comply with the rules at its first meeting after the Easter
parliamentary recess.
Meanwhile, efforts are to be made to persuade those who have not complied to
do so. One MP who has not supplied the required details said he was 'not
interested in what the committee says'.
Fifty-one Tory MPs have now disclosed past or present membership of Lloyd's
in the register, including five members of the cabinet and nine junior
ministers. Most have declared involvement with loss-making syndicates.
Earlier this week Sir Edward accused Labour MPs of running a 'sleazy'
campaign to undermine Tory MPs after details of MPs' alleged losses at
Lloyd's were published in a Sunday newspaper.

The GPMU print union may have to re-run its presidential election as a
result of allegations of unfair campaigning for candidates by some branches.
Eight candidates are contesting the election to succeed Mr Bryn Griffiths
who is retiring.
One of the candidates, Mr Doug Douglas, alleges that left-wing branches have
been campaigning beyond the rules on behalf of the Liverpool printworker Mr
Ray Williams.
Under the union's strict rules on campaigning, candidates are allowed only

Surgeons are threatening to resign from the National Health Service and sell
their services back to hospitals in protest at government reform of the NHS,
the British Medical Association said yesterday.
Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA's senior hospital doctors committee,
said the move would give surgeons more freedom to decide treatment for
patients based on clinical need rather than according to managers' budgets.
Mr Chawner added: 'What they are thinking about is setting up businesses and
hiring themselves back to the health service on terms they would then agree
with the purchasers.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Labour condemns publicity spending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday attacked the amount being spent on publicity by the
Department for Education and called for an inquiry by the Commons public
accounts committee.
According to parliamentary answers given by the government, education
department spending on publicity has increased from Pounds 103,000 in
1979-80 to Pounds 8.77m in the current financial year. It rose from Pounds
4.52m in 1990-91 to Pounds 8.88m in 1991-92. Spending dipped to Pounds 6.88m
in the following year, to rise again in 1993-94.
Television advertising started in 1990-91 at Pounds 1.1m with Pounds 800,000
spent the next year.
Both the Parent's Charter - part of the Citizen's Charter initiative - and
grant-maintained schools have been heavily publicised.
Mrs Ann Taylor, who speaks for Labour on education, said the advertising was
often 'factually incorrect, designed simply to prop up failing Conservative
education policies'. The department's expenditure was 'a national scandal at
a time when schools are crumbling and cannot afford to buy books'.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Voters scorn water transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 97 per cent of voters in a Strathclyde region referendum have
overwhelmingly rejected plans to remove the Scottish water industry from
local authority control, James Buxton writes.
The government proposals were rejected by 97.2 per cent of the 1.2m who
voted in a postal ballot. Papers were returned by 71.5 per cent of those who
received them - a high turnout for recent UK referendums. Strathclyde region
includes almost half the population of Scotland.
Mr Robert Gould, convener of Strathclyde regional council, which organised
the referendum, called the result 'sensational'. He said the government
'would be very unwise to proceed with their water legislation with less than
3 per cent supporting it'.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, called the referendum 'pseudo-democratic'
and 'meaningless'. The ballot paper had not explained that the status quo in
the water industry could not continue when local government was reorganised.
The government proposes removing water from the nine regional and three
island councils and putting it in the hands of three state-owned authorities
with boards appointed by the Scottish secretary.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Banks clash on role of managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Britain's bank managers became an issue between two of the
largest high street banks last night, as Sir Brian Pearse, Midland chief
executive, underlined their continuing importance.
His remarks came just two days after Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays chief
executive, signalled the increasing role of technology in providing customer
services, such as loan decisions.
In a speech as president of the Institute of Bankers, Sir Brian said he
disagreed with the feeling that lay behind the suggestion that most credit
decisions could be handled by computers.
He said: 'Everywhere I go, customers, professional advisers and the media
bewail the fact that good experienced people are no longer available locally
to discuss problems and seek solutions.'
Sir Brian used the role of the bank manager as an example in his argument
that the main clearing banks were very different in their outlooks. Mr
Taylor had suggested that while people wanted to spend a lot of time with
the 'old-fashioned bank manager of myth' they did not want to pay for doing
so, and that there were not enough skilled staff to go through applications
in the way they used to do.
During the course of last year, Midland put more than 200 senior managers
back into the field. Sir Brian, who is about to retire as Midland chief
executive, said there had been 'a substantial increase' in new business
approaches.
In response to reports of Mr Taylor's comments, Mr Brian Pitman, chief
executive of Lloyds bank, said there was a large task in re-skilling bank
staff, but suggestions of the 'death of the bank manager' sounded slightly
premature.
A one-day strike at Girobank planned for today has been called off after an
improved pay offer to staff.
The National Communications Union, with 2,500 members at the main Girobank
office in Bootle, Merseyside, and a further 1,000 members at other offices
across the country, is to ballot on the new offer.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Post Office to face strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office faces disruption from three industrial disputes over the
coming weeks.
Engineering staff working for the Royal Mail in London voted yesterday to
strike over the proposed closure of half the capital's mechanised letter
offices, starting next month.
The Royal Mail's 5,000 engineering workers around the country are voting in
a strike ballot to oppose the transfer of its building engineering services
to a separate subsidiary company RoMEC. The result will be known next week.
London's main post office workers will strike on March 30 about post office
closures after a three-to-one majority vote in support of industrial action.
But the Royal Mail appears close to agreement with the Union of
Communication Workers on a revised productivity deal for workers after the
original one was rejected last month in a ballot.
Mr Steve Jones, Mount Pleasant sorting office branch secretary of the
National Communications Union, said yesterday: 'Post Office management have
misjudged the mood of our engineering membership about the closure of
mechanised sorting offices in London and we will shortly be issuing notice
of strike action.' He added: 'We would like to see a negotiated settlement,
however this does not seem likely.'
On a 60 per cent turnout, 56 per cent of London's engineering workers backed
industrial action while 82 per cent supported disruption short of an all-out
strike.
Royal Mail said last night that the NCU had 'no mandate' to call its London
engineers on strike and added there was 'no question of any of them being
made redundant'.
The NCU's Mr Jones said: 'We are, without doubt, faced with the most
comprehensive set of attacks we have ever faced. We simply cannot afford to
ignore the consequences of not responding to management's unnecessary and
unjustified actions. Any sign of weakness will see in its wake even greater
attacks on our jobs and conditions.'
The UCW is lobbying parliament on March 30 in support of London post office
counter staff and calling on the public to back their one-day strike.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Matrix QC hits at use of immunity certificates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public confidence in the criminal justice system has been damaged by the
government's attempt to use public interest immunity to prevent documents
being disclosed during the Matrix Churchill trial, the chief prosecutor in
the case told the Scott inquiry yesterday.
Mr Alan Moses QC also said ministers should use their discretion when
considering making PII applications - a stance that contradicts the advice
Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, gave ministers who signed PII
certificates to stop evidence being heard by the Matrix Churchill jury.
Mr Moses said ministers should not apply 'mechanically' for PII
certificates.
They had to use their judgment about whether the release of documents would
really damage the national interest. If they thought disclosure would have
this effect, they were under a duty to apply for PII.
Sir Nicholas, who gives evidence to the inquiry tomorrow, has argued since
the trial that ministers are always under a duty to seek PII and should not
use their discretion.
Mr Moses told Lord Justice Scott: 'A minister would be ill-advised to sign a
certificate unless he was satisfied about the reasoning of the prosecution,
for fear that he would be accused of withholding documents or signing
gagging writs.
'Then he is subjecting himself to the sort of furore that happened in this
case - which is something I can well understand.'
He said the Matrix Churchill trial had produced a reaction that 'we the
public no longer find it acceptable and cannot have faith and trust in a
fair trial if this kind of thing is going on'.
Mr Moses said he had never been told of the reservations held by Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, about signing the PII
certificates.
Had he known of Mr Heseltine's objections he would have used a different
argument in asking for PII to apply.
Mr Moses strongly denied the claim by Mr Andrew Leithead, an assistant
Treasury solicitor, that the reason he had removed an index from documents
to be shown to the judge was in the hope that the judge would be less likely
to read the documents.
With hindsight, he should not have done this, Mr Moses admitted.
He was not, however, trying to deceive the judge, he said. There were very
senior lawyers in the room with him at the time. If they thought it an
illegitimate tactic they should have told him so, he said.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Housing recovery reinforced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of recovery in the housing market came yesterday from a Law
Society study showing a steady increase in the number of conveyancing
transactions and from architects.
The society said the number of transactions was likely to return this year
to 1990 levels at about 1.4m. The number peaked in 1988 at 2.15m and fell to
1.1m in 1991.
The number of solicitors' firms in business continued to rise during the
recession while conveyancing prices and overall income from conveyancing
fell sharply. Since 1986 the real cost of conveying an averagely-priced
house in the Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 50,000 bracket has fallen 53 per cent.
For houses in the Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000 range the fall is 45 per
cent.
Meanwhile, a survey published by the Royal Institute of British Architects
said the outlook for architects' workloads was the best for five years.
The survey said 40 per cent of architects expected their workload to
increase in the next six months compared with 18 per cent who expected
output to fall.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Commons closes Pounds 50m tax loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday voted through a clause of the finance bill which will close a
tax loophole that costs the Treasury Pounds 50m a year.
Clause 123 changes the basis for measuring the profit to be distributed to
the UK by a non-trading tax-haven subsidiary of a UK company if it wishes to
avoid charges from foreign company legislation. Profits must now be
calculated on a tax rather than an accounts basis.
The Treasury said that the legislation would prevent companies from using
mismatches between the two measures of profit to shelter income from UK tax.
Clause 123 was passed in spite of objections from the accountancy
profession. Accountancy bodies have complained that the change reverses the
conclusions of previous consultation and that the clause operates
retrospectively.
The bodies have said that none of the legal safeguards that normally apply
to such tax-avoidance rules were being put into place. The Accounting
Standards Board yesterday called for suggestions on the revision of FRS 1,
the accounting standard dealing with the cashflow statement.
The standard came into force for companies with financial year ends after
March 23 1992.
It has been criticised by accountants and analysts for a series of
ambiguities and inadequacies.
Comments should be received by June 30.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Clarke stands by Budget increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has reaffirmed that the economic recovery
will not be threatened by the tax increases announced in the Budget, which
are due to come in over the next two weeks.
In an article in House magazine, a weekly journal distributed in the Palace
of Westminster, Mr Clarke says he was right to introduce increases in
taxation and cuts in public spending in last November's unified Budget.
He says that he accepted at the time that there would be 'recriminations and
upset as April approached' and that people are still 'a bit shell-shocked'
after the experience of the past few years.
But he remains convinced that he was right to make the reduction in the
public sector borrowing requirement the cornerstone of his proposals.
He says: 'If I had not taken decisive action, confidence would have taken a
serious knock.
'The main topic of economic debate now would not be the outlook for economic
recovery but how much more I would need to raise taxes in the next Budget.
That would create unwelcome uncertainty for people planning their family
finances. And the markets would have judged that this government had lost
the ability to take tough decisions.'
Mr Clarke acknowledged that some areas of the economy faced an uncertain
future.
But he says that low inflation has been the most promising of all economic
indicators in recent months.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Doubts voiced about union merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs of friction are emerging between the GMB and the TGWU, the two big
general unions which are expected to start detailed merger negotiations in
the next three months.
A senior TGWU official said yesterday: 'There has been a definite cooling in
relations, which could be just a blip but could blow up into something much
bigger.'
Five joint reports covering politics, structure, organisation, membership
services and industrial services will be put to both executives by the end
of this month. All have been positive about the proposed merger.
But with conferences of the two unions expected to endorse formal talks in
May and June, groups in both unions have been expressing reservations.
In the TGWU the still-influential hard left has always had reservations
about merging with a union seen as being on the right of the labour
movement. It kept quiet about its concerns in the initial grass-root
enthusiasm for the merger, but has become more outspoken.
In the TGWU bodies comprising ordinary members have much more influence than
full-time officials, which is not the case in the GMB. This difference is
expected to cause difficulty in the negotiations.
In the GMB there are anxieties about being swamped by the still slightly
larger TGWU.
One GMB official said: 'There has been a cooling inside the GMB but I think
that both sides still recognise the logic of merger.'
TGWU members voted by 82.1 per cent in favour of retaining a political fund
on a turnout of 29 per cent. The TGWU's political fund is the second largest
in the union movement, raising Pounds 3m a year.
All unions have to vote every 10 years on retaining a fund.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Smith attacks VAT rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday stepped up its attack on the government's handling of the
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel by accusing Mr John Major of
creating a tax loophole for the better off, David Owen writes.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said it was 'deeply unfair' for the better
off to avoid a tax obligation, which millions of others had to shoulder, by
paying for gas and electricity supplies in advance.
Mr Smith told MPs that the prime minister had revealed 'the Tory attitude to
tax in a nutshell'. This consisted of 'loopholes for the better off and
everyone else has to pay in full'.
In ill-tempered exchanges Mr Major accused Labour of getting up to its 'old
tricks' by telling people how to spend their own money.
He said the Labour leader had chosen not to mention the Pounds 2.5bn over
three years which the government had earmarked to help compensate the less
well-off for higher fuel bills.
The Labour leader's attack came just a day after Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
chancellor, accused gas and electricity companies of depriving the
government of millions of pounds in potential revenue by allowing customers
to pay for future consumption before the introduction of 8 per cent VAT on
fuel on April 1.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Warning on draft insurance law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Draft new legislation from the Department of Trade and Industry threatens
the stability of the insurance market, a firm of solicitors warned
yesterday.
Davies Arnold Cooper said the DTI had muddled the definition of assets in
its proposed law designed to adopt the EC's third non-life insurance
directive.
The firm said the wording would have the effect of de-barring as assets for
solvency purposes insurance and reinsurance debts uncollected after three
months.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Outlook improves for architects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outlook for architects' workloads is the best for five years according
to a survey published today by the Royal Institute of British Architects.
The findings confirm that a slow recovery is under way in the construction
industry.
The institute's survey says 40 per cent of architects expect their workload
to increase over the next six months compared with 18 per cent who expect
output to fall.
New commissions during the final three months of last year were 5 per cent
higher than in the previous three months and 30 per cent higher than in the
corresponding period in 1992.
The survey also showed marked changes in regional workloads with the market
for architectural services in the north of England now as large as that in
London.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Praise aids civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong defence of the independence of the civil service from political
control was made yesterday by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury.
He told a conference organised by the Council of Civil Service Unions that
the civil service was 'the tangible expression of the public-sector ethic
and an asset of real value. I would be wholly opposed to any change which
undermined the enviable reputation of British civil servants for integrity
and political independence'.
Union leaders at the conference expressed pleasure at Mr Dorrell's comments
at a time of mounting criticism about alleged politicisation of the higher
reaches of the civil service.
Mr Dorrell denied that promotion in the civil service was made through
'political cronyism'. He said: 'It is the strength of the civil service
traditions of honesty and independence which make our democracy real.
'The civil service attracts and retains the loyalty of high-quality public
servants because they have the assurance that, as far as is possible in any
human institution, their prospects will be determined by their abilities.'
But he also emphasised the government would continue its policy of
contracting out services which would develop their businesses in competition
with the private sector.
Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, endorsed the call for a new code
of ethics to protect civil servants from political pressures and to govern
their relationship with ministers.

FT  23 MAR 94 / ASB seeks cashflow suggestions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board yesterday called for suggestions on the
revision of FRS 1, the accounting standard dealing with the cashflow
statement.
It wants comments on the details and the type of information the statement
should contain.
The standard was issued in September 1991 as part of the machinery of
financial reporting created as a result of the 1989 Companies Act. It came
into force for companies with financial year ends after March 23 1992.
FRS 1 replaced SSAP 10, the standard which described the format of the
complex source and application of funds statement.
The new standard has since been criticised by accountants and analysts for a
series of ambiguities and inadequacies.
Among the issues it highlights for public comment are the definition of cash
and cash equivalents and the treatment of short-term investments, the format
of the statement and whether items should be shown net or gross.
Comments should be received by June 30.

But he says that low inflation has been the most promising of all economic
indicators in recent months - and that the government has reasserted its
determination to make this a permanent feature of the British economic
landscape.
'If we take due care to keep inflation low, the prospects are brighter than
they have been for a generation,' he says.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Labour attacks publicity spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday attacked the amount being spent on publicity by the
Education Department and called for the Commons public accounts committee to
launch an inquiry.
According to parliamentary answers given by the government Department for
Education spending on publicity has increased from Pounds 103,000 in 1979-80
to Pounds 8.77m in the current financial year. It rose from Pounds 4.52m in
1990-91 to Pounds 8.88m in 1991-92.
Television advertising started in 1990-91 at a cost of Pounds 1.1m with
Pounds 800,000 spent the next year.
Both the Parents' Charter - part of the Citizens' Charter initiative - and
grant-maintained schools have been heavily publicised.
Mrs Ann Taylor, who speaks for Labour on education, said the advertising was
often 'factually incorrect, designed simply to prop up failing Conservative
education policies'. The department's expenditure was 'a national scandal at
a time when schools are crumbling and cannot afford to buy books'.
It is government policy to encourage grant-maintained status, which requires
schools to opt out of local authority control, but not to force them to do
so.
Mrs Taylor said: 'Having legislated to allow parents to choose whether their
children's schools are locally-run or government-controlled, the department
is spending millions putting only one side of the argument.'
The department said the rise was caused by more information being
distributed under the Parents' Charter.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Japan looks at options for Pyongyang sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese government departments and agencies are considering the prospect of
measures against North Korea if the United Nations Security Council adopts
sanctions, Tokyo said yesterday.
The move, revealed by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, marks
Tokyo's growing alarm over North Korea's defiance of international pressure
to open its nuclear sites to full inspections. Pyongyang's suspected
development of missiles capable of reaching Japan, with or without nuclear
warheads, has heightened public anxiety.
Until recently, Japan shared China's reluctance to consider economic
penalties, for fear of further isolating Pyongyang's unpredictable leaders.
But Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told US President Bill Clinton at their
summit last month that Tokyo would take part in sanctions if the Security
Council called for them.
Official Japanese exports to North Korea totalled Dollars 250m (Pounds 148m)
in 1991, making it the country's second largest trade partner after China,
according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. But North Koreans living
in Japan are estimated to remit another Dollars 600m a year in cash.
The possibility of sanctions puts more pressure on the Japanese government
to curb unofficial remittances to North Korea, a sensitive political
problem.
Support for the North Korean regime from the Social Democratic Party, the
largest member of Mr Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, has declined since
last year's visit to South Korea by Mr Sadao Yamahana, the former Socialist
leader. But some analysts believe North Koreans in Japan are generous
contributors to Socialist election funds.
North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme will be on the agenda when
South Korea's President Kim Young-sam meets Mr Hosokawa tomorrow, at the
start of a three-day visit to Japan. They are also expected to discuss US
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and timing of US-South Korean
military exercises.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Kazakhs refuse Russia gas and oil equity stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan yesterday said his country
would not give Russia equity stakes in either the Tengiz oil project or the
Karachaganak gas field being developed in Kazakhstan by western companies.
Russia, which controls the export routes for the two developments, has been
insisting on equity in the fields rather than being paid a tariff.
'Russia will not get an equity share in Tengiz or Karachaganak,' Mr
Nazarbayev said yesterday. He said that on March 28 he was due to meet with
Russian leaders in Moscow to discuss these issues and other economic
disputes between the two republics.
Mr Nazarbayev's statements contradict the views of western businessmen in
Alma Ata who believe Kazakhstan is on the verge of conceding equity in the
two fields to Russia. Tengiz, which is being developed by Chevron of the US,
is producing oil for export. But Chevron has been plagued by disputes with
Russia over the effect on pipelines of contaminants in the oil and the route
of new pipelines.
Karachaganak, which is some way from the export stage, is being developed by
British Gas and Agip of Italy. They have been watching Chevron's troubles
closely.
Mr Nazarbayev yesterday said Kazakhstan was serious about plans to construct
an export pipeline south through Turkey. But this pipeline would only be
built after a joint Russian-Kazakh project to build a pipeline from the
Caspian to a Russian port on the Black Sea.
Together, Mr Nazarbayev's statements indicate an increasing determination on
the part of the Kazakh leadership to lessen the ties which have permitted
Russia to exert its economic domination.
Kazakhstan has complained that many Russian refineries, upon which it is
dependent, refused during the recent severe winter to ship back refined
products to Kazakh suppliers of crude oil.
Mr Nazarbayev, who, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was one of the
most ardent backers of closer integration among former Soviet republics, is
taking a more independent line now that 'co-operation' is taking the form of
Russian domination.
He was furious when the country was ejected from the rouble zone last
autumn. Yesterday he rejected the notion of recreating the zone, describing
it as 'a deluded dream'. Mr Nazarbayev also opposed deployment of
Russian-only peacekeeping forces in other troubled former Soviet republics.
He warned of hardline tendencies in Moscow and said the time had come for
Russians to reconcile themselves to the existence of truely independent
neighbours - a process he believes is only beginning.

FT  23 MAR 94 / N Korea miscalculates in row with South: The US and Seoul
are now more determined to stand together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago, there was optimism that North and South Korea were on the
path to reconciliation and eventual peaceful unification. Events have gone
horribly wrong since then.
Relations have deteriorated to the point where the threat of a military
confrontation on the Korean peninsula has become a frightening possibility.
That did not appear so at the end of 1991, when the US, North Korea and
South Korea began to implement a three-way deal to defuse nuclear tensions.
The US agreed to pull out its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea.
This persuaded North Korea to sign a non-nuclear pact and a non-aggression
treaty with South Korea.
The US responded by holding a high-level meeting with North Korea and
cancelling its Team Spirit military exercise in South Korea for 1992. In
return, North Korea agreed to start allowing the International Atomic Energy
Agency to inspect its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon.
Things became unstuck in the summer of 1992 as the two Koreas negotiated
implementing their non-nuclear pact. Seoul demanded North Korea accept
challenge- or spot-inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in compliance
with the treaty. Pyongyang refused, blocking progress in the inter-Korean
talks.
One problem was that the treaty language governing spot-inspections was
ambiguous. 'The wording in the treaty was poorly drafted,' admits one senior
South Korean foreign ministry official.
Seoul first offered aid to help rescue North Korea's struggling economy if
Pyongyang accepted spot-inspections. When that offer proved fruitless, it
put on pressure in the late autumn of 1992 by asking the US to resume the
Team Spirit exercise in 1993.
Pyongyang had routinely condemned previous Team Spirit exercises as a
rehearsal for a possible attack against North Korea. It also viewed the
resumption of Team Spirit in 1993 as the US reneging on its promise to halt
the exercise if North Korea accepted IAEA inspections. Pyongyang proved
increasingly intransigent, and it is likely the incident reinforced its
distrust of the intentions of the US and South Korea.
'The holding of Team Spirit '93 was a terrible mistake,' said Mr William
Taylor, a prominent North Korea analyst and vice-chairman of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'It has taken us another
year to repair the damage and try to get things back on course.'
Another factor adding to Pyongyang's anxiety was that the staging of Team
Spirit in March 1993 occurred shortly before the expiry of a deadline set by
the IAEA for it to be allowed to inspect two unreported facilities believed
to contain nuclear waste.
Examination of the waste material might confirm IAEA suspicions that North
Korea had produced more bomb-grade plutonium than it had declared after
shutting down its small 5MW reactor in 1989. The US Central Intelligence
Agency estimated the North could have extracted enough plutonium to make one
or two crude nuclear devices.
On March 12, 1993, Pyongyang announced it was withdrawing from the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the first country to do so. It explained it
was taking the action in response to Team Spirit and the IAEA special
inspection demand, which it described as a 'seditious political machination
aimed at forcing us to open military objects and bases, therely leaving us
disarmed militarily.'
If it agreed to the IAEA demand, North Korea said this would create a
precedent for accepting similar spot inspections by South Korea.
Many observers concluded North Korea wanted to drop out of the NPT because
it feared the IAEA was close to discovering Pyongyang was indeed developing
nuclear weapons despite its denials.
North Korea is committed to producing a nuclear weapon because Pyongyang
views it as the ultimate guarantee against the country's absorption by the
South, according to these analysts. But the prevalent theory in Seoul has
been that North Korea was using its threat of NPT withdrawal and the
blocking of international inspections in a desperate attempt to win
concessions.
These would include gaining diplomatic recognition and economic aid from the
US and Japan, reversing the diplomatic defeat North Korea suffered when
China and Russia, its two oldest allies, established relations with South
Korea in the early 1990s. The North has also been seeking the right to
inspect US military bases in South Korea, a promise by the US not to attack
North Korea, and the permanent suspension of Team Spirit.
The view that the North was playing the nuclear card for diplomatic purposes
gained support last summer when it agreed to suspend its NPT withdrawal in
return for the promise of improved ties with the US in the future.
Since then, negotiations on the nuclear dispute have focused on a package
deal in which the US would again suspend Team Spirit and hold a new round of
talks with North Korea on possible diplomatic recognition, if Pyongyang
agreed to allow unrestricted regular inspections by the IAEA and pursue its
talks with South Korea on mutual nuclear inspections.
This would have paved the way for a second stage of negotiations in which
the US might have finally offered to normalise relations with Pyongyang if
it accepted spot inspections by the IAEA. But the North has remained
stubborn on two points in concluding the initial package deal.
Apparently fearing that the US would not fulfil its end of the bargain, it
has insisted Washington make simultaneous concessions in any trade-off with
Pyongyang. The US and South Korea, equally distrustful of North Korea, have
demanded Pyongyang make the first steps in the fulfilment of any agreement.
The North apparently made a concession in this regard recently when it
agreed to allow an IAEA inspection team into Yongbyon on condition that the
US would suspend Team Spirit if the results proved satisfactory.
But the North's subsequent refusal to allow the IAEA to carry out crucial
tests after completing at least 80 per cent of its inspections might have
been an attempt to retain 'leverage' in its dealings with the US on Team
Spirit, South Korean officials say.
The North has also proved reluctant in dealing with the South in the
negotiations over mutual nuclear inspections. 'North Korea obviously wants
to pursue its policy of improving relations with the US while delaying
inter-Korean dialogue, with the eventual aim of eliminating Seoul's links
with the US,' Mr Chung Jong-uk, national security adviser to South Korea's
President Kim Young-sam, said. The North might have been hoping to play off
Seoul against Washington in an attempt to improve its bargaining position
and win new concessions.
But if the North believed it could exploit such differences, it has badly
miscalculated after it broke off talks with the South last weekend. It has
angered the South and the US and strengthened their co-operation and
determination in confronting the North.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Foreign investment in India up eightfold in year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investment in India is estimated to have risen eightfold in the year
ending this month to about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn), far above the
government's targets and the most optimistic private forecasts.
Announcing the figure at a business conference yesterday, Mr Manmohan Singh,
finance minister, urged businessmen to make further investment commitments,
saying the economic reforms carried out since 1991 required 'a vigorous
response from both foreign and Indian investors'.
The estimated total includes about Dollars 1.5bn in direct investment and
about Dollars 3.5bn in foreign fund managers' investment in Indian stock
markets and overseas issues made by Indian companies.
The figures measure actual inflows, not investment approvals, and compare
with a total of Dollars 585m for 1992-93.
The big inflow of portfolio investment reflects the fact that India's
financial markets were largely closed to foreign investors until late 1992
and the general popularity of investment in emerging markets, as well as
growing appreciation of India's prospects.
The Dollars 5bn estimated total for 1993-94 compares with a forecast of
Dollars 3bn published in the government's annual Economic Survey only a
month ago. At the start of the financial year, finance ministry officials
expected inflows of up to Dollars 2bn at most.
They believed it would take years for inward investment to pick up speed.
They are pleased actual inflows exceed their forecasts but there is concern
that a large element of the inflow is portfolio investment, which could be
reversed if fund managers sell their holdings.
The government's policy is to encourage direct investment, especially in
infrastructure.
Mr Singh said India remained committed to further reforms, including
liberalisation of foreign exchange rules, financial markets and trade
policy.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Drugs groups slow R&amp;D investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The growth of investment in pharmaceuticals research and development
decelerated steeply last year, because of health care reforms and efforts to
cut spending on medicines.
The world's top 38 companies that have so far reported their results
increased their R &amp; D expenditure by only 9.6 per cent last year. That
compares with industry growth rate during the 1980s of between 16 and 20 per
cent.
The investment slow down follows industry warnings that R &amp; D spending was
unsustainable because of government intervention to control drugs prices and
consumption. Pharmaceutical groups have been struggling with poor growth
rates in the world's most important medicines markets. The increase in drug
sales in the top seven European market declined from 8 per cent in 1992 to
only 1 per cent last year.
Most drugs groups have responded by cutting marketing and administrative
overheads for the last two years. None had previously dared cut R&amp;D, viewed
as the life-blood of the industry.
But last year, among the top 38 pharmaceuticals groups, five companies
(three in the US, one in Europe and one in Japan) were forced to reduce
expenditure. They included Monsanto, Marion Merrell Dow and Parke Davis of
the US, Ares Serono of Switzerland, and Shionogi in Japan.
Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research
Institute, warned: 'The heady days of R&amp;D are over.' Between 1981 and 1993,
pharmaceuticals R&amp;D spending rose from Dollars 5.4bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in 1981
to Dollars 26.5bn, according to the UK-based Centre for Medicines Research.
'Although the immediate effects will be limited because of the time it takes
to develop new medicines, in the longer term the flow of innovative
medicines is being threatened,' Mr Bryan Wright, representative in Japan of
the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, said.
European companies appear to have been less affected than their US
counterparts. The top-10 European groups that have so far reported figures
increased their R&amp;D spending by an average of 15.4 per cent from Dollars
6.09bn in 1992 to Dollars 7.1bn last year. They spent, on average, 16.9 per
cent of sales on R&amp;D. Groups whose spending rose the most included Wellcome
(30.6 per cent), Glaxo (24.2 per cent), and SmithKline Beecham (20.2 per
cent).
The top 10 US groups increased their R&amp;D spending 8.8 per cent from Dollars
7.85bn last year to Dollars 8.5bn. On average, they invested 11.2 per cent
of their turnover in R&amp;D. The top five Japanese companies raised their
spending only 6.6 per cent from Dollars 1.78bn to Dollars 1.9bn, investing
11.4 per cent of their sales.
Those groups spending least have been most hit by the reforms. Among the
lower-level spenders of the top 38 companies, R&amp;D spending increased only
5.1 per cent.
The US figures follow a warning by the American Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers' Association that its members expect to increase R&amp;D spending
only 9.4 per cent this year, the first single-digit increase since 1977.
That compares with average annual growth of 16 per cent between 1980 and
1992. About 20 member companies forecast their R&amp;D investment growth rate
would fall during 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy stagnated last year, with a 0.1 per cent rise in gross
domestic product, the government announced yesterday. This was the worst
performance since 1974, just after the first oil price shock.
The figures follow a 2.2 per cent decline in the final quarter of 1993
compared to the same period of the previous year. This decline was not as
bad as the market expected.
Private sector economists in Tokyo said the quarterly drop might be the
bottom of an economic downturn which has lasted since mid-1991, the longest
in post-war history. GDP rose by a revised 1.1 per cent in 1992, down from
4.3 per cent in the previous year.
The Economic Planning Agency, the government's official economic forecaster,
was cautious yesterday. There were bright signs, such as an increase in
personal consumption, but it was too early to say for sure whether the
recession had come out of the trough, said Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, the agency's
vice minister. The EPA's caution is understandable, given the criticism it
attracted early last year, when it declared an upturn and was proved wrong.
'This is at least the end of the decline, but there is still no sign of an
upturn because of a continued decline in investment in plant and equipment
and the strength of the yen,' said Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at
Nomura Research Institute. 'I am prepared to bet this is the bottom of the
cycle,' said Mr Jim Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
Tokyo.
Mr Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of the Japan Renewal party, which
is the main influence on government economic policy, believed the economy
would recover in the second half of this year to stabilise at a growth rate
of around 3 per cent for the rest of the decade.
However, analysts warned that recovery prospects could be damaged by the
political impasse over the 1994 budget, which could delay extra government
spending and income tax cuts. Recent increases in Japan's long term interest
rates could also hamper recovery, warned Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior
economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo.
Personal consumption rose by 1.1 per cent last year, or by 0.7 per cent
between the third and fourth quarters, indicating that consumer spending has
been relatively resilient to the weak labour market. In another bright sign,
private housing investment grew by 3.7 per cent during the year, or 1.8 per
cent in the last quarter, helped by cheap government-backed mortgages.
On the gloomy side, corporate investment fell by 8.4 per cent last year, of
which 3.5 per cent was in the final quarter. The continued strength in the
yen, which hit a record high of nearly Y100 to the US dollar in August, has
hit exports, which were down 2.2 per cent from the third to the fourth
quarters.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Israel and PLO to resume talks in Cairo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli and PLO peace negotiators are to meet again today in Cairo, having
failed during two days of talks in Tunis to agree conditions for resuming
peace talks on Palestinian autonomy suspended following last month's Hebron
mosque massacre.
The stumbling blocks appear to be Israel's refusal to allow an armed
international force to be deployed in the occupied territories to protect
Palestinians, and its rejection of PLO demands for the evacuation of the 400
Jewish settlers who live in the heart of Arab Hebron.
Israel's foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, usually optimistic where Middle
East peace prospects are concerned, seemed downhearted yesterday, speaking
of the 'many obstacles' to be overcome before talks could resume. He firmly
ruled out any prospect of a summit meeting soon between Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman - that would signal
the negotiations were back on track.
The US peace talks co-ordinator, Mr Dennis Ross, and Mr Terje Roed Larsen,
Norway's foreign ministry envoy, both of whom tried to help mediate a
breakthrough in Tunis, flew to Cairo yesterday in anticipation of today's
talks. According to Israeli and Palestinian sources, the two sides did agree
on certain aspects of a Norwegian proposal, for the temporary deployment of
international observers in Gaza, Jericho and Hebron, but the PLO insisted
that these observers be armed, a proposal Israel rejected.
Norway yesterday called for an emergency meeting of more than 20 donor
countries, also to be held in Cairo tomorrow, to discuss arrangements for a
Palestinian police force, originally intended to take over from Israeli
forces after their eventual withdrawal. The donor countries will be
represented by embassy officials.
Officials and diplomats close to the talks said the meeting was likely to
discuss the possible early deployment of a contingent of Palestinian police
in Hebron should this form part of the negotiated solution.
Today's Cairo talks are expected to be headed by Major General Amnon Shahak
on the Israeli side and Mr Nabil Shaath for the Palestinians - the two men
who had headed the now-stalled talks on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and
Jericho.
The Israeli team, which was last night briefing Mr Rabin on the Tunis talks,
also ruled out PLO calls for the removal of Jewish settlers from Hebron. The
settlers themselves threatened yesterday to use all means short of shooting
soldiers to resist attempts to evacuate them, and said they were considering
ways to increase the Hebron settler population.

<TEXT>
Somalia's rival warlords yesterday postponed a ceremony of national
reconciliation for the second time this week, writes Leslie Crawford in
Nairobi
The postponement is an embarrassment to the UN, which has been sponsoring
the negotiations in Nairobi in the hope of reaching a political settlement
before US troops complete their withdrawal on Friday. The departure of US
and European peacekeepers has been triggered in part by the unwillingness of
rival Somali clans to make peace.
At issue is how 15 different clans and numerous sub-clans are to share power
in a future Somali government. The struggle for hegemony has destroyed
Somalia's civil institutions and placed the country in the hands of gunmen.
The year-old UN Operation in Somalia (Unosom) has been unable to enforce
peace. Western diplomats say the country has exhausted patience and
willingness to help.
Mr George Bennett, Unosom spokesman, said the reconciliation ceremony had
been cancelled because the 15 participating Somali factions could not agree
on who should be a signatory to the agreement, which includes a
power-sharing arrangement for a national government.
The reconciliation ceremony has been rescheduled for today.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Fed steers course between White House and markets: Michael
Prowse examines the background to Alan Greenspan's action to increase the
Fed funds rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After keeping financial markets on tenterhooks for several hours yesterday,
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, duly announced the expected
tightening of monetary policy.
A move by the Fed was seen by markets as almost certain following President
Bill Clinton's decision last week to summon Mr Greenspan to the White House
for talks on economic policy. Had the Fed not moved after the White House
meeting, it would have been accused of bowing to political pressure.
Long-term yields, already nearly 7 per cent, might have moved even higher -
something that would have upset both the Fed and the Clinton administration.
But the quarter point increase in the Federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent
signalled by Mr Greenspan was not exactly a decisive move. It was the
smallest increase the Fed could have announced. It was not accompanied, as
some analysts had hoped, by an increase in the discount rate which remains
at 3 per cent.
A rise in the latter, say to 3.5 per cent, would have created a bigger
splash. In US newspapers, discount rate changes make the front page while
quarter point shuffles in the Fed funds rate are buried in the business
sections.
Mr Greenspan is thus pursuing the same 'softly-softly' approach he adopted
when lowering rates during the recession. Yesterday's move followed rather
than led market expectations: three month Treasury bill rates, for example,
had already risen sharply.
But Fed-watchers were intrigued that Mr Greenspan, as in his first
tightening move on February 4, followed Bundesbank procedure in formally
announcing the increase in rates. In the past, the Fed has left financial
markets to work out for themselves whether a change in pressure on reserve
positions signals an increase in short-term rates.
The new approach seems designed to counter congressional criticism of Fed
secrecy. But one side-effect will be to increase greatly the volatility of
financial markets on the day when the Fed holds a meeting of its
policy-making open market committee. And it will not mollify leading
congressional Democrats, such as Mr Henry Gonzales, chairman of the house
banking committee, who last week described Fed policy as a 'true
abomination'.
In financial markets, the immediate reaction to the Fed's announcement
yesterday was positive. Share and bond prices rose sharply, reflecting
relief that a debilitating period of uncertainty was over. But the relief
could prove short-lived.
After all, Mr Greenspan signalled in congressional testimony last month that
the Fed wanted to raise rates from the abnormally low levels of recent years
to a 'neutral' level - one consistent with sustainable non-inflationary
growth. Given an underlying inflation rate of 2.5-3 per cent, a neutral
level of short-term rates is generally taken to be about 4-5 per cent. Until
short-term rates reach this level financial markets are likely to remain
jittery, constantly wondering when the next rate increase will be announced.
'It is unlikely that this marks the conclusion of a move to a neutral
policy,' said Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the New
York brokerage. In his view, the way to ease bond market jitters is to raise
rates rapidly to about 4 per cent. Having moved decisively, the Fed could
then afford to sit back and see if it had done enough to convince markets it
was serious about controlling inflation.
'This is not enough,' says Mr Mickey Levy, chief economist at NationsBank in
New York. He believes further rate increases will be needed in coming months
to cool an economy that has acquired 'significant momentum'.
Recently revised figures showed the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.5
per cent in real terms in the fourth quarter of last year. And a raft of
data in the past few weeks - from car sales to industrial production -
suggest that the pace of growth remains robust in the first quarter of this
year, despite the adverse impact of severe winter weather.
But while a more decisive tightening of monetary policy might be the best
way to allay fears in financial markets and thus bring down long bond
yields, Mr Greenspan may feel he cannot afford to ignore the views of the
Clinton administration which has still to fill two vacant seats on the Fed's
seven-member board of governors.
The White House has argued repeatedly that inflation pressures are minimal,
implying that it sees little rationale for further increases in rates.
Yesterday, perhaps trying to make amends for the confusion in markets
created by Mr Clinton's ill-timed meeting with Mr Greenspan, the Treasury
issued a short statement reiterating its support for Fed independence. 'The
administration and the Fed have the same objective: sustainable economic
growth and low inflation,' it said.
However, administration economic forecasts last month were based on the
assumption that short-term interet rates would average 3.4 per cent this
year. The tightening of policy announced by Mr Greenspan yesterday means
this target rate has already been exceeded.
It is thus safe to predict a period of continuing tension between the White
House and the Fed, protestations of cordiality notwithstanding.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Clinton to face fresh scrutiny on Whitewater
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In a fresh blow to President Bill Clinton it now appears certain that the US
House and Senate will conduct fully-fledged hearings into the Whitewater
affair, possibly as early as next month.
Last night, following an agreement between Mr Tom Foley, the speaker, and Mr
Bob Michel, the Republican leader, the House voted by 408 to 15 calling on
the two party heads to work out 'an appropriate timetable' for hearings
without interfering in the work of the independent counsel. As with the
Senate, no grants of immunity from prosecution will be given to those
summoned to testify.
The bipartisan agreement marks the end of Democratic resistance to the idea
of wide-ranging hearings into the tangled tale of the Clintons' financial
and land dealings in Arkansas in the 1970s and 1980s. It ensures the
spotlight will remain focused on Whitewater to the regret of a president
trying to get his domestic agenda back on track.
Yesterday's announcement followed the postponement of a House banking
committee session which could have provided the first congressional forum
for Whitewater.
The committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Henry Gonzalez, the Texas
Democrat, was due to review the semi-annual report of the Resolution Trust
Corporation, the agency created to clear up the savings and loan debacle of
the 1980s.
A bankrupt Arkansas S&amp;L, Madison Guaranty, has been implicated in the
Whitewater affair. Both Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary and Mr
Roger Altman, his deputy and acting head of the RTC, were scheduled to
testify.
In postponing the committee hearings, Mr Gonzalez first accused Congressman
Jim Leach, the ranking Republican, of seeking to transform them into a
'judicial adventure' against the president. But later, in a letter to Mr
Foley, he said he favoured House hearings 'in a forum of broad reach -
possibly a select committee - that can explore all the charges ..'
Mr Gonzalez insisted the end result would show these charges were without
foundation, but it was enough for Mr Foley to institute meetings with the
Republican hierarchy yesterday to determine what would be done and when.
In Little Rock Mr David Hale, a former Arkansas judge, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and fraud in an unrelated case as part of a bargain with Mr
Robert Fiske, the independent Whitewater counsel. Mr Hale alleges Mr Clinton
pressed him to make a small business loan to one of the Whitewater partners.
Mr Clinton said this was 'a load of bull'.

FT  23 MAR 94 / US trade deficit rises to Dollars 6.3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit in goods and services rose sharply to Dollars 6.3bn in
January against Dollars 4.1bn in December, the Commerce Department said
yesterday, Michael Prowse reports.
The monthly figures were the first to include data on trade in services.
Until yesterday, the US published monthly data only on merchandise trade -
or trade in goods.
By excluding a large surplus on services these gave a misleading impression
of the US's overall trade performance.
The increase in the overall trade deficit mainly reflected a sharp fall in
exports from Dollars 57.3bn to Dollars 54.5bn, partly offset by a smaller
drop in imports from Dollars 61.4bn to Dollars 60.8bn.
The larger-than-expected fall in exports - reflecting weakness of demand in
overseas markets - indicates that trade may act as a drag on US economic
growth in the first quarter, partly offsetting the strength of domestic US
demand.
Yesterday's figures highlighted the sharp divergence in US trade performance
in the goods and services sectors.
The deficit in trade in goods rose to Dollars 11bn from Dollars 8.7bn in
December. The surplus on services rose to Dollars 4.7bn against Dollars
4.6bn in December.
The merchandise trade deficit on the old basis rose to Dollars 9.8bn in
January against Dollars 7.4bn in December. This differs from the reported
Dollars 11bn deficit in trade in goods because the latter is calculated on a
'balance of payments' rather than 'census' basis.
The census figures are based on physical movements of goods whereas the
balance of payments figures also reflect changes in the ownership of goods.
The two reporting methods also differ in the way they treat gold and
military contracts. Generally figures on the balance of payments correspond
more closely to international definitions.
The revised and expanded monthly trade figures were 'important for raising
our awareness of how our economy works and how our nation competes in global
markets,' said Mr Dave Barram, deputy commerce secretary.
'We live and work in an economy in which the software is as important as the
hardware ..our service and manufacturing sectors grow increasingly
interwoven,' he said.
Since the late 1980s the US surplus on services has increased steadily -
from Dollars 12.1bn in 1988 to Dollars 55.7bn last year. The deficit on
goods fell from Dollars 127bn in 1988 to a trough of Dollars 73.8bn in 1991
during the recession but then begin rising as the US economy recovered,
reaching Dollars 132.5bn last year.
The rise in the surplus on services has thus offset to a considerable degree
the deterioration on goods. The services surplus last year was nearly 60 per
cent as large as the deficit on goods. The deficit on goods and services
combined, at Dollars 76.8bn last year, is thus sharply lower than the
Dollars 114.9bn registered in 1988.
The main components of the services account are: business services (surplus
of Dollars 22.8bn last year); tourism and travel (surplus of Dollars
20.8bn); royalties and licence fees (surplus of Dollars 15.7bn); and
government transactions including military (deficit of Dollars 2.6bn).
The sharpest improvement in the US services account since the mid-1980s has
been in travel and tourism. Exports of business services have grown roughly
in line with exports and goods and less rapidly than imports of business
services. Many analysts thus expect the services surplus to stabilise rather
than continue growing rapidly.

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in the Mexican state of Chiapas, has
sought to end speculation about his political ambitions by apparently ruling
himself out as a presidential contender this August.
'If it continues to look as if my priority is to become a candidate for the
presidency of the republic, this could end up damaging the peace process,'
Mr Camacho said.
'Between seeking a candidacy for the presidency and the contribution I can
make to the peace process in Chiapas, I choose peace,' he said.
However, in giving his work in Chiapas as the reason for not seeking the
presidency, Mr Camacho left open the admittedly small possibility his
presidential ambitions might return if the conflict in Chiapas were
resolved, or if he were no longer needed in the state. Mr Camacho made clear
he still wanted to be president, but not at the cost of peace in Chiapas.
Despite the potential ambiguity, news of Mr Camacho's announcement led to a
sharp recovery in the Mexican stockmarket yesterday which closed 5.4 per
cent up. The New York-quoted stock of Telefonos de Mexico ended the day up
11.2 per cent. Over the past six weeks the stock market has lost about 17
per cent of its value on political uncertainty.
Mr Camacho, a former Mexico City mayor and foreign minister, is one of the
best known and most powerful members of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party. His candidacy could have split the party, and thrown
this August's presidential election wide open.

Despite the potential ambiguity, news of Mr Camacho's announcement led to a
sharp recovery in the Mexican stockmarket yesterday. By noon it was up 3.7
per cent. The New York-quoted stock of Telefonos de Mexico was up by 7.2 per
cent at 1pm. The peso also strengthened slightly.
Mr Camacho, a former Mexico City mayor and foreign minister, is one of the
best known and most powerful members of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party. His candidacy could have split the party, and thrown
this August's presidential election wide open.
The political uncertainty caused by his rumoured candidacy contributed to
sharp declines in the Mexican stockmarket and peso, and consternation in the
government. Over the past six weeks the stock market has lost about 17 per
cent of its value, and the peso has depreciated by more than 6 per cent
against the dollar.
The situation in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas has also become
more tense in recent weeks. Big landlords are engaged in a struggle over
land with sympathisers of the Zapatista rebels, who launched a rebellion in
the state at the New Year.
Mr Camacho believes that speculation about his presidential candidacy was
complicating efforts to bring the sides together.
He also said that in the current electoral climate he would not seek to be a
senator, nor would any member of his negotiating team in Chiapas seek
political office. But he said he would continue in politics, seeking
democratic reforms, and responding to the needs of the population.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Cigarette tax may rise Dollars 1.25
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anti-smoking advocates won a significant battle yesterday when an
influential congressional health committee voted to raise the tax on
cigarettes by Dollars 1.25 (84 pence) a packet to help pay for a reform of
the healthcare system, far more than the 75 cent increase proposed in
President Bill Clinton's health plan.
The stiff tobacco tax increase, which could raise an estimated Dollars 16bn
a year, passed the health panel of the House of Representatives Ways and
Means committee by a 6-5 vote, but could fall by the wayside as healthcare
legislation goes through Congress.
Mr Clinton had originally considered a steep increase in the tobacco tax,
partly to raise revenue to pay for aspects of his reform plan and partly to
act as a severe disincentive to smoking, but backed down to 75 cents to
placate congressmen from tobacco-producing states in the south-east.
Mr Clinton's efforts to push healthcare reform have appeared to lose
momentum in recent weeks, but a legislative package is still being
painstakingly crafted in Congress.
One draft now being circulated by the House energy and commerce committee,
under the chairmanship of Mr John Dingell of Michigan, would eliminate the
requirement that all but the largest companies be required to buy health
insurance for their employees through government-run 'health alliances'.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Christopher defends China line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US will not back down from its demands that China improve its human
rights record as a condition for extending trade benefits, Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday.
In a signed column in the Washington Post, Mr Christopher wrote that 'our
specific conditions for renewing MFN (most favoured nation trading status)
are reasonable and attainable. . . . We are not asking China to apply
American prescriptions, only to adhere to the universal standards of human
rights that bind most nations in the world today.'
His unrepentant article may be seen as a clear rebuttal of critics who claim
his recent mission to China was a diplomatic disaster. But it also
underlines differences in the administration over whether withholding trade
privileges, which may prompt retaliation against US businesses, is the best
way to improve human rights in China.
Senior officials of both the treasury and commerce department have argued
publicly that US commercial openings should not be sacrificed to the human
rights concerns of the state department.
At the weekend, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, hoped 'alternatives'
could be worked out. Last week another senior White House official reflected
the dilemma by saying that it was 'untenable' both that MFN not be renewed
and that China's human rights record be ignored.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trade negotiators yesterday agreed the broad outlines of a work programme on
trade and the environment to be carried out by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and its successor, the World Trade Organisation.
The draft document, to be approved by ministers when they meet next month in
Marrakesh to sign the Uruguay Round trade accords, establishes a committee
on trade and environment with an initial two-year life-span. Further
extension of the committee's mandate will be discussed at the first WTO
ministerial conference in 1996.
The draft strikes a compromise between industrialised countries, notably the
US, which wanted a permanent committee, and some developing nations which
wanted to give it a fixed term.
The committee, to be set up shortly after the Marrakesh meeting, will have
broad terms of reference which stress the need to make trade and environment
policies mutually supportive.
The document outlines seven categories of issues the committee may explore.
These include the impact on market access of environmental measures and
whether fair trade rules need to be modified to accommodate multilateral
environmental agreements with trade provisions.
Trade officials said yesterday the document was drafted broadly enough to
encompass any trade-related environmental issue, including such
controversial areas as 'processing and production methods' (discriminating
between products according to how they are produced) and 'eco-dumping'
(allegedly unfair competition from countries with low environmental
standards). However, they expect the committee to start with less emotive
issues such as eco-labelling.

The diplomatic manoeuvring for the post-Marrakesh Gatt negotiations gathered
pace yesterday after France called for the European Union to take a tougher
line with the US and other Gatt members in the long-running negotiations
over liberalising financial services.
In a strongly worded memorandum issued to a meeting of finance ministers on
Monday, France demanded that the EU retain its threat to maintain
'reciprocal' restrictions in Europe's financial services if the US and
others did not offer to liberalise theirs.
'In the context of (continuing discrimination against European banks). . . .
the European Union should not abandon its recourse to reciprocity,' the
memorandum said. This step would be needed to protect European banks from
the risk of discrimination in other markets.
The EU is due to reopen formal discussions with the US and other Gatt
members over the liberalisation of the financial services after next month's
Marrakesh meeting. They failed to reach agreement over the issue at the
final Gatt meeting last December.
So far, the Commission has refused to indicate whether Union would maintain
reciprocal controls if these new negotiations fail to reach an accord within
the six-month deadline set for them.
The barriers, which were introduced under a recent European banking
directive, allow the EU to take action against the banks of countries which
are imposing similar restrictions.
But Brussels officials yesterday insisted that the Commission was unlikely
to bow to French demands. 'The common position among the member states is
let's wait and see what happens in the negotiations,' said one.

FT  23 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US rocks shipbuilding subsidy talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected shift of position by the US has thrown into disarray
international negotiations aimed at reducing shipbuilding subsidies, just as
other countries had offered concessions removing some of the biggest
obstacles to agreement.
The US surprised other delegations at talks at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development in Paris last week by insisting on the freedom
to require that ships financed by its export credit schemes be built in US
yards.
Though such 'home-build' provisions are a normal feature of most export
credit schemes, the demand that they be formalised in a legal requirement is
seen by other delegations as an attempt to establish a principle which is
both unacceptable and contrary to the purpose of the negotiations.
The US demand followed important concessions at last week's meeting by Japan
and South Korea, which had been widely regarded as taking the most
inflexible positions in the five-year-long talks.
The two countries finally agreed to the establishment of an international
anti-dumping code for ships, to prevent 'injurious pricing'. Substantial
progress has also been made on the detailed provisions of such a code.
In addition, Japan has agreed to modify the terms of shipbuilding credits
provided by the Japan Development Bank, to bring them into line with tighter
restrictions on financing demanded by the US.
However, because a successful outcome of the negotiations depends on a
complex package deal, these concessions could be put in jeopardy if the
last-minute US shift makes overall agreement impossible.
The latest turn of events creates a particularly awkward problem for the
European Union. The Commission is expected to take a firm line with the US,
because it sees an agreement in the OECD as crucial to its efforts to phase
out national shipbuilding subsidies in Europe.
There is a danger that the US demands could undermine EU cohesion on the
issue if some shipbuilding industries and member governments, particularly
in southern Europe, seize on them as a pretext to press for a relaxation of
national subsidy rules.
A further obstacle to agreement is the US refusal to negotiate a repeal of
the Jones Act, which requires that a fixed proportion of cargo passing
through US ports be carried in US-registered ships. However, it is thought
that a way could be found around this problem by gradually relaxing the
application of the act.
Prospects for breaking the deadlock will depend on a report being drawn by
Mr Staffan Sohlman, Sweden's ambassador to the OECD, who is chairing the
talks. If he believes scope for compromise remains, he will reconvene the
negotiations, probably late next month.
The negotiations, which were originally instituted under pressure from the
US, involve the world's largest shipbuilding countries. They also include
Finland, Norway and Sweden.

FT  23 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Japan 'trapped' by chip imports deal -
Michiyo Nakamoto on the implications of latest semiconductor market figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The apparently favourable figures for foreign share of the Japanese
semiconductor market released last week have been greeted with both relief
and resentment in Tokyo.
On the one hand, the 20.7 per cent market share for the last quarter of 1993
is welcomed as proof of the tremendous effort that Japanese semiconductor
users have made to increase market access for foreign manufacturers since
the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement in 1991.
'The industry has worked very hard (to that end) in the last quarter,' says
an official at the Electronics Industry Association of Japan.
At the same time, however, there is resentment at US pressure on Japan to
ensure that 'gradual and steady improvement in foreign market share continue
throughout the duration of the arrangement,' as Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative said with the announcement of the fourth-quarter figures.
Mr Tadahiro Sekimoto, chairman of the EIA, said recently that from the
industry's point of view it would have been better not to have had the
semiconductor agreement at all.
'We are troubled by the (20 per cent) figure which was an expectation but
which has been turned into a target. If the agreement is to be continued we
want the figure taken out.'
Mr Sekimoto's is a personal opinion, but it is shared by many of those
affected by the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement. 'We all want to call it
quits,' says one Japanese industry member.
The resentment stems from what is seen as a no-win deal that has caught
Japanese semiconductor users in a bind. If the aim of the arrangement to
improve market access for foreign markers is not reached, Japan risks US
threats of retaliation. At the same time, however, if that goal is achieved
it risks supporting the perception that targets work in Japan.
During the ill-fated framework negotiations, for example, under which the US
had been asking for 'objective criteria' in measuring progress in opening
markets, the semiconductor arrangement was cited by US officials as an
example of how numerical targets could be successfully used to obtain
results in Japan.
No matter how loudly Japanese officials state that there has never been any
commitment on market share in the semiconductor arrangement - which notes
only Japanese government recognition that the US industry 'expects that the
foreign market share will grow to more than 20 per cent . . . by the end of
1992', few in the US seem to heed their words.
Behind US pressure on the semiconductor issue is a misguided perception of
how things work in Japan, laments one industry official. The ministry of
international trade and industry has influence, but not enough to raise the
foreign market share with a few tough words, he says.
Nevertheless, for the trade ministry as well, the bilateral arrangement has
left little choice but to apply pressure on Japanese industry and achieve a
target it does not officially recognise.
At the end of 1992, the key year in which foreign market share was expected
by the US to reach 20 per cent, ministry officials pleaded with companies to
buy foreign semiconductors even if it meant they would have to throw them
away later, according to one industry member.
While the share of foreign semiconductors in Japan did reach 20 per cent at
the time, US pressure has far from diminished. Earlier this year, when the
figure fell below 20 per cent for three consecutive quarters, the US
requested an emergency consultation and asked Japan to adopt an action
programme to stem the decline.
'It is strange for the US to ask us to adopt an action plan to boost imports
when in fact US suppliers have not always been able to meet Japanese demand
due to a shortage of supplies,' complains Mr Koji Matsui, deputy director of
the industrial electronics division at the trade ministry.
Meanwhile, the US Semiconductor Industry Association has said it believes
the foreign semiconductor share will reach between 25 and 30 per cent by
1996. The Japanese industry is worried the US might again take this figure
as a target and press Japan to achieve it.
The concern in Japan is that, with a mid-term review of the semiconductor
arrangement due by the end of July this year, and against the background of
frustration over the stalled framework negotiations, the US may seek to win
greater commitments in semiconductor trade, including a government guarantee
of market share.
Some in the trade ministry believe that unless it can be made clear that the
semiconductor arrangement has no market share commitment, the deal itself
should be scrapped.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forecast French economic growth of 1.4 per cent this year was 'not enough'
to make an appreciable dent in unemployment, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the
economics minister, said yesterday, but he believed the recovery 'could be
more vigorous than foreseen'. Commenting on yesterday's price and trade
figures, the minister said the 0.3 per cent rise in consumer prices in
February showed France had little to fear from renewed inflation. The fall
in the trade surplus to FFr2.7bn (Pounds 300m) in January was only a
correction from an abnormally high surplus of FFr13.2bn in December. Exports
rose at 4 per cent a year from October 1993 to January 1994, compared to a
3.6 per cent growth in imports.
The German social security budget reached a record DM1,063bn (Pounds 413bn)
in 1993, equivalent to a third of the total budget, although spending on
social security in eastern Germany fell to 70 per cent of GNP from 73.1 in
1992.
Russia's grain harvest is forecast to fall to 90m tonnes this year, from 99m
tonnes last year, but the country will not need to import grain for at least
the next two years.
Hungary's current account saw a record deficit of Dollars 3.45bn, or 9 per
cent of gross domestic product, in 1993. Exports fell 17 per cent while
imports increased by 7 per cent.

FT  23 MAR 94 / No reformist spring on Ukraine farms: Jill Barshay tests the
political climate in the countryside before parliamentary elections on
Sunday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The only outspoken reformist candidate in Ukraine's poor farm village of
Yaroslavka, who promised to privatise the land and let the collective farm
workers sell their sugar beets and milk to whomever they wanted, died in a
car accident recently. He was travelling the poor roads that link the 80
isolated, backward villages in his electoral district, 90 miles north east
of Kiev.
Of the district's seven remaining candidates in parliamentary elections next
Sunday one is on the revived Communist party ticket and the other six are
ex-party farm bosses or long-time local officials.
Last September when Ukraine's first post-independence elections were called,
western diplomats and Ukraine's opposition press thought they would be the
mechanism that would at last remove the entrenched Soviet legacy that has
steered Ukraine to hyperinflation, a severe energy crisis, plummeting output
and monthly wages of less than Dollars 10. Now they are pessimistic.
Yaroslavka is a typical Ukrainian village of 1,300 people, 70 per cent of
them pensioners, whose lives are centered around the collective farm,
formerly named Pro-Communism. People there do not easily trust new
approaches even though their lives have lurched back to a primitive barter
economy as the state is increasingly unable to provide.
'The old mentality lives on here,' says Mr Mykhailo Yarmolenko, a Soviet
master welder who built atomic power stations abroad and has retired to his
family's birthplace. 'People still expect the collective farm director to
provide everything from roofing to their kids' lunches. They don't see
another way.'
Horse-drawn ploughs are used more and more as tractors break down. There are
no replacement parts to be found. Public transport to the city was cut off a
year ago. Candles are used more to cope with frequent blackouts which last
for days. The single general goods store has been closed for weeks because
there are no goods.
Personal backyard plots of beets and berries are the main source of security
for their families' meals. Instead of using Ukraine's worthless currency
(Dollars 1 gets you 39,000 karbovanets), home produce is bartered through
informal networks of city friends and family who can bring matches or a warm
sweater on a visit.
Mr Yarmolenko uses his welding skills for his contribution to the collective
farm. The chairman wanted to pay him. ''What money?' I said,' recounts Mr
Yarmolenko. 'Give me a sack of flour instead for my wife to make blini
(pancakes).'
Centuries of serfdom and starvation, whose apex was the artificial famine of
the 1930s which wiped out 7m Ukrainian peasants, have made them a stoic lot,
who expect little of their government and are good at devising private
strategies for survival. They distrust radical change, preferring the devil
they know.
'I just don't believe that private farmers can feed the country,' says head
of the village council, Hryhori Boretz, a life-time communist official,
'Only the state can provide the kind of massive investment our farm needs. A
lone farmer couldn't do it by himself with just a horse and a plough.' In
this village, only two farmers have taken advantage of Ukraine's private
land law to get their own farms.
'There are not enough young people to take risks and responsibility,' says
Andrii Bezlyudny, who is in charge of the collective farm's animal breeding
and mechanisation. (The collective farm's head was off on one of his regular
trips to Kiev to beg for fuel needed for spring planting.)
'Right now all the bureaucrats are in charge of the processing factories
where we send our grain and milk. They don't have any money to pay us, but
they won't let go either because they'd be out of a job. They live off these
factories.'
On the front line of his farm's problems Mr Bezlyudny believes everything
needs to be privatised, from the processing plants down. He is hoping for a
new parliament.

Denmark and Sweden have clashed over Baltic cod quotas following Sweden's
accession negotiations with the European Union. Under the agreement,
Sweden's share of the cod quota will rise from 35 to 40 per cent. Fishermen
on the Danish island of Bornholm are urging Denmark to vote against Swedish
EU membership unless they renounce the extra 5 per cent. But Mr Carl Bildt,
the Swedish prime minister, said: 'A deal is a deal.' The extra quota was
awarded to Sweden in the final, hectic phase of the negotiations, unknown to
Danish negotiators. 'It was a technical mishap,' said Mr Niels Helveg
Petersen, the Danish foreign minister.

<TEXT>
The first test of the Netherlands' 1989 insider-trading law began yesterday
with the trial in Amsterdam of three Dutch investors and a brokerage house.
The defendants - Mr Joep van den Nieuwenhuyzen, Mr Eric Albada Jelgersma and
Mr Leon Melchior - sold more than 4m shares in HCS, a computer company in
which they were the main private shareholders, on July 31, 1991, the morning
after they had met the company's bankers to discuss a Fl 127.5m rescue plan.
Prosecutors say the shares were sold to depress HCS's share price in the
expectation that the lower price would be used several days later to fix the
price of a private share placement in which the three would participate. The
defendants deny that a firm decision had been taken on the private
placement. HCS, which later launched a rights issue, was declared bankrupt
in 1992.

The tripartite centre-left coalition which has ruled Brandenburg since 1990
collapsed yesterday, amid allegations that Mr Manfred Stolpe, the state
premier, had contacts with the east German Stasi. The Social Democratic
party had threatened to oust the Alliance 90 party from the coalition unless
its leader withdrew charges that Mr Stolpe had lied about his connections
with the former secret police. Alliance 90 leader Mr Gunter Nooke said he
would not retract his comments. The Social Democrats and the Free Democrats
will now run a minority government until state elections on September 11.
However, the two Alliance 90 ministers yesterday said they would quit their
party and stay with the two-party coalition, which has 41 of the 88 seats in
the state parliament.

<TEXT>
The Croatian government and Serbs from the breakaway Croatian republic of
Krajina yesterday failed to agree on a ceasefire which would start paving
the way for an eventual peace treaty between Croatia and Serbia.
The two sides will meet again next Tuesday in a further effort to strike a
deal. The talks - in the Russian embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian capital -
are the highest level contacts for many months between the two sides, as
well as the first attempt by the Russians to broker a ceasefire in the
three-year-old conflict between Serbs and Croats. The talks, hosted by Mr
Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, coincided with
threats by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to use military force to assert
control over Krajina.
The Krajina Serbs, backed by the Yugoslav army in June 1991, waged a war of
secession against Croatia's moves towards independence. The Serbian side
called for Croatian troops to withdraw from Krajina, a swathe of territory
which cuts across south-west Croatia.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Steel producers miss key talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel and Thyssen, the German steel producer, have decided not to
attend a key meeting tonight with the European Commission.
British steel said it was boycotting the talks between the Commission and
big European steel producers because it believed Brussels was taking too
soft a line on state subsidies. Mr Heinz Kriwet, chairman of Thyssen, said
his company would not be represented because of 'scheduling difficulties'.
The British company has become exasperated about state subsidies following
the heavily criticised December agreement under which state-owned producers
in Spain, Germany and Italy received government subsidies worth Ecu6.8bn
(Pounds 5.14bn) in return for capacity cuts of more than 5m tonnes.
Today's meeting is to discuss the progress of plans by non-aided producers
in making voluntary cuts in capacity to help the industry reduce losses. The
Commission has told private steelmakers that an Ecu240m fund to ease the
cost of redundancies will be withdrawn unless the steel companies come up
with the capacity cuts by April.
Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, wants a further 2m-3m tonnes of
cuts in hot-rolled product capacity on top of 13m tonnes of cuts already
delivered and 4m tonnes promised.

FT  23 MAR 94 / The tragedy and the irony of village conservatism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND, East Europe Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the amazement of outside observers Ukraine's election campaign is not
being fought primarily on economic issues, writes Chrystia Freeland, East
Europe correspondent. But, if Ukraine is to have any hope of averting the
sort of disaster foreign experts predict, then the day after they take up
their seats, the new MPs will have to face up to the issues they have been
avoiding on the campaign trail.
On its own, Ukraine's economic plight is cause enough for serious
international concern. Ukraine's macro-economic record - the worst in the
former Soviet Union - is so dreadful that the beleaguered officials of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Kiev have taken to raising
their spirits by counting the inventive new ways Ukrainian officials are
constantly discovering to destroy their economy.
But what makes fragile Ukraine particularly important now is its
increasingly hostile relationship with Russia. Russians - ranging across the
political spectrum from Lenin to Solzhenitzyn - have always seen Ukraine as
an integral part of 'Greater Russia'. As Russian foreign policy hardens in
the aftermath of the elections there in December and in reaction to Russia's
own economic travails, Moscow's pressure on Kiev to re-submit to Russian
rule has become stronger.
Ukraine's economic collapse makes it more difficult for Kiev to resist; at
the same time, the nation's political determination to remain independent is
growing stronger. This makes Ukraine a particularly volatile partner in what
is already a tense relationship, hence the CIA's gloomy prediction earlier
this year of a 'probable' conflict between the two Slav giants.
It is in the cities, with their greater voting power, that the outcome of
Ukraine's election will be decided. There, the race is far more competitive
and a new political class, representing a fledgling middle class rather than
the entrenched ex-communist nomenklatura, could emerge.
Ukraine's tragedy is that the uncomplaining resilience of its villages is
likely to help keep its inept government in place. The irony is that it is
the villages, with their tradition of hard-working self-sufficiency, which
could be the driving force behind a Ukrainian economic revival - if
Ukrainian voters are ever able to elect a government with the courage and
skill to initiate reforms.

FT  23 MAR 94 / New Italian government will face spending crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy yesterday revealed that spending in 1994 was liable to overshoot the
budget target by L14,800bn (Pounds 6bn).
The budget shortfall comes during the closing stages of the election
campaign and underlines the limited options open to the next government. It
would make it extremely difficult for the media magnate, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, leader of the conservative alliance and a possible prime
minister in a coalition government, to carry out his promise to relaunch the
economy, reduce taxes and provide more jobs.
Instead the next government will probably be forced to introduce a
corrective budget shortly after it takes office. The estimate is based on
first quarter treasury receipts which were lower than expected as a result
of the recession biting deeper. At the same time social security spending
has grown faster and the savings envisaged in the reform of the civil
service have been slow to materialise.
The 1994 budget envisages holding the deficit at L151,000bn, equivalent to
8.7 per cent of GDP. On latest projections the deficit would expand to
almost L160,000bn.
One area where spending has grown rapidly is pensions, and officials have
warned this week that Italy will have to accelerate its plans to raise the
pension age to 65 years. If tough measures are not taken on pension and
health spending, the total social security budget may exceed 14 per cent of
GDP.
Italy's state-dominated pension system is among the most generous in the EC
and reforms introduced last year envisage only a gradual tightening of
benefits and an extremely slow move from the current retirement ages.
The pensions budget has been complicated by the recession with large-scale
resort to early retirement to facilitate industrial restructuring.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Time running out for EU image: The protracted enlargement
voting dispute has a political price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's festering internal row over voting rights if it opens
its doors to Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway risks destroying already
muted Euro-enthusiasm among the electorates of the applicant countries, all
of which have to submit EU membership to a referendum.
The four putative newcomers have agreed hard-bargained entry terms. But
their ministers now have to turn up in Brussels on an almost weekly basis,
waiting in their embassies or hotels on the off-chance that the UK and Spain
and their 10 partners can decide on how many countries should be entitled to
block Euro-laws.
EU foreign ministers again failed to resolve this dispute yesterday, at the
fourth time of asking.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, increasingly uncomfortable with
the hand he has been dealt, acknowledged yesterday that 'there is time
pressure'. 'We are well aware of the time-scale, but agreement requires
movement by everybody,' he said.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, summed up well the mood of the
EU majority, when he warned that Europe's reputation was being seriously
damaged. 'We are showing that we can't do our business properly, and we are
creating a bad impression among the electorates of the applicant countries,'
he said.
A senior official from Finland - the only applicant country which as of now
has near majority opinion in favour of Europe - said: 'We have to cut this
off now and get on with the (membership) process.'
In the minds of all the negotiators, there is concern that the deadline for
the four to enter in January next year is slipping away. In the minds of
some, there is fear that this deadline is not academic - that it could cause
a fatal loss of political momentum which could turn Nordic and Alpine voters
against Europe, and that the Union would take a long time to recover from
such self-inflicted wounds.
Deadlines on the Uruguay Round, on the European Economic Area free trade
zone, and on previous enlargements, were missed without final mishap. The
formal deadline at issue here is May 4, by when the European parliament must
approve the accession treaty.
It says firmly it will not if the UK and Spain get their way in making it
more difficult for the EU to take decisions. British and Spanish ministers
profess to believe that if they can get a legal text on enlargement to
parliament by about April 5, along with a compromise on majority voting
which leans their way, EU expansion can go ahead as planned.
But there is more to reckon with. Senior parliament officials already say
that even if the argument on voting rights goes their way, they doubt that
the Strasbourg assembly - up for re-election in June - would be willing or
able to deliver approval in time. Many MEPs will be absent campaigning;
about half are set to lose their seats and may not turn up; up to a third
never turn up anyway.
The parliament received important new powers, including that of veto, under
the Maastricht treaty, and resents the way the member states continue to
treat it as a talking shop. The Socialist and Christian Democrat
apparatchiks who control the Euro-assembly definitely hold a whip hand on
enlargement, and are in a mood to demonstrate they are nobody's
rubber-stamp. But the longer the votes debate goes on, the less likely it is
that parliaments in the 10 member states who oppose leaving the 'blocking
minority' on decision-making unchanged will endorse ratification.
Already Belgium and Holland have said that they will not get through a bill
which enshrines quasi-veto powers for countries such as the UK.
'The longer you leave it, the more people are going to speak up on the other
side,' a Dutch diplomat warned yesterday. 'And then you have a real
political crisis.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Croats and Serbs fail to agree Krajina ceasefire

The Croatian government and Serbs from the breakaway Croatian republic of
Krajina yesterday failed to agree on a ceasefire which would start paving
the way for an eventual peace treaty between Croatia and Serbia.
Talks in the Russian embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, will continue
today. They represent the highest level meeting for many months between the
two sides, as well as the first attempt by the Russians to broker a
ceasefire aimed at ending the three-year-old conflict between Serbs and
Croats. The talks, hosted by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to
the former Yugoslavia, coincided with threats by Mr Franjo Tudjman, the
president of Croatia, to use military force to assert control over Krajina.
The Krajina Serbs, backed by the Yugoslav army in June 1991, waged a war of
secession against Croatia's moves towards independence.
The Serbian side called for Croatian troops to withdraw from Krajina, a
swathe of territory which cuts across south-west Croatia.
For its part, the Croatians insisted on asserting their authority over the
region. Any substantial compromises, particularly by the Serbs would
gradually lead to the gradual suspension of sanctions on Serbia.
Mr John Mills, the UN spokesman, yesterday called the closed-door meetings
'detailed and purposeful'. But he warned of a 'growing impatience in the
international community for solutions to be found in the regions'.
Previous UN attempts to forge a settlement on the status of the Serbs in
Croatia have failed. A ceasefire in January 1992, which called for the
return of hundreds of thousands of refugees, was violated one year later
when Croat forces pushed across UN lines.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Waigel pours scorn on SPD's tax plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday denounced the tax
reform plans of the opposition Social Democrats as wrongly calculated and
grossly extravagant, claiming they would lead to substantial tax increases
for the great majority of taxpayers.
Seizing on the opposition plans for a fairer redistribution of taxation to
pay for the cost of German unification, Mr Waigel plunged into the first
real controversy of Germany's marathon election campaign with a welter of
statistics, designed to terrify the country's property-owning middle
classes, as well as average income-earners.
He said the new spending plans outlined in the election platform of the
Social Democratic party (SPD) would add around DM60bn (Pounds 23.3bn) to the
government's annual DM480bn budget, and prove impossible to finance from the
present level of taxes and social insurance contributions.
SPD plans for a 10 per cent income tax surcharge on the better paid, instead
of the current 7.5 per cent surcharge on all taxpayers, would have to begin
at income levels of DM44,000 a year to produce the same revenues, he
declared. The SPD hopes of levying the surcharge on taxable incomes of
DM50,000 for single earners, and DM100,000 for married couples, would leave
a DM6bn shortfall.
He also singled out the SPD plans for increased taxation on property and
savings as likely to add another burden of at least DM10bn on
property-owners. 'It wants to punish the top performers of our society
through a considerable tightening of the tax system, although the top 10 per
cent of taxpayers already pay more than 50 per cent of tax,' Mr Waigel said.
Mr Waigel's predictable intervention reflects the delight of the ruling
liberal-conservative coalition in Bonn at the potential electoral dynamite
in the SPD tax plans, in spite of the fact that they are intended to be
neutral in their overall effect.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, admitted yesterday that his
presentation of the plans last week might have been mistaken, by failing to
make clear that the 10 per cent surcharge would affect taxable incomes of
DM50,000 and above, not gross incomes. The result has been a barrage of
press criticism, and concern in his own party ranks, that the plans would
affect many average income-earners.
He insisted that more than 80 per cent of all taxpayers would actually be
relieved of the present planned 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge', and
fewer than 20 per cent be forced to pay the higher rate.
As for increased wealth taxes, he said they would not be increased
across-the-board, and would exempt private pension and life insurance
policies, as well as business property. He also promised a review of the
present tax on interest incomes, which has caused a huge flight of capital
from Germany to neighbouring Luxembourg.
Mr Waigel said the SPD's proposals would drive investors to deposit billions
of marks in foreign tax havens, undermining economic growth in Germany.
'What the SPD is presenting is an employment programme for Monaco, perhaps
for Liechtenstein and parts of Switzerland, but certainly not for Germany,'
he said.

FT  23 MAR 94 / France warns student rioters
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Balladur government yesterday asked teachers to keep their students off
the streets where they have been contesting a youth wage law and warned that
if they did not, serious injuries might result.
But students in the south-eastern city of Lyons yesterday held their fourth
demonstration in less than a week against the law. In its final version
published yesterday, it permits employers to pay unskilled young people 80
per cent of the national minimum wage for working 80 per cent of a normal
39-hour work week, with the other 20 per cent devoted to training. The
government's aim is to make France's jobless young, numbering some 800,000
now, more employable.
Dozens of protesters have been arrested demonstrating against the measures
in the past week and at least 19 have been sentenced in court to up to six
months in jail.
During three days of demonstrations in Lyons, capped by pitched battles on
Monday, 35 policemen were injured and 73 people detained.
In Nantes, 21 policemen were injured when about 300 young people broke away
from an estimated 4,000 protesters and fought for more than four hours with
police.
Mr Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, warned students not to let
themselves be manipulated by left-wing politicians and unions, adding: 'It
is the young people who will pay the price.'
It was, in fact, an earlier version of the law, allowing employers to pay
the same reduced wages to young people with university diplomas, that
ignited the student revolt which has rumbled on despite the law's revision.
Ex-president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF party in the
government coalition, yesterday criticised 'the clumsy presentation' of the
law, saying that its original version was 'discouraging' to students.
Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, yesterday promised 'early initiatives
to help the country's youth. He said that he and prime minister Edouard
Balladur had been 'incensed' by what he called 'the political exploitation'
of students' fears by trade unions and the Socialist and Communist parties.
But in Toulouse, a city with 100,000 students and the highest university
population outside Paris, this political connection was discounted.
Professor Robert Marconis, a teacher at Toulouse-Le Mirail university, said
that, in contrast to 1968 when students seized control of part of Paris for
nearly a month, 'French students are more discouraged than politicised -
more likely to be found reading L'Equipe (a sports paper) than Le Monde'.
But he added: 'This is dangerous for the government because it is hard to
know how to deal with it.'

FT  23 MAR 94 / Pro-Europe MPs warn of Tory party civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading pro-Europeans on the Conservative back benches warned of the threat
of renewed civil war in the party last night after the fierce anti-Brussels
outburst in the House of Commons by Mr John Major.
Conservative MPs on the party's centre and left have been told not to engage
in public debate with rightwing Eurosceptic colleagues as part of an effort
to suppress divisions before June's European elections.
The instruction - delivered by the Tory whips at Westminster but said to
have come from Mr Major - has until now met with grudging acquiescence from
members of the party's Positive Europe Group.
But the anti-European tone of the prime minister's comments enraged many of
the enthusiasts. They warned that if the row with Britain's partners over
voting rights in an enlarged Union was used an excuse to appease Tory
sceptics, the present truce on the back benches would disintegrate.
Ministers said Mr Major's comments were no more than an attempt to persuade
Britain's European partners of the seriousness of its resolve not to accept
a dilution of the ability of governments to block decisions.
Many backbenchers, however, interpreted his characterisation of Labour party
leader, Mr John Smith, as a 'poodle' of Brussels as a clear precursor to an
overtly nationalistic stance in the run-up to the June elections.
There is a strong suspicion Mr Major has decided that appeasing the
Euro-sceptic right offers the best chance of heading off a challenge to his
leadership later in the year.
Members of the Positive Europe group have told party managers they will not
accept a 'bashing Brussels' platform in the campaign for the European
Parliament. They believe that by bowing to the right of the party the prime
minister is underestimating a potentially far more dangerous threat to his
leadership from the centre-left.
The pro-Europeans fear Mr Major's approach could degenerate into a repeat of
the disastrous European campaign of 1989 when the Thatcher government
suffered heavy losses.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, has sought to reassure the enthusiasts
that Conservatives will not attack EU institutions but focus instead on the
dangers of the Socialists securing control of those institutions.
A draft manifesto prepared by Mr Hurd has drawn a careful line between
emphasising Britain's role in Europe and its ambitions for a more open,
decentralised Union.

FT  23 MAR 94 / PM takes Euro-sceptic line on EU voting crisis: Major
accuses member states of 'phoney threats' as Brussels talks fail to secure
agreement
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major raised the stakes yesterday in the battle over enlargement of
the European Union by siding decisively with Conservative Euro-sceptics as
talks in Brussels broke up without agreement.
Mr Major astonished the Commons by accusing other member states of using
'phoney threats' against Britain, and warning that the government was
digging in for a long campaign.
His language, the strongest used by any British minister during the
enlargement negotiations, contrasted sharply with conciliatory comments by
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
Mr Hurd, who appeared uncomfortable with Britain's hardline stance in the
enlargement negotiations, said time was running out for a compromise.
'Agreement requires movement by everybody,' he said in Brussels yesterday
after a meeting of the Union's foreign affairs council broke up.
The council rejected three sets of Anglo-Spanish proposals aimed at
protecting the ability of large member states to block decisions. The
dispute threatens to delay the entry of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway
into the Union.
Mr Pieter Kooijmans, Dutch foreign minister, reflecting widespread
frustration with British and Spanish brinkmanship, said: 'We are now in a
crisis. That is because they cannot present any compromise as a victory for
themselves.'
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said Anglo-Spanish demands would
make decision-making in a Union of 16 member states more difficult. 'We want
enlargement with a reinforcement of the European Union's powers,' he said.
Ministers from the applicant countries warned that tepid support for EU
membership could cool further. Hopes of a compromise rest on a deal being
reached at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece this weekend. But
both Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, and Mr Javier Solana, Spanish
foreign minister, said they were not optimistic.
The UK and Spain are seeking to maintain voting rules which allow two large
member states and one small one to muster 23 votes to block decisions.
But the rest want to raise the minority blocking threshold to 27 votes to
take account of the entry of the four new countries.
EU diplomats said the UK and Spain proposed three formulas to safeguard
their position.
These were: raising the blocking minority to 25 votes, a UK proposal; making
it impossible to outvote countries representing more than 100m or more
people; or adding a legally binding protocol to the Maastricht treaty which
would allow countries mustering 23 votes to postpone decisions indefinitely.
In the Commons, many Conservatives roared their approval at question time as
Mr Major told MPs: 'We are determined to negotiate in Brussels, to fight
Britain's corner hard, just as hard as every other nation would fight for
themselves. We will not be moved by phoney threats to delay enlargement.
There is ample time to complete the enlargement process. If there is delay,
it will be because certain other member states, two in particular, have
taken an inflexible and doctrinaire line.'
Downing Street said Mr Major's remarks were aimed at Belgium and the
Netherlands, which were believed to have blocked agreement in spite of the
willingness of other states to settle on terms acceptable to Britain and
Spain.
Mr Major also launched a bitter attack on Mr John Smith, the Labour leader,
who has urged the government to agree to a blocking minority of 27 votes.
In comments seen as laying the groundwork for a nationalistic Tory campaign
for June's European elections, Mr Major described Mr Smith as 'Monsieur Oui,
the poodle of Brussels'.

FT  23 MAR 94 / Fed signals US rate rise to 3.5%: Bond prices advance after
move to curb rate of growth and increase in inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve yesterday moved to slow the rate of US economic growth
by signalling a modest increase in short-term interest rates to 3.5 per
cent.
Bond and share prices rose following the announcement, which came during a
jittery day on Wall Street as traders waited anxiously for a decision on
rates from the Fed's policy-making open market committee which met yesterday
in Washington.
After the meeting, Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, issued a short statement
saying the committee had decided 'to increase slightly the degree of
pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be associated with
a small increase in short-term money market rates'.
Analysts interpreted this as a sign that the new target for the federal
funds rate - the cost of overnight money for banks - would be raised to 3.5
per cent.
The Fed's move was in line with market expectations and followed a
quarter-point increase in the Fed funds rate to 3.25 per cent on February 4.
The February rate increase was the first in five years and led to a sharp
increase in long bond yields to nearly 7 per cent because analysts
interpreted it as the first in a series of tightening moves.
Speculation that the Fed would tighten policy again reached fever pitch last
Friday after President Bill Clinton called Mr Greenspan to the White House
for a discussion of economic trends. The White House, which believes there
is little risk of higher inflation, said it had not tried to influence the
Fed's decision.
The US Treasury yesterday reiterated its support for Fed independence and
said it shared the Fed's goal of achieving sustainable growth and low
inflation.
By signalling a further rates rise, the Fed evidently hoped to calm nerves
in bond markets by showing that it was serious about preventing the economy
overheating and thus averting a rise in inflation next year or in 1996.
Most analysts expect the Fed to continue to raise rates until they reach a
'neutral' level perceived to be at least 4 to 5 per cent. The speed of
tightening, however, is likely to depend on the rate of economic growth
later this year and the extent of upward pressure on inflation.
After weeks of anticipation, bond traders appeared relieved that the
long-awaited boost in the fed funds target rate had finally taken place. The
benchmark 30-year government bond, which is especially sensitive to
inflationary expectations, showed the biggest gains, in sharp contrast to
February 4, when the Fed's first strike on rates triggered an immediate
sell-off. The long bond jumped by 1 5/32 to 92 13/32 . The yield eased to
6.848 per cent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 2.3 points at 3,862.55, after
a burst of buying immediately after Mr Greenspan's statement.
The news came too late to affect European bond markets, but could cause
further volatility today. 'The US has been hanging like a black cloud over
European bond markets for the last two months, and there is no reason why
that should stop,' said Mr Andrew Roberts of UBS.
However, according to one market observer, 'if (the US rise) is accompanied
by a significant cut in the German repo rate, this could reinforce hopes for
a clearer divergence between Europe and the US'.
The Bundesbank is today due to allocate two-week securities repurchase
agreements at variable rates. Many traders expect the lowest-accepted repo
rate to fall by around 8 basis points from last week's 5.88 per cent.
However, the move may weaken hopes of an imminent rate cut in the UK, which
has followed the pick-up in the US economy, ahead of the rest of Europe.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Fed's
announcement confirmed that 'Greenspan is still in a gradualist mode'.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Elf given deadline on plans for
refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, yesterday gave Elf Aquitaine,
the French energy group, until the end of this week to give final details
about its investment plans in the delayed DM4.5bn Leuna oil refinery in
eastern Germany.
Two Elf directors were negotiating with a senior Treuhand official until
last night, when talks were interrupted to allow experts to review legal
details, a Treuhand spokesman said. 'Progress was made,' he said. 'We now
have to reach a conclusion.'
Elf said it wants less than 50 per cent of the project, having originally
taken a 67 per cent stake.
The agreement for the larger stake was struck before the French energy group
was due to be privatised.
Under this original plan, Elf's stake would have risen to 100 per cent after
Thyssen Handelsunion, the construction arm of the German group, had handed
over its share once the refinery had been built.
Meanwhile, Mr Klaus Schucht, a member of the Treuhand management board, said
that Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil enterprise, would take a 20 per
cent stake in the showpiece refinery which it would pay for with crude oil
deliveries.
Mr Schucht suggested that it was acceptable to reduce refining capacity from
10m tonnes to 8.5m tonnes but he insisted that work on the project should
start in April, a month after construction was to have begun.
The uncertainty surrounding Elf's investment has caused the French and
German governments severe embarrassment.
Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand were involved
in the agreement, the biggest single industrial investment project in
eastern Germany.
However, Elf has so far failed to find a buyer and has come under increasing
pressure from the German government to keep the project.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Portuguese group to invest Es60m
in cable TV system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Portuguese company is to invest Es60bn (Dollars 430.7m) to supply cable
television to 2m homes over the next six years, using a fibre-optic network
that will enable the system to evolve into a multimedia information highway.
TV Cabo Portugal (TVCP), wholly owned by two of Portugal's state-owned
telecommunications operators, will choose a company to supply the
infrastructure for the project by April. It is negotiating with Philips of
the Netherlands, Siemens of Germany, Sirti of Italy and Intelcis of Spain.
The contract is estimated to be worth Es20,000 for each home supplied.
The company is also holding talks with 40 programme producers, mainly
European satellite TV companies. TVCP will offer a service of 30 channels
for Es5,000 a month plus an installation charge of Es15,000. Additional
channels will be added on a pay-per-view basis, pending the approval of new
legislation. Broadcasting is due to start in October.
TVCP will act as a holding company for nine regional cable TV operators. It
will own 51 per cent of each company. Municipal authorities and private
investors will subscribe to the rest of the capital through negotiation. The
regional companies are expected to be floated on the stock market after two
years.
The capital of TVCP itself will be opened to private investment after the
partial privatisation of Portugal's telecommunications sector due to take
place by mid-1995. Mr Jose Manuel da Graca Bau, TVCP president, said the
project should show a profit after six years.
'Being a later starter means Portugal can avail itself of more advanced
technology,' he said. 'Installing an optic fibre network means that the
cable TV system can later be used for multimedia products such as
interactive computer and television technology.'
The Portuguese government has authorised TVCP to use the optic fibre network
of the basic telephone system for cable TV. Investment in the project would
otherwise be double.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Porsche to pursue work for other makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Porsche is to branch out further from its niche as a luxury sports car maker
and expand its business of building cars for other manufacturers, it emerged
yesterday.
'Great efforts' are to be made to build small-volume contract manufacturing
into 'a strategic business sector', according to a rights issue prospectus
published yesterday.
Negotiations are under way to add to Porsche's existing manufacturing
contracts with Mercedes-Benz and Audi, the Volkswagen group's quality car
division.
Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche chairman, said recently that his new
negotiating partners were 'not necessarily' German.
The contract with the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, under which Porsche makes the
Mercedes 500E series, is due to expire later this year. However, the company
has just started production of the Audi Avant RS2, a high-performance estate
car. This 50:50 joint venture is a brainchild of Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW
group chairman, who also owns an estimated 10 per cent of Porsche.
According to information released ahead of today's opening of the
subscription period for the one-for-four DM200m (Dollars 110m) rights issue,
Porsche expects to build 16,000 of its own cars this year and 2,000 for
third parties. Orders have already been booked for 560 Audi RS2s.
The aim of the rights issue is to help meet estimated development costs of
DM1.5bn for two new sports cars, due to be launched in 1996-97.
Subscriptions for the issue, offering new shares at DM575 for both ordinary
and preference shareholders, must be in by April 7.
It also emerged yesterday that the Porsche and Piech families, which own all
Porsche's voting stock, recently reduced their holdings of preference
shares.
Less well-off members had sold part or all of their non-voting stock to
cover the cost of their entitlement to new ordinary shares, a company
spokesman said. He did not know how many of the preference shares -
previously estimated at 40 per cent of the 875,000 outstanding - remained in
family hands. That was a private matter, he said.
Porsche made a DM114m loss in the six months to January, despite increasing
turnover by almost 20 per cent to DM980m.
Forecasting sales of more than DM2bn and a deficit of DM140m-DM150m for the
full year, after a DM240m loss last time, the company said total deliveries
to customers had increased by 6 per cent to 7,033 cars in the first half.
Deliveries of Porsche marque cars had risen 8 per cent to 6,600.
The company expects to break even in the 1994-95 financial year.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Denmark leads off telecoms sales with likely Dollars 2.7bn
float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tele Danmark, the Danish state monopoly telecommunications operator,
launched the sale of 48.3 per cent of its shares yesterday, expected to be
worth about Dollars 2.7bn.
The flotation is the first of a string of telecoms privatisations expected
in the EU's continental states over the next two years and the world's
largest since the sale of the final tranche of British Telecommunications in
June.
More than 80 per cent of the 63m shares on offer are expected to be sold
outside Denmark, making the privatisation one of the biggest international
equity issues.
The offer will be marketed in five tranches: the Nordic countries - which
will be guaranteed about 20 per cent of the shares - the US, the UK,
continental Europe, and the rest of the world. It will be priced at the end
of April and close in early May.
The shares are expected to be listed on the Copenhagen and New York stock
exchanges, and will be quoted through Seaq International.
Unusually for a telecoms privatisation, all the net proceeds will go to the
company, not to the government. Analysts believe the Danish government's
decision to forgo a slice of the proceeds is likely to increase the
attraction of the offer, particularly to institutions seeking a medium or
long-term return.
The Danish government will retain a controlling 51 per cent stake in Tele
Danmark, but the company will have operational independence. Mr Hans Wurzen,
chief executive, said privatisation would enable it 'to move away from
political control in the face of competition in an open market in Europe'.
The initial offering is expected to be in the price range DKr275-DKr315 per
DKr10 share (or Dollars 20.83-Dollars 23.86 per American depositary share),
according to the prospectus.
By capitalised value Tele Danmark is expected to become the second largest
group listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange after the AP Moller shipping
group's companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg.
Tele Danmark operates one of the cheapest and most advanced telecoms
networks in Europe. Denmark has about 59 telephone subscribers per 100
people, compared with about 45 in the UK, and it has the highest proportion
of cellular subscribers of any EU state.
Telecoms privatisations are also likely or possible this year in the
Netherlands, Greece and Italy, with several others expected beyond the EU.
The Greek privatisation is expected to raise about Dollars 1bn, the Dutch
about Dollars 3bn.
The sale of the first tranche of shares in the German operator Deutsche
Telekom, the largest privatisation on the horizon, is not expected until the
end of next year at the earliest.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (16): Natural beauty is main attraction -
The locals love their island and this clearly shows in its cleanliness and
the cherished appearance of homes and gardens. The pace is slow and people
make time to talk / Where to go and what to see
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The problem facing the visitor to Jersey is not what to do, but what to miss
out. The island is small enough for easy and leisurely exploring, while
surprisingly full of places of interest and activities to suit most tastes.
Undoubtedly Jersey's main attraction is its natural beauty. Packed into 45
square miles - 63 square miles at very low tide - are long sandy beaches,
cliff-bound little coves, small fishing harbours, hedgerows and fields full
of wild flowers, small farm fields with neat rows of vegetables or a few
Jersey cows, and winding country lanes shaded by trees.
Jersey is often referred to as the floral island and its climate ensures a
constant and wide variety of plant life. The locals love their island and
this clearly shows in its cleanliness and the cherished appearance of homes
and gardens. The pace is slow and people make time to talk.
Tucked away in St. Mary is La Mare Vineyards, with 5 1/2 acres of vines. The
warm granite buildings date in part back to the 1600s and visitors can
sample produce at a wine-tasting and enjoy home-made food in the Buttery.
Wines and cider are on sale at the vineyard as well as a mouth-watering
selection of mustards and preserves, all home made. This year's addition to
the range is 'Jersey Lightning' - a potent spirit distilled from cider in a
copper pot-still, not unlike Calvados.
A different type of distilling goes on at Jersey Lavender Farm in St.
Brelade. Seven acres of lavender fields are harvested to obtain essential
oil used in the farm's selection of cosmetic products. Visitors can walk
around the lavender and herb fields and watch the distilling and bottling
process.
About 55 varieties of lavender are grown here, which comprise one of the
national collections of plants approved by the National Council for the
Conservation of Plants and Gardens. A range of products are on sale and
Jersey cream teas are served in these fragrant surroundings.
Herb enthusiasts will want to visit Samares Manor in St. Clement. It has one
of the largest herb gardens in Britain, with more than 100 varieties planted
out. Talks on herbs are given in the garden most afternoons and potted herbs
can be bought at the shop. Samares also has other well-designed gardens to
wander round, including a water garden and a Japanese garden.
Carnations are grown commercially in Jersey and a visit to Jersey Flower
Centre at Retreat Farm, St. Lawrence, will allow the visitor a view of the
whole production cycle, up to packaging and posting of mail order bunches.
This is the largest carnation-growing nursery in Britain and its mail order
section, Flying Flowers, was recently listed on the stock exchange.
Animal lovers will find that Jersey Zoo is a unique centre for breeding rare
and endangered species of animals in captivity. Founded in 1963 by author
Gerald Durrell, the zoo is now home to such animals as aye-ayes, lemurs and
giant jumping rats. Visitors always enjoy the families of orang-utans and
lowland gorillas, one of which achieved world fame by his protection of a
young visitor who fell into the enclosure.
Visitors interested in the island's history do best to start at the
award-winning Jersey Museum in St. Helier. The museum's audio-visual
presentation and exhibitions act as a gateway to further explorations. There
are sites, monuments and castles to visit dating from prehistoric time
through to modern history.
The German occupation of Jersey during the last war is well illustrated at
several sites, but probably most prominently at the German Underground
Hospital in St. Lawrence. Regarded as the most ambitious engineering feat of
the occupation, it now vividly brings to life the experiences of thousands
of islanders at that time.
Jersey offers a wide choice of accommodation and the authorities ensure
standards are kept up. Prices per night range from Pounds 13 for
accommodation only in a small guest-house, to Pounds 300 for a suite in a
five-sun (the Jersey official rating) hotel.
For visitors wanting to be in St. Helier, the Pomme d'Or on the waterfront
offers excellent three-sun facilities - 147 bedrooms, two restaurants, a
coffee shop, a pub and easy access to both harbour and town centre.
Longueville Manor, just outside St. Helier, is the island's only five-sun
hotel, named Egon Ronay hotel of the year in 1991. Prices for a room per
night range from Pounds 110 for a single to Pounds 300 for a suite.
Country lovers will appreciate the four-sun Chateau La Chaire in the Rozel
Valley. Oak panelling, antique furniture, more than eight acres of grounds
and a cuisine renowned throughout the island combine to give the guest an
experience not dissimilar to that of staying in a really comfortable country
house. Prices range from about Pounds 50 to Pounds 180 per night, depending
on accommodation and time of year.
The standard of cuisine generally throughout the island is high, with
seafood a speciality in many restaurants. A favourite with both visitors and
locals is the Dolphin (also a two-sun hotel) on the edge of the little
fishing harbour of Gorey, beneath the dramatic Mont Orgueil Castle. From
about Pounds 20 per head for a full meal, the delights of Jersey seafood can
be enjoyed in very appropriate surroundings.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (13): Reclamation projects forge ahead -
The second, much larger, waterfront site is thought to be the biggest land
reclamation project in Europe. It is anticipated that it will provide 25 to
30 years of tipping capacity / Planning and Construction

<TEXT>
The construction projects most in evidence in Jersey are two large land
reclamation sites on St. Helier's waterfront. While the recession has
generally slowed construction in the island, these important projects are
forging ahead.
Great piles of earth bear witness to the progress of the first site and the
States has just granted the go-ahead for the second.
Although they are always referred to as land reclamation sites, they are
rubbish tips. The island has insufficient space for a landfill site to take
waste not suitable for its incinerator. Instead, long sturdy walls are being
built out into the sea adjoining the waterfront, and the enclosed area
filled with builders' rubble and other island waste.
No organic waste goes into the infill, but concern ts being expressed about
the inclusion of fly ash from the incinerator. The site is regularly tested
and monitored to check behaviour and seepage of heavy metals and other
potentially dangerous components of the fly ash.
Plans are already drawn up for building on the sites once they are full and
covered. Mr. Peter Thorne, planning officer, said: 'This first site, which
is about halfway through its contract period, will provide about 12 acres of
land for development. By 1997, we should be ready to do the housing and
hotel development on it and to lay out a new marina adjoining it.'
He said the authorities were aware of the need for quality. Particular
attention will be paid to this in the waterfront scheme in all areas such as
design and finishes.
The States has granted permission for a second, much larger site on the
waterfront. This one is thought to be the biggest land reclamation project
in Europe and it is anticipated it will provide 25 to 30 years of tipping
capacity.
Most of the work is going to specialist structural or marine engineering
contractors from off the island. The large stones to construct the new sea
walls enclosing the sites are shipped from France in barges carrying 4,000
tons a load. But some work is going to local contractors.
Mr. Ian Browne, managing director of Charles Le Quesne building contractors,
said his company was building slipways at the site. However he is not
generally optimistic about the island's construction industry.
'The 1980s was an extremely buoyant period for everyone in the island and
clearly things will never recover to how it was then. But we are hopeful
there will be some recovery in a couple of years, once confidence returns to
the market place.'
He said the recession of the early 1990s, coupled with the States zero job
growth policy, hit his industry hard. 'The last three to four years it has
been a steadily decreasing market. This is not only in work opportunities
but also in severely increased competition - there are now more after a
piece of a smaller cake.'
'Three reasonably substantial companies have gone bust in the past two
years, but the situation has been relieved by the States bringing forward
its housing schemes in recognition of the decline in private sector work.
'Our fear is that the public sector work will have substantially dried up
and, unless there is an upturn in the private sector, a lot of traditional
builders will face problems.'
Jersey companies resent having to face competition from off-island
contractors. Non-local companies have to quote prices 10 per cent lower than
their Jersey counterparts to gain contracts. 'I don't necessarily believe
outsiders offer a better deal. Some have gone bust and left enormous debts
with local subcontractors and builders' merchants.'
Mr. Browne said there would not be anything very hopeful for the industry
until growth returned to the market. 'In the meantime we try to be more
efficient. We are looking at different types of work so we do not have to
rely on the tender market.'
Mr. Thorne agreed that the recession was biting the building trade. His
department has seen the number of building applications drop to low levels
in 1987-88, prior a peak in 1990.
'There is a bit more confidence in terms of applications and we are seeing
some speculative development. There is a lot of activity in the housing
area. People are going for alterations and extensions to existing homes
rather than moving up-market,' he said.
Although not everyone has been satisfactorily housed yet, land has been
identified for housing, and building is expected to start soon. Two big new
schools are also to be built within the next three years.
'There is a new mood in the States towards the island becoming 'greener.'
And people are becoming more aware of these issues, which results in more
representations against planning applications than we used to get.'
Mr. Thorne said this change in attitude had also led to recognition of the
need to protect some of the island's buildings.
'We have now identified all buildings we consider worthy of protection and
hope to get them designated as the Jersey equivalent of listed buildings.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (12): Price can be something of a shock -
It is hard enough for local residents to find affordable property, with even
starter homes selling in the range of Pounds 95,000-Pounds 110,000 /
Property
</HEADLINE>

Fancy a converted farm in secluded parkland for Pounds 2.5m? If so, Jersey
has a good number of properties on offer. For those with more modest means,
accommodation is not so easy.
'The housing market has not performed as in the UK,' says Mr Colin Powell,
chief adviser to the States of Jersey. 'Prices did not fall in Jersey
because of the underlying pressure for accommodation. It looks as though
prices were pretty flat in 1993.' He admits there has been some 'downward
price adjustment' in some of the middle price-range housing.
Mr Roger Trower, head of Broadland, one of the largest local estate agencies
in Jersey, says: 'We have not suffered nearly as badly in Jersey as
elsewhere.'
But he warns of the sometimes excessive expectations of prospective
residents. 'It is very difficult to compare here with the UK,' he says. 'If
people come from a fairly rural area, they have difficulty coming to terms
with it.'
In the past, he says Jersey could be compared to outskirts of inner London
in price, although certainly not in quality. It is hard enough for local
residents to find affordable property, with even starter homes selling in
the range of Pounds 95,000-Pounds 110,000.
Even for wealthy individuals, the price can be something of a shock. Mr
Trower says those travelling to Jersey spend a little time on the island
deciding whether or not they could live locally and judging the house
prices. 'They normally want to spend up to Pounds 1.5m. When they realise
what they get for that they go into a slight panic wobble to say the least.'
The housing market has been subject to strong government control. Mr Powell
says that until 1970, non-residents were restricted to buying houses above a
certain price range. But he said this had the effect of pushing up all
prices above this barrier.
As a result, housing regulations were introduced which approached the matter
from another direction: by classifying all accommodation so that only
certain categories of residents could buy or rent it.
Much of the lower priced property is reserved for locals. J-category or
'essential employees' and K-category residents - those granted entry on
'economic or social' grounds - are restricted to a relatively small number
of generally higher priced property.
At the other end of the scale, 'non-qualified' people who are neither local,
nor in categories J or K, cannot buy or rent any property, but must instead
live in lodging houses regulated by the States housing committee or rent a
room in someone's house. As a result, a network of letting agencies has
sprung up on the island.
The government is still actively involved in providing accommodation for
local residents. It builds some state housing and oversees means-tested rent
rebates on these and on the private rental market for those who cannot
afford to buy.
It offers first-time buyers access to a loan scheme with low rates of
interest on the mortgages based on a sliding scale currently from as low as
3 per cent, which is also dependent on the income of the buyers. 'The States
have always been very encouraging of home ownership,' says Mr Powell.
While Jersey is sensitive about the need to prevent over-development, its
current housing plan estimates that about 100 private sector housing units
will be built in each of the next four years.
Mr Trower says he has fought the government regularly on housing matters.
Until a few years ago, there was price control on houses: regulations
stipulated that a house could only be sold for its previous purchase price
plus additional amounts for rebuilding, contents and other costs.
If the States disagreed with the price, a panel of quantity surveyors was
brought in, creating a protracted process which often frustrated buyers and
sellers alike and caused deals to be called off at the last minute. It also
led to evasion techniques such as 'wheelbarrows sold for Pounds 1,500 and
sheds for Pounds 5,000.' He admits that this did prevent prices 'galloping
away' during the property boom.
To avoid the housing classifications limiting acquisition of properties by
non-locals, a number of ingenious techniques were developed. Under the
ancient principle of degrevement, a creditor can take over the property of a
debtor. By holding the property through a company and then transferring the
shares, it falls outside the jurisdiction of the States. This loophole has
now been closed.
Mr Trower says there is one other way for those wanting to become Jersey
residents. Those with some hotel experience can live in any properties with
at least 60 bedrooms. He says there are at least two such properties
currently available.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (11): A chance to hop on the fast track and
Victor Matthews - Those lured over the years include John Nettles (star of
the Bergerac TV series), Ian Woosnam, Alan Whicker / Residency
</HEADLINE>

Wanted: a handful of prominent individuals to move to Jersey each year to
help swell tax revenues and contribute to the community. Apply with detailed
CV and expect a rigorous interview. Those with a criminal record, or who are
not famous or have assets below Pounds 10m need not bother to apply.
For the lucky few with honestly-earned fame or fortune behind them, Jersey
offers a chance to hop on the fast track and circumvent its ferocious
residency regulations to gain access to life in a low tax haven.
Residency control was introduced in 1970, with locals classified in
categories A to H, and outsiders granted permission to live locally on
economic or social grounds as category K. This entitles them to buy or rent
high-priced accommodation that has been classified for K residents.
Those lured over the years include Harry Patterson (better known as author
Jack Higgins), John Nettles (star of the TV detective series Bergerac which
is based in Jersey), Alan Whicker, Ian Woosnam, and Victor Matthews.
Many more residents have unfamiliar names, choosing a lower profile, and
having always concentrated on making money more than garnering public
attention. 'I've seen some serious City figures in my office,' says Mr Roger
Trower, head of Broadlands, probably the largest firm of estate agents on
the island.
He says that among Jersey's attractions for them are the island's closeness
to the UK, the low tax rates, the stable economy and the fact that English
is spoken. He adds that the island is very safe for children, with good
sporting facilities and milder weather than on the UK mainland. France is
only 15 minutes away by aircraft. 'I could make a call and be on a golf
course there this afternoon,' he says. 'It's genuinely a nice place to
live.'
One of the people most influential in making the decision for residency is
Mr Colin Powell, chief adviser to the States of Jersey. He or his deputy
interviews every applicant to gain information on their background, motives
and what they are likely to contribute to the island - such as their time,
charitable donations and sponsorship of events, as well as tax.
Mr Powell inspects financial information to ensure that their money is
honestly obtained and to verify their assets. He then makes a recommendation
 -without revealing any of these personal details - to the housing
committee, which formally makes the decision.
'This can give the impression that there is almost a price to come in,' he
says. 'But some form of selection has to be employed. This was felt to be
the best system. The island has a problem of limited space and a concern
about population growth.'
Mr Powell will not be drawn on naming those who have been turned down, but
he says the number is not that large because most who apply have already
been screened by professionals from the accountancy and law firms who know
the criteria required and who advise those not suitable against going
through the process.
Since the early 1970s, Jersey had been allowing in about 15 K-category
residents each year. This was reduced to five during more recent times of
strong economic growth, but has now been increased again so that about 10
people can expect residence annually.
There are several other ways to qualify to live on the island. Those who are
born there naturally have rights of residency, as do those who marry locals.
However, Jersey passport-holders must be able to show that they, both their
parents and all grandparents were born locally. On the other hand, those
with Channel Islands passports are at a disadvantage compared with the UK,
because they do not share the right of all European Union citizens to work
in any country within the union.
Jersey also allows in each year about 30-40 people in the J category - or
'essential employees' - those who are considered necessary for a company's
successful operations. Employers have to satisfy the housing committee that
anyone granted this status could not be found from among local residents.
Essential employees are allowed to stay for five years, after which they
have traditionally been expected to leave. Last year, the housing committee
relaxed the requirements so that employers can petition for additional
extensions up to 10 years, at which point they can become long-term
residents.
Other Europeans can enter Jersey to find work. The problem is finding
accommodation. They are forbidden from living in any of the accommodation
available for residents in categories A to K. Instead, they must spend their
time in lodgings: either specially-designated apartment blocks supervised by
the housing committee, or in rooms in other people's houses.
In the past, their status never changed. However, last year the politicians
agreed a modest relaxation: those who have lived in Jersey for 20 years or
more would be able to settle and buy accommodation as though they were
long-term residents.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (10): Mixed fortunes across the industry -
As far as arable crops are concerned, the past three years have been average
at best and disastrous at worst / Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD PEDLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Historically, agriculture has been Jersey's most important industry but over
the past 50 years it has been eclipsed by the rise of the tourism and
finance sectors.
About 55 per cent of the island's land is given over to agriculture, but it
contributed only 4 per cent of the income for 1992, compared to 50 per cent
generated by the financial sector.
However, the countryside has been a big factor in Jersey's success as a
tourist resort and it is in the island's best interest to maintain
agriculture as a viable industry. But over the past three years the value of
agriculture, excluding the dairy industry, has fallen from Pounds 40m to
just over Pounds 30m.
Many young growers are leaving the industry and if this year is unsuccessful
the remaining growers will face a crisis.
On the other hand, the dairy side of the industry is looking remarkably
healthy. Jersey's famous cows produce milk with a rich cream content and
even though demand for full-fat milk has dropped, sales have continued to
increase and are now worth more than Pounds 10m a year. This goes against
the trend as milk sales in most European Union countries are dropping
steadily.
Since 1954, the Jersey Milk Marketing Board has been obliged to take all the
milk produced in the island. The limited local market for dairy products and
the increasing demand for low-fat products has made it difficult for the
board to sell all that it receives.
A recent development has been a move into the portion control market, which
has been extremely successful since 1988. Jersey milk pots are now being
used by British Airways, Dairy Crest, the milk processing and supply
subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board in England, and Butlins holiday
camps. The JMMB is also negotiating with MacDonald's, the hamburger chain.
The dairy is due to buy an extra Pounds 1.5m packing machine within the next
year to cope with demand and bring production up to 250,000 units a year.
Despite this success, the JMMB still receives a subsidy of Pounds 1m from
Jersey's government, the States, each year.
As far as arable crops are concerned, the past three years have been average
at best and disastrous at worst. The main crop, the Jersey Royal potato,
accounts for roughly half the annual crop returns. Since 1990, when the crop
was worth more than Pounds 20m, returns have dropped by almost 25 per cent.
This is not purely due to competition from Cyprus and the Canary islands -
the recession and a fair amount of infighting between the four local
marketing groups has also damaged the industry by depressing prices.
Almost all crops are exported to the UK and most of these go to the main
supermarket chains. The amount of profit made in a season is still largely
down to luck, with the weather being the all-important factor.
Diversification has taken place in several areas. Iceberg lettuce is now
being successfully grown in the island and is bought by a number of the
national supermarket chains in the UK. Indoor tomatoes, once the exclusive
province of Guernsey, are now being grown with far more success in Jersey.
Other crops, such as aubergines, are being investigated, but to be of use to
the industry they have to be grown in a quantity that would be of interest
to a supermarket chain.
Different varieties of existing crops, such as lettuce, cauliflower and
flowers, are constantly being investigated by the local States' farm, which
has pledged Pounds 250,000 specifically for this research. Marketing groups
are carrying out their own work but as yet nothing new is being grown in
significant quantities.
The trend of the past few years indicates that farmers are returning to the
Jersey Royal as the crop most likely to give them a good return on their
investment.
While it faces the greatest competition from overseas it remains a unique
product with recognisable brand name. The realisation that it is a quality
crop which can command a high price has led to greater care being taken
during harvesting. As a direct result of the recession, Jersey's Department
of Agriculture and Fisheries has decided to direct the Pounds 7.6m of aid it
gives out in 1994 to those who can demonstrate that they are in need.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (9): Special relationship negotiated -
Jersey remains enthusiastic and confident about the arrangement, seeing far
more advantages than disadvantages / Links with Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the UK entered the European Community it negotiated a special
relationship with the community for Jersey and its other two Crown
dependencies, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.
The islands are not full members but under the arrangement their traditional
right of free trade in manufactured and agricultural goods with the UK is
extended to all EU countries. But they retain their fiscal autonomy and
their long-established right to self government.
They are outside the EU with regard to free movement of people, free trade
in services and fiscal harmonisation. EU directives on taxation do not apply
to Jersey which has no valued added tax, and is treated as a third country
in this respect.
Jersey remains enthusiastic and confident about the arrangement, seeing far
more advantages than disadvantages. Mr. Colin Powell, chief adviser to the
States, says: 'There are inevitably pluses and minuses with any arrangement
of this nature, but it is considered that the pluses continue to heavily
outweigh the minuses. As far as Jersey is concerned there is no pressure for
any change in the relationship - the arrangement continues to be seen as the
best option for the island.'
But the island keeps a close watch on movements within the EU and retains a
law firm in Brussels as its adviser. Senior Jersey politicians and
executives make annual visits to Brussels and twice-yearly visits to the UK
Home Office for discussions about Europe.
Senator Reg Jeune of the Policy and Resources Committee, a Jersey politician
for more than 30 years, says: 'Nobody feels we should change from the
decisions made years ago; our position has been a fortunate one.
'It will be a long time before Europe really gets its act together and it
will be a looser monster than first thought. It helps us that it is not so
tight. But there will be problems for the island and we have to constantly
keep our finger on the pulse.'
Senator Jeune explained that islanders felt more offshore Europe than
offshore UK. While he acknowledges that Jersey fund managers would like
easier access to Europe, he does not see any real hindrance to the island's
finance industry in general by not being a full member state.
'Providing we keep our nose clean and put in place all the laws for a
respectable finance industry,' he added.
Mr. Clive Barton, senior partner in the Jersey office of accountancy firm
Moore Stephens, said: 'Jersey's finance industry sees Europe as a large
market for the island, and an area of work that will grow. The island's
authorities have been travelling to introduce themselves to the European
market.
'However, we might miss out because we have no tax treaties with Europe and
a lot of European advisers are heavily into treaty shopping.'
Mr. Barton said his firm had dealt with substantial trusts and their
accompanying bank balances for a number of Europeans who view Switzerland as
less attractive. 'There is a lot of high net worth private trust business to
be done there. It appeals more than a Swiss bank account, where difficulties
may be encountered in claiming money after the account holder's death.'
He said the island's lack of VAT caused a problem for European companies
trading with another European country and wishing to dog-leg the transaction
through an offshore company. He usually recommends the Isle of Man, which
does have VAT, for these purposes.
'But this is not a reason for Jersey to institute VAT,' he added.
The island's agricultural industry remains the area most affected by the EU.
Mr. Powell said: 'While the industry had ensured access to its traditional
UK market, with the accession of the UK to the EC that market was opened up
to competition from producers in the member states. That competition was
increased further with the subsequent accession of Spain and Portugal to the
community.
'The island is obliged to comply with European rules on hygiene and
production regarding produce it sells to the UK or other European countries.
However it is not obligatory for the island to implement directives if no
trade is to be undertaken.'
But Jersey's small fishing industry - with a total annual catch valued at
Pounds 4.5m - has run into problems. Jersey boats traditionally land catches
in both the UK and France. But French fishermen have interrupted market
access to their country by blockading ports. The last such incident was only
a few weeks ago.
Jersey has only a three-mile territorial water limit, but it is attempting
to get this extended to a six-mile exclusive fishing limit around its coast.
It is also negotiating with France to replace the old agreements on access.
Senator Jeune says: 'We are trying to have much more contact with France, as
our nearest neighbour. It is sad about this latest fisheries incident
because it could strain the relationship.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (8): UK visitors are the bread and butter -
The island has become an all-year-round destination. During peak summer
periods there are about 22,000 beds available; during the winter about 6,000

The biggest skill we can exercise is to keep the island as it is and not
destroy it. Jersey's real strength is what God built, not what we have put
here. These are the words of Mrs Sheila Henwood, director of Jersey Tourism.
Mrs Henwood believes that the island continues to be a good product to sell.
'We manage to keep a good balance between sophistication and simplicity. It
is a very safe environment that has a similar infrastructure to that of the
visitor's home but with the exotic appearance of an island.'
The last buoyant trading year for Jersey's tourist industry was 1990 -
before the recession hit. Since then, visitor numbers have dropped about 17
per cent which, with discounting, probably represents a 20 per cent drop in
total value.
But Mrs Henwood feels the tide has now turned. 'Last year, visitor numbers
from the UK and Europe were up 2 per cent, but there is still a degree of
discounting going on. Because the 1980s were such easy years, any drop
impacts.'
The two leading trends are towards short-stay visitors and more visitors
from continental Europe. 'The Europeans produce very good business - they
stay longer than the British and they spend well. But we recognise very
strongly that the UK is our bread and butter,' says Mrs Henwood.
Of an estimated 683,000 visitors who stayed overnight last year, some
542,000 were from the UK. France produced 47,900; Germany 20,700; Sweden
17,300; and Ireland 11,600. The island has become an all-year-round
destination. During peak summer periods there are about 22,000 beds
available; during the winter about 6,000. With several big attractions open
during the winter, and the island's physical attractiveness little
diminished, most hotels retain a steady flow of visitors during the cooler
months.
Mr Renzo Martin, president of the island's hoteliers' association and
managing director of five Jersey hotels, said: 'The last two years have been
tough. We have had to work harder for less bookings and the lack of money
meant the local market in dinners and functions has been down this winter.'
But Mr Martin says bookings and inquiries are now well up on this time last
year, as are the number of conversions from inquiries to bookings. 'Because
the island is geared to a higher economy than the UK, we've got to make good
money. The operation costs of hotels are much higher and we do not have any
passing trade.
He believes the States will see the industry through this difficult time.
'For the benefit of the island overall, the tourism industry is probably
number one in terms of providing resources, employment and work to other
businesses.
'The hoteliers' association and the tourism department have a very good
liaison. We must work together, then we can achieve a lot,' he said.
The island is hoping to set up a central reservation system. Discussions
about its funding are currently going on between the public and private
sectors and everyone would like to see it activated later this year.
Most hoteliers advertise privately in UK publications and the tourism
department will this year spend about Pounds 3.5m in marketing Jersey in the
UK. About Pounds 1m of this will be spent in television and Pounds 1m in the
press, mostly concentrated in southern regions.
Mr David de Carteret, Jersey Tourism's marketing manager, said the
advertising inquiry response was so far about 20 per cent up on last year.
'This year we are getting a resurgence of interest in the family market. I
think the reasons are that many of our hotels have large family rooms so
they can show a 15-20 per cent price advantage over Mediterranean
destinations. Also, the speed and ease of getting here is more suitable for
children,' he said.
He said the Irish market was picking up, largely due to an increase in
departure points in Ireland. 'It is very much part of the desire of the
public to travel from a local airport. Other destinations may be accessed
from only three or four places, but Jersey can be accessed from many smaller
airports.'
The island, only 14 miles from France, also benefits from large numbers of
day trip visitors. Many are from continental Europe; about 140,000 a year.
Jersey's conference business has suffered because of the recession but the
island still hosts about 20,000 delegates a year for conferences.
Seventy-one per cent of this business comes from the UK, although last year
business from continental Europe increased by 50 per cent.
Big growth has been seen in small to medium-sized conferences of fewer than
100 delegates, although conferences of 1,500 or more delegates are still
accommodated. Jersey offers one of the cheapest rates in Britain - about
Pounds 83 a head for 24 hours in a four-star venue, compared with about
Pounds 140 in London or the Home Counties.
Mrs Henwood said of the whole industry: 'The message for 1994 is upbeat. The
feedback is positive on inquiries and bookings and we are going for quality
and sustainable development.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (6): Chief adviser has finger on pulse -
Profile / Colin Powell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are very few aspects of Jersey life that Mr Colin Powell, chief
adviser to the States, is not concerned with. Whatever the topic and whoever
you are discussing it with - politician, civil servant or someone from the
private sector - at some point they will refer to Mr Powell.
He has his finger on every pulse and has built up and retains an extensive
knowledge of how the island operates. His knowledge, combined with his
modest and unflappable manner, has earned him the deep respect of everyone
he deals with.
'I see myself as a servant; an adviser to the politicians. You hope that
what you have to say will be taken on board, otherwise an adviser's work
would not be very satisfying,' he says. His diligence and attention to
detail over the past 25 years have certainly earned him the open ears of
Jersey's foremost movers.
But Mr Powell is not a Jerseyman. He was born and educated in Surrey before
taking his economics degree at Cambridge. He followed this with two years in
the economic section of the British Iron and Steel Federation in London,
before taking an economic adviser's post in the Northern Ireland government
at Stormont in 1963 - where he stayed until the end of 1968.
Mr Powell moved to Jersey in 1969 to take up the newly-created post of
economic adviser. He said the need arose for the job from two factors. 'By
the second half of the 1960s, the island's population was increasing by
around 1,000 a year. This put considerable strain on the economy and the
politicians wanted to know how to control it. Secondly, the lack of economic
information made it difficult for Jersey to decide which situation was best
for it with regard to the UK's attempt to join the EEC.'
His first big task was to produce an economic survey of the island, which
was published in 1971. This has been the basis for much of the island's
subsequent development. Initially, it was thought that a new survey would be
produced after 10 years, but Mr Powell's annual reports and statistical
digests have provided the updates.
Always a forward planner, he has decided to write a new edition of the
economic survey as one of his retirement tasks. He hopes to retire in 1997
when he will be 60 and his other retirement task will be to write a history
of Jersey as an international finance centre. 'When I first came here in
1969 the finance industry was 9 per cent of the island's income. Now it is
50 per cent and most of the growth was in the 1970s and 1980s.'
'My job changes all the time. In the past 25 years no two years have been
the same and you have to be adaptable. If a small island is to be successful
it must be adaptable. It does not control market forces and must be able to
respond flexibly. I have to respond to changing political as well as
economic influences,' he said.
Jersey's Policy and Resources Committee, responsible for co-ordinating and
prioritising the work of other government committees, was formed in 1989.
'Underlying that was the need for co-ordination and corporate thinking. The
role of co-ordinator fell to me because there was no one else in this
position. In 1992, it was agreed the role I was performing was not very
aptly described and would be better described as chief adviser.'
He feels the new system has worked well, providing a more corporate approach
to matters. 'This is particularly so now the island has come through a
period of recession. We were faced with the need to prioritise and exercise
restraint, which the island had not had to do for some years.
'Jersey is very lucky. Its economy is based on two industries - finance and
tourism - that face positive markets. I see no reason why growth should not
continue over at least the next 10 years.'
But he feels there will be changes. 'Jersey is a niche market player and has
to respond to circumstances in the outside world. Although faced with a
difficult economic climate, I still expect Jersey to remain something of a
jewel in the economic crown of Europe.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (7): Crown dependency of the UK - The UK
retains responsibility for the island's defence and international relations
and the right to veto legislation passed by the States / Legislature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Protagonists of devolution might well hold Jersey as a role model. It is a
Crown dependency of the UK with its own parliament, the States, that is
responsible for most of the government of its 80,000 population.
The UK retains responsibility for the island's defence and international
relations and the right to veto legislation passed by the States.
The States comprises 53 members - 12 Senators, 29 Deputies and 12
Constables. They are all democratically elected. There are no party
politics. Each member is an independent and, by virtue of the island's size,
easily accessible to those he or she represents.
The whole is presided over by the Bailiff, appointed by the Crown, who
retains the right to a casting vote.
Other Crown appointments in the island are: the Lieutenant Governor, who
represents the Queen, the Deputy Bailiff, the Attorney-General, the
Solicitor-General and the Dean, all of whom have no vote in the States.
Senators are elected by the whole island's electorate for a six-year term,
six of them retiring every third year. The 29 Deputies are elected by
constituency electorates for a three-year term.
Each Constable is elected by the electorate of one of the island's 12
parishes.
States members are paid a flat allowance of Pounds 8,000 a year, but may
draw up to a further Pounds 10,000 subject to means testing. Their duties
keep them busy about half of every week.
Introduction of the additional allowance a few years ago has led to a
broadening of representation in the States.
The States assembles for public debate and voting once a fortnight. Until a
couple of years ago it was weekly, traditionally starting at 10.15 to
coincide with arrival of the train from St. Aubin. The meetings were
unstructured and often postponed to the following week.
Now the fortnightly meeting begins at 9.30 and follows an agenda drawn up by
the Greffier, the clerk of the States. Extra meetings can be held when
necessary.
The Bailiff, who is appointed to office until his 70th birthday, has a dual
role - presiding over the States and over the Royal Court, the island's high
court. He and the Deputy Bailiff are the island's judges.
Sir Peter Crill, the current Bailiff, was originally elected to the States
in 1951. He sees no need for a change in the Bailiff's dual role and says
this was confirmed by the Royal Commission in 1973.
Sir Peter is concerned about a trend towards professional politicians in the
island.
'Jersey is very much a community of voluntary service. I believe that
because our structure is based on voluntary work, we should not encourage
young, professional politicians.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (5): Competition in some fields - The legal
services market is more tightly controlled than for accountants. Lawyers
need to be qualified in Jersey to practice / Legal and Accountancy
Professions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glance through the list of accountancy firms in the Jersey telephone
directory, and you might be mistaken for thinking that you were in London,
New York or Sydney, so many of the same names arise.
All the UK's largest 'big six' firms are present, as well as some of the
medium-sized firms, to accompany the local names. The most recent entrant,
just three years ago, was Arthur Andersen. Mr Greg Branch, partner in charge
of the office, says he now has about 25 staff and is seeing healthy growth.
With low unemployment and difficulties in recruitment from the UK, he says
one of the firm's real problems is finding new employees.
In many ways, the business carried out by the accountants in Jersey is
similar to anywhere elsewhere in the world, with accounting, tax and
consultancy services all on offer. Mr Branch says demand for consulting,
which he imagined would grow only slowly, has proved unexpectedly popular as
companies which expanded rapidly in Jersey seek advice on their operations
and systems.
In the future, there are signs that the accountants' role will expand as a
result of new legislation, including the forthcoming financial business law
which will require a reporting accountant to verify to the States'
supervisors each year that trust companies and other financial services
entities comply with requirements.
The primary element that skews the accountants' business away from the
normal pattern elsewhere is the heavy influence of offshore trusts and
company administration work.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, through its subsidiary Abacus, is probably the largest
such entity locally. It employs more than 400 people in the Channel Islands,
of whom about two-thirds work on trusts and companies.
There is certainly a wide variety and growing number of products available,
with work required on personal trusts, special purpose vehicles, 'freezer
trusts' in which entrepreneurs shield their shareholdings from capital gains
tax, and the infamous 'asset protection trusts' designed to safeguard the
assets of professionals worried about being sued.
In this work, the accountants come into direct competition with lawyers,
bankers and other firms offering trust and company administration. 'We are
all fulfilling the same function though we approach it from different
angles,' says Mr Geoffrey Grime, senior partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
The exception to this pattern is Andersen, which has avoided entering trust
or company administration work. Mr Branch says this is partly a response to
the 'risk-reward ratio', given that great competition means the fees are
relatively low, while there are substantial future liabilities if things go
awry.
However, he also says that taking on the role as a trustee or administrator
would risk at the very least the perception of a conflict of interest, with
the firm acting effectively as directors of companies which may form part of
their own client base.
The structure of law firms in Jersey is rather different to the accountants.
While a few London practices - such as Gouldens and Theodore Goddard - have
established local offices, law is dominated by long-established Jersey-based
firms.
This may partly reflect the traditionally less aggressive approach of
lawyers than accountants in building international works. In addition, the
legal services market is more tightly controlled than for accountants.
Lawyers need to be qualified in Jersey to practise, which acts as a barrier
to entry.
Unlike the UK, most law firms include both barristers and solicitors. Each
group is currently separately controlled and represented by its own body,
although a debate is now in hand about whether the separate bodies should be
merged.
Mr Jonathan White, a senior advocate with Ogier &amp; Le Cornu, one of Jersey's
law firms, says there may have been a modest decline in demand for some
types of legal services, although he sees continued growth of commercial
litigation. 'Until now there was almost too much work for too few firms,' he
says.
How do the firms ensure the honesty of their clients - particularly those
without a corporate presence on the island who are subject to some
independent scrutiny by officials?
'You have to know your client, but it is horrendously difficult to monitor,'
says Mr Branch. 'The days when people came in with suitcases full of money
are long gone. They have become much more sophisticated.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (4): Towards greater regulation - In spite
of the proposed new legislation, Jersey continues to walk a tightrope /
Trusts and Companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It does not take long for the casual visitor to St Helier to identify one of
the mainstays of the local economy: numerous brass, silver and gold plaques
symbolise the enormous number of offshore trusts and companies controlled
from the island.
But after the great growth of offshore financial services on Jersey since
the 1960s, the government has finally begun turning its attention to
clamping down more firmly on their regulation in line with controls covering
most other parts of the finance industry.
The biggest growth in trusts took place in the past decade, after Jersey
became one of the first countries in the world to introduce a trust law in
1984. According to figures from the Jersey Financial Services Commission,
nearly half of the top 500 companies in Europe now have companies or trusts
on the island, and nearly one third of the top 700 companies in
Asia-Pacific.
It now estimates that there are about 200 trust and company administrators,
managing several thousand individual trusts holding assets of perhaps Pounds
50bn. 'Jersey has been distinguished by the quality of legal advice and of
the courts,' says Mr Richard Syvret, director of the Financial Services
Commission. 'The trust law has been much copied in other jurisdictions. It
has been a real bonanza.'
In the past, Jersey has relied on maintaining high quality by scrutinising
businesses when they first apply to set up. Under the 1973 regulation of
undertakings law, it has always vetted companies, requiring information such
as beneficial ownership.
However, the mood has been changing in the past few years towards greater
regulation. The 1984 trusts law only has one very restricted supervisory
requirement: that if a limited liability company is acting as a trustee, its
directors should be jointly and severably liable.
'The view has now developed that we need to play a part in supervising
trustees from the point of view of protecting the island's good name,' says
Mr Syvret. 'We've had one or two small problems.'
Jersey has generally escaped relatively unscathed from many of the financial
scandals of the past few years, but only last year it became clear that the
existing system was far from foolproof when two significant cases came to
trial in the local courts.
Mr Tony Delaney, a certified accountant, who controlled Deltrust and
Sentinel Management, was sentenced to six years' imprisonment after pleading
guilty to defrauding clients of more than Pounds 1.1m.
Later last year, Mr Nicholas Hanley, a barrister and company and trust
adviser, was also sentenced to six years after pleading guilty to defrauding
17 clients of Pounds 4.75m which he used to fund his compulsive gambling
addiction. This is believed to be the island's biggest ever fraud.
However, work on a new set of regulations began long before these cases came
to light. The reason was partly recognition of the growing need for
consistent regulation across the financial services sector. 'Trusts and
companies were the big black hole for regulation,' says Mr Jeffery Grime,
senior partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Mr John Pallot, deputy director of the Financial Services Commission in
charge of the financial business division, is currently helping draft the
Financial Business (Jersey) Law, which will cover trusts and company
administrators, as well as insurance intermediaries and investment
businesses. Under current plans, his department will increase to eight staff
as they adopt their new supervisory role.
Under the proposals, trust companies and other financial businesses will be
required to register with the States, be subject to an annual audit,
demonstrate they have professional indemnity insurance cover, and show that
the directors are 'fit and proper' to run the operations.
There will be an annual declaration by the directors on topics such as the
segregation of money, the quality of books and records, the state of
internal controls, and to ensure that there are at least two executive
directors or partners examining the work - the 'four eyes principle'.
Following an outcry over client confidentiality if civil servants examined
trust records, revised proposals say companies will provide an annual
statement verified by a reporting accountant.
The delays caused by debate over the trust regulation are likely to delay
the law into next year, although some are suggesting the trust elements may
be split from the regulations covering the other financial services sectors,
to allow these to be enacted more rapidly.
In spite of this proposed new legislation, Jersey continues to walk a
tightrope in its determination to continue to attract high quality offshore
business. If it does not, it will lose out to the increasingly aggressive
competition from some of its rivals - not least Guernsey and the Isle of
Man.
Last year, it introduced the International Business Company, under which
businesses can opt for a rate of tax as low as 0.5 per cent, and a two-hour
incorporation service. 'Those companies with a sound track record will find
no difficulty in getting a licence,' says Mr Syvret. 'We are very very open
for quality business.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (2): Profits up 15% staff down 5% - The
recession has opened the way to a new growth period free of the constraints
of labour and property shortages / Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jersey is one of the premier offshore banking centres of Europe - still no
rival to Switzerland but not so far behind Luxembourg as a private banking
centre.
Moreover it is poised to expand again, after a period of consolidation.
Mr Roger Bignall, the banking and insurance regulator, says that four new
institutions are in the process of setting up in Jersey, and the year's
total could be six. At present, 71 banks are established including nine
so-called 'managed' banks which have no separate physical presence but
operate through other banks or accountancy firms.
Bank deposits actually fell last year from Pounds 53.4bn to Pounds 52.9bn
but this gives a misleading picture of the strength of the industry.
With dollar interest rates so low, and sterling rates falling too, many
investors switched into the securities markets.
'There are no unhappy faces. Everyone is happy with the amount of business
coming in,' says Mr Julian Bub, head of Chase Manhattan's Jersey operation
and president of the Jersey Bankers Association.
In recent years, Jersey bankers have focused primarily on the booming market
in services to private clients. A survey by Chase Manhattan Private Bank
last year concluded that worldwide some Dollars 2,100bn is placed 'offshore'
outside the investor's domicile. Of this, some 6 per cent is in the Channel
Islands, with Jersey significantly larger than Guernsey, its neighbouring
rival.
Economic overheating in Jersey caused problems in the late 1980s but the
recession has opened the way to a new growth period free - at least for the
time being - of the constraints of labour and property shortages. Jersey's
banking industry has shared in the labour shake-out common to banking
throughout Europe but it missed the problems of bad debts which hit banks
generally.
Thus in 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, Jersey's
banks actually increased their profits by 15 per cent while staff numbers
fell by 5 per cent. Consequently the average profit per employee, a key
measure tracked by the island's authorities, jumped by a fifth to Pounds
116,300.
Productivity has been boosted by technology upgrades and by the shift
towards investment funds and securities where margins can be higher and
there is more scope to earn fees.
A recent survey of the Channel Islands banking industry by accountants
Arthur Andersen found that most banks expected their profits to grow by at
least 10 per cent a year over the next few years but the labour force could
eventually shrink by up to another 10 per cent from current levels. Slightly
surprisingly, bankers expected more growth from corporate business and
institutional investors than from private clients.
Many banks earn a prosperous living around the English-speaking expatriate
circuit. 'There is more opportunity than we can possibly cope with,' says Mr
Trevor Falle, marketing director of ANZ Grindlays. 'The investment side is
stretched at the moment.'
There remains the challenge of continental Europe, where tighter
harmonisation could play into Jersey's hands.
'We should raise our level of awareness as Offshore Europe,' says Mr Peter
Williams, managing director of Lazard Brothers. 'But with Europe, Jersey's
main problem is a language barrier.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (3): Growth centre of finance industry -
There are now some 760 separate investment pools, many of them tied together
under umbrella structures / Fund Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Collective funds moved to the growth centre of Jersey's finance industry
last year, gaining from the big rises in most of the world's securities
markets and the parallel loss of appeal of bank deposits.
At the end of December, Jersey-based funds were worth Pounds 23.4bn; up 48
per cent in 12 months. Of the total, Pounds 19.5bn was accounted for by
open-ended funds and the remaining Pounds 3.9bn by closed-end vehicles.
There are now some 760 separate investment pools, many of them tied together
under umbrella structures.
Jersey's funds are largely invested in equities, reflecting a different
approach and clientele from that of, say, Luxembourg, which is heavily
orientated towards bonds. Just under 30 per cent of Jersey's open-ended fund
assets are bonds, with another 7 per cent in money funds. Equity funds are
mainly orientated towards Europe and the Far East.
The figures, incidentally, do not cover private funds, including offshore
institutional vehicles. These 'Cobo' funds, so-called because they are set
up only under the control of borrowing law rather than the collective
investment funds legislation, could be worth another Pounds 10bn, industry
experts say, although no statistics are available.
A survey published last month by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand showed,
unsurprisingly, that members of the Jersey Fund Managers Association are in
a buoyant mood. Some 84 per cent recorded higher profits in 1993, and 80 per
cent expect more gains in 1994.
The survey suggested that the industry was looking equally to three sources
of business - the retail market, institutional investors and private
portfolio management. Four geographical client categories were picked out:
the UK, UK expatriates, the Far East and the European Union, ranked in that
order of importance.
The importance of the UK market exposes the Jersey fund management industry
to the consequences of mainland regulatory changes, so local managers are
closely watching the proposals for the introduction of open-ended investment
companies (oeics) in the UK and accompanying changes such as the
introduction of single pricing.
Although oeics already exist in Jersey along with unit trusts, access to the
UK market is through designated territory status under Section 87 of the
Financial Services Act, a route which at present rules out single pricing.
'An area of concern is whether funds from the designated territories will be
required to be equivalent to unit trusts or to the new oeics,' says Mr
Jonathan Overland, spokesman for the JFMA and a marketing executive at
Capital House. There have been talks with the Treasury and the Securities
and Investments Board in the UK.
Access to other markets is clearly important to Jersey's future as an
offshore centre, and the authorities have been talking to several
jurisdictions. So far, Japan, Ireland, Switzerland and the Netherlands have
granted at least restricted or fund-by-fund marketing rights.
'We are all looking over our shoulders to se what happens on oeics,' says Mr
Alastair Torvaney, who runs Perpetual's Dollars 400m Jersey offshoot.
Mr Torvaney thinks individual deals with countries will prove costly and
time-consuming, however. In the meantime, he perceives opportunities for
third-party administration, for example for institutional funds which do not
require day-to-day attention. 'All retail funds in Jersey must be looking at
this as an add-on,' he says.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (1): Offshore industry expands strongly -
Jersey is putting behind it the awkward period at the end of the 1980s when
the economy overheated and curbs had to be placed on business expansion /
Introduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
Yes, they do have some bananas in Jersey. At least, the UK-listed fruit
group, Geest, last year set up its worldwide trading headquarters in the
island, one of the first substantial companies to take advantage of new
rules for so-called international business companies.
Besides soliciting global traders, Jersey has also begun to promote a
nascent offshore insurance industry and once again is more actively
marketing itself to international banks, more than 70 of which are already
represented. The offshore funds industry, meanwhile, has been expanding
strongly during the recent bullish phase for global securities markets.
Jersey is thus putting well behind it the awkward period at the end of the
1980s when the economy overheated and curbs had to be placed on business
expansion, especially through employment restrictions under the Control of
Undertakings law.
The island earned a reputation for being closed for new business. That was
never entirely true, but the limited resources of the labour and property
markets had to be focused on the established banking, funds and trusts
sectors and the finance industry was unable to develop in other directions.
Finally, Jersey ran into the effects of the UK recession, especially on
tourism, and 1991 and 1992 saw a rare dip in the island's economy, with
gross domestic product falling some 6.5 per cent to Pounds 1.29bn over the
two years. Meanwhile, the number of people in full-time private sector jobs
declined by some 2,500 to 35,800 between June 1991 and June 1993.
A good part of the ensuing unemployment problem was transferred to the UK
mainland as perhaps 2,000 transient workers, many of them in construction,
returned home.
Although no figures are yet available for 1993, the economy has clearly
moved off the bottom. 'We certainly saw the improvement coming through in
the second half of 1993,' says Mr Colin Powell, chief adviser to the States,
the island's government, and Jersey's top civil servant. 'There is now a
much more confident feel.'
The island's equivalent of a finance minister is Senator Pierre Horsfall,
president of the powerful finance and economics committee. He points out the
short-term and long-term reasons why Jersey is now able to seek more
vigorous expansion.
'There is now some slack in the economy, and a very high level of skills is
available,' he says. Just as important, however, is the evidence of
sharply-rising productivity in the banking industry, an international rather
than just a Jersey phenomenon. 'The indications are that the finance
industry will employ fewer people over the years,' he says.
Offshore finance is now reckoned to generate 50-51 per cent of Jersey's
income. Tourism was last estimated at 26 per cent in 1992, and has probably
fallen further. Much of the balance of income represents the investment
receipts of wealthy residents.
Prospects for tourism in 1994 are a little better, thanks to the recovery in
the mainland economy. Senator Horsfall emphasises that the strategy of the
States is to continue to promote tourism: 'We want to keep the second pillar
strong,' he says.
The position of the offshore finance industry, still only about 25 years
old, is regarded as secure despite growing competition, but it is now so
dominant as a wealth generator that it is recognised that the risks should
be prudently spread.
'We've got a few gaps,' says Senator Horsfall. 'It's now quite clear that at
this time some diversification is welcome.'
Accordingly, local firms have been given the go-ahead to exploit the
insurance law which was introduced in 1983 but which was effectively put on
ice for some years because of labour shortages. The first few captive and
reinsurance companies (two of each so far) have been set up, and there is a
Jersey Captive Insurance Association, but Jersey remains a very long way
behind its neighbour Guernsey in the insurance business.
International business companies represent an attempt to move beyond brass
plate entities towards corporate HQ units attracted by low local taxes and
good communications. Geest has moved from the Bahamas to Jersey partly
because of the convenience of a location in the European time zone.
Another current legislative initiative concerns limited partnerships, which
are seen as important to attract certain types of investment vehicles to the
island.
Meanwhile, the established banking industry is being more vigorously
promoted, with Jersey dignitaries undertaking a programme of visits to
European centres such as Paris and Frankfurt. Four new banking licences are
at present in the final stages of negotiation.
Jersey seeks to promote itself as a clean and well-regulated financial
centre. 'We are not regarded as a thorn in the side of either the UK or
Europe,' insists Senator Horsfall. 'It can be argued that we are of
significant benefit to our neighbours.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous equities overshadowed by Fed
meeting - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A trading session overshadowed by worries ahead of the meeting today of the
US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee closed with share prices giving
ground as Wall Street fell sharply in early trading. The final hour in
London coincides with the traditional timing for the Federal Reserve to
intervene in US money markets, and some traders in London clearly feared a
pre-emptive strike from the Fed yesterday.
Equities spent most of the session following the gilt-edged market which had
an equally unsettled session. After opening lower, share prices slipped
below the Footsie 3,200 mark before both bonds and equities steadied
following the announcement of the UK's non-EC trade deficit for last month.
The deficit was smaller than anticipated in the market.
The stock market failed to join fully in the rally in bonds and was soon
again overshadowed by the weakness on Wall Street. The final reading showed
the FT-SE Index at 3,198.0 for a loss on the day of 20.1. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index also eased, shedding 11.1 to 3,854.5.
Traders warned that turnover in equities had been unimpressive - Seaq volume
fell 17 per cent to 506.3m shares. In addition to the Fed's Open Market
Committee meeting today, markets have to face auctions this week of Dollars
28m in near-term US bonds; London must also brace itself for the UK Retail
price index, due tomorrow, and expected to show that domestic inflation has
remained subdued.
However, on Friday, retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.43bn,
fully maintaining the bounding volume levels which have brought such
excellent trading results this year from the securities houses and merchant
banks.
The flow of company reporting statements continued to support views that the
stock market will benefit from a recovery in company profits, even while
economic recovery appears to be sluggish. Bunzl, the paper group, joined the
list of leading British companies to increase its dividend payout
significantly.
Better news on the European car industry came from Porsche and Lucas
Industries, which although it left the dividend unchanged, indicated some
steadying in industry sales. Overall, however, share prices moved in thin
trading and traders were unwilling to take on new share positions.
Yesterday's market performance suggested that the European bourses are still
finding difficulty in shaking off the influence of US credit policies, even
though local analysts continue to argue that interest rates can be lower in
Europe while they rise in the US.
There is no certainty that the US Federal Reserve will make any announcement
today - in the past, it has left the markets to scrutinise the Fed's
intervention money market intervention policies to discern its policy.
However, Mr Greenspan did make a statement a month ago when the Fed changed
stance and London analysts expect a formal statement today if the Fed
decides to take serious action, such as increasing its discount rate. At
worst, a half point rise in the rate is thought possible.
Some London strategists took the view that, since the Federal Reserve has
made clear its intentions to tighten policy, European markets will be
unsettled until it makes its move. In the meantime, it was clear yesterday
that the London market is unlikely to develop much significant direction.

FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives traders reported a dull and uneventful session as they awaited
the outcome of today's US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting,
writes Joel Kibazo.
In Liffe futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,207. Early
selling saw it fall to the day's low of 3,192 within the first hour of
trading. The release of favourable UK economic data, and a rally in the
bonds helped bring about a recovery in June over the lunch time period.
The retreat on Wall Street brought about another fall in the contract before
it finished at 3,198, at parity with cash but down 17 on Friday's close and
around 10 points below its fair value premium to cash of about 10 points.
Volume at the official close was a poor 9,869.
The FT-SE Mid-250 on Liffe was also dull with 2 contracts dealt as June
closed at 3,855. The screen showed no contracts traded in the same contract
on the OMLX.
The Liffe traded options sector had one of its poorest days in recent
sessions with turnover reaching only 21,575 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option
traded 6,094 lots while the Euro-FT-SE 100 option saw business of 3,141
contracts.
HSBC was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,805 contracts dealt.

FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's largest bank note manufacturer, De La Rue, was the biggest
casualty in the FT-SE 100 after announcing a small acquisition and also
suffering a bout of profit-taking. On the first day of its return to the
Footsie index of leading UK companies, De La Rue's shares fell 41 to 980p on
comparatively high turnover of 1.1m. The shares have recently risen sharply
following a rumoured upgrade by Cazenove.
The company also announced that it had bought MB-Clarke, the cheque printing
arm of conglomerate Caradon. Caradon shares eased 4 to 392p.
Finally, there was some concern over the rising price of paper, which was
highlighted by an encouraging statement from paper merchant Bunzl as well as
newspaper comment. However analysts said printers such as De La Rue would
find it easy to pass on the higher prices to customers and would not suffer.
Bunzl shares lifted 2 to 183p.
Bank shares were among the market's worst performers as dealers fretted
about increased interest rates in the US and their impact on European
markets.
NatWest's acquisition of Citizens First Bancorp of the US for Dollars 500m
unsettled NatWest late in the session with the bank's shares closing 13 down
at 472p.
The latest slide by the Hong Kong market triggered a fresh burst of selling
in the leading Hong Kong related stocks such as HSBC, finally 32 off at
772p. Standard Chartered dipped 36 to 1124p.
Schroders was again the pick of the merchant banks with the market still
responding to last week's bumper profits and the 50 per cent dividend
increase and also picking up suggestions that the bank may be interested in
absorbing US associate Wertheim Schroder. Schroder shares climbed 24 to
1193p.
Other merchant banks, however, fell back as dealers continued to worry about
potential market losses during the recent upheavals in bond markets across
the globe. SG Warburg dipped 17 to 748p.
A weekend Press story suggesting that Liberty Life, the international
insurance group, is preparing a mega-bid, triggered a short-lived mark-up in
Sun Alliance shares, which touched 338p before slipping back to close
unchanged at 329p.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo held its ground after a recommendation from
NatWest Securities pointed out the yield benefits of the stock. The shares
were higher but finished 1 1/2 off at 683p. The note also recommended
Zeneca, up 2 at 756p.
USM-listed ML Laboratories improved 9 to 234p after a new product received
approval from the EU medicines approval body.
Press reports that results pending from Wembley will include large property
write-downs, as well as some gloomy speculation over trading prospects, saw
the shares slump 25 per cent, closing 3 1/2 down at 10 1/2 p. There was
further media comment on Forte, up 2 1/2 at 262 1/2 p, and Savoy, 10 ahead
at 1125p. Forte owns a large minority share of the Savoy and there has been
speculation of an impending deal between the two.
Results from Argos, the catalogue stores group, came in line with market
forecasts, with the shares, up 4 at 359p, being helped by an upbeat trading
statement.
Boots and WH Smith moved in opposite directions, although analysts put this
down to technical reasons rather than reaction to reports that a
restructuring announcement about the groups' joint Do It All home
improvement subsidiary was imminent. Boots shares were steady at 536p, while
WH Smith retreated 10 to 514p.
Reuters was firm on reports that the German Stock Exchange might be prepared
to take on Globex, Reuters' electronic futures and options system. The
shares added 10 at 2020p.
Elsewhere, the sector was hard hit by bearish press comment that it was
overvalued. Reed International, which disappointed with its figures last
week, fell a further 21 to 848p. Some analysts began to feel the shares now
represented a buying opportunity. United Newspapers, which is expected to
show margins under pressure when it publishes figures on Thursday, fell 17
to 671p and Carlton Communications lost 23 at 940p.
Advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi slipped 6 to 143p on reports that the
chief executive might quit this week.

FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lucas downgraded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerospace and motor components group Lucas Industries surrendered 10 to
209p, in healthy volume of 6.5m, after several brokers downgraded full-year
profit expectations following the release of interim figures.
Brokers said earlier predictions had been over-ambitious and several
analysts said the company was a little too optimistic about the short-term
recovery prospects, though prospects for the long term remained good.
Dealers also said the improvement in profits had been discounted.
Brokers downgrading included BZW, which reduced its forecast by Pounds 13m
to Pounds 72m, and Panmure Gordon, which trimmed its figure by Pounds 11m to
Pounds 75m. Mr Harry Philips at the Panmure said: 'Trading conditions remain
difficult, but I remain positive particularly about the year to July 1996.'
However, NatWest Securities was more positive and it upgraded its current
year forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 80m.

FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oils on the alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil sectors provided the market's two highest turnover stocks in BP and
Lasmo, ahead of what is viewed by oil analysts as a crucial Opec meeting in
Geneva on Friday.
Oil specialists were saying yesterday that stories emanating from the Middle
East suggested that the most likely outcome of the talks was a roll-over of
the current output agreement for a further two quarters.
'If that is the case then there is probably scope for a further Dollars 1
slide in oil prices to around the Dollars 12.50 a barrel level,' said one
analyst.
BP was the market's biggest turnover stock with 7.6m traded, as the shares
edged up 3 1/2 to 371p as some of the market's action funds adopted an
aggressively positive view of Friday's Opec meeting.
Shell, on the other hand, dipped 2 1/2 to 670p, after talk of switching into
BP. Lasmo shares were sustained throughout the session, closing a penny
ahead at 131p on 7.2m traded following keen support by one of the big
international marketmaking firms. Lasmo is due to announce preliminary
figures tomorrow.

FT  22 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hurt by concerns over
monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks fell sharply yesterday amid heightened international tensions and
nagging concerns over monetary policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 30.80 lower at 3,864.85,
surrendering all the gains it notched up in the previous session's
expiration-related rally. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was
down 2.52 at 468.54. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was
off 2.19 at 470.77, while the Nasdaq composite, after setting two
consecutive all-time highs, fell 6.63 to 797.30.
NYSE activity was light, but a burst of program-driven selling at the
opening bell helped boost volume to 247m shares.
The optimistic note on which trading ended last week proved to be fleeting.
A primary concern yesterday was the failure of the US Treasury market to
staunch its losses after a sharp sell-off in the final trading day of last
week.
Today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making arm, the Federal Open
Market Committee, was weighing heavily on bonds. Prices dropped sharply
across the yield curve amid anticipation of an imminent move by the Fed to
nudge up short-term interest rates for a second time in as many months.
Political tensions were exacerbating the market's monetary jitters. Threats
by the US to take steps to punish North Korea for its refusal to permit
nuclear inspections accelerated a downward push in stocks that normally
follows big Friday advances.
Stocks which are sensitive to broad economic trends were among the big
losers. Chevron sagged Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 90 7/8 , Boeing shed Dollars
1 1/8 to Dollars 46, International Paper dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 68
5/8 and 3M lost Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 102.
In banking, Baltimore Bancorp jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 19 1/4 after
First Fidelity offered to buy the group for Dollars 346m, or Dollars 20 3/4
a share.
Cadence Design Systems was up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/8 in heavy
trading on the NYSE. The stock benefited from an upgrading by Mr Gregory
Gould, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. IBM closed Dollars 1 1/4
ahead at Dollars 58 1/2 as analysts at a Phoenix trade convention
scrutinised computer operating software developed by its Taligent joint
venture with Apple.
Brazil
An unexpected rise in the benchmark overnight interest rate from 54 per cent
to 56.5 per cent, and rising inflation forecasts continued to take its toll
on the Sao Paulo stock market, where prices dropped 4.6 per cent in weak
trading. The Bovespa index ended at 12,708 points, down 610. Turnover was
Cr196.3bn (Dollars 243.8m).
State-run telecom firm Telebras fell 5 per cent, mining giant Vale do Rio
Doce was down down 4.9 per cent, and oil monopoly Petrobras dropped 7.1 per
cent.
Canada
Toronto stocks broke a six-day winning streak, closing sharply lower in
moderate trading. The TSE-300 index tumbled 43.11 points, or 0.94 per cent,
to 4,523.50, with declines leading advances 459 to 354 in decreased turnover
of CDollars 706.8m.

FT  22 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hang Seng and KLSE lead
decline in the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of Japan's absence, closed for the spring equinox holiday, the
region's markets were very active. Hong Kong continued to fall, and most
analysts expect it to fall further before finding a new support level.
HONG KONG succumbed to heavy institutional selling triggered a wave of sell
orders by local investors.
The Hang Seng index tumbled 5.1 per cent, or 465.28 to 8,667.03, having hit
a low of 8,658. Turnover was HKDollars 6.2bn.
Brokers commented that most of the sell orders initially came from Europe,
before accelerating as local investors added their orders.
Blue chips lost across the board: HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 5 to
HKDollars 87.50, and Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 50.
KUALA LUMPUR took a 5 per cent tumble as US funds withdrew, writes Kieran
Cooke. The composite index lost 52.88 to 954.18.
The market dropped below the 1,000 level for the first time since early
December. Brokers said that there was heavy selling of blue chip stocks with
foreign fund managers poised to move funds either back to the US or into
Japan.
'At the moment it's more a retreat than a stampede,' said one broker.
Individual buyers have been driving the market up in recent months but
retail buyers have been concentrating on highly speculative second board
stocks.
Some local economic indicators are also thought to have contributed to
market nervousness: while Malaysia's gross domestic product seems likely to
grow by more than 8 per cent this year, there is concern that moves by Bank
Negara, the central bank, to control inflation are not working.
SINGAPORE, struck by redemption selling, suffered one of its biggest one-day
falls this year.
At its lowest point on Monday, the 30-share index was down nearly 3.5
percent, or 72.83 points. The Straits Times Industrial index gathered some
ground on late bargain hunting to end off 67.72 or 3.2 per cent at 2,306.30.
SEOUL had worries of its own as tensions continued to increase with North
Korea. The composite index shed 8.34 to 885.65. Investors shrugged off the
news that South Korea will allow foreign investors to buy some convertible
bonds from June. Turnover was Won620bn.
TAIWAN alone among the south-east Asian markets showed a rise on the day,
helped by news that the SEC had approved the stock dividends by the Big
Three banks.
But sentiment remained nervous and China Steel closed below its public offer
price for the first time.
The weighted index rose 26.10 at 5,220.73, off an intra-day high of 5,243.
Turnover was TDollars 30.4bn. China Steel lost 20 cents at TDollars 21.60,
below the TDollars 21.71 price for its current public offer of 288m shares,
which closes on Tuesday.
MANILA was upset by the fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone in New
York on Friday. The composite index lost 59.41 to 2,598.57, with turnover
down to 346.8m pesos.
PLDT fell 55 pesos or nearly 3 per cent to 1,820 pesos while Philippine
National Bank was down 30 pesos at 515 pesos.
The Philippines' two stock markets will be merged tomorrow with a single
price and quote for all 200 issues.
AUSTRALIA tumbled sharply at the close with many investors absent. The All
Ordinaries index lost 23.0 to 2,140.5, but off its day's low of 2,136.6.
Turnover was ADollars 415.9m.
BHP was down 16 cents to ADollars 17.14 in turnover of 3.9m shares ahead of
its quarterly results. News Corp fell 17 cents to ADollars 9.38 while
Fosters Brewing, which saw 6.87m shares traded, lost 4 cents to ADollars
1.21.
NEW ZEALAND shed 1.65 per cent in line with the trend set elsewhere in the
region. The NZSE-40 capital index fell 37.83 to 2,255.34 at the close.
Brierley Investments, which last week said it would make a NZDollars 175m
profit from the sale of part of its Carter Holt stake, slipped 1 cent to
NZDollars 1.37.
BANGKOK ended 3.4 per cent lower, but managed to retain the 1,200 level.
The SET index lost 42.72 to 1,204.12 in turnover of Bt5.3bn.
Issues fell across the board although banks found some support.
KARACHI finished at a record high with the KSE 100 share index rising 7.76
to 2,653.64, helped by a rush of late buying. BOMBAY was little changed on
the day as investors continued to await developments regarding a ban on
carry forward trade. The BSE 30-share index closed up 4.41 at 3,806.27.

FT  22 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent awaits news from the
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Europe spent the day worrying about a possible rise today in US
interest rates, writes Our Markets Staff.
Goldman Sachs yesterday trimmed its exposure to Europe but said that it
maintained an overweight position, 'because short-term rates should fall by
more than elsewhere (and by more than money market futures imply) and retail
inflows into equities are running at healthy levels'.
More specifically, Goldman's upgraded Finland, based on good recent earnings
announcements, and reduced the weighting of France slightly, 'given that any
decoupling from the Bundesbank seems unlikely for several months, and the
risks of social discontent are rising'.
FRANKFURT fell in line with weakness in the bund market, the DAX index
closing off 24.33 or 1 per cent at 2,131,28. Turnover was relatively light
at DM7.6bn.
The market remained cautious with few participants prepared to come in ahead
of today's expected news from the US.
Corporate news was highlighted by Hypo Bank, which resisted steeper declines
seen elsewhere to end the session off DM2.50 at DM467.50. The bank said that
it would lift its 1993 dividend by DM1.50 to DM14.50 after reporting an
increase of 33 per cent in group operating profit.
Porsche, down DM15 at DM895, held few surprises as it reported 6 month
figures, with most of the news having already been discounted.
PARIS picked up a little of the day's losses in the last moments of trading.
The CAC-40 index, which had seen a session low of 2,193.81, ended the
session off 18.65 or 0.8 per cent at 2,202.69. Turnover was slack at around
FFr3bn.
After the market closed Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, was
reported on wire services as saying that there was still room for further
interest rate cuts in Europe.
General activity was moderate with UAP rising against the trend, adding 90
centimes to FFr189.90, ahead of results due out after the close. The insurer
reported a rise in net attributable profit to FFr1.5bn from FFr1bn.
St Gobain, down FFr16 at FFr672, was affected, said dealers, by arbitrage
between the shares and warrants as the subscription period for the rights
issue closed.
MILAN was unsettled by interest rates and next weekend's general election
and the Comit index fell 9.51 or 1.4 per cent to 665.02.
CS First Boston recommended taking profits on the basis of the market's
outperformance during the last two months when the Comit index rose by more
than 9 per cent; the fact that the Italian bond market had fallen more than
other European bond markets while the equity market had outperformed,
implying that relative valuations had deteriorated; and a possible
consolidation after the general election.
Merrill Lynch commented that political uncertainty compounded the problems
of a market that appeared to be among the most expensive in Europe on the
basis of earnings prospects.
The investment bank added that liquidity might push the market still higher
but it believed the situation was too risky to take an aggressive position
until the policies of the next government were clearer.
Italcable fell L475 or 4.4 per cent to L10,268 as investors demonstrated
their disappointment with the weekend deal to merge five telephone operating
companies into a single Telecom Italia.
Sip slipped L18 to L4,351 after its announcement of a 42.8 per cent rise in
1993 net profit, while Stet, the holding company, eased L15 to L4,877.
Cogefar fell L93 or 4.9 per cent to L1,799 in arbitrage trade linked to the
rights issue.
ZURICH was lower, in line with other bourses and bond markets elsewhere in
Europe, and the SMI index fell 39.2 to 2,804.3.
Interest rate sensitive issues were the hardest hit with UBS bearers losing
SFr31 or 2.5 per cent to SFr1,195. Recently favoured cyclicals were
resilient with Alusuisse adding SFr7 to SFr654.
WARSAW plunged 8.8 per cent as small investors, losing their patience with
the recent stagnant market, rushed to unload shares. The all-share Wig index
fell 1,777.1 to 18,414.2, but volume was a thin 969,000 shares.

FT  22 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong in retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong was in retreat last week as a combination of economic and
political developments at home and abroad conspired against it.
The fall-out was felt elsewhere in south-east Asia as Singapore and Malaysia
also registered sharp declines. Japan, on the other hand, pulled ahead as
foreign investors, particularly in the US, rebuilt their holdings.
Mr Michael Franklin at James Capel comments that much of Hong Kong's recent
decline is the result of US selling of futures, and arbitrage activity.
Europeans remained sellers, but on a much smaller scale, while Japanese
investors were largely absent ahead of their fiscal year end.
He says technical assessment suggests that if the Hang Seng index is not
able to consolidate around the current 8,700 level, then the next obvious
support would be around 7,700.
The latest James Capel global strategy note says there are six major
concerns facing the market: rising US interest rates; the risk of a hard
landing for the Chinese economy; succession uncertainty in the event of the
death of the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping; whether the Hong Kong property
market is overvalued; the outlook for Sino-British relations; and the
renewal of MFN status for China. The broker takes the view that the
correction has been overdone and many of the concerns have been overstated.
Goldman Sachs notes that the positive sentiment seen in Hong Kong during the
early part of the year abruptly reversed with the unexpected 25 basis point
increase in short term US interest rates on February 6, and a public
appearance by the Chinese leader in the following week. 'Deng's marked
deterioration in health gave investors cause for concern and provoked
uncertainty over the political outlook for China.'
Goldman Sachs adds that these two factors have taken much of the heat out of
the Hong Kong market and have, together with a general decline in sentiment
towards equity markets worldwide, contributed to the 14 per cent decline in
the Hang Seng index over the last month.
Looking forward, the investment bank believes that fundamentals will be the
main feature and that sentiment is unlikely to rebound in the near term,
with further weakness predicted. 'Our longer term outlook is more positive
as Hong Kong remains the key gateway to China.'
Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson comments that Japanese share prices
continue to climb as a result of foreign buying, particularly from the US.
'Though technical indicators suggest the 1994 rally needs a short rest
before the major indices can soar above last year's peaks, the pressure to
increase weightings in Japan increases week by week.'
In Europe, Germany put in the strongest performance as a 6 basis point cut
in the repo rate was well received, but the Bundesbank council left official
rates unchanged.
Morgan Stanley comments that while a cut in the discount rate was not
expected, some market participants were hoping to see a cut in the Lombard
rate or, more importantly, a more aggressive easing through a fixed repo
rate for this week. 'Nevertheless, we maintain our optimism on European
markets where Buba easing is holding the key.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Markets Report: All eyes on the Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a case yesterday of 'All eyes on the FOMC' as foreign exchanges
focused on today's important meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in
the US, writes Philip Gawith.
The policy-making FOMC is widely expected to sanction a further tightening
of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve. Its deliberations have taken
on added importance following last Friday's unscheduled meeting between
President Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed.
Markets remain unsure whether that meeting signified political interference
in monetary policy, or heralds an even quicker tightening of policy than
previously anticipated.
Markets were very quiet ahead of the FOMC with few noticeable trends in
trading. The dollar finished slightly firmer in London against the D-Mark at
DM1.6979 from DM1.6961 on Friday. It finished marginally higher against
sterling - Dollars 1.4845 from Dollars 1.4888 - and was also firmer against
the yen, closing at Y106.920 from Y106.035.
The D-Mark was slightly weaker in Europe, with the market anticipating
further cuts in the repo rate, while sterling weakened following the release
of mixed non-EU trade figures.
Trading got off to a slow start in Europe yesterday with Japanese markets
closed on account of the spring equinox national holiday. London traders
said the morning was 'exceptionally quiet' before the US market opened.
Mr David Barrett, trader at Natwest Markets, said foreign exchanges were
'blinkered to anything but Fed rate hikes'. Many corporates preferred to
stay on the sideline with much of the business inter-bank.
Markets remain confused about how to interpret last Friday's meeting, but
there is a broad consensus that at least a 25 basis points tightening in the
Federal Funds rate can be expected. This would be in keeping with Mr
Greenspan's gradualist reputation. A minority view is that there may be a 50
basis points increase in the discount rate.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said the Fed should
be seeking to stabilise financial markets. After Friday's meeting, though,
widely condemned in the markets as insensitive, there is a risk that the Fed
is in a lose-lose situation. No change, or a small increase, could well
result in a dollar sell-off. A 50 basis points hike, on the other hand,
could 'spook' the market by causing it to think that the inflation threat is
worse than the Fed has let on.
The anticipated tightening in interest rates was reflected yesterday in the
Fed Funds rate which was trading in the 3.31-3.37 per cent range, compared
to the 3.25 per cent target level set by the Fed. The rate later fell back
to 3.31 per cent after the Fed added temporary reserves to the banking
system through three-day system repurchase agreements.
In the futures market the June eurodollar contract traded at 95.58,
discounting interest rates of 4.42 per cent in June. Three month US money is
currently trading at 3.87 per cent/3.93 per cent.
Analysts were agreed that no matter what the Fed does, there is little
short-term upside for the dollar. Mr Lyons said the market had already
discounted the tightening. He said the upward movement in rates across the
yield curve, since the Fed last tightened on February 4, was an effective
tightening of policy.
The D-Mark traded slightly weaker in Europe. Unchanged against the French
franc at FFr3.407, it finished at L987.7 from L989.3 against the Italian
lira. It was also lower against the Spanish peseta closing in London at
Pta81.87 from Pta82.14 on Friday.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at the Bank of America, said the
D-Mark was not going anywhere, as the dollar remained well underpinned,
while a further cut in the German repo rate was a constraint on would-be
D-Mark bulls. He predicted a further 5-7 basis points cut from the current
level of 5.88 per cent.
The prospect of higher interest rates in the US put a dampener on the
futures market. The June three-month euromark contract lost two basis points
to settle at 94.50. The December contract fell by three points to 94.89,
indicating that the market expects rates to fall by about 60 basis points by
December. Three month money is currently trading at 5.70/ 5.80 per cent.
In the cash markets, German call money continues to trade at 5.70/5.80 per
cent reflecting market expectations of a cut in the repo rate.
Sterling had a fairly quiet day finishing at DM2.5205, half a pfennig below
the DM2.525 where it closed on Friday. It weakened on the release of
February non-EU trade figures. Stripped of oil and erratics, the deficit was
Pounds 673m, up from Pounds 612m in January.
In the discount market the Bank of England cleared a small Pounds 250m
shortage with afternoon assistance of Pounds 274m.
Sterling futures barely moved with the June contract closing one point
firmer at 94.84. In the cash market three month money was bid at 5 1/4 per
cent.

The elite schools of management education in the US are rapidly retooling
their MBA programs, adjusting to the changing climate for business in the US
and elwehwere.
Successful for decades at turning out highly-skilled specialists to people
corporate bureaucracies, universities are now striving to mould leaders who
can manage change.
With most of the giants of corporate industry downsizing, re-engineering,
and revamping their market focus, businesses need a different product from
that which traditional MBA programmes have been turning out, explains Mr.
Yoram (Jerry) Wind, director of Wharton's Center for Advanced Studies in
Management.
Mr. Wind interviewed more than 300 executives in key industries to determine
their views on how changes in technology, environment, demographics, and
international politics were changing their jobs.
'We were basically seeking to define the characteristics of 21st century
enterprise,' Mr. Wind said. 'We found we weren't providing what the market
needed - managers who can operate across functions, in flat hierarchies, in
teams, and who can handle globalisation. Our programmes were mostly domestic
and didn't deal at all with technology.'
Wind's research contributed to a radical redesign of the Wharton MBA, where
a new curriculum is being implemented throughout the graduate business
school this year.
While the Wharton programme varies in design - it makes heavy use of
mini-courses in the first year of the 2-year MBA - its building blocks and
philosophy are similar to those being adopted at most top-tier schools of
management in the US.
The new look MBA strives to incorporate new disciplines, such as information
management, leadership, innovation, people skills, and crisis management
into curriculums heavy with coursework in traditional fields such as
marketing, finance, accounting, human resources, and management strategy.
Along with the new topics comes a new teaching approach - integrating
diverse material so students learn to operate effectively across functions.
This innovation is more difficult for faculty than students, since it
requires the often balkanised departments of academe to co-operate.
Another sign of the move toward a different sort of manager is a planned
change this year in the standardised business school admission test,
commonly known as the GMAT. Aspiring MBAs will be asked to write two essay
questions, a sign that companies and universities are beginning to value
verbal and analytical skills as highly as mathematics aptitude.
In addition to on-site coursework, management schools such as the University
of Michigan, the University of Chicago, and Harvard, are introducing heavy
doses of international exposure to their students, unusual in the US even
five years ago.
Northwestern University's Kellogg School, a pioneer in the
internationalisation push, will send a third of its MBA students around the
world this spring in special study programmes.
Michigan's business school has reformed its MBA around a model that requires
extensive real-life experience working at corporations, in what Dean B.
Joseph White likens to a medical school approach. At Harvard Business
School, where the case method of teaching has been sacrosanct for decades,
there is an ambitious review in the works. Though radical changes are not
expected, a recently released position paper advocates a more integrated
curriculum, a diversification away from case study, and an explicit emphasis
on creating business leaders rather than general managers.
The criticism of the case method, one professor says, is that in a case
study the parameters are well defined. 'In the real world, the problem is
that the problem is not obvious at all,' he says. As for leadership, Harvard
has always assumed its graduates would become leaders, says Mr. John Kotter,
a professor of leadership at Harvard Business School. However, for the first
time this year, a course in leadership has become part of the required
curriculum.
Sensitive to criticisms that egghead MBAs with financial or accounting
acumen, but few social skills fit poorly in most corporate cultures, the
University of Chicago has recently added people skills to the agenda of its
Graduate School of Business. While still recruiting top-level math wizards,
Chicago now subjects its MBA-recruits to outward-bound-style leadership
adventures to promote teamwork, and asks second-year MBAs to design
socialisation activities for first-year students.
Not long ago, for example, a local theatre group was invited to campus to
help pull students out of their academic skins and engage in role-playing.
Some of these changes appear to be faddish. 'The problem with the MBA
business, like any business, is that MBA programmes have been too
successful.
The new look is more for public consumption rather than a reality,' says
Harvard University's Kotter.
In fact, there are some 700 MBA programmes in the US, and competition among
second-tier schools is fierce. Top students and students with funds to pay
graduate fees will become scarcer as demographics change, and the US
population ages. However, top-level schools are reporting an upswing in both
applications and job placements, and are confident of survival no matter
what curriculum revisions are made.
This year, Wharton, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Harvard, and others
of the MBA elite are reporting applications up on average about 15 per cent.
Recruiting figures are more difficult to pin down, but most of the top
schools report that more companies are making campus recruiting visits than
last year, and that graduates are receiving more job offers than during the
recession-distressed years of 1991 and 1992.

are the target - Chicago

In an ambitious attempt to export American management education to Europe
which will be watched keenly by its rivals, the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business will launch an executive MBA programme in
Barcelona in July.
The course will consist of ten sessions held over 18 months, adding up to 14
weeks of intensive work. Taught in English by members of the regular faculty
of the Chicago business school, it will be aimed at high fliers with about
10 years of business experience.
The Chicago school claims this is the first time an executive level
programme, leading to an MBA degree, has been offered in Europe by a leading
American institution.
However, the precedent of Harvard - which once considered offering a
shortened version of its Advance Management Programme in Switzerland - is
seen by some as salutary. Chicago appears to have spent a lot of time and
effort wooing European companies, but it is bound to be a hard sell in the
current economic climate and at a time when European schools are becoming
more international.
Robin Hogarth, Chicago's deputy dean, said recruitment is 'going well',
though he was reluctant to talk numbers. 'I doubt if we'll be up to 80 (the
maximum) this time'. He rejects the Harvard parallel, stressing that Chicago
'is in this for the long term' and 'invented the executive MBA concept in
the US 50 years ago'.
Chicago courses in Barcelona will be taught in a newly renovated building
with state-of-the-art facilities provided with the aid of Argentaria, a
large Spanish financial services company.
European participants will travel to Chicago in the second year to take
courses with their American counterparts. Similarly, Americans following the
executive MBA in Chicago will travel to Spain.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (14): Education is
a big industry - Overseas Marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The University of Hull, in Humberside is not shy about advertising its MBA
programme. Its MBA in strategic marketing is 'the pinnacle qualification' in
its field, according to an ad placed by the university in a Singapore
newspaper. 'Over 100 GMs, MDs, CEOs already in the programme.'
It is enough to make old fashioned academics retreat for ever into their
ivory towers. These days British, Australian, Canadian and US universities
market their courses overseas like General Motors sells its cars, or Chanel
its perfume.
About 12,000 Singapore students are at present involved in some form of
higher education overseas - with more than 3,000 of them in Britain. The
figures for Malaysia are higher: more than 50,000 Malaysians are at tertiary
level institutions overseas. Of those, about 9,000 are in the UK, with
another 3,000 at British secondary schools or studying for university
entrance.
Worldwide, education has become a big industry. It is estimated that
students from Singapore and Malaysia contribute about Pounds 200m to the UK
balance of payments each year.
In both Malaysia and Singapore, the British Council acts as a vital conduit
for students planning to study in Britain. Despite the recent fracas over
Malaysia's ban on government contracts with British companies, educational
links appear unaffected. The student counselling room at Kuala Lumpur's
British Council is crowded everyday.
'People here have a great appetite for higher education,' says Mr Gareth
Howell, director of the British Council in Kuala Lumpur. 'I can't see any
slackening of demand for overseas places between now and the end of the
century.
While law and medicine continue to be popular, there is increasing demand
for engineering and business orientated courses, including accountancy. 'The
MBA seems to be the thing these days' says Mr Howell. 'Courses focused on
finance and banking are particularly popular.'
The Malaysian government has become increasingly anxious about the foreign
exchange losses caused by the exodus of its students each year. While the
bulk of overseas students are privately funded, it is still estimated that
they bring about a loss of more than MDollars 3bn (Pounds 750m) of foreign
exchange reserves each year.
A decade ago the Malaysian authorities started to allow local private
colleges to set up twinning degree courses with overseas institutions.
Private colleges are now in virtually every part of the country: many
thousands of Malaysian students study for one or two years at such colleges
in Malaysia and then do the remainder of their course in Britain or
elsewhere.
In the case of MBAs alone, 12 British universities and management centres
now offer courses in collaboration with Malaysian institutions. Many of
Malaysia's big companies send their personnel on such courses. The same
applies in Singapore.
Twinning not only saves on foreign exchange and makes higher education
cheaper for many thousands of students. It also plugs a considerable gap
between supply and demand for higher education within Malaysia.
Malaysia aims not just to cut down on the number of its students going
abroad. Through twinning programmes it eventually hopes to develop its own
education services to a level where it can serve as a regional educational
centre - instead of sending students overseas, Malaysia hopes to be able to
encourage students from Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia to do MBAs and
other courses in Malaysia.
In time, it is likely that foreign universities will be allowed to set up
campuses in Malaysia. The University of London is already involved in
discussions about such a scheme.
'The authorities want students to be able to do the whole degree programme
here,' says Mr Howell. 'That would mean either foreign universities setting
up here or foreign institutions franchising their complete degree courses to
local colleges.'
But such moves are still some way off. First problems have to be ironed out
in the twinning programmes. There are worries that not all courses under
such programmes are being properly supervised - both by institutions
overseas and by the private colleges in Malaysia.
'Tension between the marketeers of such courses and the guardians of
academic standards is probably inevitable,' says Mrs Alexia Bannikoff, a
counsellor in education and training at the Australian High Commission in
Kuala Lumpur.
There are now more Malaysians at tertiary institutions in Australia than any
other overseas group. Australia also has 20 twinning programmes in Malaysia.
Again, there are no signs that the flow of students is drying up.
But there is concern that the first year of such twinning programmes in
Malaysia is often treated merely as an extension of school, leaving the
student ill-prepared for the less disciplined world of university, with its
emphasis on self learning.
Wider questions of just how much academic freedom the Malaysian government
will be ready to tolerate will doubtless occur - particularly if foreign
institutions open local campuses - but such questions are not deterring
foreign educational institutions and their marketing people. They are
continuing to beat a path to Malaysia and elsewhere in fast-developing,
education-hungry, south-east Asia.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (11): Different
views from the hill - The European Experience / Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IESE and Esade, the two most internationally renowned business schools in
Spain, are perched on the same hill just 10 to 15 minutes from the centre of
Barcelona.
Their similar geographical location, however, masks fundamental differences
which go beyond Esade's famous association with the Jesuits and rival IESE's
link with the traditionalist Roman Catholic organisation, Opus Dei.
Founded in 1958 IESE (the International Graduate School of Management of the
University of Navarra) is a Harvard-inspired institution devoted to
post-experience MBA education and the training of senior executives. Esade,
founded in the same year, provides these services, too, but it concentrates
much of its effort on younger students straight from school who typically
follow a 5 year management course modelled on the French grandes ecoles
system.
The different focus has helped shape separate philosophies, visible in the
schools' product mix, attitudes to teaching, and international strategies.
At one level, their relationship appears to be one of relaxed co-existence.
A question for the harsher and less predictable economic climate of the mid
1990s, though, is the extent to which rivalry will be sharpened in areas
such as MBA and executive education, where there is overlap.
As Paul McDonough, MBA admissions director at IESE puts it: 'In the late
1980s people like myself just had to sit back and wait for the applications
to roll in. Now schools have to make more of an effort. Certainly the
general level of interest is down, but we are benefiting from the different
aspects of our programme and from people's desire to learn about the Spanish
and European economies'. Last September there were 360 applications for 65
places on the English-language section of the two year full-time MBA course.
Lluis Puges, director general of Esade, concedes that economic pressures,
and the proliferation of smaller domestically-oriented Spanish schools
offering short programmes, have had an impact on Esade's MBA applications.
Nevertheless, he is happy with the current size of the full time MBA class
(around 180 per year, including 40 in the English speaking section).
Esade is trying hardest to expand in specialised courses for executives and
tailor-made programmes for companies. As Puges explains, there are three
main benefits: 'Our faculty gets better exposure to current management
problems, it improves the chances that they will hire our people, and it
fosters loyalty and repeat business from our company customers.'
A reputation for top executive training lies at the heart of nearby IESE's
formidable strength. About 600 senior managers attend the school's part-time
programmes each year, accounting for 49 per cent of its income. This success
is based on IESE's enviably close links with the local business community.
These are based in part on the its influential and highly active alumni
network. (A recent survey showed that an internationally high 45 per cent of
its former students contribute to school activities).
As Carlos Cavalle, dean of IESE, points out, there are equally important
forms of collaboration with the school's non-alumni customers, through
IESE's joint advisory board, its joint (research) committee, and its
associate company status. This gives members regular input into educational
issues.
Cavalle emphasises the primacy of corporate connections in IESE's overall
strategy. 'We actually started the school by setting up a senior executive
programme first. We thought this was an excellent way of developing the
faculty, the MBA market and research.' Some Spanish business schools, says
Esade's Puges, are being forced to cut their budgets by as much as 20 per
cent this year. Puges says he is not hiring any new faculty members. 'I am
trying to keep it the same.' The challenge, he says, is to find new markets
both at home (through more executive education) and abroad. (Esade's new
international programme in business law is one current example).
Puges reflects that the changes forced on schools may be more fundamental.
'When change follows a pattern, it is relatively easy to look ahead,' he
explains, 'but for me the great difficulty is that we are on the point of a
big breakthrough, which means you have to dream. That is difficult for
business schools, because it is the realm of artists and philosophers. If we
can somehow combine dreaming with rational thinking the result could be very
positive.'
If business schools are to do more to solve society's problems, Puges
further believes they must be more focused on helping entrepreneurs and less
obsessed with serving multinationals.
Back at IESE Pedro Nueno, the school's widely respected professor of
strategy, sounds optimistic. He says the recession, 'uncovers new types of
need which we have been addressing.' Change has increased the pressures on
IESE's staff, but Nueno emphasises that the school's total throughput is
increasing and that it is still hiring and training new faculty.
Much of IESE's success lies in the decision five years ago to go global, as
Carlos Cavalle puts it. IESE, for example, has teamed up with the University
of Michigan, one of the leading US schools in executive education, to offer
a two week course in Switzerland.
Where others talk gloomily of their experience in Eastern Europe, Cavalle
says that on the contrary the international faculty development programme,
run jointly with ISA in Paris and Bocconi University in Italy, is working
well.
'It is much better to train the faculty than to try to teach executives
directly,' he suggests.
He admits that Moscow has been more difficult but ' by choosing the
universities of Prague, Warsaw and Budapest we are working with the best'.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (12): Experience
dampens both sides' high hopes - Eastern Europe's Needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western management educators joined in a general excitement in the West at
the start of the decade: eastern Europe was a market which seemed to offer
unbounded potential.
Here was half a continent whose companies were crying out for executives
familiar with modern management techniques. Just as structured management
education spread from the US to western Europe in the 1960s, so the movement
appeared poised to take the former communist bloc by storm in the 1990s.
But management schools have shared in the disappointment of the discovery
that need does not automatically translate into demand for services. 'An
enormous market - an enormous, insolvent market,' says Robert Crane, dean of
the International Management Center in Budapest, one of the leading schools
in the region. 'As far as I can tell, no one has made money from management
training in eastern Europe.'
East European trainees can rarely pay fees out of theirown pockets. Salaries
remain a fraction of western levels while management training is little
cheaper. Fees at the International Management Center in Budapest, for
instance, are Dollars 10,000 a year while a US school would charge between
Dollars 12,000 and Dollars 20,000.
Some students make the sacrifice. Vilmos Skultety of Szekesfehervar in
western Hungary sold his Lada car to raise the funds to study at the IMC. He
is now Hungarian marketing manager for Loranger, the US car components
maker, and possesses a smarter car but he is the exception.
Local corporations are as strapped for cash as individuals. Management
courses were the fashion when the east European economies first opened up.
But prolonged recession has forced many state enterprises to cut their
training budgets and rising unemployment has made employees more cautious
about taking a couple of years out.
That has left official and private philanthropy as the main source of
financing. Most important is the European Union's Phare aid programme for
eastern Europe. George Soros, the hedge-fund speculator, provides
scholarships through his foundations for almost all the students on IMC's
full-time MBA course.
Official assistance has not been sufficient, however, to induce reputable
western management schools to establish a permanent presence in eastern
Europe. The University of Pittsburgh has close links with the International
Management Centre in Budapest and the Czech Management Centre. Five
top-ranking US schools have formed a consortium which provides courses for
east Europeans. But involvement is generally at the level of individual
faculty members. After initial exploration, most institutions have
retrenched.
Disillusionment has been mutual. 'We had a trooping to the east of a lot of
dubious people in management education who were, by and large, charlatans,'
says Derek Abell, professor at the Institute for Management Development in
Lausanne. That has done little for the standing of management training in
eastern Europe. 'What the West was offering was suspect,' says Mr Abell.
'There is a real sense of disappointment.'
East Europeans are nevertheless gradually becoming more discriminating and a
few institutions have managed to build reputations for quality and find
their financial footing. The International Executive Development Centre in
Slovenia, dynamically led by Danica Purg, is particularly well-regarded.
Most observers' lists include Budapest's IMC, the Czech Management Centre in
Prague and the International Postgraduate Management Center of Warsaw
University.
The better schools, seeking to reduce their dependence on grants, are trying
to drum up business from western companies with operations in eastern
Europe. IMC conducts an in-house MBA programme for Tungsram, General
Electric's lightbulb-making subsidiary in Hungary. IMC hopes, through
projects like these, to match western schools and cover 70 per cent to 75
per cent of operational costs within five years.
For east Europeans without backing from a western employer, distance
learning is increasingly popular and has provided opportunities for some
western providers. The Open Business School, a branch of the Open
University, has students in Slovakia, Hungary and Russia and is expanding
into Bulgaria and Romania.
There is untapped potential in management education beyond standard MBA
courses. 'The initial traditional activities have not been the growth
areas,' says Julie Rowney, formerly of the IMC.
Gay Haskins, head of the European Foundation for Management Development,
believes there is a pressing need for first degrees in management and
entrepreneurship training, not to speak of education for the educators.
Others argue that institutions should target senior executives. Slovenia's
IEDC has set up a President's MBA course for chief executives who lack
formal management education and the time for a full-time course.
But above all the impact of schools in eastern Europe depends on localising
management education and making courses relevant. On a mundane level, that
involves giving more weight to finance, accounting and marketing. More
fundamentally it requires western trainers to adapt to eastern European
business conditions, and more give-and-take between western theory and
eastern practice. 'People have been teaching rather than learning,' says Mr
Abell of the IMD. 'Once they learn, they will be able to teach more
successfully.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (8): Solid
domestic base for a world mission - The European Experience / France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International business school, south west of Paris, not far from Versailles.
For most multinational business executives outside France that map reference
means just one word: Insead.
Set up in 1959 on the Harvard model, the Fontainebleau-based Institute of
Business Administration is almost synonymous with management education in
Europe.
However, the same part of France - the village of Jouy-en-Josas, to be
precise - boasts another institution with a growing claim on outsiders'
attention.
Groupe HEC (L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales) is France's leading
grande ecole of management, and representative of a proud educational
tradition which lies at the heart of the country's executive training
system.
Frequently misunderstood - and too easily dismissed by international
commentators - HEC and other grandes ecoles like ESSEC, ESC Paris and ESC
Lyon are developing serious international strategies on what, from the
outside at least, appear to be enviably solid domestic foundations. At a
time when the Anglo-Saxon MBA model seems no longer to be able to provide
all the answers, the French system offers an instructive alternative.
The grandes ecoles, which like so much in France can be traced back to
Napoleon, are independent of the French universities, but closely associated
with and partly financed by local chambers of commerce through a compulsory
payroll tax on employers. Originally set up to prepare children of wealthy
industrialists and merchants for a career in the family business, they
evolved after the second world war into much more professional and better
focused management training institutions, influenced greatly by what was
going on in the US.
Today, there are 21 grandes ecoles of management which turn out some 8,000
graduates per year. Students follow typically a 5 year general management
curriculum which starts immediately after the baccalaureat and which is
sub-divided into two years of classes preparatoires devoted to pre-business
school courses; a one year foundation course; and the two year graduate
programme proper. Students already holding a university degree, as well as
foreign students, generally go straight on to the graduate programme.
The qualification they receive is generally known in France as the masters
in management, and is quite distinct from the MBA. The latter, of course, is
of Anglo-Saxon origin and is aimed at graduates with a general education who
have already spent several years working in a business.
In one sense, the two systems are complementary: indeed HEC and Lyon
recognise this and offer both. But in another sense the economic climate in
Europe has sharpened rivalry as business schools seek to find the most
appropriate methods for training the Euro-manager of the mid 1990s.
There is more than a touch of anti-Americanism in the jibe that Insead is an
offshore business school, but while such remarks merely underline HEC's
still chauvinistic instincts and Parisian hauteur, it would be a mistake to
under-estimate the advances which the grandes ecoles have made in broadening
their course content (less emphasis on mathematics and closer contacts with
the business community), the seriousness of the international mission of
schools, such as HEC and Lyon, and the inherent attractions of the business
vocational approach.
HEC points out that its international student exchange programme actually
started 20 years ago with New York University, and that 25 per cent of its
students are non-French. It was also one of the founders of the Community of
European Management Schools(CEMS) which has attempted to set standards for a
European masters.
That said, there is still some way to go. Its international drive really
only started with the creation of HEC's specialist MBA arm the Institut
Superieur des Affaires, while only 10-15 per cent of the faculty is
non-French. Henri Tezenas du Montcel, HEC's President, admits that the
school is ' still too small and still too French', but he adds
provocatively: ' We are not so far now from schools, such as Harvard, MIT
and Columbia. Ten years ago you could not have said that'.
Lyon, meanwhile, is a more unlikely institution to be going global but as
Bruno Dufour, the school's dynamic president, explains: ' It was the only
strategy we could develop. If you are outside Paris in this country and you
want to exist, you have to do something else.'
He, too, admits that the school has a long way to go if it wants to be more
than just a well regarded European school, and he predicts it will take
another 10 years to be truly international, notably in terms of faculty
quality. Lyon, nevertheless, has a good mix of non-French students taking
the masters degree, and the student exchange programme is said to have
progressed better than expected.
Lyon has 13 double degrees with other institutions, including Cranfield of
the UK and Esade of Spain, and 31 cross-border partners, with whom course
work is validated for degree purposes. It is also a participant in the
multiregional international business programme, run between the so-called
club of rich regions in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, plus Wales and the
Canadian province of Ontario. This involves students spending a full year at
another business school, and carrying out a research project, or internship,
in one of the other partner regions.
Dufour lists many challenges facing business schools, including the need to
adapt to new customer demands, develop a more flexible teaching approach,
and make up budget losses arising from lower apprenticeship tax
contributions in France. 'Some of the smaller grandes ecoles are going to go
out of business', he says.
The French-speaking market for management education is not large enough for
distance learning, he believes, but schools in France will have to deliver
their programmes with the help of the new technologies, such as
videoconferencing.
The cost of management education can be broken down into one third
travelling and accommodation, one third salaries of the participants, and
one third teaching expenses. 'If you can remove part of this equation so
much the better.'
In the absence of strong partnerships with companies, business schools are
in big trouble, he says.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (10): English is
new French weapon - Continental schools are seeking to internationalise
their intake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The relatively small domestic market is one reason why the leading French
business schools are pushing for foreign MBA students.
Insead's intake has long been international. The Institut Superieur des
Affaires (HEC) and ESC Lyon say that respectively 30 per cent and nearly 20
per cent of participants in their current classes are non-French.
' Our objective is to increase the proportion to 30 per cent in three years,
and 50 per cent in the next five to seven years,' says Patrick Molle, dean
of Lyon's MBA programme.
HEC/ISA's MBA is already fully bilingual, but next September Lyon plans to
introduce an international track for foreign students. Until now, core
courses at Lyon have been in French, which has tended to restrict
non-nationals to those with French spouses, family connections, and
educational backgrounds.
The new English courses - 20 per cent of the Lyon Faculty already teach in
English - will be accompanied by full time tuition in French. As for
markets, Molle is targeting Canada, Scandinavia, Germany and Spain, and
plans to tackle the Asian markets over the longer term.
The cost and time pressures bearing down on MBA students in France are
little different from those elsewhere - but neither Lyon (full time
programme one year) nor ISA (16 months) has much interest in the part-time
approach. Lyon is, nevertheless, contemplating a two to three year option
which would enable students to spread studies over a longer period and
remain with their employer.
'Last year 60 per cent of our students went back to their old company, which
would have been unthinkable five years ago', observes Molle.
'At the moment only 10 per cent are paid for by their employers, though I
don't think the proportion could go much beyond 15 per cent.'
At ISA, the dean, Eric Briys, is a strong defender of the full time MBA.
Part time programmes cannot generate the mutual enrichment which comes from
mixing people from different backgrounds and the total intellectual
immersion and freedom from corporate responsibilities afforded by an
extended training sabbatical, he says.
Moreover, full time participants, display a risk-taking propensity which
should bode well for their future careers.
Briys believes, however, that what he calls the geometry of risk has become
unbalanced for the student.
He advocates more imaginative loan schemes and tuition fees, linked to
performance or subsequent salary.
ISA is also notable for its imaginative course content. Rather than teaching
business ethics in the classroom, it sends students four times a year to the
French Alps to study with Benedictine monks at the monastery of Notre-Dame
de Ganagobie.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (9): Melting-pots
for Euromanagers - Management School Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The engine of European political integration may be stalled for the moment
but the high level of cross-border mergers and acquisitions last year was
just one sign of the growing interdependence of EU and Efta economies.
In this environment multinationals more than ever are on the look out for
managers who can speak foreign languages and adapt to different business
cultures and practices.
Since 1988 the Community of European Management Schools (CEMS), a network of
high prestige management schools in Europe*, has been attempting to address
their need.
So far its imaginative attempt to instil in students a common body of
European knowledge, wider language skills and broader international
experience, has produced 550 Euro-managers in four years but this may just
be the beginning.
Says Ian Du Pre, national recruitment partner at accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand in London, which annually recruits 700 graduates in the UK alone: '
We are extremely enthusiastic about it (CEMS). One of the problems in the UK
is that our A-Level and university system puts people into the market in
their early 20s without a business vocation. The people we get from the
continent are in their mid 20s, have a vocational degree, speak languages,
and will go where the action is.'
The challenge for the CEMS is reconciling the different European traditions
of management education. CEMS respects the broad continental model, which
differs from country to country but which in most states is based on a four
to five year university based course (combining undergraduate and
postgraduate work).
The idea of the CEMS Masters is that over this time students fulfil both
their home course requirements and those of a wider European curriculum.
Economics, law, mathematics and statistics are among core subjects in the
first three years. In the final two years a CEMS student has to take eight
courses dealing with a variety of European and international issues (of
which six, including EC law and international economics, are compulsory).
Fluency in three languages (at least two of them European) has to be
demonstrated, and to receive the qualification six months must be spent
abroad, three of them at another academic institution in the network, the
rest on secondment to a company.
CEMS is not unique, the idea having been copied in 1989 by the Alliance Of
Management Schools in European Capitals** whose AMSEC Master adds Euro
requirements to the home degree in much the same way. Even allowing for its
self-conscious exclusivity, however - there is only one CEMS institution per
country - its approach can be seen as one means of trying to harmonise
European standards for Masters level management qualifications. These CEMS
standards are defined in close collaboration with 33 corporate partners,
most of them leading European multinationals.
According to Lluis Puges, director general of the Spanish business school,
Esade, and a founder member, CEMS goes beyond mere student exchanges. 'We
are trying to mix faculty groups and to write more European cases,' he
explains. 'For me, though, the great advantage is discussing a common
problem but then hearing the different cultural solutions which you find
within Europe.'
Puges admits that more work has still to be done on harmonising standards.
'Some schools are more interested in certain issues than others. It is
particularly difficult in areas such as human resources and organisational
development. We are effectively having to negotiate to find a common
degree.'
*The 12 CEMS academic members are: Copenhagen Business School; Erasmus
Universiteit, Rotterdam; Esade, Barcelona; HEC,Paris; Hochschule Saint
Gallen; London School of Economics; Norwegian School of Economics and
Business Administration, Bergen; Stockholm School of Economics; Universite

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (6): A maestro in
finance - Profile / Thomas Kaurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Thomas Kaurich, an American concert pianist, first moved to London in
1989, he used to jog in Regent Park near his home. As his route took him
past the majestic front of the London Business School(LBS), he would wonder,
'Who would want to go to business school?'
Three years later, Mr Kaurich, then 30, was struggling to distinguish a
creditor from a debtor in his first study group at LBS, where he is now in
his final year of the Masters in Business Administration(MBA) programme.
The MBA is a rather unusual course of study for a man who made his concert
debut at the age of 12. After more than 16 years of playing the professional
concert circuit throughout North America and Europe, Mr Kaurich sold his
piano in New York to buy a computer in London, and replaced hours of
Schumann and Mozart with balance sheets and annual reports.
Mr Kaurich's original intention at LBS was to acquire skills to transfer
back to the profession he grew up in. 'I saw the need in the arts for some
sort of business-directed thrust, and I was single-handedly going to deliver
it,' he says,
Small in build, and immaculately dressed and groomed, Mr Kaurich speaks in
precise rhythms, punctuating sentences with, 'Does that make sense?'. He
recalls with amusement learning the jargon of business. 'It was in many ways
like being in a foreign country and being surrounded by native speakers,' he
says. 'People were talking about topics such as equity markets and it took
me ages to figure it out.' He takes obvious delight in his current facility
with the business tongue. 'Now I can pick up financial reports and find what
I need very quickly. When someone says asset turnover I know what it means.'
Mr Kaurich has maintained his links with the musical world by giving
occasional concerts - last month he packed out Wigmore Hall in London with a
Music and Management programme of Schubert, Bach, Liszt and Schumann to
raise money for the Friends of London Business School scholarship fund - and
through his second-year project with the Barbican Centre. He is examining
ways of diversifying programming and audiences.
'It is interesting doing a project for the Barbican Centre in a business
capacity when I have been on the other side as well,' he says. 'I think that
it has given me an advantage.'
He is frustrated by classical musicians who 'expect people to come to
concerts just because they are performing 'great music''. According to Mr
Kaurich, that mindset is responsible for diminishing audiences.
Describing a typical orchestral concert, he says of the performers 'they are
all dressed as if it were the last century. When they finish and take a bow
they don't even look at the audience. They put up barriers between performer
and audience,' he claims.
The former concert performer offered one possible solution to musicians'
apathy toward audiences.
'If their salary depended on the number of tickets they sold then they would
have a vested interested in each performance,' he said.
His studies, however, have introduced other interests. 'Being in the MBA has
opened up so many new things to me that it is not necessary for me to be in
the arts. Business is business whether you are selling opera-singers or
circuit boards, though circuit boards certainly are not as temperamental as
opera singers.' he says.
Mr Kaurich has now joined his classmates at LBS in interview rounds for jobs
in corporate finance. 'What appeals to me about finance is the buzz of it.
It reminds me of the kind of energy generated by performing,' he said.
This convert to finance sees other similarities between music and business.
'Music is the perfect marriage of a structured intellect and intuition,'
said Mr Kaurich. 'I find that these two instincts transfer very well to the
business world.'
He believes that business schools are beginning to recognise that decisions
often are - and indeed should be - based on a sixth sense, rather than pure
facts and figures. 'I think it (the MBA) is moving away from trying to
quantify everything and allowing for gut feelings'
But does he miss music? Not yet, he said but he is not sure he wants to
return to the music industry, even just to apply his business skills. 'I
think ultimately maybe I could but I do not think I am prepared to enter
that world again just yet. I do not think I have got everything I want from
business.'
Still, he puts aside time - albeit only 15 to 20 minutes a day - to tinkle
the ivories (on a rented piano) when he needs a break from his studies. He
no longer feels the need for the constant buzz of performing. 'If I want to
perform I will find a hall and fill it with people I know. I cannot think of
anything more enjoyable than performing for an audience, everyone of whom I
know. That is how the past few concerts through LBS have been.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (5): New routes
are opened up - Studying for an MBA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The death of the MBA has indeed been much exaggerated - but its character in
Europe, notably in the UK, has undergone radical change.
Course content is a case in point - relevance, interdisciplinary teaching,
internationalisation, and 'soft' issues, such as business ethics, are just
some of the current buzzwords. Perhaps the most striking development,
though, has been the dramatic widening in range of delivery.
It used to be that a two year full-time MBA was the norm in the US. Now,
only the powerful London Business School among UK suppliers retains a
genuine two year programme as its main option, following Manchester's
decision to offer a restructured course for the forthcoming year. Manchester
now offers what it calls a standard full time MBA over 16 months with a
longer 20 to 22 month alternative or a fast-track route of just over 12
months.
'This was in response to a consultation process which showed that most
students wanted a shorter career break and lower opportunity cost,' explains
Anne Keddie, Manchester's marketing manager.
Therein lies the rub. For all the well publicised doubts of employers and
the sceptical British approach to management as an academic subject, the MBA
remains a much sought after qualification on the right terms.
The result has been a significant increase in part time MBA programmes
(evenings, weekends, a combination of both,'modular' weeks); the astonishing
popularity of distance learning (where students work from home with teaching
material provided by the sponsoring institution); and the introduction of a
range of programmes generically known as company MBAs. These are usually
part-time and organised in partnership with individual companies, or a
consortium of companies.
Latest figures from the Association of MBAs (Amba) suggest that the shorter
delivery times for full time programmes may be having an impact. Revised
figures for 1993/94 show that the number of full time MBA students joining
UK business schools rose by 9.7 per cent (thanks in part to the addition of
five new courses), while new part-time students showed an increase of just
2.6 per cent (with the help of two new courses).
The key features of the part-time and company variants are that participants
can stay in their jobs and look to their employers for time off and
financial support.
Many business schools - such as Warwick - are taking advantage of this
flexibility. There, students can follow a 12 month programme (which has a
class this year of 114, average age 28, 85 per cent of whom pay for
themselves); a part time evening MBA over three years (class size 56,
average age 32, 90 per cent employer sponsored); a modular MBA (class size
29, average age 35, 95 per cent sponsored); and distance learning (350
students, average age 31, 50 per cent sponsored).
Henley Management College also has full time, part time, and distance
learning options (the latter is followed by nearly 5,000 students, based in
92 countries). More recently Henley has developed what it calls a third
generation MBA which tries to integrate traditional learning styles and
newdelivery technologies (including distance learning).
City University Business School specially targets those who work in the City
of London with its two year evening MBA but it is also notable for its
management, or consortium MBA. The course has powerful backers, which
include Rover, J Sainsbury, Norwich Union, American Express and BT.
An innovative MBA run by the Judge Institute of Management Studies at the
University of Cambridge combines full-time study with full-time work
experience. - 12 months out of the 21 month course, two 12 month periods in
the 33 month option. Because of the real world content Cambridge is less
strict than some business schools about prior work experience. It makes the
point that the salary earned during 12 months of the MBA makes fees easier
to handle than on a conventional full time programme.
The Open University, claims to be the largest business school in Europe and
a market leader in distance learning with 24,000 managers following its
courses and a turnover of Pounds 17m. Some 5,500 managers are studying for
its MBA (including 670 students in continental Europe). It expects to be
providing more than 20 per cent of UK MBA graduates within the next two
years. A further 3,000 managers are using its material in central and
Eastern Europe.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (7): Quality tests
raise hackles - Funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality control has just hit the UK's business schools.
Funding for all the UK's higher education is now handled by one powerful
quango - the Higher Education Funding Council(Hefce) which is now busily
implementing the government's policy that funds should reward quality and
that institutions should be inspected to ensure that the state is getting
good value for money.
Nobody objects to these aims, but assessing the quality of something as
subtle as academic endeavour has, almost inevitably, proved highly
controversial.
Business schools feel particularly badly treated. Professor Leo Murray,
director of Cranfield University's school of management, is forthright about
the government's role: 'Just as they did with the poll tax, they took
something which could be improved and made a hash of it.'
Funding is based on two separate components - research and teaching. The
first quality assessments of teaching are now being announced.
They judge individual departments within institutions, rather than
universities as a whole, and divide them into only three broad bands -
excellent, satisfactory and unsatisfactory.
These classifications hinder marketing overseas, particularly in the
competitive business schools market. It is difficult to explain away an
official rating of only satisfactory to a foreign company looking for
excellence. The committee of vice-chancellors and principals describes the
classification as 'a marketing bullet in the foot'.
Universities must first make a self-assessment, which, according to Hefce's
guidelines, should be an up-to-date, self-critical analysis.
In practice, this forces institutions to compose a brief mission statement,
and then cite statistics to show that the mission is being fulfilled.
This allows recognition for diversity - those who feel they should compete
with the best in Europe may do so only satisfactorily, while the excellence
of less ambitious institutions which aim to train local middle-managers can
also be recognised.
Hefce assessors then visit every institution which has claimed to be
excellent, plus those where they have grounds to believe that quality is
unsatisfactory. Most of the the assessors are are academics contracted to
work for Hefce for one to three years - whose presence often causes ire with
academics devoted to their own research - along with a core of permanent
Hefce staff and subject specialist assessors.
Even institutions revealed as excellent by the survey, such as City
University Business School and Cranfield, have mixed feelings about the
exercise.
Mr John Kaye, dean of City, is positive about the new system. He said the
process had forced City to 'take a long hard look at itself.'
However, he expected Hefce's methodology to evolve with time.
Results for the last research selectivity exercise, marked on a five-point
scale, were announced in 1992. It found that the top-scoring institutions in
business and management studies were the universities of Bradford, Warwick,
Lancaster and Strathclyde, the London Business School, the London School of
Economics and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology.
These emphasised published research in academic journals, and in the press.
Professor Murray was not happy about this: 'Our job is as a service provider
for companies. What is most important for us is how we transfer or apply our
research.'
He said the exercise forced academics towards publishing research, whether
or not this best served their students, 'pushing us towards the old and
damaged American model of 'publish and be damned''.
These difficulties, facing a government agency, may be resolved as the
system matures, but they suggest that precise business school league tables,
wanted by many applicants, will not be easy to compile.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (2): School fees
defy recessionary pressures - MBA Costs and Benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recessions are good for keeping down prices but not, it appears, the
somewhat daunting fees charged by management education schools.
As belts have tightened generally across Europe, many institutions offering
MBAs and executive courses have continued to raise their fees, even if the
increases are less pronounced than they were during the 1980s.
A glance at the charges for Europe's top management education centres
confirms that many are charging significantly more than they were at the
start of the decade. Perhaps MBAs, like Mercedes Benz cars, fall into the
category of Giffen goods - products whose attractiveness increases as their
prices rise.
Not all schools have continued to increase their nominal fees, but this has
often been for special reasons. At IESE, the International Graduate School
of Management in Barcelona, Spain, for example, the cost of an MBA course
between this academic year and the next has barely moved.
For 1993/94 the cost of the programme was Pta1.875bn (Pounds 9,014) while
for 1994-95 the price will be Pta1.9bn (Pounds 9,134). This amounts to a 1.3
per cent increase, compared with a 26 per cent increase, between 1989/90 and
1991/92.
Mr Paul McDonough, director of admissions at IESE, says fees are rising more
slowly for several reasons. IESE believes that its programme was
under-priced for many years, leading to the big rises at the end of the
1980s. These increases were necessary, too, to pay for new facilities.
On top of this, the economic downturn in Europe has resulted in a drop in
the numbers of people willing to make investments of any nature.
'Many MBA candidates have decided that it may be wiser to wait a year or two
before actually quitting a job and making a significant investment in
education,' says Mr McDonough. 'Many marginal candidates have decided that
quitting a job is just too risky.'
In spite of this, costs generally have continued to rise. Even in the UK
where there is an abundance of MBA places and a poor outlook for jobs, many
schools have been able to raise their fees. Six of the best known UK schools
 -Bath, Bradford, Cranfield, London, Middlesex and Strathclyde - raised
their prices in this academic year. At Bradford fees increased by almost 20
per cent between 1992/93 and 1993/94.
At London rises were more modest. The cost of the first year of the two-year
MBA course increased from Pounds 8,950 in 1992/3 to Pounds 9,500 in this.
This Pounds 550 increase compares with increases of Pounds 750, Pounds 1,700
and Pounds 2,000 in the previous three years.
At the same time, post-MBA earnings are not as impressive as they were
during the last decade.
As Aurelie Morel, director of admissions and placements at the Institute for
Management Development in Switzerland says: 'The cost of an MBA is less to
do with the actual price of the course and much more to do with quitting a
job, of investing a year of your life, of forgoing your salary for a year
and of finding another job at the end.'
A survey by the Association among MBAs (Amba) shows that those entering into
positions with new employers after completing an MBA, the size of the
premium attracted by MBAs has generally declined over time.
Those graduating between 1980 and 1985 reported an average increase in
salary of nearly 65 per cent (about 40 per cent when adjusted for salary
inflation). By 1991 the average reported percentage increase had declined to
34 per cent which, after adjustment for salary inflation, indicates that
those graduating in 1991 increased their salary on average by 16.5 per cent
over and above the increase they would have expected to receive during the
period of their training. The survey covered 28 UK business schools, 10
continental European schools and leading US schools.
One solution to the rising cost of MBAs would be to make fees paid by an
individual tax deductible, something for which Amba has long campaigned. The
issue has yet to be resolved. In the last UK Budget the government extended
tax relief for vocational training to National Vocational Qualifications at
level 5, but no-one has yet established whether this covers MBA courses.
'We find the present uncertainty highly undesirable,' says Roger McCormick
of AMBA.
It would be wrong to exaggerate the impact that the recession has had on the
cost of MBAs. The big, well-established schools have sailed through the
economic downturn and continued to charge ever higher fees, protecting
themselves, to an extent, by offering increasingly varied executive courses
on top of the MBAs. This has left the less well-known establishments to bear
the brunt of sluggish economic conditions.
But as Europe emerges from recession, and the jobs market becomes less
competitive, the opportunity cost to students of taking an MBA may start to
creep back down. As Mr McDonough points out: 'Those individuals over there
(the US) who decided to embark on their MBA two years ago are reaping the
benefits of being in the right place at the right time. In Europe, my
question is whether it will be the graduating class of 1995 or 1996 which
will be job seeking just as the economy picks up.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (4): A selective
approach to training - Case Study / British Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Britain's largest companies, training is an enterprise in its own right.
And for none is that more so than British Telecommunications (BT), which
currently employs around 1,500 people in its development and training
divisions
BT is in the throes of a big reorganisation of its training capabilities,
seeking to apply four principles commonplace in theory but less widely
observed in practice. Namely:
greater use of outsourcing. BT exists to provide telecoms services, not
training. It already contracts out a fair slice of its senior executive
development, but the rest - including most of the technical and sales and
marketing training vital to its performance - is still done by trainers
employed by the company.
'Until now, we have tended to train in-house, and only go outside for more
senior levels where the need is to mix with a peer group and bench-mark with
other company's executives,' says Jan Davis, BT's development and training
adviser. 'Now we are considering greater use of outside trainers.'
centralised purchasing and quality control. Until now, line managers have
had control of most of BT's training budget. Employees have been directed -
or self-directed - to courses chosen from an a la carte list, often
organised by trainers attached to BT's operating divisions.
From July, a central supply management unit will advise on all external
purchasing of training and certify courses for all divisions.
'We were in the laissez faire cafeteria approach to training where you chose
what you wanted,' says Ms Davis. 'Now we intend to have far more rigorous
monitoring of inputs and outputs with a more selective approach tied to
company needs.'
a unified development and training organisation. BT currently has two
separate training divisions, one for management development, the other (and
far larger) for technical and function-related training. From this July the
two will be brought together into a single structure.
But the plan is for unified management, not for centralisation of the
training itself. BT's existing main training centres - primarily at Kent's
Hill, Milton Keynes for management development and commercial training, and
Stone in Staffordshire for technical training - will be retained.
Indeed, the plan is to shift more of the actual training nearer the customer
base, concentrating resources on work-based activities rather than
residential courses.
coherent training programmes. For more technical staff, training
requirements are generally fairly obvious. In the management and broader
work skills arena, however, training needs are typically less precise. BT
has made rapid progress towards a more programmatic approach to management
training - focusing on those about to make significant career steps. 'The
aim of all the changes, including a shift to external supply, is to create
an even greater in-house centre of excellence of high-quality development
and training at minimum cost,' says Ms Davis.
For the myriad of independent trainers and business schools struggling out
of recession, it is the opportunity of the decade.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (3): Rival
benchmark gains in credence - British NVQs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Summers, chief executive of the Management Charter Initiative, a
body set up in 1988 to improve the quality of UK managers, is often asked by
employers about the relative merits of different management qualifications.
'Until recently, the only management qualification with standing was the
MBA,' says Mr Summers, 'but I believe the higher level national vocational
qualifications (NVQs) at levels four and five will in time be established as
a qualification with equivalent currency.'
It is an ambitious hope as well as being a controversial one. NVQs, unlike
the MBA, which is acquired through either full-time or part time study, are
competence-based, depending on what an individual is able to do in his or
her workplace, rather than what he or she knows.
Wider adoption of NVQs in the field of management qualifications thus has
significant implications - not least for business schools where MBAs are an
important income generator. A full-time course at a top school can cost up
to Pounds 20,000. Accreditation of an NVQ level four or five in management
is a much cheaper option.
Candidates typically have to demonstrate in their workplace, to trained
assessors who are not their direct line managers, that they can perform a
number of management jobs. The many modules of the qualification include
managing operations, and financial competence.
NVQs do not, however, formally test the knowledge of the candidate through
examination, and it is here is that the gulf emerges between proponents of
NVQs and MBAs.
The NVQ framework has been set up as part of the government's strategy for
addressing askills shortage in the UK compared with its main competitors.
The qualifications start at NVQ level one, a basic competency in performing
a given task, and cover most blue collar jobs. They are slowly being
extended into the professions.
The lower level NVQs have attracted some criticism but the greatest
suspicion and hostility has been encountered at higher levels, particularly
from professional bodies, defending the traditional system of testing
knowledge by examination.
'The NVQ cannot be a substitute for the MBA, an academic qualification which
includes some practical work,' says Mr Alan France, dean of the business
school at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston. 'Academic inquiry
is a useful skill for managers to acquire, and experience cannot be a
substitute for the ability to reflect.'
It is a criticism that Mr Summers, chief executive of the Management Charter
Initiative, takes on board. 'There are no formal examinations for the level
four and five NVQs in management but there is a requirement that candidates
demonstrate that they have the underpinning knowledge,' he says.
'In practice, this means that the information and skills required to do a
task - such as developing teams and individuals - will be acquired through a
variety of means: by imitating best practice of colleagues; by attending
courses at college; or by personal reading.'
Typically, he says, it would take an individual between six and 18 months to
demonstrate that they had the competency to carry out these tasks, and this
could include a substantial amount of study, and evidence in support.
The merits of NVQs as distinct from the MBA qualification are, he believes,
a matter of horses for courses.
'An employer considering sponsoring his employees for either NVQs or the MBA
should ask what his or her business objectives were, and what key skills
needed to be developed,' he says.
'Some employers would say they needed to develop practical skills, such as
team-building, or setting up a quality programme. The attainment of the
level four and five management NVQs could be part of the package equipping
individuals with those skills, whereas if the need was for strategic
planning or analysis, a more formal input from a business school might be
more appropriate.'
Conversely, business schools acknowledge that the NVQ may have some merit
and they are examining whether or not practical aspects of their MBAs can be
accredited as NVQs.
There is a financial reason for this. In a highly competitive marketplace,
candidates for NVQs are eligible for tax relief on fees, such as those
charged for accreditation of the qualification.
For this reason, Cranfield School of Management is discussing with the
Inland Revenue whether it will recognise the practical parts of the school's
MBA as the equivalent of the NVQ levels four or five.
If the Inland Revenue does not agree, the school will consider making the
competence parts of its MBA NVQs in order to obtain the tax reduction.'
It seems highly unlikely NVQs will replace the MBA. The measurement of
competences as assessed by NVQs is only one aspect of management education
and may not be the most important one,' Professor Colin New of Cranfield
says.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (1): A case study
in change - A less certain economic environment has increased business
demand for management education. Competition is becoming much fiercer,
however, as rival institutions vie to offer the formula for success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading management educationalists spend a lot of time these days telling
companies how to cope with change.
Ironically, the turmoil and uncertainty in their own business provides ample
material for a good case study.
Like other sectors, business schools in Europe and North America have been
hard hit by recession. The problem, though, has not merely been adjusting to
a cyclical pattern of demand.
Teaching content and styles, traditional delivery methods, and even the very
basis for schools' existence have all been thrown under the spotlight by the
quickening pace of economic and technological change.
Among trends on both sides of the Atlantic several stand out: a sharper
focus on immediate corporate concerns (as manifested in the growth of short
executive courses tailor-made for individual companies); increasing emphasis
on the so called multidisciplinary - as opposed to functional - teaching
approach; and growing interest in international issues.
In striving to find the right formula for survival in the 21st century -
which in Europe means finding an appropriate model for training the new
breed of Euro-manager - business schools are locked in an urgent struggle
for students, staff, money and other scarce resources.
Management education only became a respectable and established academic
discipline in the US in the late 1950s - but its expansion over the last
three decades is a remarkable success story.
The US method has been widely exported, in the process influencing the
development of regional systems such as that in Europe. The contribution of
business school research has been acknowledged in the award of at least four
Nobel prizes for economics to business school professors.
Suddenly, however, a discipline renowned for its interpretation of
relatively predictable long term business trends is being asked to provide
instant solutions for companies in a much faster and less certain economic
environment.
The good news is that even if its nature is changing, demand for management
education is probably as great (if not greater) than ever.
Annual company spending on executive education in the US, for instance, is
estimated to have doubled from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 4bn between 1987 and
1992. In Europe, the UK's Ashridge Management College last year conducted
interviews with 150 large and medium sized companies in Britain, Germany,
Scandinavia and the Benelux countries, which found that 80 per cent of them
were actively involved in management development, 66 per cent had recently
increased their investment, and 50 per cent predicted a further rise in
spending.
Intensifying competitive pressures, organisational restructuring,
integrating strategy and development, and recognition of the value of
management education as a competitive weapon were among reasons cited by
respondents.
But if the cake is not necessarily shrinking, getting a slice of it has
become much tougher. The corporate sector's concern with immediate problems
has blurred the boundaries between management education and consultancy -
creating new competition from (among others) big management consultancies,
trade associations and redundant executives. Business schools have had to
re-think their strategies radically.
The soul-searching takes slightly different forms in Europe and North
America, but Professor George Bain, principal of the London Business School,
believes the challenges on both sides of the Atlantic can be summarised in
the four 'I's' - Internationalisation, Integration, Implementation and
Innovation. Internationalisation is reflected in the growth of foreign
students on MBA courses, and in attempts to broaden faculty recruitment,
diversify teaching materials, and promote a greater number of exchange
programmes.
Integration is seen in the way schools have been trying to move away from
the vertical curriculum 'silos' - accounting, marketing, finance and the
like - and to replace, or at least supplement, them with course structures
that encourage a more holistic approach to problem solving, thereby better
reflecting the real world.
Implementation is a reaction to old jibes that MBA really stands for
management by analysis or management by academics. Thus skills courses, team
building, business ethics, negotiation and, above all, leadership have
become features of the modern management education curriculum.
Innovation, the last of the Is, implies that the static model of the golden
age is nowadays in constant need of revision and fine tuning.
The encouraging thing from a European point of view - not least amid renewed
fears about Eurosclerosis - is that Europe's management education suppliers
may be better placed to make the necessary adaptations than their US
counterparts.
London, Fontainebleau-based Insead, and IMD in Lausanne, Switzerland, for
example, have long been more international than even the top US
establishments (and certainly more so than the Mid-Western school whose Dean
not so very long ago proposed that schools' international credentials should
be measured by the number of faculty holding passports).
North America's strong research tradition, moreover, is thought by many to
have hampered the development of a true interdisciplinary approach, while
the rich endowments often provided by alumni have encouraged some to remain
unwisely detached from employers.
Instead, IMD, London and IESE (Barcelona), on the other hand, have long
received 50 per cent of their income, or more, from executive as opposed to
MBA programmes.
The proportion from this activity at most leading US schools is still less
than 10 per cent.
The immediate strains on business schools in the UK and continental Europe,
nevertheless, are real enough. The proportion of funds which they can obtain
from the public sector in Britain and France is falling, while the trend
away from open executive programmes, attended by managers from many
companies, towards shorter company-specific courses has financial
implications.
Single-sourcing, moreover, or at least reducing the number of suppliers, is
happening as much in the management education sector as it is in others,
says Mr Martin Christopher, deputy director, executive development, of
Cranfield School of Management which has an annual turnover of Pounds 6.3m
from short courses alone. 'The competition is very tough'.
Lower salary expectations and the uncertain jobs market have combined to cut
demand for full time MBA courses by roughly 15 per cent over the last two to
three years - though latest figures from the Association of MBAs (Amba)
suggest that 1993/94 has seen a recovery in the UK.
The growth in part-time programmes is a welcome extension of choice, but
some courses are of poor quality and middle-ranking schools in particular
are being squeezed.
The management challenge for business school deans goes well beyond merely
balancing the budget.
The test is finding faculty able to respond to the growing demand for
teaching across disciplines, sufficiently versed in international issues,
and with the right skills to address companies' immediate problem-solving
needs.
The trick is to do this without sacrificing schools' research capability,
and without losing the leading-edge knowledge which distinguishes management
education from management consultancy.
To use a piece of jargon from the latter's lexicon, the successful schools
of the next century will have rightsized rather than downsized.
Cutting human capital is a last resort for many businesses at the moment,
but business schools are especially reluctant not just because their brains
are their biggest asset but because a well rounded faculty is not easily
re-assembled.
This in part explains the intense interest in training managers in emerging
markets like those of Eastern Europe, India and even the Far East.
A business school's most precious - but at the same time most costly -
resource is the brains of its faculty.
Perhaps the most interesting tussle is what Jean-Pierre Nioche, a Professor
at the HEC-ISA School of Management, has called the war of educational
standards within Europe.
At issue is whether the imported post-experience MBA model - so influential
in many ways already - will win out, or whether a new European model is
emerging for the single market.
It must not be forgotten that despite the MBA's high profile he or she is in
a minority in Europe in terms of both new graduates and industrial leaders,
particularly in France and Germany.
Broadly speaking, institutions in most European countries apart from Britain
offer degrees leading to a qualification acknowledged by many to be of
masters level, and often including on-the-job experience.
In France there are also the grandes ecoles of management (discussed
elsewhere in this survey), independent of the universities and offering five
year programmes with a more business-oriented vocational focus.
Both UK and continental institutions increasingly offer exchange or
placement opportunities under the Erasmus or Comett programmes. More than
15,000 management students will have spent periods of more than three months
abroad at partner institutions in 1993/94.
Thus, there is no shortage of well-qualified European students with good
linguistic skills and solid professional experience.
The challenge is to make these masters level qualifications as tradeable
across frontiers as a good quality MBA - either through mutual recognition,
or, more ambitiously, through the development of a common curriculum.
This is the mission of networks, such as the Community of European
Management Schools and the Alliance of Management Schools in European
Capitals, as well as of multi-site programmes such as the European
Partnership of Business Schools, the Ecole Europeenne des Affaires, and the
European Business School.
The extent to which existing programmes satisfy the criteria for a European
qualification is also the subject of a European Commission study being
undertaken at the moment by Lancaster University.
Between them, Brussels and the market place can no doubt supply some
answers.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum shaft closed
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Impala Platinum, the world's second biggest platinum producer, has closed a
marginally-profitable shaft with the loss of more than two thousand jobs. It
now employs about 35,000 workers, having shed more than a third of the
workforce in the past two years in a bid to preserve profitability at a time
of steadily declining metal prices.
A company official yesterday said that the six-year-old shaft had been beset
by underground mining difficulties, which had led to it being operated at
only half of its rated capacity. Its closure would have a marginal impact on
the group's overall platinum output of more than 1m troy ounces a year.
She added that the closure of the shaft would improve Impala's working costs
in the year ahead. 'Limited development work will continue as Impala plans
to re-open the shaft when market conditions improve,' she said.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact talks begin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Coffee Organisation embarked yesterday on a 10-day meeting
that could decide its future existence. The 56-member body is due to agree a
new international coffee pact to replace the 1983 accord, which has been
extended four times.
But the 40 coffee-producing countries disagree with the 16 importing members
about whether the new pact should contain the option to re-introduce
measures to regulate the market, such as export quotas.
Such 'economic' mechanisms were dropped from the old agreement in 1989 and
coffee consuming countries want the new pact to remain merely
administrative, providing a data base and research on the coffee market.
If the ICO council cannot agree a new pact, it may meet again shortly, to
extend the current one yet again or to abolish it, said an official.
The producer and consumer sides were discussing their respective positions
yesterday and an outcome on the pact is not expected until towards the end
of the meeting on March 30. Producers, basking in the success of their
export retention scheme in buoying prices, would like the new accord to
enable the council to implement economic measures.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU shows flexibility on banana
regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday signalled that it was prepared to be
flexible in its dispute with Latin American countries over banana imports by
fixing a much higher import quota than usual for the second quarter of this
year.
It set the quota at 590,120 tonnes, about 60,000 tonnes higher than the
average of second quarter imports over the past four years.
The move came as the European Union awaited word from Costa Rica on whether
it would drop its complaint to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
about the EU's preferential banana trading arrangements with former colonies
in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific under the Lome convention.
The EU is expected to resubmit its offer to increase the annual Latin
American quota to 2.2m tonnes over two years from the 2m tonnes fixed last
July if Costa Rica joins Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela, the other three
main suppliers, in abandoning the complaint.
A meeting is provisionally scheduled for tomorrow between Mr Rene Steichen,
EU agriculture commissioner, and Mr Roberto Rojas, the Costa Rican foreign
trade minister.
'We've had no indication from them that they're prepared to accept our
offer, but we would hope to find a solution,' said a commission official.
The rise in the second quarter quota is in response to applications for
import licences for that amount, which corresponds to 29.5 per cent of the
annual 2m tonne quota.
'It doesn't mean the 2m tonnes will change,' said the official. 'But the
facility is there to import more if there's a demand and we're willing to
use these mechanisms.
'By accepting all the licence demands, no one can turn round and say to us
that it's the regime which is causing the rise in prices.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disappointed oil explorers may
cut Barents Sea losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oil companies operating in Norway may decide to suspend activity in the
Barents Sea after 13 years of disappointing results from 52 exploration
wells costing an estimated NKr10bn (Pounds 910m). Several wells have yielded
natural gas, but they are not considered commercially exploitable because of
the long distances to markets and high development costs.
With the current low level of oil prices and the high costs of exploring the
remote region, companies say activity in the area is an 'exotic indulgence'.
Recognising the decline in oil company interest in the area, the government
recently proposed more attractive terms and conditions for exploring there.
The authorities earlier linked the award of the most attractive Norwegian
shelf exploration acreage to company commitment to invest in high-risk
acreage such as the Barents Sea.
Many oil companies have welcomed the proposed changes but nevertheless say
they do little to enhance prospectivity, given low oil prices, distances to
markets and Norway's stringent tax regime.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, says it must develop new
strategies before it proceeds and is not likely to drill a new well in the
region for at least two years. The group has spent some NKr2.5bn, about 25
per cent of total oil company exploration costs there.
'We're at a crossroads, and must soon decide whether - and how - we are
going to continue in the southern Barents Sea or switch our attention to
other parts of the Norwegian shelf,' Mr Tor Fjaeran, Statoil senior vice
president for domestic resource development, said recently.
He welcomed the new proposals but stressed that the potential for finding
hydrocarbons - particularly oil - was the principal factor determining
Statoil's commitment.
Mr Fjaeran said oil companies' expectations for the region had been reduced
because of the dominance of gas. 'The area is primarily a gas province and
no way has been found for selling the gas already discovered,' he said.
At the same time, according to Mr Fjaeran, present geological information
suggested that only small oil discoveries could be expected, while
environmental challenges added to costs.
Statoil recently completed testing a Barents Sea discovery that yielded a
high gas flow and low oil production and established that the find, though
technically producible, was not commercial.
The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the industry watchdog, estimates the
potential recoverable petroleum reserves of the region at 1.12bn tonnes of
oil equivalent, of which oil accounts for 190m and gas 930m. About 260m
tonnes of petroleum has been discovered, it says.
Mobil Exploration Norway, a pioneer explorer in the area, has spent about
NKr750m to drill seven wells. 'We have not completely lost interest, but we
have to look at the Barents Sea compared with other prospective areas,' says
a company executive.
'Although we appreciate the new proposals, the fiscal regime is still the
same.'
'Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil company, spent about
NKr150m exploring in the Barents Sea. 'We feel the Barents Sea is still
interesting given its size and, there are new explorations models but, given
the small amount of oil discovered so far, it is hard to justify investment
in the area right now,' says a Saga executive.
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest listed company, has spent about NKr1.7bn in
the region but says it will continue to evaluate future activity.

Within the next couple of weeks, Royal Dutch Shell will sign an agreement
with the Peruvian government that is expected to lead to the development of
the huge Camisea natural gas fields discovered by the company in 1986.
Earlier attempts to sign an exploitation contract under the left-of-centre
Alan Garcia regime foundered for political reasons.
Now, with a new hydrocarbons law in place, a liberal economic regime and
renewed investor confidence, the chances of real agreement look bright.
Development of Camisea - located in the south-eastern jungle in Cuzco
department - will increase Peru's current reserves position almost
sevenfold.
'Our interest in developing Camisea has never lapsed,' said Mr John Auger,
Shell's representative in Lima, at the weekend. Under the new agreement,
Shell - together with Peruvian experts - will carry out a feasibility study,
expected to take some fourteen months. By late May 1995, the company should
be negotiating a development contract which, in turn, should be signed by
December 1995.
Camisea is Peru's biggest ever find and, when developed, will represent the
largest single investment in the country's history. Probable reserves amount
to 11 trillion (million million) cubic feet, or the equivalent of 1.7bn
barrels of oil. In addition, according to Mr Auger, the three deposits in
the Camisea field already identified contain some 500m recoverable barrels
of liquid petroleum gas.
'And there's the possibility of finding yet more in the same area,' said Mr
Auger.
Development of Camisea has become a matter of some urgency for Peru. For
lack of exploration over the past decade, oil reserves have slumped to about
350m barrels and the country has been forced to import some of its light
crude requirements. The national electricity deficit is variously estimated
at between 300MW and 500MW.
One of the options Shell will be considering is the installation either in
Lima or in the Camisea area of thermal power stations to generate
electricity from Camisea's gas. Another option is to lay a gas pipeline
hundreds of miles across the Andes to Lima. If eventually built, this would
be the highest in the world.
Mr Auger was reluctant to speculate on the scale of possible future
investment, although earlier studies would indicate something between
Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn. In the 1980s, Shell invested over Dollars 200m
in initial exploration work. It seems likely that it will seek consortium
partners for Camisea's eventual development.

A technical sell-off in late afternoon trading saw the London Metal Exchange
three months delivery COPPER price tumble below Dollars 1,950 a tonne to
find underlying support towards the Dollars 1,940 level.
Copper's weakness spilled over into the ALUMINIUM market, where the three
months price fell back to test support under Dollars 1,330-a-tonne following
waves of speculative and trade selling.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India not yet ready for tea
imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian federal government has decided against allowing the import of
bulk tea for re-export.
At the same time, however, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the commerce minister, has
told local tea producers, who are against imports of any kind, that he finds
no 'inherent contradiction in the simultaneous export and import of the same
commodity'.
'It is very important', he says, 'that India retains the image of a
sustainable steady supplier of commodities. In times of domestic shortages
we may resort to import to maintain export. It is never easy to regain a
lost market.'
Mr Mukherjee thinks that the Indian Tea Board production target of 1bn kg of
tea by the turn of the century is ambitious. Last year India's crop was a
record 760m kg, against 704m kg in 1992 and 742m kg in 1991. The minister
has expressed concern that 'with the domestic consumption of tea going up by
15m to 20m kg a year, there is a pressure on the exportable surplus.'
Mr SM Dutta, chairman of Hindustan Lever, who is spearheading the tea import
campaign has also cast doubt on India hitting its turn of the century
production target. Those in favour of import point out that the rate of
growth in domestic consumption of tea is higher than the production growth
rate. They also contend that with annual consumption of tea in India being
only 65kg a head, there is considerable scope for growth. This, however, is
not possible without import, if Indian tea exports are not to be affected.
Even then Mr HP Barooah, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, admits that
'one day, some countries may be in a position to offer good enough tea to
the Indian consumer at a competitive price. If the price is attractive and
the quality acceptable, the Indian consumer may not be willing to pay the
extra high price for Indian tea, even though it may have an edge in
quality'.
The basic problem in India, Mr Barooah points out, is that because of the
low productivity of workers (730kg per man-year) and of land (1,610kg a
hectare in north India, where quality tea is grown), the country has become
a high cost producer. The cost of production of north Indian tea is Dollars
1.60 a kilogram, compared with about Dollars 1 in Kenya.
According to Mr Barooah him, the Indian tea industry cannot ask for
protection when the country's business is being globalised. In the long run,
the import of tea can be avoided only by making the domestic industry
competitive in terms of quality and price, he warns.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall further ahead of Fed
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds suffered further losses yesterday amid continued jitters
over monetary policy and ahead of this week's influx of fresh supply.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/16 lower
at 91 9/16 , with the yield rising more than four basis points to 6.944 per
cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 to 99 3/16 , to
yield 5.051 per cent.
After a sharp downturn in bond prices in the previous session, the tone of
the market remained decidedly defensive. Uncertainty over the timing of the
Federal Reserve's next strike on short-term interest rates was the catalyst
to renewed selling pressure and a dearth of any significant buying interest.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, was
scheduled to meet in Washington today. The consensus among Wall Street
analysts sees the central bank lifting its target for the Federal Funds
rates - at which banks make overnight loans to one another - by either 25 or
50 basis points, from the current 3.25 per cent level.
But the extent of the market's recent weakness has surprised some analysts,
given last week's unthreatening data on consumer and producer prices. The
perception of political interference in the rate-setting process was
partially to blame, following Friday's unexpected talks between President
Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman.
Another factor exacerbating the market's jitters was the breakdown of
negotiations between the US and North Korea over nuclear inspections and
threats by the White House to take steps to punish the recalcitrant Asian
power.
Of more direct concern was the Treasury's plans to sell Dollars 17bn in new
two-year notes today, followed by an auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year
securities on Wednesday. The new issues could inspire slack demand in view
of the fluid state of Fed policy.
An overwhelming belief that the US Federal Reserve will further tighten
policy today sent European government bond markets lower at the start of
trading yesterday. Analysts said they expected the Fed to proceed cautiously
since a rise of more than a quarter-point would be viewed negatively by the
markets. 'The Fed will try to avoid upsetting the markets,' said one
analyst.
However, traders said the lower levels attracted some bargain-hunting, which
pushed prices a shade higher in the afternoon. They added that a widening in
the yield differential between 10-year German government bonds and UK
government bonds to more than 100 basis points prompted some investors to
switch from bunds to gilts. The spread has been as narrow as 50 basis points
in the past.
In London, gilts drifted higher after a weak opening but most of the
activity was in the futures market. The June long gilt future on Liffe
traded between the day's low of 108 19/32 and high of 109 9/16 before
settling at 109 1/8 in the late afternoon, down  7/32 on the day.
In the cash market, five-year gilts made the day's best gains, of around
7/32 , as traders who had gone short of paper with that maturity last week
in the belief that the Bank of England would announce a five-year,
fixed-rate auction were forced to cover their positions.
The Bank is due to announce details of its first auction of floating-rate
gilts for 15 years today. The market expects the issue to have a five-year
maturity, to be priced to yield 20 to 25 basis points below the London
interbank offered rate (Libor) and to raise in the region of Pounds 3bn.
Analysts reported that the Bank had been in close consultation with leading
participants in the gilts market regarding the size of the issue, which
reflected its desire for a smooth launch. A successful issue would open up
new funding avenues for the Bank, analysts said.
The defensive nature of the issue is likely to appeal in particular to the
monetary sector, to central banks and to foreign institutions.
Bunds recouped some of their early weakness on hopes of a further fall in
the Bundesbank's repo rate tomorrow, to 5.8 per cent from 5.88 per cent. The
bund future on Liffe broke above a chart resistance point of 96.20 and rose
to the day's high of 96.52. However, it fell back to 95.82 in the late
afternoon, down 0.78 points, due to lack of follow-through buying.
The market also found some support in economists' bullish forecasts on
German inflation. Provisional cost of living data for the month to mid-March
are expected to be published by the end of the week. A year-on-year figure
of 3 per cent would please the market. By contrast, traders said the
publication of M3 for February would not have much impact on the market
provided it came within forecasts of around 15 per cent.
Italian government bonds eased as the countdown started to the March 27
general election. The Italian government bond June future fell just over one
point to 109.36 in the late afternoon.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Scarce borrowers stick to floating-rate
note issues

<DATELINE>
   VALETTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed volatility in government bonds dampened activity in the Eurobond
market again yesterday. Dealers said they expect the flow of new issues to
be very subdued this week.
The few borrowers to brave the market stuck to floating-rate note issues,
which are less sensitive than fixed-rate bonds to interest rate uncertainty,
since they perform like money market instruments.
Barings launched a Dollars 150m issue of floating-rate notes due March 2001,
with put and call options from March 1999. The notes have a discounted
margin of 50 basis points over three-month Libor. An official said that the
proceeds would be used to provide funding for Barings' securities business.
Like a number of other banks in recent weeks, Barings took advantage of the
opportunity to secure floating-rate note funding, as an alternative to bank
credit lines.
In the French market, Toyota Motor Credit launched a FFr840m one-year deal,
which pays 7.63 per cent times the number of days that the Paris interbank
offered rate falls within a predetermined range.
In the sterling market, Cheshire Building Society launched a small Pounds
10m issue of Pibs (permanent interest bearing shares) via Hoare Govett, the
second such offering to pay a variable interest rate. The deal pays interest
of 2.4 per cent above six-month Libor.
First National Building Society, Ireland's second largest building society,
launched the first floating-rate Pibs issue, a Pounds 25m deal, earlier this
month.
Dealers said that more floating-rate Pibs are likely to be launched,
although demand may be rather limited.
'Natural buyers of Pibs are fixed-rate investors who want to lock in a
certain level of income,' said one syndicate official.
Elf Aquitaine has had its long-term securities ratings placed under review
for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, which cited concerns
over the effect of lower crude oil prices on Elf's balance sheet. Elf's
long-term debt and preferred stock are currently rated Aa3. Its Prime-1
short-term rating is not under review.
Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, have given
Malta an a2 and an a (stable) rating, writes Godfrey Grima from Valetta.
Mr John Dalli, the finance minister, said both agencies view the island's
economy as strong and in the process of increased liberalisation.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Indian investment log-jam
bypassed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Edinburgh-based fund manager has struck an agreement with an Indian
custodial bank, allowing a log-jam of securities transactions in India to be
bypassed. The log-jam has been responsible for a dramatic slowdown this year
of foreign investment in India.
The fund manager, Martin Currie, is to raise an additional Dollars 150m
through an issue of convertible preference shares in the Indian
Opportunities Fund. The IOF, managed jointly by Martin Currie and Indian
merchant bank Indbank, raised Dollars 100m in an initial placing of ordinary
shares last July.
A further tranche planned for earlier this year had to be postponed after
difficulty arose at custodial banks in India. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking,
the leading custodial bank in India, which acts as Martin Currie's
custodian, told its customers it was temporarily unable to handle any
further increase in foreign investments in India.
Custodial banks hold share certificates for safe keeping, collect dividends
and follow instructions to pass shares to new owners when they are sold. In
India each share has its own certificate and the volume of paper this
creates has raised serious administrative burdens for large, active
institutional investors.
Martin Currie has struck an agreement with Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India, which acts as a sub-custodian for several large US
banks. The local fund managers will have a period of six months in which to
invest cash raised by the latest issue.

A Dollars 300m sovereign loan syndication for Oman was more than 100 per

Bankers described the response as a measure of the confidence bankers have
in the oil producer.
The arrangers for the five-year deal were Gulf International Bank, Chase
Manhattan Bank, Commerzbank and Bank of Tokyo.
As Oman was repaying debt, it created room for banks to take on new paper, a
banker said. Japanese banks were said to be particularly interested in the
deal, perhaps trying to re-establish their presence having taken a lower
profile during the 1990 - 91 Gulf war.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: French bank to securitise
commercial property loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust International has arranged a FFr9bn securitisation of
commercial property loans, designed to restructure the balance sheet of
Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the French bank.
The securitisation is split into three tranches, consisting of two
asset-backed commercial paper programmes and one bond offering.
The deal will allow CdE to refinance itself without the need for further
capitalisation, according to Mr Graeme Thomson of Banker's Trust's global
investment bank division.
The first two tranches consist of FFr1.5bn to FFr3bn of revolving credit
back-up facilities, one in French francs and one in dollars, supporting,
respectively, a billets de tresorerie (BT) programme, and a dollar
commercial paper programme, both maturing on December 31 1998.
The third tranche is a FFr4.5bn fixed-rate bond due December 31 1998, to be
arranged by a group of French banks next month.
Under the structure, CdE sells its property loan portfolio to a special
purpose vehicle. CdE's shareholders, Assurances Generales de France, Credit
Foncier de France, Union Assurance de Paris, Caisse des Depots et
Consignations and Groupe des Assurances Nationales, all act as guarantors.
There is also an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee from MBIA, a
triple-A rated specialist insurance company.

of USDollars 306m

<TEXT>
Hongkong Land, the property development and management arm of the Jardine
group, yesterday reported unchanged net earnings, with 1993 profits before
extraordinary items of USDollars 306.5m, compared with USDollars 305m in
1992.
Last year's earnings at the operating level were ahead by only 1.6 per cent,
and growth was further undermined by Hongkong Land's share, totalling
Dollars 20.6m, of losses at Trafalgar House, the UK property, engineering
and construction conglomerate.
Mr Alasdair Morrison, managing director, said he hoped Trafalgar House's
problems were behind it and that losses would not recur.
Profits after an extraordinary gain of Dollars 213.2m on the sale of a Hong
Kong property were Dollars 519.7m. The dividend is going up 5.3 per cent, to
10 cents a share. The company ended last year with net borrowings of just
Dollars 82m.
Hongkong Land owns the most highly-prized office and retail properties in
the central district of Hong Kong island. Mr Morrison, who is stepping down
at Hongkong Land to take over as head of the Jardine group, said the company
expected improved earnings this year on the back of higher rents. About a
third of the company's property leases come up for renewal this year.
He said the average rent during 1983 was HKDollars 45 per square foot for
office accommodation and HKDollars 105 for retail space. In recent rent
reversions, the company had achieved around HKDollars 100 per sq ft for
small offices in Exchange Square - its prime office development on the Hong
Kong waterfront - and expected to rent larger spaces for more than HKDollars
90 per sq ft.
'We see rents increasing for some time; most of the space in core central is
fully let,' Mr Morrison said. In real terms, current rents were still below
those of 1989, he said.
Mr Morrison said that Hongkong Land was interested in property development
in China. It was conducting a market survey of Shanghai and hoped to
identify opportunities there.
Sun Hung Kai Properties, a leading Hong Kong property developer, has entered
into a joint venture agreement to develop an integrated commercial complex
in Shanghai. The project, Central Plaza, will require an investment of
HKDollars 800m (USDollars 103.5m), the company said.

Israeli issue

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The underwriters of the share offering for Shikun U'Pituah, the Israeli
state construction group, have threatened to cancel the issue. The move has
prompted threats of a lawsuit by the treasury, Reuter reports from
Jerusalem.
The sale of Shikun U'Pituah was to have been one of Israel's largest share
offerings. It would also have been the first time that a state-owned company
had been completely privatised on the Tel Aviv stock exchange.
Analysts said underwriters of the offering - scheduled to have gone ahead
today - had shelved the issue because they believed the planned price was
too high to attract buyers in a depressed market.
The finance ministry said: 'The treasury reserves the right to sue for
damages if the underwriters fail to underwrite the offer.'
The flotation was expected to have brought the government a return of about
Dollars 337m.
A number of recent privatisation issues in Israel have had a rough ride,
with buyer interest well below initial projections.
This trend has been intensified by stock market weakness amid a rash of
insider-trading investigations.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: HK checks share-buying mania -
The colony's authorities are curbing investor zeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just six months ago, investors would have fallen over themselves to buy
shares in Chaifa, a small Hong Kong company planning to expand its business
 -making and selling clothes embellished with the Playboy bunny logo - into
mainland China.
Now, however, with stock market sentiment battered and the China tag no
longer the gilding it once was, new issues are a different ball game.
Chaifa's modest HKDollars 54.1m (USDollars 6.9m) offering was just 1.86
times subscribed, and on its first day's trading, the shares closed at 99
cents, 7 cents under the issue price.
Nor are H shares - China enterprises listing in Hong Kong - immune. Yizheng
Chemical Fibre, China's biggest producer of polyester, saw its HKDollars
714m public offer close last week 20 times subscribed. In December, Kunming
Machine Tool's HKDollars 128.70m offer was 627 times subscribed.
While the chief reason for the lacklustre IPO market is undoubtedly the poor
sentiment and volatility in the Hong Kong stock market (now down almost 25
per cent from its January peak), it also highlights different attitudes
towards new issues.
Regulators have been monitoring oversubscriptions in the IPO market since
1992. And investors themselves, no longer counting on turning round one or
two-day profits, are casting a far more critical eye over the listing
prospectuses before diving in.
Last year, discretion was often sacrificed. Investors descended on the
lending banks in hordes, at times forcing the Exchange Fund to step in with
cash injections to stabilise interbank rates and general liquidity. Share
prices invariably roared upwards on the first day of trading.
Denway Investment, a company from China making and selling cars, earned
itself a place in the colony's history books when it saw its HKDollars 402m
offer some 657 times subscribed. The offer, just over a year ago, pulled in
about HKDollars 264bn - almost one-third of Hong Kong's gross domestic
product that year.
Since then, the Monetary Authority has implemented a seven-point plan to
curb bank lending for new issues - insisting, among other things, that
financial institutions take a 10 per cent margin from all customers. Prior
to this, certain institutions were settling for 5 per cent: in certain
cases, where issues were widely believed to be hugely oversubscribed, no
down payment was required.
Earlier this month, the stock exchange launched its bid to rein in the new
issue market by banning multiple applications and applications that exceed
the total offer. In the past, it was not uncommon to receive applications
for HKDollars 500m worth of shares for a HKDollars 60m offering.
Underpinning the regulators' steps is a growing disenchantment with the IPO
game. In the past, stagging was an easy road to riches regardless of the
company fundamentals. Rumours of 100-fold subscription levels became
self-fulfilling prophecies, and there were plenty of buyers to push the
price up when trading started.
Now, however, with short-term gains no longer guaranteed, investors are
looking further ahead. Not all the companies which floated in a blaze of
hype and met their promised profits in year one went on to turn in surging
earnings in the second year.
Many brokers believe the quality of companies coming to market has
deteriorated. It is partly this feeling which has prompted many to advocate
a second stock market board - a concept rejected by the stock exchange in
1990, and again in its latest strategic plan this month.
Proponents of a second board argue this would be a more natural home for
many of the smaller and poorer quality companies coming on line. Out of this
year's 17-strong IPO league, more than half have raised less than HKDollars
100m. These smaller capitalisation stocks, which seldom merit much broker
research, are almost exclusively bought by retail investors.
In this sense at least, brokers judge the dwindling interest in the IPO
market as healthy: the market will support the quality companies and allow
them to raise funds for further expansion, while shunning the weaker
offerings. At the same time, underwriters - who now face being left with
stock - will be forced to take a harder look at potential clients.
Pricing mechanisms also came under attack during last year's
oversubscription mania. However, as yet there has been no marked increase in
price earning multiples: Yizheng Chemical Fibre is on a fully diluted p/e of
13.8 times, making it broadly comparable to last year's H share issues.
Mr Kevin Westley, chief executive of Wardley Holdings - one of the colony's
most active underwriters - reckons IPO pricings this year have only risen in
line with the blanket re-rating of the Hang Seng Index.
However, Mr Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Monetary Authority, believes
p/es still tend to be quite low on issue. The lull in investor frenzy and
the curbs in place do not mean Hong Kong's IPO market is clean of anomalies
yet, he warns.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Surge at HK broadcaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television Broadcasts (TVB), a Hong Kong broadcaster, yesterday lived up to
its reputation as the colony's most profitable media company with a 42 per
cent rise in net earnings, to HKDollars 519.6m (USDollars 67.2m), for 1993.
Profits were struck on an 11 per cent rise in turnover, to HKDollars 2bn.
A final dividend of 65 cents a share makes a total of 80 cents, an increase
of 33 per cent on 1992.
Underwriting TVB's profitability is its near-80 per cent share of
terrestrial television advertising revenues in Hong Kong. Directors remain
confident that demand for advertising air-time will remain strong this year.
TVB entered the satellite television market last September with the launch
of a Chinese-language TV station aimed at Taiwan.

<TEXT>
General Motors (GM), which returned to profits in 1993 after three years of
losses, did not pay any annual bonuses to its top executives, including Mr
Jack Smith, the chairman and chief executive.
Mr Smith received Dollars 1.37m in base salary, plus a package of share
options - well below the Dollars 1.9m salary and bonus received by Mr Robert
Eaton, chairman of the much smaller Chrysler.
GM's preliminary proxy statement yesterday explained that 'management
believed corporate awards should not be granted until the executive group
achieves sustained profitability, and better positions the corporation to
grow its core automotive business.
'While it is competitive practice for a company to pay for 'turnaround
results', the committee believes this decision . . . underscores GM's
commitment to its pay-for-performance philosophy and focus on stockholders'
interests.' The proxy also revealed that GM wants shareholders to approve a
doubling of its authorised common shares to 2bn. It has 718.7m shares
outstanding.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Tenneco names new Case head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, has named a veteran of
Honeywell's European restructuring programme to head JI Case, Tenneco's
largest division.
Mr Jean-Pierre Rosso, a 53-year-old from Vichy, France, will succeed Mr
Edward Campbell as Case's president. Mr Campbell will retire on March 31.
Mr Rosso's appointment is seen as a sign that Case is about to proceed with
an extensive rationalisation of its European operations, where its
construction and agricultural equipment lines have been battered by
competition and shrinking markets.
Case has just completed the first year of a three-year, Dollars 920m
restructuring programme designed to rescue the equipment manufacturer from
losses of Dollars 1bn in 1992. To date, the bulk of Case's rationalisations
and plant closings have been in North America.
Announcing Mr Rosso's appointment, Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's president, said
'a substantial amount of restructuring steps remain across all of Case's
worldwide operations'.
Twenty-five per cent of Case's business originates in Europe, mostly in the
UK, France, and Germany. Mr Mead, who remains chairman of Case, confirmed
rationalisations were expected beyond the previously-announced closure of
the Neuss tractor plant in mid-1996.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Borland revenue warning as
finance chief resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Borland International, the US personal computer software company which is
selling its spreadsheet product Quattro Pro to Novell for Dollars 145m,
yesterday announced the resignation of its finance chief and warned that it
will report significantly lower revenues and a 'substantial' operating loss
in the quarter ended March 31.
Borland also said it will incur a charge in the next quarter to cover the
corporate restructuring that followed the Quattro Pro sale and its poor
recent earnings performance. It said it had not yet determined the extent of
the charge.
These latest developments follow last week's appointment of Mr Keith Maib as
Borland's first chief operating officer. Mr Maib, a former partner at the
accountancy firm Price Waterhouse who had spent the weeks prior to his
appointment conducting a detailed examination of the Borland's business, is
now running the day-to-day management of the company.
The arrival of Mr Maib followed a period of turmoil among the company's
senior management. Yesterday's resignation of Mr Alan Henricks, who stepped
down as chief financial officer 'to pursue other interests', was only the
latest in a line of recent departures by senior executives.
Last Wednesday, the head of the company's product division resigned.
The sale of Quattro Pro, the arrival of Mr Maib, and the planned
restructuring, are all part of an attempt by Mr Philip Kahn, Borland's chief
executive, to ensure the company survives a price war in the increasingly
competitive software market.
Borland incurred a loss of Dollars 49m for its 1993 fiscal year, and in the
latest quarter reported only modest profits.
Shares in Borland rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday before they were suspended pending the announcement of
the deal with Novell.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment
company, yesterday reported an 81 per cent advance in net earnings to
HKDollars 1.89bn (USDollars 244m) for 1993, up from HKDollars 1.04bn in
1992. The results were in line with market expectations.
Profits were swollen by a string of acquisitions during the year and
partially funded by a HKDollars 7.1bn placement which went towards the
purchase of a 12 per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom and the controlling
interest in two mainland power stations bought from parent Citic Hong Kong
last January.
Taken on a per share basis, earnings grew 24 per cent to 108.2 cents, from
87.4 cents.
Dah Chong Hong, the motor trading group which became a wholly-owned
subsidiary in April 1992, was an important factor in last year's growth,
contributing around 35 per cent of total profits - ahead of the 30 cent from
Hongkong Telecom.
However, increased competition in the motor sector eroded margins, while
macro-economic measures adopted in China hit sales there, said Mr Larry
Yung, chairman.
This year, the contribution from Dah Chong Hong is likely to shrink to
around 25 per cent, reflecting the increased contributions from other parts
of the group.
Of the two power plants, one started operation during 1993 and the 56 per
cent-owned Ligang Power Plant has been running since January 1.
The group will also start to benefit in 1994 from its 50 per cent interest
in the development of Discovery Bay, a residential complex on Lantau Island
which was bought by Citic for HKDollars 3.4bn earlier this year.
The directors are proposing a final dividend of 28 cents a share, making a
total payout of 38 cents. This represents an increase of 26 per cent over
the total of 30.2 cents paid for 1992.

claim

<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, has become embroiled
in a dispute with the Oslo Tax Board which is claiming NKr690.1m (Dollars
93.8m) in extra taxes covering a four-year period.
The disagreement concerns a deduction for losses on shares in Norsk Hydro
Canada, a unit which produces magnesium, and the waiving of interest on
equity loans for Hydro Fertilizers in the UK.
Norsk Hydro intends to appeal against the tax board's claim and said
deferred tax provisions were included in consolidated accounts for the
relevant years.
The company maintains that 'the new assessment, therefore, has no effect on
total taxes compared with the preliminary result for 1993 published on
February 21'.
It explains that the tax board had disallowed a deduction for loss on shares
in Norsk Hydro Canada, and in the board's view the waived interest on the
loans to Hydro Fertilisers should have been included in taxable income in
Norway.
ABB Finland has won a Dollars 50m contract from Central Hidroelectrica de
Carnas (CHEC), the Colombian utility, to supply transformers and other
equipment for 21 new substations throughout the Caldas region of the
Colombian Andes, writes Andrew Baxter.
The deal is a further sign of revival in the South American power equipment
markets. Union Bank of Finland is providing 85 per cent of the finance
through a Dollars 42.5m 12 1/2 -year export credit loan.

Bancorp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
First Fidelity Bancorporation, the New Jersey-based bank, is to acquire
Baltimore Bancorp for Dollars 346m in a Dollars 20.75 per share cash deal,
agencies report from New York.
The price represents about twice Baltimore Bancorp's expected book value at
closing, Fidelity noted. Baltimore Bancorp, with Dollars 2.2bn in assets, is
the parent company of the Bank of Baltimore which has Dollars 2bn in
deposits, Dollars 1.4bn in loans and 42 branch offices.
First Fidelity said the acquisition was expected to close by the end of
1994, starting to add to its earnings in the first quarter of 1995. It said
there will be no up-front charges.
Mr Tony Terracciano, First Fidelity chairman and chief executive, said the
acquisition positions his bank in a growing and geographically contiguous
market.
He added that the Baltimore bank's distribution system provided an
opportunity to develop new business and revenue for middle market, small
company and private banking businesses.
First Fidelity said it needed no external financing to close the
transaction, which has been approved by the boards of both Baltimore Bancorp
and First Fidelity.

injection of equity in shake-up

<TEXT>
Trizec, the biggest property unit in Toronto's Edper-Hees group, is
negotiating a CDollars 600m (USDollars 438m) equity infusion which would
form the basis of a revised recapitalisation.
Trizec, which is controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, is
restructuring its debt. It was affected by the collapse in North American
property values that began in 1990, and its debt totals nearly CDollars 2bn
at the corporate level, plus a further CDollars 3bn due in five years in the
operating subsidiaries.
The Calgary-based group, one of North America's fastest growing development
companies, last week won an Alberta court order delaying enforcement
proceedings by senior and junior debenture holders until March 31.
Trizec said that this would give it time to complete negotiations for the
third-party cash infusion.
Last August, Trizec proposed a recapitalisation to handle debt maturing in
five years. Debt holders would have ended up with 49 per cent of the equity
of the reorganised company and the Bronfmans would have lost control.
Last January, the senior debt holders presented a counter-proposal but an
agreement was not possible, Trizec said in a statement. It then tried to
raise new equity and 'several sophisticated investors' began due-diligence
proceedings.
In the past week, Trizec said, the plan for a third-party infusion of
CDollars 600m was tabled, partly to buy senior debentures and partly to
strengthen the company's equity base.
It asked the senior debenture holders for extra time to finalise
negotiations, but they refused and accelerated payment of all debentures
under the March 19 1994 trust deed.
Trizec said Saturday's court delay 'will provide the time needed to complete
the talks'. The plan would require a vote by all debt holders and
shareholders and court approval.
The group retains about 80 office buildings and shopping centres totalling
54m square feet of commercial space (77 per cent in the US and 23 per cent
in Canada). It recently sold its chain of nursing homes.
In the year ending October 31 last, the loss was CDollars 312m, including
CDollars 287m in write-downs and losses on undeveloped properties and cash
flow remain insufficient to service debt. Its holding in a sister company,
Bramalea, was written off in 1992.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ares-Serono, the Geneva pharmaceuticals group that specialises in fertility
drugs, reported a 33 per cent slide in 1993 net income to Dollars 72.5m.
However, the fall was exaggerated by an extraordinary Dollars 27.7m gain on
the sale of assets in 1992. Net income from continuing operations was down
9.4 per cent.
Sales fell 12 per cent to Dollars 755.3m, hurt by currency devaluations in
Italy and Spain and drug price reductions imposed by governments in several
countries.
The group said the improvement in operating margin was due to cost-cutting.
The diagnostic division, accounting for 12 per cent of group sales, returned
to profit.
Pre-tax profits were down 17 per cent to Dollars 100.6m.
Movenpick, the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, said consolidated net
income recovered slightly to SFr8.5m (Dollars 5.9m) last year from SFr6.5m
in 1992, on sales up 1.5 per cent to SFr1.25bn.
Mr Ulrich Geissmann, chief executive, said measures to strengthen the group,
which changed hands two years ago, had already begun to take effect.

Guoco Group, the Hong Kong-based company controlled by the Malaysian Quek
family, reported a 287 per cent surge in earnings to HKDollars 812.8m for
the six months to December 31, compared with HKDollars 210.1 last year,
writes Louise Lucas.
The dividend rises just 1 cent on last year, to 21 HK cents.
Subsidiary Dao Heng Bank Group, spun off in a separate listing last
December, made a net interim profit of HKDollars 400.5m - an increase of 135
per cent over the HKDollars 170.1m last time.
The group said Overseas Trust Bank, bought from the colony's government last
October for HKDollars 4.46bn, was making a strong contribution. There is no
interim dividend at Dao Heng.

Ares-Serono, the Geneva pharmaceuticals group that specialises in fertility

However, the fall was exaggerated by an extraordinary Dollars 27.7m gain on
the sale of assets in 1992. Net income from continuing operations was down
9.4 per cent. Sales fell 12 per cent to Dollars 755.3m, hurt by currency

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air France waits for Czech talks
outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air France was last night anxiously awaiting the conclusion of negotiations
in Prague to sell its 19.1 per cent stake in Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) to
Konsolidacni Banka, the Czech state-controlled bank, for between Dollars 25m
and Dollars 30m.
The French airline, which acquired the stake in 1992 and is under acute
financial pressure after a strike last autumn, has for weeks been embroiled
in negotiations with the Czech authorities over the share sale.
The two sides had originally hoped to announce terms of a final agreement
yesterday afternoon, but the talks continued into the evening.
Meanwhile, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, which also
owns 19.1 per cent of CSA, was also attempting to conclude negotiations with
the Czech government for the latter to take over Air France's guarantee for
70 per cent of its stake.
EBRD is understood to be hoping to hold on to its shares providing the Czech
authorities agree to accept the old Air France guarantee. However, the bank,
which has written off 30 per cent of the investment, may reconsider its
position if the guarantee is not renewed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks are expected formally to approve a FFr13bn (Dollars
2.25bn) rescue package for the stricken leisure group in the next few weeks.
Lenders representing more than 50 per cent of its FFr20.3bn loans have
already agreed to participate.
Euro Disney last Monday announced that Walt Disney, its US parent company,
had secured an outline agreement with its banks for a restructuring plan
that would reduce its net debt to FFr10bn, on condition that the banks
agreed to an 18-month interest holiday.
A senior banker within the Euro Disney loan syndicates said yesterday that
every bank on the steering committee that negotiated the restructuring had
already agreed in principle to support it. Several banks outside the
committee have also signalled approval.
The consenting banks include: Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Agricole and
Banque Indosuez of France, Barclays and National Westminster of the UK, and
Deutsche Bank of Germany. Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French
financial institution, has already publicly stated its support.
The steering committee is negotiating with other members of the 63-strong
syndicate to try to secure their consent.
It is common in large restructurings for a few small lenders to object to
the terms. However, the terms of the rescue do not require any of the banks
to provide extra capital. It is also understood that the steering committee,
chaired by BNP and Indosuez, is empowered by its mandate to accept an
agreement on behalf of all the banks.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Macy rescue plan hits snag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of RH Macy was convening yesterday after a last-minute glitch
emerged in a plan to bring the company out of Chapter 11 protection.
The conflict, centring on the valuation the company would place on itself in
the reorganisation proposal, threatens to scupper a strategy designed to
allow the New York-based department store chain to remain independent.
In January, Federated Department Stores, a long-time rival, proposed a
merger between the two groups and purchased Dollars 450m of Macy's highest
ranking debt.
The deal gave Federated considerable influence over Macy's future and the
right to come up with a reorganisation plan.
Until late last week, yesterday's board meeting was expected to endorse a
proposal hammered out after weeks of negotiations between Macy's management
and two of its most important secured creditors, GE Capital and Fidelity
Investments.
The package was intended to pay off both Federated and Prudential Insurance,
which also holds about Dollars 450m in Macy's debt, and pave the way for a
reorganised Macy to issue new equity to other secured creditors.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the former US secretary of state who was appointed last
month to mediate in the negotiations, would then review the proposal.
However, a challenge to the management-sanctioned plan surfaced in the days
leading up to yesterday's meeting. Mr Laurence Tisch, an influential
outsider director, was expected to argue for a Dollars 3.8bn valuation for
the company, compared with Dollars 3.5bn recommended by Macy's financial
advisers.
Under a Dollars 3.8bn valuation, public bondholders and other junior
creditors would realise a greater return on their claims and receive a
bigger proportion of the stock issued by the company when it emerges from
Chapter 11.
Senior creditors would receive less. As a consequence, some of them, led by
Fidelity, are threatening to withdraw their support for Macy's independence
if Mr Tisch wins. A letter signed by the group was sent to Mr Vance, warning
him of their intention to back Federated unless the lower valuation was
sanctioned by the board.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: GiroCredit executives threaten
to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and IAN RODGER

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The four executive directors of GiroCredit, Austria's third largest bank,
have threatened to resign at the end of June unless the long struggle over
control of the bank is resolved.
Mr Hans Haumer, chief executive, said he and his three colleagues were
expressing their frustration at working in a strategic vacuum.
GiroCredit was established by Austria's savings banks as their central
clearing institution. It has used that platform to become a leading
participant in capital markets.
However, the two largest savings bank groups, Erste Oesterreichische and
Bank Austria, which between them control more than half of Giro's equity,
have come to regard Giro in recent years as a competitor, and so have
stymied its development.
For more than three years, Giro executives have been trying to promote a
resolution of a stalemate on their supervisory board.
A year ago, Erste attempted to assemble a group of savings banks that would
buy Bank Austria's 30 per cent stake and take effective control.
Last month, Bank Austria, which had become impatient with the delays in
completing this deal, launched a unilateral counter-bid for 20.4 per cent of
Giro shares. This would be enough to give it clear control.
It soon became clear that Bank Austria would probably not achieve its
target, so the stalemate would remain intact.
In recent weeks, both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's have put Giro's credit
ratings under review, citing the ownership uncertainty.
The Austrian finance ministry has expressed its displeasure with the
situation at the bank.
Mr Haumer yesterday met Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chairman of Giro's
supervisory board and chief executive of Bank Austria, to present him with
the decision of the four executives not to renew their contracts when they
expired at the end of June.
Mr Haumer said later it had become very difficult to run the bank, and the
notices by the credit agencies proved that the situation had become
untenable.
He said that the bank was in a very strong financial situation, having
raised its pre-tax profits last year by 55 per cent to Sch2bn (Dollars
167.4m) in spite of the uncertain atmosphere surrounding it.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kemper and GE Capital closer to
proxy bid battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kemper, the embattled US financial services group, said yesterday it was
preparing to hand a list of its shareholders to GE Capital, in a move which
would allow the General Electric subsidiary to step up its Dollars 2.2bn
campaign for control.
The request from GE Capital could signal the start of the first big proxy
solicitation battle in the US for more than two years.
It is the first since the introduction of regulations making it easier for
shareholders to launch attacks on incumbent managements.
GE Capital said on Sunday it had written to Kemper asking for a list of
shareholders. The request followed a unanimous decision by Kemper's board
last week to reject a bid.
In a proxy battle, one shareholder seeks support either to force a board of
directors to pursue a policy it has rejected - such as putting a company up
for sale - or to engineer a change in the composition of the board.
Such battles, a familiar part of the 1980s corporate landscape, have become
rare in recent years. In the most recent case, USX, the steel, energy and
chemicals group, fought off an attempt from the corporate raider Mr Carl
Icahn to break up the group.
Kemper said yesterday it was consulting its lawyers about whether it should
hand GE Capital a shareholder list. It added, though, that it expected to
hand over the list, 'once we establish that they are a shareholder of
record'.
Regulations introduced last year allow shareholders to communicate directly
with others, in theory making it easier to build an alliance against an
incumbent board of directors.
GE Capital is believed to have hired D. F. King, which along with Georgeson
is one of the two biggest US proxy solicitation firms, to help with its
campaign.
King was active for QVC in its recent unsuccessful fight for control of
Paramount Communications, while Georgeson worked for Viacom, the eventual
victor.
In the letter to Kemper, Mr Gary Wendt, chairman and chief executive of GE
Capital, said: 'You leave us no choice but to proceed unilaterally and
communicate directly with our fellow shareholders, who surely will feel the
time-sensitive urgency to consummate this transaction as promptly as
possible or risk seeing their values decline.'

<TEXT>
Ford Motor, the US car-maker, appears to be close to a sale of its
unprofitable thrift, First Nationwide Financial Corporation, which has been
on the auction block for the past four months.
The car company is believed to have attracted two offers, each worth around
Dollars 1bn.
Market sources identified one of the bidders as Mr Gerald Ford, who heads a
Texan thrift, Madison Financial, but has no ties to Ford Motor or to the
former US president of the same name.
The other is understood to have come from a partnership between Great
Western Financial, a large Californian thrift, and Lehman Brothers, the
investment bank which American Express is spinning off. Lehman would be
involved solely to package and sell off First Nationwide's problem real
estate loans.
The sale of the San Francisco-based thrift would close an embarrassing
chapter for Ford, which bought First Nationwide in 1985 for around Dollars
500m but has since invested more than Dollars 700m to offset real estate
loan losses. First Nationwide has not been profitable since 1990.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Borden forced to restate
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Borden, the troubled US foods company, has been forced to restate its 1992
and 1993 earnings in a move that signals a broader regulatory crackdown on
how US companies report restructuring charges.
The accounting adjustment, stemming from a restructuring charge which Borden
announced in 1992, was forced by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It is the first sign of a more aggressive approach by the securities
regulators as to how companies book such one-off charges.
The SEC has written in recent weeks to companies which have taken big
restructuring charges to remind them that the charges must meet certain
criteria to qualify.
Many US companies have taken substantial restructuring charges in recent
years in an attempt to make themselves more competitive.
Such one-off charges, which often follow the appointment of a new management
team, could allow companies to report expenses which should be spread over
future years, in effect boosting profits in future years and flattering a
company's earnings trend.
IBM, the struggling computer giant, reported a Dollars 8.9bn restructuring
charge last year after Mr Louis Gerstner was brought in as chief executive.
The company could not immediately be reached for comment yesterday about the
SEC's apparent campaign to police such charges more actively.
Borden said that, following discussions with the SEC, it had decided to
reclassify part of its 1992 restructuring charge as 'cost of goods sold or
as marketing, general and administrative expenses in the years incurred'.
The company said it had reduced its 1992 restructuring charge, which was
originally reported as Dollars 642m, to Dollars 377m.
Of the difference, Dollars 60m has been applied to 1993, causing the company
to report an increased net loss for the year of Dollars 631m. The other
adjustments have been reflected in the 1992 figures, and will not affect
reported results in future, Borden said.
Mr Lawrence Doza, Borden's chief financial officer, left the company a month
ago in a departure that was thought at the time to be part of a broader
management restructuring at the troubled group.

The Euro Disney banks are expected formally to approve a FFr13bn (Dollars
2.25bn) rescue package for the stricken leisure group within the next few
weeks.
Lenders representing more than 50 per cent of its FFr20.3bn loans have
already agreed to participate.
Euro Disney last Monday announced that Walt Disney, its US parent company,
had secured an outline agreement with its banks for a restructuring plan
that would enable a reduction in its net debt to FFr10bn.
This was on condition that the banks agreed to an 18-month interest holiday.

Deutsche Bank of Germany. Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French
financial institution, has already publicly stated its support for the
rescue.
The steering committee is negotiating with the other members of the
63-strong syndicate to try to secure their consent. 'So far, no-one has
actually said 'no',' said the banker.
It is common in such large corporate restructurings for a few small lenders
to object to the terms of the deal.
However, the terms of the Euro Disney rescue do not require any of the banks
to provide extra capital. It is also understood that the steering committee,
chaired by BNP and Indosuez, is empowered by its mandate to accept an
agreement on behalf of all the banks.
The committee is believed to be willing to exercise that right as the
package has already secured so much support.
Walt Disney, which is bankrolling Euro Disney, has been pressing the banks
to finalise the rescue as quickly as possible.
However the legal process is expected to take a few weeks, and will not be
completed in time for Disney's original March 31 deadline.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Allstate raises estimate of
California earthquake toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The financial toll of January's earthquake in California seems set to rise
sharply to as much as Dollars 4bn, following yesterday's announcement by
another big US insurer that it has raised its estimate of losses.
Allstate, which has the second-biggest exposure to the earthquake, said it
now expected the disaster to cost it Dollars 600m, rather than the Dollars
350m it estimated before.
The increase followed an inspection of most of the 38,000 claims from
policyholders, the company said.
Another US insurer, 20th Century Insurance, said on Friday it expected the
earthquake to cost it Dollars 325m, more than double its original estimate
of Dollars 162m. The company, based in Los Angeles, warned that the costs
would wipe out around a quarter of its net worth.
Mr Jack Snyder, an insurance analyst at AM Best, the US ratings company,
said the two announcements reflected a general trend among US insurers to
revise their loss estimates upwards by between 50 and 100 per cent.
The revisions suggest that the total insured losses from the disaster, put a
month ago at around Dollars 2.5bn, are likely to be closer to Dollars 4bn,
he added.
Allstate put its market share of Californian homeowners insurance policies
at 15.6 per cent, behind State Farm, the market leader. State Farm has yet
to revise its expected losses, but the final cost to the company could reach
as much as Dollars 1bn, said Mr Snyder.
The higher level of losses is unlikely to be reflected in catastrophe
insurance premiums until the end of the year.
Allstate said the revision meant that it would report a pre-tax charge of
Dollars 750m in all in its first quarter results to reflect catastrophe
losses, with the remainder of the losses coming from bad weather.
The losses would result in an operating loss for the quarter of 30 cents a
share, and a net loss of around 15 cents a share.
Lloyd's of London said yesterday that the insurance payouts as a result of
the latest Los Angeles earthquake were unlikely to be large enough to
trigger any payments from its reinsurers, Andrew Jack adds from London.
It said that payments so far from London reinsurers from the Los Angeles
earthquake in January were Dollars 20m from non-marine and just Dollars
207,000 on aviation insurance policies.
These were only triggered once claims in the US on Los Angeles had risen
above Dollars 3bn.
Royal Insurance said it did not believe that many UK composite insurers
would be affected by yesterday's events.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Denmark's telecoms sale expected
to pull in Dollars 2.7bn

Tele Danmark, the Danish state monopoly telecommunications operator,
launched the sale of 48.3 per cent of its shares yesterday, expected to be
worth about Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn).
The flotation is the first of a series of telecoms privatisations expected
in the EU's continental states over the next two years, and the world's
largest since the sale of the final tranche of British Telecommunications
last June.
More than 80 per cent of the 63m shares on offer are expected to be sold
outside Denmark, making the privatisation one of the biggest international
equity issues ever.
The offer will be marketed in five tranches: the Nordic countries - which
will be guaranteed around 20 per cent of the shares - the US, the UK,
continental Europe and the rest of the world.
It will be priced at the end of April and close in early May. The shares are
expected to be listed on the Copenhagen and New York stock exchanges, and
will be quoted through SEAQ International.
Unusually for a telecoms privatisation, all net proceeds will go to the
company, not to the government. Analysts believe the Danish government's
decision to forego a slice of the proceeds is likely to increase the
attraction of the offer, particularly to institutions seeking a medium or
long-term return.
The Danish government will retain a controlling 51 per cent stake in Tele
Danmark, but the company will enjoy operational independence. Mr Hans
Wurzen, chief executive, said privatisation would enable it 'to move away
from political control in the face of competition in an open market in
Europe'.
The initial offering is expected to be in the price range of DKr275-DKr315
per DKr10 share (or Dollars 20.83-Dollars 23.86 per American depositary
share), according to the prospectus.
It is expected that Tele Danmark will become the second largest group by
market value listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, after the A. P. Moller
shipping group's companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg.
Tele Danmark operates one of Europe's cheapest and most advanced telecoms
networks. in Europe. Denmark has about 59 telephone subscribers per 100
people, compared to against about 45 in the UK, and it has the highest
proportion of cellular subscribers of any EU state.
Telecoms privatisations are also likely or possible this year in the
Netherlands, Greece and Italy, with several others expected beyond the EU.
The Greek privatisation is expected to raise about Dollars 1bn, the Dutch
about Dollars 3bn.
The sale of the first tranche of shares in the German operator Deutsche
Telekom, the largest privatisation on the horizon, is not expected until the
end of next year at the earliest.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bavarian bank boosts pre-tax
profits by 33%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, one of Germany's two big
Bavarian-based regional banks, yesterday initiated what promises to be a
strong results season for Germans banks when it reported a 33 per cent rise
in 1993 pre-tax profits to DM1.04bn (Dollars 580m).
The bank released this figure, arrived at after providing for bad and
doubtful debts, after a meeting of the supervisory board. Further details of
Hypo-Bank's and other institutions' 1993 results will emerge in the coming
weeks, with the banks expected to report record profits.
There was no break-down of profits yesterday, but the figures reflect strong
growth in German mortgage business, a Hypo-Bank speciality. For the German
banking sector as a whole, 1993 is likely to prove a strong year, with
robust mainstream commercial activity complemented by buoyant market
conditions which benefited fee-income and own-account trading.
Hypo-Bank is, as expected, paying a 1993 dividend of DM14.50 a share, up
from DM13 in the previous year. It said yesterday that group assets rose by
20.4 per cent to DM266m last year.
At the parent bank, pre-tax profits after provisions rose 25.2 per cent to
DM860m and assets increased by 23.2 per cent to DM189m.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Denmark maps out the route for
telecoms privatisations - Andrew Adonis and Hilary Barnes on Tele Danmark's
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications shares have been outperforming their stock exchanges
worldwide. But Tele Danmark, the Danish state operator whose privatisation
was announced yesterday, is likely to prove particularly attractive to
institutional investors.
It is partly the luck of the draw. Tele Danmark is the first of a string of
EU privatisation candidates. With only the UK and Spain currently boasting
large operators with private shareholdings, investor choice is limited.
State operators in the Netherlands, Greece, Germany and Italy are following
behind, as are numerous operators outside the EU. As the numbers grow, so
will investor discrimination.
Tele Danmark - an operator formed by the merger of five regional telephone
companies - can nonetheless withstand fairly exacting comparisons. It is
near the top of the EU's efficiency league, benefiting from its regional
inheritance.
Although each of the constituent companies had a regional monopoly, they
competed fiercely to demonstrate to the public that they were the best and
the cheapest. With 59 exchange lines per 100 people, Denmark is ahead of the
rest of the EU.
Tele Danmark's cellular mobile networks also have an impressive record. The
company operates two mobile phone systems, the Nordic Mobile Telephone
service, where it has exclusive rights to Danish traffic, and a GSM service,
where it claims a 60 per cent market share in competition with a second
licence holder, Dansk Mobil Telefon.
Denmark boasts nearly 50 cellular subscribers per 1,000 people, against
barely 30 in the UK and fewer still in France and Germany.
Tele Danmark is anxious not to be submerged by larger telecoms operators as
European markets open up, and appears to be succeeding better than many of
the EU's smaller operators. It has helped establish optical fibre links
between Copenhagen and St Petersburg, Copenhagen and Poland and south
through Poland to the Czech border.
It is also developing cellular networks in east Europe, with a 16 per cent
share in mobile phone network under construction in Hungary and Ukraine and
20 per cent in a service in Lithuania.
Tele Danmark reported a turnover in 1993 of DKr16.29bn (Dollars 2.45bn)
compared with DKr15.65bn in 1992, and made a net profit of DKr1.56bn, up
from DKr916m in 1992.
According to the prospectus, about DKr11.4bn of the privatisation proceeds
will be used to settle pension commitments and repay debts to pension funds
and for other expenses.
On the assumption that the issue raises DKr18bn, about DKr6.5bn will be left
to strengthen group equity capital, which was DKr8.7bn at the end of last
year, when total assets were DKr26.1bn.
The success of the sale will have a bearing on others planned. 'This is the
road map for a string of other privatisations,' said Mr Scott Mead, head of
European communications group at Goldman Sachs, one of the global
co-ordinators of the privatisation. 'All the EU's smaller states will be
looking to see how international investors take to it, and what happens to
the company afterwards.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Move to reduce size of UBS board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BK Vision, an investment fund that is the largest shareholder in Union Bank
of Switzerland, is proposing that the bank cut its board membership from 22
to a maximum of nine.
Using a new provision in Swiss company law entitling large shareholders to
put motions to an AGM, BK has asked that a resolution to this effect to be
put to the UBS annual meeting on April 29.
It has also submitted a motion that would require the nomination of each
director of UBS, Europe's largest bank by market capitalisation, to be put
to a separate vote by shareholders.
This is the third issue on which BK, which is controlled by Mr Martin
Ebner's BZ Bank, has tangled with UBS. A year ago, it complained about the
bank's decision to sack Mr Christoph Blocher, a BZ ally, from the board. It
also took the bank to court over the creation of equity capital that could
be used to make acquisitions without prior shareholder approval. A decision
is still pending.
At the end of last year, BK, which promises investors that it will take an
active role as a shareholder, held 9.6 per cent of the total UBS equity,
worth SFr1.8bn, and 17.6 per cent of the registered shares. Mr Kurt
Schiltknecht, a BK director, said the fund, which raised SFr480m (Dollars
324m) in a rights issue in January, had not reduced its UBS stake since
then.
Mr Schiltknecht said it was widely accepted that large boards were
ineffective in representing shareholder interests.
UBS said it would recommend that shareholders reject the BK motions. It
added that as a large and influential institution within the Swiss economy,
it had to have on its board leaders from different regions and sectors, and
they had to represent shareholders, employees and clients.
The bank also pointed out that the executive committee of the board,
comprising eight people, formed the hard decision making body that BK seemed
to be seeking.
Mr Schiltknecht said the best thing the bank could do for the Swiss economy
would be to remain successful. He said the executive committee still had to
refer decisions to the whole board and the political influence there could
often be strong if the decision was a difficult one.
To succeed, the BK motion would require the approval of two thirds of the
shares being voted at the AGM. Shareholders can indicate their wishes on the
normal proxy form.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: UAP up 32% despite steep
domestic slide
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group which is the next
candidate for the French government's privatisation programme, yesterday
reported a 31.8 per cent increase in net profits to FFr1.42bn (Dollars 230m)
in 1993 from FFr1.08bn in the previous year.
The group, which is France's largest insurer and which recently fulfilled a
long-standing ambition to expand into Germany by taking control of Colonia,
said it had benefited from a 'strong improvement' in profits from foreign
activities and increased asset sales. These helped to counter the steep fall
in insurance profits within France and a FFr3.25bn charge for Banque Worms,
its banking unit.
Mr Jacques Friedmann, the financier who last year became chairman of UAP to
orchestrate its privatisation, recently warned that profits would be at the
lower end of expectations for 1993, at about FFr1.5bn.
The profits were slightly below that forecast, given the gravity of Banque
Worms' problems and the continuing pressure on the French insurance sector.
But they are not expected to affect UAP's privatisation prospects.
Mr Friedmann yesterday confirmed that UAP would stage a capital increase as
part of the privatisation. He also announced plans to split UAP's shares
into three. Other privatisation candidates have adopted similar tactics to
make their shares more marketable.
UAP mustered a 12.3 per cent increase in consolidated sales to FFr141.5bn in
1993. Life insurance interests, buoyed by a strong performance from Sun Life
in the UK, saw sales rise 17.7 per cent to FFr74.1bn. The non-life arm
increased 7 per cent to FFr67.4bn.
UAP's French insurance interests suffered a 31.7 per cent fall in net
profits to FFr948m, with profits outside France rising 8.6 per cent to
FFr1.09bn. Banque Worms registered a FFr1.49bn loss, against a FFr1.53bn
deficit in 1992.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Porsche to expand contract
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Porsche is to branch out further from its speciality niche as a luxury
sports carmaker and tap new profit sources by building cars for other
manufacturers, it emerged yesterday.
'Great efforts' are to be made to build small-volume contract manufacturing
operations into 'a strategic business sector', according to a rights issue
prospectus.
Negotiations are under way to add to Porsche's existing manufacturing
contracts with Mercedes-Benz and Audi, the Volkswagen group's quality car
division.
Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche chairman, said recently his new negotiating
partners were 'not necessarily' German.
The contract with the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, under which Porsche makes the
Mercedes 500E series, is due to expire later this year. However, the company
has recently started production of the Audi Avant RS2, a high-performance
estate car.
According to information released ahead of today's opening of the
subscription period for the company's one-for-four rights issue to raise
DM200m (Dollars 118.3m), Porsche expects to build 16,000 of its own cars
this year and 2,000 for third parties. Orders had already been booked for
560 Audi RS2s.
It also emerged that the Porsche and Piech families, which own all Porsche's
voting stock, recently reduced their holdings of preference shares.
Some family members had sold part or all of their non-voting stock to cover
the cost of their entitlement to new ordinary shares, an official said. He
did not know how many of the preference shares - previously estimated at 40
per cent of the 875,000 outstanding - remained in family hands.
Half-year figures showed the company made a DM114m loss in the period to the
end of January, despite a 20 per cent rise in turnover, to DM980m.

A Portuguese company is to invest Es60bn (Dollars 430.7m) to supply cable
television to 2m homes over the next six years, using a fibre-optic network
that will enable the system to evolve into a multimedia information highway.
TV Cabo Portugal (TVCP), wholly owned by two of Portugal's state-owned
telecommunications operators, will choose a company to supply the
infrastructure for the project by April. It is negotiating with Philips of
the Netherlands, Siemens of Germany, Sirti of Italy and Intelcis of Spain.
The contract is estimated to be worth Es20,000 for each home supplied.
The company is also holding talks with 40 programme producers, mainly
European satellite TV companies. TVCP will offer a service of 30 channels
for Es5,000 a month plus an installation charge of Es15,000. Additional
channels will be added on a pay-per-view basis, pending the approval of new
legislation. Broadcasting is due to start in October.
TVCP will act as a holding company for nine regional cable TV operators. It
will own 51 per cent of each company. Municipal authorities and private
investors will subscribe to the rest of the capital through negotiation. The
regional companies are expected to be floated on the stock market after two
years.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Brightstone for market with Pounds 8.8m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brightstone Properties, the property arm of the collapsed London United
Investments is making an uncharacteristic entrance to the listed property
sector, by placing its shares at a substantial discount to net asset value.
The company has been set up to buy Brightstone Estates from the
administrators of Walbrook, an LUI subsidiary, for Pounds 8.15m. It will
have an initial market capitalisation of Pounds 8.75m, compared with a net
asset value of Pounds 10.3m, or 147p per share.
Brightstone has placed 6.9m shares at 125p, and Mr Richard Jacobs, the chief
executive, has subscribed for a further 100,000.
The directors will own 13 per cent of Brightstone, and other backers will
include PDFM, Jupiter Tyndall and Clerical Medical Managed Funds.
Despite the collapse of its parent group, Brightstone remained profitable
throughout the recent property slump and has been managed independently.
Brightstone's net worth grew from Pounds 3.1m in 1982 to Pounds 10.25m, and
its property portfolio is currently yielding 10 per cent against its
December valuation of Pounds 12.9m.
Of the portfolio 69 per cent is in the east Midlands, although Central House
in Croydon is valued at Pounds 3.1m, accounting for 24 per cent of the
portfolio.
Mr Richard Jacobs, chief executive, said Brightstone's properties had
primarily been developed by the group. After suffering from the financial
restraints imposed on its parent company, it plans to resume an active
development programme.
The company is sitting on Pounds 3.7m of cash, which will be partially used
to repay Pounds 1m of a Pounds 5.3m debenture. Pre-tax profit amounted to
Pounds 400,000 in 1993, but property income was double debt repayments. The
shares are being issued on a notional net yield of 3 per cent.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden leaps to Pounds 31m - UK
housing recovery and pension fund windfall build 85% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Wilson Bowden jumped by almost 85 per cent last year to
Pounds 31.2m as the group took advantage of the recovery in the UK housing
market.
The figure included a Pounds 5.5m pension refund.
Without it pre-tax profits still rose by 52 per cent, from Pounds 16.9m to
Pounds 25.7m.
Mr David Wilson, chairman, described this as a magnificent performance given
the patchy nature of the recovery.
The group is proposing a 6.65p (6.2p) final dividend as forecast at its
Pounds 57.2m rights issue in November, giving a total up from 8.7p to 9.3p.
Earnings per share, excluding the pension fund windfall, increased by almost
58 per cent to 22.4p (14.2p). Turnover increased by 45 per cent to Pounds
185.1m (Pounds 127.7m).
After the rights issue, which received 99.1 per cent acceptances, the group
was left with net cash of Pounds 20.7m and shareholders funds of Pounds
232.2m.
Land purchases completed following the year end have left it with net debt
of Pounds 4m. This is expected to rise to about Pounds 20m by the end of
1994 as the group pursues its target of building 3,000 homes a year by the
late 1990s.
Last year it completed 1,860 homes, a rise of 36 per cent. Housing operating
profits increased by 60 per cent to Pounds 22.1m, and the average price of a
home rose from Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 83,900.
The increase was due to a change in sales mix towards more expensive, higher
margin homes rather than an underlying increase in house prices, said Mr
Wilson.
Profits from commercial property sales rose by 36 per cent to Pounds 6m
(Pounds 4.4m). Mr Wilson said reduced demand for small industrial units
meant that sales would become 'more lumpy', but he would be disappointed if
the group did not increase property profits in the current year.
COMMENT
Housing operating margins reached 14.7 per cent in the second half and will
easily top 15 per cent in the current year. The group's strength is its long
land bank with average plot costs of about Pounds 16,000, excluding land
creditors. This compares with an average selling price likely to exceed
Pounds 90,000 this year. Property profits will depend upon the timing of the
sale of a Pounds 17m Leicester leisure development and Pounds 20m
Northampton shopping centre. But they should exceed last year's Pounds 6m,
increasing group pre-tax profits to Pounds 35.5m and putting the company on
a prospective p/e of 21: a must for any housebuilding portfolio.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A continuing high level of demand for its full-time courses enabled EW Fact,
the accountancy and banking tuition group, to show a 57 per cent increase in
1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 862,000, restated for FRS 3, to Pounds
1.35m.
Turnover was 6 per cent higher at Pounds 4.98m (Pounds 4.67m). The pre-tax
