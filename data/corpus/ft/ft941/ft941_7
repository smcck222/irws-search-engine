FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Keller floats with valuation of Pounds 70m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keller, a specialist in ground engineering, will be floated next month
through a placing and intermediaries offer giving it an estimated market
value of Pounds 70m. A former engineering offshoot of GKN, Keller was bought
by its management for Pounds 26m three years ago, backed by funds led by
Candover Investments.
It will use the proceeds to repay debt and finance further overseas
expansion. Projects outside the UK account for more than 80 per cent of
sales.
In spite of recession, Keller has increased operating profits by 46 per cent
since 1991 from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 9.2m on turnover up by 30 per cent to
Pounds 148m.
Most of Keller's sales and profits come from Austria and Germany, where the
company has benefited from infrastructure improvements.
Although established by GKN as a site investigation business in the early
1950s, the group takes its name from Johann Keller, a German specialist
company which it bought in 1974.
In 1984, the group expanded into the US by purchasing Hayward Baker, a
company specialising in grouting - strengthening ground and reducing
waterflows. In January this year Keller paid Dollars 9m for Case
International, a Chicago-based foundation engineer which it said would
complement Hayward Baker and will lift the group's North American sales to
in excess of Dollars 70m.
The float is expected to raise about Pounds 30m of new money and about 75
per cent of the company's equity will end up being held by institutions and
private investors.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Language training fall behind decline at
BPP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BPP, the education and training group, fell yesterday as the
company predicted that this year would not be easy for the group.
BPP reported pre-tax profits for 1993 down from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 6.3m,
in line with the forecast given in a profits warning last November. The
shares closed at 225p, down 20p on the day.
Slightly improved profits in three of the group's divisions were more than
offset by a Pounds 728,000 loss (Pounds 207,000 profit) at Linguarama, the
language training business.
Mr Richard Price, chairman, said the group continued to do well in areas
where exams were being taken, but was under pressure in more discretionary
areas, such as language training. He blamed Linguarama's loss on a worsening
economic climate almost everywhere in continental Europe.
During the year the group withdrew from language training in Japan and
Belgium, taking a loss on the disposal of Pounds 219,000 on top of a Pounds
650,000 provision made in 1992. Turnover in the division fell from Pounds
17.5m to Pounds 15.3m.
New competition held back the performance of BPP Publishing, where trading
profits edged ahead from Pounds 3.29m to Pounds 3.31m on turnover up from
Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 14.9m.
Profits in the professional training division also edged ahead from Pounds
2.47m to Pounds 2.83m on turnover of Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 12.6m).
The main profit generator in the division is accountancy training. Over the
past five years the number of chartered accountancy students has fallen from
about 17,500 to 11,500, but the number of non-chartered accountancy students
is rising steadily.
The academic training division, which has four A-Level centres, boosted
profits from Pounds 306,000 to Pounds 409,000 on turnover down from Pounds
4.36m to Pounds 4.25m.
Earnings per share fell from 14.5p to 13.2p. The group's total turnover
edged ahead from Pounds 48.7m to Pounds 49.8m.
The board is proposing to lift the final dividend is from 5.3p to 5.8p,
taking the total for the year to 8.8p (8p).

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Recession in Europe takes toll on Doeflex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Doeflex, the Surrey-based PVC and thermoplastic sheet
manufacturer, fell by Pounds 287,000 to Pounds 1.22m in the year to
end-December as the recession in continental Europe began to take its toll.
Mr Richard Bickerton, chairman, said that many of the group's UK markets had
demonstrated growth, but the dominant feature had been its exposure to the
first full year of the deep recession in continental Europe.
Turnover grew to Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 26.1m) but at the operating level
profits were down from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 1.98m. Tax took Pounds 296,000
(Pounds 494,000) and earnings per share emerged at 8.83p (12.28p).
The final dividend is again 3p, maintaining the total for the year at 4.6p.
Doeflex also announced the exchange of contracts for the sale and leaseback
of its freehold property on the Hawksworth industrial estate in Swindon,
which houses the main operating facility of its PVC division.
The property, which had a book value of Pounds 2.15m at the year end, has
been sold to Conegate for Pounds 2.25m cash. Subject to completion, Doeflex
will lease the property for 30 years at an initial rent of Pounds 240,000 a
year.
The proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pendragon rises 41% to Pounds 7.4m - New
car market showed recovery while used car prices firmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stronger demand and improved margins helped Pendragon, the luxury and
executive car dealer, report a 41 per cent improvement in 1993.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 7.37m, against Pounds 5.23m last time, on
turnover up 29 per cent to Pounds 276.4m (Pounds 214.6m), including Pounds
5.59m from acquisitions.
Earnings per share emerged at 14.1p (11.8p) out of which an increased final
dividend of 4.8p (4.4p) is being paid, raising the total for the year to
7.2p (6.6p). Despite the increase the shares closed 2p lower at 304p.
Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said: 'New and used car profits,
after-sales contributions and profits from the contract hire business, all
showed improved results in 1993.
Operating profits grew by 31 per cent to Pounds 8.99m (Pounds 6.87m). .
Interest costs were flat at Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.64m).
Buoyed by the general car market recovery, new car gross profits increased
to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 9.1m). Similarly the increased availability of
nearly-new cars enabled the group to sell more used cars at higher margins.
Overall used car gross profits increased by 82 per cent from Pounds 2.3m to
Pounds 4.2m.
Firmer used car prices also helped lift the profitability of Pendragon's
contract hire business, which turned in a 73 per cent gain in profits to
Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.4m).
Meanwhile the contribution from parts, service and body-shop activities  -
the mainstay of profit growth throughout the recession - increased to Pounds
20.4m (Pounds 16.9m.)
The group ended the year with net debt of Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 8.8m)
representing gearing of 16 per cent.
COMMENT
Pendragon has used the proceeds of last year's Pounds 16.6m rights issue
wisely, and now has the largest grouping of executive and luxury car
franchises in the UK. Future growth is likely to come from adding franchises
to existing sites, somewhat greater representation in the volume segment of
the market and an expansion of the contract hire business. Meanwhile the
upturn in the UK luxury market lagged the general upturn so Pendragon should
see further benefits this year. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9.2m are
likely, pro-ducing earnings of 16.8p and a reasonable prospective p/e of
about 18.1.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Arlington Secs falls by Pounds 7.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arlington Securities, the business park subsidiary of British Aerospace,
announced a reduction in pre-tax profit from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 5.1m for
1993, after Pounds 5m of provisions against rental guarantees on property
sales in previous years.
Turnover increased from Pounds 74.5m to Pounds 121.5m, because of land
sales, institutional sales and speculative pre-funds from its eight business
parks.
Arlington let 400,000 sq ft of space (387,000 sq ft), in what was described
as a very difficult market by Mr Patrick Deigman, chief executive.
The annual report was accompanied by a press statement concerning criticisms
that Arlington, which was bought at the peak of the last property cycle, has
been a liability to its parent company. 'British Aerospace's so-called
property 'black hole' owes more to science fiction than to reasoned analysis
of the property market,' it said.
Arlington separated from the remainder of BAe's property interests in
December 1992, with a view to concentrating the management's effort on
business parks and preparing for a possible flotation in a few year's time.
At present, BAe describes Arlington as a core business because of its role
in masterplanning BAe's disused sites.
Arlington said that the clamp-down on out-of-town developments signalled by
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, would enhance the value of its land
bank.
The company has land capable of sustaining 13m sq ft of space with planning
permission, as well as land capable of sustaining a further 8m sq ft of
space that is going through the planning process.
Net current assets increased from Pounds 116.6m to Pounds 168.4m. There is a
dividend of Pounds 3m for BAe.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer, the stores group, has formed its first franchise
operation in Turkey linking with a local petrol and fast foods group.
M&amp;S has announced that Turk Petrol Holding, an oil retailer 42 per cent
owned by Burmah Castrol, had been chosen from some 46 original applications.
The venture will make use of the marketing opportunities provided at TPH's
outlets, although the company stressed the main reason for the link up was
TPH's 'entrepreneurship and progressive management'.
TPH has more than 650 retail filling stations throughout Turkey, 10 per cent
of a market which is growing by 5 per cent a year. TPH is also expanding its
consumer business and is the local franchisee to Wendy Hamburger.
M&amp;S franchise will open one store before the year end, stocking a full range
of clothes and household appliances. The company said it wanted to 'keep
pace with the opportunities'.
Turkey's retail sector is growing rapidly in line with urbanisation, rising
incomes and a new awareness of foreign brands. Carrefour of France opened
its first megastore last November. The French stores, Prisunic and Promodes
of France, are both in negotiations with local partners.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Strong advance for Hibernian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hibernian Group, the Dublin-based insurance and financial services company,
yesterday announced a surge in 1993 pre-tax profits from IPounds 5.66m to
IPounds 47.4m (Pounds 45.7m).
The figure, however, was based on revised accounting policies and included
IPounds 27m from investment profits, compared with previous losses of of
IPounds 11.9m.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 20.27m, a 16 per cent increase over 1992's
Pounds 17.53m.
The group's core general insurance business performed strongly in 1993,
despite an increase in claims related to adverse weather. Profits of the
division rose by IPounds 1.4m to IPounds 16.8m on the back of a 13 per cent
increase in gross written general insurance premiums to Pounds 200.4m.
Hibernian has been expanding into the UK and has 16 offices, which brought
in IPounds 27m of premium income, an 18 per cent increase from 1992. It has
also been building up its life insurance business, which contributed Pounds
3.4m, an increase of 63 per cent, aided by a broader range of products.
Investment profits, including unrealised gains, reflected the performance of
Irish equities and bonds following last year's devaluation of the punt,
which also increased translated profits on overseas holdings.
Mr Cecil Hayes, general manager finance, said the investment performance
under the new accounting policy would be volatile, but it had averaged a
IPounds 3m profit over the past decade.
The company is continuing to expand its life assurance business and broaden
its exposure to the UK.
Earnings per share, pre-investment profits but after tax, amounted to 26.2p
(22.6p). A recommended final dividend of 4.7p makes a 7p (6.2p) total.

FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Xtra-vision petitions for
appointment of examiner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Xtra-vision, the USM-quoted video rental stores operator, has petitioned the
High Court for the appointment of an examiner.
The Ireland-based company said the protection afforded by the examiners
legislation would best facilitate the necessary restructuring and should
enable discussions, which have been taking place with investors, to progress
to a satisfactory conclusion.
The company, whose shares were suspended at 2 1/4 p, came to the USM in
1989. The shares at one point reached 100p.
Over-expansion, an inappropriate depreciation policy and the growing impact
of satellite TV on the market, caused the company to run into financial
difficulties by 1991 with debts of IPounds 18m (Pounds 17m).
Debts have since been reduced to IPounds 11.5m, but it is apparently having
difficulty making repayments under a restructuring agreement with bank
creditors made in August last year, and is facing contingent liabilities of
up to IPounds 500,000 a year in the UK.
Examinership has been sought as a means of maintaining the company as a
viable trading unit.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CrestaCare Pounds 341,000 in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CrestaCare, the nursing home operator, swung from losses of Pounds 1.58m to
pre-tax profits of Pounds 341,000 in 1993 in spite of the upheavals of a new
management team, a withdrawal from property activities, a Pounds 33.3m share
placing and a number of acquisitions. Turnover was Pounds 30.8m, against
Pounds 25.9m.
Mr Andrew Taee, chief executive since March last year, said the group was
now in shape and he predicted that it 'will bloom' in 1994.
A final dividend of 0.5p (0.4p) is proposed to give a total of 0.75p (0.5p).
Profits were hit by a Pounds 2.35m loss on property, including a Pounds
359,000 provision against the sheltered housing side. The property
activities were cut from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 600,000 over the year through
sales and provisions.
The nursing home division increased turnover from Pounds 17.3m to Pounds
23.2m, helped by a 38 per cent increase in bed numbers to 2,142.
The new community care legislation had reduced occupancy rates to 92.2 per
cent, but had since recovered to 93 per cent.
Nursing home operating profits rose from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds 5.12m,
before exceptional charges of Pounds 385,000 covering compensation for the
former chief executive and relocation costs for Mr Taee.
Interest costs were Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 2.88m).
Gearing at the year end was 17.5 per cent, but the group has Pounds 22m of
fixed rate debt paying 9.4 per cent, and cash on deposit earning a lower
return.
Mr Taee said he could spend Pounds 35m taking gearing to about 60 per cent.
Beyond that he aimed to use sale and leaseback deals to fund expansion
rather than go to shareholders.
He said the group was looking at all areas of long-term health care from
chronically sick children to elderly mentally ill.
A Pounds 554,000 tax charge left losses per share of 0.2p (1.9p) and a
retained loss of Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 2m).

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Advance to Pounds 1.2m for Tay Homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tay Homes, the Leeds-based housebuilder, increased pre-tax profits by 18.5
per cent from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 1.22m during the six months to the end
of December.
Turnover fell from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds 26.6m as the number of homes sold
rose by 6 per cent to 434. Earnings per share rose from 3.04p to 3.63p, a 19
per cent increase.
The company which has extended its housebuilding operations to north
Birmingham and north Bristol is increasing the interim dividend from 1.2p to
1.35p.
Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, said Tay had seen a significant improvement in
sales since the new year with unit sales currently 8 per cent ahead of the
corresponding period.
Last November, when announcing a Pounds 10.2m rights issue, Tay said it
intended to increase land purchases to take advantage of the housing market
recovery. Since then it has bought a number of sites enabling it to maintain
its land bank at 4,200 plots. In addition, it has 750 plots for sale in
Scotland. No land sales are proposed this year.
Gearing, which stood at 80 per cent at end-December, has been reduced to 35
per cent following the rights issue.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Argos jumps to Pounds 83m but warns on
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argos, the catalogue retailer, announced a sharp increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 52.9m to Pounds 83.5m for the year to January 1 1994 but warned
that the pick-up in consumer spending could still be damaged by next month's
tax increases.
The 1992 figure was depressed by Pounds 18.9m of losses and closure costs at
the Chesterman furniture chain. Taking account of those, however, underlying
profits increased by 16.3 per cent.
Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, warned, however, that while sales had not so
far been damaged by the threat of tax rises, the group was prepared for a
downturn in April.
'We're planning on the basis that it will happen,' he said. 'So if it
doesn't, that will be a bonus.'
Sales increased by 10.6 per cent to Pounds 1.11bn - although last year's
figures were for a 53-week period, and included Chesterman. Excluding the
furniture chain, sales in the catalogue business were up 12.4 per cent, with
like-for-like sales up 7.3 per cent and new stores adding 5.1 per cent.
Like-for-like growth increased from 5.9 per cent in the first half to 8.1
per cent in the second, and Mr Smith said sales growth had continued at
about 8 per cent since January.
He said part of the reason for the sales improvement was very competitive
pricing, with three-quarters of Argos' lines carried over from its summer to
winter catalogues at the same price or less, stronger price promotions and
an expanded range. Argos increased market share in nearly all product areas,
with furniture, office equipment and gifts the best performers.
The gross margin increased by 0.25 points in the first half, but declined in
the second half, leaving it 0.1 points up.
Mr Smith warned that gross margins would fall as Argos continued to improve
price competitiveness, but the effect on operating margins would be limited
by 'managing' the gross margin - increasing the range of high-margin areas
such as gifts and jewellery - careful cost controls, and continued store
expansion.
The home delivery operation showed a 37 per cent rise in the number of
product lines contributing to a 49 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 37m
Argos plans 30 new stores in 1994, taking the total, after some closures, to
345. The eventual target is 500 to 600 stores.
Earnings increased to 18.6p per share (11.7p) and the proposed final
dividend is 5.65p, lifting the total from 7p to 8p.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rising house sales help lift Avonside to
Pounds 5.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avonside, the building services and housebuilder floated off from Cannon
Street Investments in 1992, increased pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to
Pounds 5.51m in 1993.
The rise followed a drop in first half profits from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds
2.2m. Since then house sales had risen significantly and margins had also
improved, Mr Christopher Glynn, chairman, said yesterday.
Even so margins fell slightly. Profits were helped by a Pounds 203,000
contribution from acquisitions, BS Glazing and Clydesdale Roofing, and a 21
per cent increase in the number of homes sold to 262.
The group operates in Scotland, north England and Wales. Turnover increased
by 29 per cent to Pounds 66.3m (Pounds 51.5m). Mr Glynn said this was a
satisfactory performance in difficult market conditions.
The proposed final dividend, is to be increased to 2.3p making a total for
the year of 4.2p (4p). This is covered by earnings per share of 8.54p
(7.08p).
Mr Glynn said prevailing economic conditions of low inflation, falling
interest rates and a slight improvement in unemployment levels had
encouraged an increase in house sales.
Margins in the building services division, however, had begun to recover
from their recessionary low. The group expected house prices to stabilise in
1994 and for margins and prices in the building services division to
continue to recover.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Putting China top of the agenda - Simon
Holberton reports on ICI's expansion into mainland China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In what used to be a banana grove on the outskirts of Guangzhou (Canton),
the capital of Guangdong province, Imperial Chemical Industries has built a
beachhead for its expansion in China.
On Friday, Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, opened a joint venture factory
which will produce a range of decorative paints and coatings for the
household sector, automotive and packaging industries in China and Hong
Kong.
The 15m litres a year plant - with capacity expandable to 50m litres - will
employ some 160 people, and is cheap in terms of investment. Total cash
expended is just Pounds 8m of a Pounds 15m plant. Swire Pacific, a Hong
Kong-based trading company, and a local Chinese investor are joint owners of
the factory.
However, this investment represents a return to the Chinese mainland for ICI
which, like so many large foreign industrial companies, was forced out of
China in the aftermath of the Communists' assumption of power in 1949.
Sir Denys said that ICI's board had been thinking about China quite a lot
recently. 'As China has become more receptive to inward investment and more
politically stable, we have begun to take it more seriously,' he said.
Mr John Chandler, chairman of ICI China, put the point more forcefully:
'There is not a single business of significance within ICI where China is
not on its agenda.'
The same can be said for many of ICI's competitors in Europe and the US.
They, like ICI, are lured by the attraction of a market for chemicals
growing in line with the rapid expansion of the Chinese economy.
Over the past decade this growth has averaged nearly 10 per cent a year in
real, inflation-adjusted, terms. In Guangdong, southern China's fastest
growing regional economy, growth has been quicker, with total output in 1993
rising by more than 20 per cent in real terms.
On Friday, Sir Denys said that ICI's paints division had often been the
division to lead the company into new markets. This was the case in Taiwan
where ICI has been manufacturing paints since the 1970s.
Over the past five years ICI has invested Pounds 350m in Taiwan. This
culminated two years ago in the opening of a pure terephthalic acid (PTA)
plant.
PTA is an essential ingredient in the manufacture of polyester fibre for the
textiles industry - an industry which is growing rapidly in Taiwan and
China.
ICI China is pursuing opportunities in three main business areas:
Polyurethane. The company currently ships 20,000 tonnes of polyurethane from
factories in the US and the Netherlands. It has established a liaison centre
in Beijing and a technical development centre in Shanghai.
It wants to upgrade the Beijing office to a technical centre and by 1995 to
have opened a 'systems house', where customised polyurethane can be
produced. The latter will cost up to Pounds 10m.
PTA. ICI's Taiwan plant produces 350,000 tonnes of PTA a year. Currently up
to 10 per cent of output is exported to China, but customers on the mainland
want more. ICI's board is considering a proposal to double the capacity of
the Taiwan plant, some of which would go to satisfying demand on the
mainland.
One of ICI's main customers in China is Yizheng Chemical Fibre Company.
Earlier this month ICI paid Dollars 7.7m (Pounds 5.3m) for a 2.5 per cent
share of the company, which is to be listed shortly on the Hong Kong stock
exchange.
Additionally, ICI has licensed its PTA manufacturing process to two mainland
Chinese chemical companies.
Paint. ICI has ambitious plans to invest in paint factories throughout
China. It is currently assessing sites in and around Shanghai, and intends
to invest in plants in Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan and others.
For automotive paints, currently refinish paints, it has about 300 outlets
throughout the country. Last year it established 60 outlets to sell
decorative paint and hopes to have 180 open by the end of 1995.
Mr Barry Matthews, managing director of ICI Swire Paints, said the company
had no ownership of these retail and business outlets, however they tended
to stock only ICI paints. 'It is relatively rare in China to have such a
broad distribution network,' he said.
According to Mr Chandler, one of ICI's biggest challenges will be building
up local management. The company believes that the biggest brake on its
growth in China will be the supply of qualified and trained personnel.
'People are both the problem and an opportunity,' he says. 'In China the
outlook and values are different, and trying to fit them into a western
company is very difficult.'
An added pressure is that with mainland management resources so scarce, ICI
has been forced to take risks with people which it would not normally be
prepared to do.
'We've been forced to take expensive decisions about people before we have
really got to know them,' says Mr Chandler.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Greyfriars transformation via buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greyfriars Investment Comp-any will be transformed from a Pounds 2.5m
investment trust to a Pounds 30m financial services business if it gains
approval for a back-door listing by the IAF group.
Greyfriars is acquiring IAF for Pounds 21.7m, through the issue of 65.7m new
shares at 33p. The company will raise a further Pounds 6m through a
placement of 9.8m shares and a rights issue of 8.4m new shares at 33p.
Shareholders are offered one new share for every existing share and/or
warrant.
English Trust, which took effective control of Greyfriars last September,
will see its 31 per cent shareholding substantially diluted. It said it
viewed the proposals as positive and would retain its stake.
IAF was formed in 1987 as a joint venture between Tiphook, thetransportation
group and Mr David Massie. Tiphook sold out in 1991.
It is forecast to make static profits before tax and exceptional items of
Pounds 2.5m in the year to June 1994. It had net assets of Pounds 3.9m at
December 31. At the 33p placement price Greyfriars will have a
capitalisation of Pounds 30m and its name will be changed to IAF Group.
Mr Massie will become executive chairman.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Strong dollar helps lift Bunzl 38% to
Pounds 56m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong dollar, acquisitions and profits on disposals as well as organic
growth helped Bunzl raise pre-tax profits by 38 per cent, from Pounds 40.4m
to Pounds 55.8m, in 1993.
The shares rose 2p to 183p.
Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said that with 60 per cent of group
sales coming from the US, the 16 per cent rise in the dollar contributed
about 9 1/2 percentage points to the 13.5 per cent rise in sales from
continuing operations to Pounds 1.46bn. Total turnover was 16 per cent up at
Pounds 1.52bn (Pounds 1.31bn).
Operating profits rose 12.5 per cent to Pounds 64m, including Pounds 1m from
acquisitions and an unchanged Pounds 1.4m from discontinued operations. Mr
Habgood said the group suffered from falling prices during the year and a
Pounds 1.5m cost of closing the southern Italy paper distribution business.
Profits on disposals totalled Pounds 1.3m (losses Pounds 5.2m) and interest
charges dropped by Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 9.5m.
A fall in the tax rate helped lift earnings per share from 5.6p to 8.3p.
A final dividend of 2.3p (2.2p) is proposed to give a total of 4.1p (4p). Mr
Habgood said that although small, it was the first increase since the
dividend was cut in 1991.
He said that under FRS 3 accounting the group had paid Pounds 80m in
dividends from no profit over the previous four years. Even now the cover
was only two times.
Operating profits from paper and plastic disposables rose by 28 per cent to
Pounds 40.6m, matching the rise in sales. This division benefited from the
currency gain and the purchase of ACS, though the Grossman acquisition made
a small loss as expected. In dollar terms sales rose 5 per cent although
prices fell 2 per cent.
Fine paper distribution suffered from falling paper prices, especially in
Germany where prices were 16 per cent lower. Profits fell from Pounds 12.9m
to Pounds 6m.
A rebound in profits in building supplies, from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds
4.2m followed cost cutting and a rise in demand. Profits from cigarette
filters rose 10.7 per cent to Pounds 11.4m and made a 34 per cent return on
capital.
Plastic products recorded a 40 per cent jump in profits to Pounds 8.8m with
the main caps and plugs business doing well and in spite of continuing
losses at Stewart, the consumer plastics operation.
COMMENT
The new management at Bunzl has certainly brought a discipline and coherence
to a group which had been one of the worst examples of late 1980s
acquisitiveness. Even so, there is still precious little homogeneity to the
five divisions and a distinct impression that the building supplies side, at
least, could be up for sale once its recovery is nearer completion. If paper
and packaging distribution is to be the core, with cigarette filters a
mature cash cow, Bunzl does not deserve the significant premium to the
market it currently enjoys. With forecasts of about Pounds 66m for the year,
and a higher tax charge slowing earnings growth, the prospective p/e is
about 19 1/2 , a rating which looks further into 1995.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Astec (BSR) doubles to Pounds 14.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Astec (BSR), the Hong Kong-based and London-listed electronics company, 48.9
per cent owned by Emerson Electric of the US, yesterday reported a sharp
increase in pre-tax profits reflecting the benefits of its reorganisation in
recent years.
The group, which claims to be the worlds largest supplier of power
conversion products, reported a near-doubling of pre-tax profits to Pounds
14.9m, against Pounds 7.82m struck after Pounds 5.82m of restructuring costs
offset by Pounds 5.5m of profits on the sale of operations.
Turnover grew by 16 per cent to Pounds 291.4m (Pounds 251m). On a comparable
basis, adjusting for exchange rate movements and discontinued businesses,
turnover increased by 6.6 per cent.
Group operating profits grew by 58 per cent to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 9.61m)
as margins widened from 3.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent.
The core power conversion business reported operating profits of Pounds
13.1m (Pounds 9.15m) on sales up 29 per cent to Pounds 135.6m (Pounds
182.5m).
Adjusting for exchange rate movements, power conversion sales grew by 8.6
per cent compared with world market growth of 6.2 per cent.
After returning to profitability in 1992 the electronic components business
reported increased operating profits of Pounds 2m (Pounds 465,000) on sales
down 18 per cent to Pounds 55.9m (Pounds 68.4m).
Adjusting for discontinued operations and exchange rate movements, sales
decreased by 1.2 per cent.
The group ended the year with Pounds 7.3m of net cash, compared with net
debt of Pounds 11.6m at the end of 1992.
Earnings per share increased to 4.16p (2.15p). An 0.5p final dividend is
recommended making a total of 0.75p (nil).
COMMENT
Astec's senior management, led by Mr George Tamke, chief executive, has made
considerable progress re-focusing the group on its core power supply
business, restructuring the balance sheet and positioning it for growth. The
world power supply market remains highly fragmented, but Astec already ranks
number one and expects to grow bigger, both through organic growth and
acquisition. Economies of scale and tweeking the product mix should enable
the group to keep margins moving ahead. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds
20.5m look possible this year producing earnings of about 5.7p. The shares,
which gained 2p yesterday to 91p, have risen steadily over the past two
years and are now trading on a prospective p/e of 16. They could go higher.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tesco plans Pounds 12m investment in
Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco is to become the first UK food retailer to invest in eastern Europe.
It is negotiating a Pounds 12m investment in Global, a regional food
retailer in Hungary.
It will be Tesco's second move into continental Europe after buying the
Catteau chain in northern France for Pounds 175m last year. The company said
in January that it was looking at new business opportunities both in the UK
and overseas when it announced it was cutting back its UK expansion
programme.
Tesco plans to buy a 45 per cent stake in Global when it raises capital and
floats on the Budapest stock exchange next month, as part of the
government's privatisation programme.
The company said it had been watching eastern Europe for several years and
had chosen Hungary as it 'appears to have developed furthest towards a
market economy'.
Two continental European retailers, Austria's Julius Meinl and Germany's
Tengelmann, already have operations in Hungary, but food retailing is
dominated by small regional chains, many state-owned.
Global made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m on sales of Pounds 25m last year,
from 43 stores totalling 100,000 sq ft.
'This is small beer for us - less than the cost of building one UK
superstore - but it gives us a window on what is going on there,' Tesco
said.

FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Badgerline buys Rider for Pounds 38m -
Takeover creates UK's largest private sector bus and coach operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rapid consolidation of Britain's bus industry moved up a gear yesterday
with a Pounds 38m agreed offer by Badgerline, the Avon-based operator, for
Rider, the leading supplier of bus services in West Yorkshire.
Badgerline, which came to the market in November, said the enlarged group
would be the largest private sector bus and coach operator in the UK.
Last month it agreed to pay Pounds 23m for PMT Group, the
Staffordshire-based coach company.
Rider operates 1,100 buses.
It was the subject of a buy-out from the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport
Executive in 1988. About 90 per cent of Rider's 3,200 employees own shares
in the private company, and their average holding will be worth about Pounds
5,000.
The offer is 16 Badgerline shares for every 5 Rider shares held. Badgerline
shares closed at 118p, down 1p, valuing each Rider share at 377.6p.
Rider shareholders will be entitled to take up to half of their
consideration in cash or loan notes. The offer has been recommended by the
Rider board and holders of a majority of the shares have already agreed to
accept.
Badgerline currently operates 2,800 buses and coaches in the West Midlands,
the Potteries, south Wales and the south of England.
Mr Trevor Smallwood, Badgerline's executive chairman, said: 'The acquisition
of Rider is expected to be significantly earnings enhancing in the next
couple of years as the enlarged group takes advantage of the opportunities
to increase margins.' He added: 'I see this in many ways as a merger of two
of the bus industry's leading operators.'
Rider made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m on turnover of Pounds 83.9m in the
year to March 31 1993.
Net assets at March 31 last year were Pounds 19.8m.
Mr Bill Cottham, Rider's chairman, said: 'For some time we have been
considering how, in the current environment, we might best develop our
business.'
'We have examined a number of options and have concluded that Rider can best
be developed as part of a larger bus grouping.'
Badgerline said this deal would make it bigger than Stagecoach, the
Perth-based group which came to the market last April.
Last week a third bus operator, the Go-Ahead Group, based in Gateshead, said
it planned a flotation this summer with a market capitalisation of more than
Pounds 40m.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Stanhope tries to overturn sale of stake to British Land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle for control of prestigious London office properties intensified
yesterday when Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive of Stanhope, a troubled
property company, launched a legal action to block the sale of 29.9 per cent
of his company to British Land.
Mr Lipton is attempting to overturn a deal struck last month in which
British Land bought into Stanhope with a view to putting pressure on it to
sell its properties at Broadgate and Ludgate. British Land intends to
transfer the stake to the Pounds 500m British Land Quantum Property
Investment Fund, the joint venture formed last June between it and Mr George
Soros, the US investor.
Mr Lipton is challenging the share sale on the grounds that he had
pre-emption rights which gave him first refusal over the block of shares. He
is taking legal action against British Land, Bank of Nova Scotia, which sold
the shares, and Olympia &amp; York (UK), which originally owned the shares.
British Land's proposals have dismayed Stanhope because they would leave its
shareholders without any interest in Broadgate Properties, which consists of
some of London's most prestigious modern buildings.
'British Land's proposal would be very good for British Land,' said Lord
Sharp, Stanhope's chairman. 'There is very little in it for Stanhope's
shareholders.'
Stanhope is hoping to wrest control of the shares away from British Land,
leaving it free to pursue restructuring proposals with other parties.
Stanhope said it had been approached by two other consortia offering more
generous terms.
British Land responded to Stanhope's action by suggesting that Stanhope's
financial difficulties could force it to agree a deal. 'We are quite sure
that the Stanhope banks and other shareholders are awaiting the board's
proposals with bated breath,' said Mr John Weston Smith, a director.
'Litigation is quite a slow process.'
Stanhope, which has a review of its banking facilities at the end of the
year, was hopeful of an early hearing.
The administrators to Olympia &amp; York (UK) said the action was unlikely to
affect plans to wind up the company, which they set in motion yesterday by
serving a petition to put it into liquidation.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Gates and McCaw to launch fleetof satellites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Gates and Mr Craig McCaw, two of America's richest technology
entrepreneurs, set out yesterday on an ambitious space odyssey: the creation
of a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) global satellite communications system by the
year 2001. The two billionaires, each using 'a few million dollars' as seed
capital, aim to launch a fleet of 840 small satellites into orbit about 400
miles above the earth. The system would offer wireless data, video and voice
communications services worldwide.
The plan, however, faces technical and commercial doubts as well as daunting
financial and political hurdles.
Mr Gates, aged 38, is co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's
biggest software company. Mr McCaw, 44, built McCaw Cellular Communications
into the largest US cellular telephone company. It is now being sold to AT&amp;T
for Dollars 12.6bn.
Mr Gates, Mr McCaw and McCaw Cellular each will own 30 per cent of
Teledesic, the new venture. Mr McCaw is chairman, but Mr Gates does not hold
an executive position. Microsoft itself is not involved.
Teledesic revealed its plans yesterday by applying to the Federal
Communications Commission for permission to begin construction of the
satellite system.
Using very high frequency transmissions, the refrigerator-sized satellites
would send and receive digital signals from telephone directory-sized
receivers and small antennas installed in homes and businesses. Each
satellite would, in effect, be a telephone switching system.
The small satellites could be launched in clusters, reducing the cost.
However, low-orbit satellites tend to fall out of their orbits far quicker
than the 22,300-mile-high geostationary satellites now used for telephone
communications. They must therefore be replaced more frequently, adding to
the cost of maintaining the system.
Teledesic has yet to begin raising the Dollars 9bn needed to build the
satellite system. It aims to draw together a broad alliance of
manufacturers, telecommunications companies and governments to back the
massive effort.
Teledesic faces competition from less expensive satellite projects such as
Motorola's Iridium, which will provide mobile communications to car drivers.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Lucas rises to Pounds 20m despite fall in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries, the UK motor and aerospace components group, said that
cost reductions were continuing to rebuild profitability, but warned that
its markets remained weak.
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive, said: 'With aerospace and
defence spending remaining much depressed, it is too early to be optimistic
about any early overall recovery in Lucas markets.'
Lucas's pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 20.1m in the
six months to January 31. Sales fell from Pounds 1.29bn to Pounds 1.19bn.
Sir Anthony said the cost-cutting momentum established last year had
increased. Substantial further progress increased profits by Pounds 29m.
These savings, together with increased sales volumes, more than offset the
adverse effects of stock reduction on output, the lower recovery of
engineering costs from customers and currency translation of foreign
earnings.
Restructuring programmes continued, with costs of Pounds 9.8m charged to the
Pounds 88.4m provision established in 1991-92 and another Pounds 4.9m
against first-half profits. A net 1,000 jobs were lost.
Sales had again outperformed general industry trends. Sir Anthony said:
'Automotive demand in the UK and US is recovering and we sense that the
bottom has been reached in the continental European automotive market.'
Lucas said net borrowings at the half-year were cut from Pounds 479m to
Pounds 360m, gearing of 48 per cent. The reduction was helped by disposals,
last year's enhanced scrip dividend, a sale and leaseback of six US sites
and a better working capital performance.
Automotive operating profit increased from Pounds 13m to Pounds 27m. Strong
sales, up from Pounds 792m to Pounds 830m, reflected continuing success in
the diesel sector.
Aerospace profits increased from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 8.9m, although sales
declined from Pounds 323m to Pounds 252m because of softer defence markets
and reduced production by airframe manufacturers.
Sales by applied technology businesses declined from Pounds 172m to Pounds
107m, due to disposals. Demand remained soft, with particular deterioration
in Japan and Germany. Operating profits fell from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds
800,000.
Earnings per share were 2.2p, against a loss of 0.2p, and the interim
dividend was held at 2.1p.

FT  22 MAR 94 / NatWest in Dollars 500m US bank buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank, the UK's second biggest bank, yesterday announced
that it was buying Citizens First, the New Jersey retail bank, for Dollars
500m (Pounds 340m). The US bank will be merged with NatWest Bancorp, the
bank's existing US retail operations.
The purchase is the most substantial by a UK bank in the US since the losses
endured in the late 1980s, although Royal Bank of Scotland has made smaller
acquisitions for its Citizens Financial Group US subsidiary.
The move strengthens NatWest Bancorp's position in northern and central New
Jersey, particularly in Bergen county which is one of the richest areas in
the US.
NatWest is paying Dollars 9.75 per Citizens First share, which represents
2.47 times estimated book value at the end of last year. The deal will be
funded by cash and an ADR issue in the US. A maximum of 43m NatWest ordinary
shares may be issued - about 2.6 per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital. Citizens First shareholders will be able to choose cash or ADRs.
Mr Derek Wanless, group chief executive, said that the acquisition of
Citizens First, the last independent commercial bank in the northern part of
New Jersey, would move NatWest Bancorp from 17th largest in Bergen county to
second.
The addition of about 250,000 customers to NatWest Bancorp's existing 1m
will give it 10-15 per cent of the local personal banking market. The
fragmented US banking industry is going through a period of consolidation.
Mr Wanless said NatWest expected to make 30-35 per cent cost savings within
24 months, and also expected an enhanced income stream from selling NatWest
products to Citizens First customers. The savings, the affluence of the
customers and the bigger product range had been factored into the financing.
Analysts said that the move was not a great surprise in terms of NatWest's
strategic development in the US, as the bank had signalled that it had not
finished building its US business. The transaction raises NatWest Bancorp
assets to Dollars 26bn.
After the merger NatWest Bancorp will have a branch network of 183 offices
in New Jersey and 127 in surrounding areas.
NatWest Bancorp will earn between dollars 73.2m and dollars 96.1m in the
first quarter, Mr John Tugwell, chief executive said yesterday, Reuter
reports. The first quarter would beat its 1993 fourth quarter core earnings
of dollars 73.2m, but not exceed its net income of dollars 96.1m, which
included tax benefits from accounting change. 'The consumer business is
excellent,' he said, noting the bank is 'seeing nice income' in several
areas, including credit cards, consumer loans, and car finance.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Pension groups put a little aside for the future: Alison
Smith explains the impact on life groups of mis-selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal &amp; General last week became the latest UK life insurer to admit to
making provisions to cover potential compensation to people who suffered
from poor advice to transfer out of an occupational pensions scheme. But,
like several others, it refused to reveal the extent of its provisioning.
There is no reason to expect Prudential - the UK's largest life insurer -
and Sun Alliance, whose annual results are due today and Thursday
respectively, to be more forthcoming.
Some have given a little more away. Refuge Group, the life insurer,
announced this month that it had made provisions totalling Pounds 11.6m  -
leaving 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.3m - for possible compensation in
respect of pension transfer cases. It would not say how many it had sold.
Only National &amp; Provincial, the UK's eighth largest building society (with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 121m), gave an approximate breakdown: Pounds 2m
provisions in respect of its 850 pension transfer cases. Only when both
sides of the equation are offered can any sort of extrapolation be made for
the cost to the whole financial services sector.
If the same level of provisioning was adopted by other insurers, banks and
building societies, the total for the 500,000-plus pension transfers sold
since 1988 would be well over Pounds 1bn.
Mr David Prosser, L&amp;G chief executive, argued that to reveal the figures for
provisioning, or even to give an 'order of magnitude', would be unhelpful
since it would fuel speculation.
There is a risk that refusing to give any indication may lead the market to
think that the position for individual companies is worse than it will turn
out to be. It is true, however, that firm judgments about provisioning and
compensation arrangements must await the work of the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulator.
The SIB's guidance is due to be published in July. But next month it will
tell organisations which are the priority categories - such as people coming
up to retirement or who transferred out of index-linked schemes.
Some important issues bearing on the cost of compensation remain unresolved
 -including the basic question of who should be eligible.
As the life insurance industry never tires of pointing out, even in files
where the information recorded is seriously incomplete, customers could
still have received satisfactory advice and be better off than if they had
stayed in their previous employers' schemes.
In many instances the question will be more complex - where a customer
received advice that was suspect at the time of the decision, but which
seems to have been vindicated because of the buoyancy of the stock market;
or whether a customer should be able to revisit the original decision where
the information was incomplete although the advice seems satisfactory.
Even after the ground-rules for who should be compensated have been set, the
question of how this should be done remains unanswered.
The life industry and its regulators believe that compensation arrangements
should be settled promptly, rather than leave organisations with liabilities
stretching on until their pension transfer customers reach retirement.
The SIB proposals seem likely to offer some variant on giving the victim of
poor advice the choice of either staying in a personal pension - enhanced
with some 'top-up' payment from the life company - or being reinstated in
the scheme of their previous employer.
The costs of reinstatement vary according to the scheme from which the lump
sum was transferred and the performance of the personal pension. But some
idea of possible sums can be drawn from examples given by Mr Mike Wadsworth,
a partner at consulting actuaries, R Watson &amp; Co.
The illustrations cite a 35-year-old man with 30 years to normal retirement
and 10 years' service with his ex-employer, transferring a lump sum of
Pounds 10,000 from a scheme providing 1/60th of pay for each year of
service.
If he had transferred out of the scheme on March 1, 1989, it would cost
almost Pounds 19,600 to reinstate him on March 1, 1994, plus perhaps Pounds
200 in administrative charges levied by the scheme, while the value of his
personal pension would be Pounds 17,400 - a shortfall of Pounds 2,200 plus
charges. If he transferred out of the scheme on March 1 1991, the overall
shortfall would be only Pounds 600.
Although the relationship between individual examples and the cost to
companies is tenuous, the figures suggest the total bill for the sector may
be nearer Pounds 500m than Pounds 1bn.
The co-operation of occupational pension schemes in taking former members
back would be essential.
Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, is on the
committee set up to advise the SIB board. But though the NAPF has discussed
the issue, its members' views differ so sharply that there is no collective
stance. Some, such as the mineworkers' pension scheme, are allowing former
members to return. But others, such as British Steel and Unilever, are not.
In the interests of resolving the matter cleanly, the Treasury is likely to
exert moral pressure on schemes which do not want to reinstate former
members. But what this will mean in practice - like so much else - will not
be clear until after the SIB makes its July report.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Auditors censure Brussels over financial weakness and waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of Auditors of the European Union attacked the European Commission
yesterday for its poor financial management, weakness in tackling fraud and
obstruction of efforts to track down waste.
Mr Andre Middlehoek, president of the Court of Auditors, identified
'numerous administrative and control weaknesses' in Brussels and among
member states in spending on regional aid and farm subsidies.
He told a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels that the Commission
would like to pretend that the problems reported were no more than isolated
'accidents' which the Court had extrapolated in an 'irresponsible' way. 'The
contrary is true,' Mr Middlehoek said.
The Court's report on the 1992 Ecu68bn (Pounds 51bn) EU budget calculated
that some Ecu170m had been wasted in irregular outlays and lost receipts.
But only 7 per cent of the amount deemed recoverable had been clawed back,
Mr Middlehoek said.
The UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are pressing for tougher action
against fraud and tighter controls on spending. Britain will tomorrow
propose that member states make fraud against the EU budget punishable in
the same terms as fraud against a national budget.
The Commission will respond this week with measures to combat fraud,
including a blacklist of companies and individuals found violating EU rules.
Mr Peter Schmidhuber, the EU budget commissioner, will also press for extra
staff and closer co-operation with national police and customs forces. The
Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors has assumed a higher profile following
the Maastricht treaty, which urges EU institutions to co-operate more
closely to save money and stop waste.
Mr Middlehoek criticised the practice which gives the Commission a right of
reply to comments in the Court's annual report. It was disturbing that the
Commission 'seems to consider that it should always have the last word, even
with regard to those conclusions of the Court which can only be finalised in
the light of the Commission's replies to the Court's comments'.
He added that the Court's staff had difficulty verifying the Commission's
internal audit because of 'restrictions placed by certain services of the
Commission', including access to the main computer system.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Britain and Spain face pressure on EU voting: Paris and Bonn
push for quick solution to crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France and Germany will exert heavy pressure on Britain and Spain today to
try to resolve the crisis over voting rights in an enlarged European Union.
Neither London nor Madrid appeared ready last night to soften their position
at today's meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels. The issue may force the
EU to delay a decision on new voting arrangements, jeopardising an already
tight timetable for the entry of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway into
the Union by January 1, 1995.
The European Parliament further damped hopes of a solution being reached
today. The largest group in the Strasbourg assembly, the Socialists,
rejected the compromise being offered to Britain and Spain.
Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the Socialist MEPs, said: 'What is at stake is
the whole concept of a future Europe.'
The European Parliament has to approve the accession treaty by May 4 to make
it possible for the four newcomers to enter by January. But the Strasbourg
assembly has said it will withhold assent if Britain and Spain win their
demands to retain the 'blocking minority' at 23 votes in the Council of
Ministers, allowing one small and two large member states to obstruct
decisions.
London and Madrid's 10 partners insist that the blocking threshold should
rise to 27, since the weighted votes in Council will rise from 76 to 90. But
as a compromise, they are prepared to offer a two-month delay on decisions
which are opposed by 23 votes, to try to get consensus.
Mr Cot said yesterday: 'There is no chance of having any sort of mixed
solution go through (the European) Parliament, such as a two-month
cooling-off period, which would only exacerbate delays in decision-making.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, repeated that Britain was determined to
keep the weight of voting power with the larger EU states. 'The situation
now, where two large and one small country can block a decision, is
perfectly satisfactory,' he said in Brussels. 'I am not prepared to see a
situation develop where a collection of small states can vote down a
collection of bigger ones.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was more conciliatory, but indicated
that it was unlikely that a solution could be reached today. The Union had
to find a way through the voting impasse, he said, during a visit to Dublin.
'We may not do so in Brussels tomorrow (Tuesday), but we will persevere
until we do.'
In Paris, the French foreign ministry, quoted by Reuter, said France and
Germany would still press for a solution at today's meeting:. 'There are
ways to take account of some countries' concerns.'
Mr Clarke said it was wrong to assume that enlargement automatically meant
changes to make decision-making easier at the expense of the minority.
But an EU diplomat said all 12 member states, including Britain, had agreed
at the EU summit in Lisbon in June 1992 that the admission of the four
Nordic and Alpine countries would require a 'mechanical' adjustment in
voting weights.
A senior Brussels diplomat played down speculation about a special summit to
break the impasse.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Germany's opposition moves to allay fears on tax plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democrats were attempting to save themselves
from an electoral own-goal last night after stirring public fears with a
commitment to raising taxes on higher-income earners.
The party leadership, surprised by a setback in local elections at the
weekend, claimed that government ministers and their supporters in the
German press were deliberately distorting the tax plan to suggest that it
would affect a majority of taxpayers.
The emergence of concerns in the Social Democratic party (SPD) comes only a
week after it emerged as clear victor in the first of Germany's 19 state and
national polls, and a few days after it confidently announced a draft
election platform.
The proposal to impose a 10 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' only on the
better-paid, instead of the present plan for 7.5 per cent from all income
taxpayers from next January 1, has aroused criticism from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's government and from many SPD supporters.
Banner headlines in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper denounced the 'tax
hammer' of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader. It said income earners on a
gross salary of DM3,846 (Pounds 1,526) a month would be affected - more than
half of all taxpayers in the country.
Chancellor Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is lagging
far behind the SPD in the opinion polls with seven months before the general
election, seized on the tax plan with undisguised glee. Mr Peter Hintze, the
CDU general secretary, said Mr Scharping was 'demolishing his own election
chances'.
Some commentators suggested that the drop in SPD support in the local
elections in northern Schleswig-Holstein at the weekend - where its vote
dropped from 42.9 per cent (in 1990) to 39.5 - was partly due to the tax
furore. The CDU also lost support, down from 41.3 to 37.5 per cent.
Last night the SPD leadership insisted that its opponents were deliberately
misinterpreting its tax plans, which it said would add no more than DM23 a
month to the tax bills of the top 17 per cent of taxpayers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no shortage of excuses for the sharp fall in the Hang Seng index
which has left it nearly 30 per cent below its peak. US interest rates have
turned up. There are growing worries about the Chinese economy over-heating,
not to mention the impact on the territory's trade if the US refuses to
renew China's most-favoured-nation status. Even taken together, though,
these factors do not seem to warrant such a steep fall in equities. The real
cause has been withdrawal of liquidity by US hedge funds and other
speculative international investors. The question is whether the decline has
now gone on far enough to attract long-term buyers again.
Yesterday's pick up in volume suggests this point might be close. So far,
the results season has lived up to expectations or even, as yesterday with
TVB and CITIC, exceeded them. The consensus puts the market on a prospective
p/e of between 12 and 13, which is hardly expensive.
Admittedly a further rise in US interest rates would damage confidence in
the property market, which must be close to its top. But it would also be
easy to over-estimate the impact of higher rates on corporate earnings even
if they were passed on to the local market. Hong Kong would probably
continue to enjoy negative real interest rates, while the corporate sector
itself is under-geared. If one believes the US needs China's support in
curbing North Korea's nuclear aspirations, the MFN threat may even recede.
That would leave trading companies looking particularly good value for
anyone with the courage to climb back on board.

consumer goods more cheaply than the competition. On the evidence of
yesterday's figures, the formula is far from running out of steam.
Second-half sales growth from existing stores of 8 per cent is especially
impressive, although that rate of improvement will be difficult to sustain
whether or not next month's tax increases dampen consumer spending. While
its new stores are performing well, Argos stands out as a retailer
delivering decent sales growth without surrendering much by way of margin.
The nagging worry is that margins might have to be sacrificed in order to
remain the cheapest retailer in town. So far any such price initiatives have
come from the company itself, and compensating efficiencies have been found.
Limited price wars have been dealt with by surrendering market share, as was
the case last year in DIY. The wider danger is that Argos will find its cost
advantage gradually eroded by specialist retailers with greater purchasing
muscle in each of its product areas.
That is all the more reason for Argos to sow the seeds of diversification.
With average cash balances running at over Pounds 100m, it has no shortage
of resources. The costly flop that was Chesterman should not argue against
other, better-timed initiatives. While the cash pile is not yet large enough
to demand immediate action, a sensible move to spread its bets cannot come
soon enough.

FT  22 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are echoes of old follies in National Westminster's decision to spend
Dollars 500m on Citizens First Bancorp. At nearly 2.5 times net assets, the
price looks high. If NatWest itself were trading on the same multiple of
book, its price would be nearer 800p than 472p. It thus looks vulnerable to
the accusation of paying through the nose to build up its US business. But
that does not necessarily warrant yesterday's 3 per cent slide in its share
price.
In the group context this is a small deal which will add only around 1 per
cent to total assets. Citizens will enhance NatWest Bancorp's distribution
network and bring useful efficiency gains. Because of that it may have been
worth paying a little over the odds. Still NatWest is buying when US bank
earnings are at a cyclical high. The acquisitions trail would have been
cheaper a couple of years ago, although it was then still wrestling with its
own problems in the US.
Nor is the strategic relevance clear. The wholesale business of NatWest
Markets requires a US presence but retail banking need not be global. The
diversification argument has lost credibility given the simultaneous impact
of the recession on both sides of the Atlantic. The justification must be
that NatWest can see a high return in the US. That may be possible at the
moment, but relative returns may look less favourable once UK provisions are
back to normal. NatWest Bancorp will then have to sweat harder given the
price paid for Citizens.

FT  22 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Bright spark at Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Progress is being made restructuring Lucas Industries, but there is still a
sense that the company is waiting for Godot. Mr George Simpson is due to
take over as Lucas's chief executive at the end of the month. Until he has
had a chance to walk around, kick the tyres, and decide how much more time
is needed in the body shop, it is difficult to see whether the company will
prove an economical little runner.
Like several other component manufacturers, however, Lucas is already
insisting that it can earn margins of 10 per cent. That sounds fanciful when
margins were only 9 per cent even at the height of the boom in 1989. But
quantum jumps in productivity from new manufacturing plant, rationalisation
benefits, and the disposal of low margin contracts, will all help meet the
boast. Mr Simpson may well drag some reluctant sacred cows to the block.
Cuts in working capital - principally stocks  - could also reduce borrowings
substantially.
If the management performs, thoughts will turn to growth prospects.
Expanding the braking business is an obvious possibility, though persuading
another British manufacturer to sell may be more difficult. Still,
double-digit margins, growth and lower interest costs by 1996-97 implies
profits of over Pounds 250m. Heady stuff, since even the famously naked
dividend would then be covered three times. Unfortunately, the market
already seems to know that, and the company is trading at 10 times the most
optimistic earnings estimates three years out. Mr Simpson will be hard
pressed to make the shares perform from here.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Leading Article: The Korean conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International frustration is understandably growing at North Korea's refusal
to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities. With today's expected
referral of the issue by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the UN
Security Council, the frustration appears to be approaching the point of
western action against Pyongyang.
But in contemplating action - whether economic sanctions or something more
direct - the US and its allies need to tread with the utmost caution. The
latest threats from Pyongyang to turn the South Korean capital into a 'sea
of fire' attest that they are dealing with an adversary of uncertain
motivation and highly unpredictable reactions. Moreover, they have precious
few options that seem likely to influence its behaviour in the way they
wish.
Part of the problem is that nobody outside has the faintest idea what is
really going on in North Korea. While some western intelligence agencies
claim that Pyongyang has a well-advanced programme to develop, deploy or
sell nuclear weapons, other sources say the North Koreans are engaged in a
giant game of bluff with the aim of securing US diplomatic recognition and
forestalling a German-style absorption of their country by the South.
Unconfirmed rumours abound of power struggles and of the imminent demise of
ruler Kim Il-Sung. More solid evidence exists of severe economic problems in
North Korea, which lend an air of desperation to the regime's behaviour.
If not even North Korea's compatriots in Seoul can read its motives and
likely responses, how can the west hope to frame a well-judged policy to
contain its destabilising potential?
Trade sanctions
In the circumstances, there is bound to be a temptation to ratchet up the
pressure through trade sanctions. There are a number of difficulties with
this course, however. First, it is far from certain that such a measure
would pass the UN Security Council. A sanctions resolution would very
probably be vetoed by China, still at least a nominal ally to Pyongyang.
Second, it is not clear what sanctions would achieve, beyond driving the Kim
Il-Sung regime deeper into its laager. North Korea is already an
international pariah; even if China co-operated with attempts to isolate it
further, an embargo would leak to an extent that would enable Pyongyang to
defy it for a considerable time.
At worst, sanctions could provide North Korea - as it has frequently warned
 -with a casus belli. Although some members of the Pyongyang regime might
welcome such a confrontational diversion from their current plight, it is
certain that hardly anyone else, in South Korea, China, Japan or the west,
would relish such a prospect. Whatever the justified alarm about the
implications of North Korea's alleged nuclear programme - in sparking a new
arms race in Asia or setting back the international fight against nuclear
proliferation - the west is in no mood to form a Gulf war-style military
coalition to destroy it.
Close neighbour
Where does that leave the many countries in Asia and beyond that are anxious
to neutralise the North Korean threat? Their least undesirable option is
enlisting Chinese assistance in defusing the crisis. China, as a 'friend'
and major trading partner, is the only power that has a chance of bringing
Pyongyang to heel. In theory, as a close neighbour, it should have every
interest in co-operating to foster peace and stability in the Korean
peninsula. Instability could disrupt its march towards market-driven
prosperity; hostilities, as happened four decades ago, might well force it
to side with a regime from which it has done much to distance itself in
recent years.
The trouble is that the US - currently at loggerheads with Beijing on trade
and human rights - is not best placed to seek Chinese co-operation on this
issue. China, while making co-operative noises, has shown little public sign
of putting pressure on Pyongyang, instead repeatedly counselling the west to
show 'patience'.
Unfortunately, Beijing may be right. Without active Chinese assistance, the
west - forced to sit tight until the Pyongyang regime collapses under the
weight of its contradictions - may find patience is its only option.

Raised eyebrows at Downing Street yesterday. Journalists covering John

But, as Paisley knows, appearances can be deceptive; the carpet was actually

After a meeting-turned-slanging match, Paisley was escorted out of a side

Doesn't the juxtaposition of Michael Heseltine, Kenneth Clarke and John

Disquieting news for those who made the supreme sacrifice by boycotting
South African wine during the long hard years of apartheid. Their pain was

reasonably priced substitute, they were in fact quite likely to have been
drinking Stellenbosch's finest.
South African wine producers proved themselves a cunning adversary; they
successfully marketed their product in Europe and elsewhere through obliging
Bulgarian middlemen. Cheers: or Totsiens, as they say in Afrikaans.

Whatever prompted Theo Waigel to stop by yesterday's meeting of European
Union finance ministers? The German finance minister graces such gatherings
but rarely - and then generally only in times of crisis - to the extent that
peers have taken his absences as a calculated snub to the European cause.
So why should the garrulous Bavarian have changed his ways? Could it just be
that his thoughts have turned to the early summer nomination of his
country's two new European commissioners? Waigel will have none of it - 'it
is all very flattering but there is no question (of my candidacy),' he made
out yesterday.
Still, the attractions of a perk-filled five-year spell in Brussels cannot
have escaped Waigel as he labours to contain the costs of unification, and
attempts to put behind him his failure to secure the Bavarian premiership.
Indeed, in the run-up to the general election, a certain cageyness would be
understandable. His predicament is nothing compared with that of chancellor
Kohl, who has to choose his commissioners some four months before he knows
whether he has a mandate to govern the country beyond October.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edward de Bono, the skilled self-publicist who has made himself a name for
thinking laterally, believes the time has come for a fresh approach to the
world's economic problems. Ten out of ten so far.
As well as writing in yesterday's FT on the need for a bit of imagination in
tackling employment issues, he's crafted a think-tank paper for the Centre
for the Study of Financial Innovation. In the latter, he proposes inventing
something called 'target currencies', with companies like IBM creating their
own economies by issuing their own currency.
De Bono says the idea could be extended to cover sectors; people would be
paid in 'housing currency' or 'luxury goods currency' or 'supermarket
currency'.
He believes this would enable governments to manage the overall economy much
more selectively - particular sectors could be stimulated without triggering
all-round inflation. A secondary market would enable people to trade between
different types of currency. 'It would be like the human body with membranes
separating the various currencies.'
He points to examples already existing in prototype: the US Food Stamp
programme and Singapore's Central Provident Fund, which holds a portion of
people's salary but allows them to borrow against it or invest it.
Oh, of course; socialism with a human face.

FT  22 MAR 94 / A push and they'll all fall down: Allegations of a plot
against Yeltsin have shaken a government facing economic crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, yesterday broke off a
scheduled meeting with Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the
International Monetary Fund, and flew to Socchi on the Black Sea, where
President Boris Yeltsin is reported to be recovering from a bout of flu. 'I
have some things to discuss with the president,' he said as he took off.
The things he has to discuss with the president centre around a fully
fledged allegation of a coup against him, prepared and circulated in the
press and political circles over the weekend, probably by Mr Yeltsin's
opponents in parliament. The rumoured attempt to overthrow the government
resulted in ministers being questioned by the security services - as well as
Mr Chernomyrdin's trip. The status of the coup is not yet clear - is it a
provocation, a real plot which was aborted, or a real plot which is still in
motion? The certainty is that it has convulsed a government already
shivering before the prospect of an economic blizzard.
For the Chernomyrdin government has inherited an infrastructure from the
communist period which is ill-equipped to translate the rigours of economic
reform into even a semblance of prosperity. It struggles against the wave of
corruption and crime which the reforms have encouraged (though certainly not
created) and with which the state cannot properly cope; it has lost a
parliamentary and probably also a popular constituency for radical reform
and thus must enact change, if it will do it at all, against the will of the
people; and it must struggle against high inflation which decimates its
income and makes those who demand extra money even more desperate.
This is the economic climate with which the government must struggle and in
which it is trying to persuade the IMF to release a further Dollars 1.5bn
loan: Production across all sectors fell an average of almost 24 per cent
last month compared with February last year. Mr Chernomyrdin, addressing the
lower house last week, said that thousands of enterprises had stopped work
and thousands more were working part-time. The crisis, he said, was made up
of their inability to sell their stock, compounded by a debt crisis which
means that companies owe a total of Rbs25,000bn and are owed Rbs32,000bn.
The production of oil, Russia's most precious commodity because it is by far
its most tradeable, continues to fall rapidly - down more than 14 per cent
in the first two months of this year over the same period of 1993. At this
rate, it will not be long before the predictions made and widely derided two
years ago - that Russia will be an oil importer before the end of the decade
 -will come true.
The budget for 1994, not yet debated by parliament though it is nearly at
the end of the first quarter of the year, is less of a financial document,
more of a field of struggle. Its headline figures - expenditure of
Rbs183,000bn and income of Rbs120,000bn, with a resulting deficit of some 9
per cent of gross national product - do not indicate the virtual
impossibility of either the income being collected or the expenditure being
kept to that level. The fall-off in government income, because of the
effects of very high inflation on tax revenue, coupled with declining
profits and the huge pressure on expenditure from practically bankrupt
enterprises, from the energy producers, from the military and from
agriculture mean that the real deficit could be twice, three times or even
more than that advertised.
There are two brighter spots. Privatisation, as Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy
premier for privatisation, told the lower house yesterday, is rolling along
 -with nearly 80 per cent of small enterprises now auctioned off, and up to
14,000 medium and large concerns also through the auction process. In
addition, two huge and profitable giants - the Gasprom production and
distribution monopoly and the Norilsk Nickel plant are about to come under
the hammer. However, the financial condition of the privatised enterprises
is generally no better than that of their state counterparts (sometimes
worse), and the sell-offs have been attended by corruption in some 30 per
cent of the cases (according to those who have seen security service
estimates).
The other bright spot is inflation. It was down to 10 per cent a month in
February and - according to Mr Chernomyrdin - is likely to stay at that
level this month. The government has claimed it is following a tight budget
policy this year, but for the moment inflation is still a result of
decisions made in the last quarter of 1993 rather than a reflection of
virtue in the New Year.
As disheartening as any other fact for Russian ministers is the obvious
truth that, after more than two years of official reformism, there is little
to show in the way of domestic success or foreign confidence. No western
companies of size have made very large commitments to Russia. Trade has
shrunk to levels where most countries can discount it as negligible; foreign
bankers do not believe that Russia will pay back any real debt in the next
five years; and the rouble is driving steadily down to the 2,000 to the
dollar level.
The excited buzzing about investment possibilities which surrounds the names
of China, India and even Vietnam is largely absent in discussion of Russia.
At best, business people will tap the side of their noses and say: 'There's
a lot of money to be made in Russia - if you know how to bend/make/ignore
the rules.' But long-term business commitment comes not from knowing how to
circumvent, but how to observe, the rules.
The conjunction of dire circumstances makes an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund for the payment of the next tranche of the
'systemic transformation facility' loan - the second instalment of a special
Dollars 3bn fund designed to speed the transition from communism to
capitalism - more than usually important, if Russia is to retain a reform
momentum.
The loan is needed both to cover immediate hard currency expenses, such as
debt servicing, but more particularly to increase waning confidence and to
retain some momentum to the west's involvement in Russian reform, reaffirmed
at two Group of Seven summits and likely to be at or near the top of the
agenda at the G7 summit in Naples in July.
The west's involvement, now under increasing criticism in Russia and in the
west itself, has, say critics, produced nothing but rhetoric by western
politicians, often self-serving. The IMF and the World Bank, the two main
lending agencies, say that this is at best a half-truth. They have been
hampered, continually, by their inability to find partners in Russia to whom
to lend.
The World Bank, for example, which takes its lead from the IMF, has been
trying for months to make large loans to cover the cost of a social security
network, and to assist agricultural reform. The first of these has been
refused by the Russians because ministers do not want to pile up more debt
and do not believe that the local uthorities, to whom the money would be
passed, would pay it back. In the second case, the various actors in the
agriculture sector - the Moscow ministry and committees, the regional and
local authorities, the state and collective farm managers - cannot agree on
what a loan would be used for. The result is that, in two of the most vital
sectors for reform, little is being done except local pilot projects.
Nothing that the government can now do would improve matters in the short
term. When it does act - as it did last week when it introduced higher
customs duties on a range of imported goods - it stirs up more opposition
from the public (who, in the large cities, have become increasingly
accustomed to buying imported food and other commodities), and protects
industries which often (not always) appear indifferent to becoming
competitive in world markets.
This is the geology, the sub-structure, of the turmoil we now see. A
shrinking wealth, a government which struggles to find its bearings, an
advanced world which cannot agree on a convincing way to assist: these are
the elements which are producing an ever-deepening political crisis.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Challenge of trade deficits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is living beyond its means. That is the conclusion which will be
drawn from statistics for the country's trade with the world outside the
European Union, published yesterday. Some will go on to argue that the UK
recovery is doomed to drown in a sea of current account deficits. How
plausible is that view and what might it mean for policy?
As a share of gross domestic product, the UK's measured current account
deficit never fell below 1 per cent of gross domestic product during the
recession. On average, independent forecasters predict that it will run at
about 1 1/2 per cent of GDP during 1994 and 1995. But there are far more
pessimistic views. Bill Martin of UBS global research argues, for example,
that the current account deficit will rise from 2.2 per cent in 1994 to 3.3
per cent in 1995.
This forecast, bad enough on its own, is part of a grim view of economic
prospects, which rests on two main points: first, that the growth of
domestic demand will remain strong, notwithstanding the tax increases due in
1994 and 1995; and, second, that the supply capacity of the economy is
inadequate, despite high unemployment. The UBS team forecasts inflation
peaking at 7-8 per cent during the latter years of this parliament, with
base rates reaching a floor around 5 per cent this year, before moving
towards double digits, if not beyond. Such views have to be taken seriously,
in the light of experience and particularly when a more complacent view of
economic prospects is held by most forecasters, including the Treasury.
Unfavourable trends
The current account deficit shows that there is already an excess of
aggregate demand over aggregate supply, despite unemployment at just under
10 per cent of the labour force. Moreover, trends seem unfavourable. In
December to February, for example, the volume of UK exports (excluding oil
and the erratic items) to the world outside the European Union rose 2 per
cent by comparison with the previous three months, while the volume of the
equivalent imports rose by 3 1/2 per cent. More encouragingly, the value of
these exports rose by 18 per cent over the past year, while the value of
imports rose by only 9 per cent. But this reflects a sharp rise in export
unit values, which must threaten the future growth of export volumes.
If domestic demand were to expand at a brisk pace, there could well be
inflationary pressure in sectors producing non-tradable goods and services,
while the trade deficit would also rise. If foreigners were to prove
unwilling to channel funds to the UK or UK residents prove unwilling to
repatriate wealth held abroad in the requisite amounts, either the exchange
rate would fall, or the interest rate rise, or both. So a trend
deterioration in the external balance would impose a constraint on economic
growth by threatening higher inflation.
Gloomy scenario
The nature of that inflation needs to be understood. If the devaluation
since September 1992 does prove insufficient to generate a financeable
current account at existing interest rates, as economic demand expands, the
implication is that the UK's real exchange rate remains overvalued.
The implication of the gloomy scenario is not that growth need stop. It is
rather that the UK might find itself in the middle of another real
depreciation of the exchange rate. Such a devaluation could be achieved
either over a long period, during which wages rise by less than
productivity, or by a nominal devaluation of the currency. The former would
be consistent with continued low inflation; but the latter would threaten a
period of higher inflation.
What might this possibility mean for policy? First, the relevant measure of
inflation for the UK is that for domestic costs, principally labour costs.
Second, the government must prevent the growth of nominal demand from
surging as it did in the second half of the 1980s. Third and most important,
a policy of high interest rates and a high exchange rate may be an
unsustainable way of controlling inflation, because of its adverse long-term
effects on the supply of tradable goods and services. The fiscal alternative
is being used this year and next. Higher taxes may have to be used again, in
the still further future.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Avoidably detained: Edward Mortimer argues that the UK is
treating asylum seekers as if they are the guilty ones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the outskirts of Oxford, close to Kidlington airport, an unobtrusive sign
points down a suburban side road to 'Campsfield House'. The road leads to a
group of red brick buildings surrounded by a 20-foot high perimeter fence.
Beyond that fence, 200 people are living in a world that is part Franz Kafka
and part George Orwell. In the custody of private security company Group 4,
supervised by Home Office immigration officers, they are known as 'clients'
but are in fact prisoners, tormented by a continuous stream of Tannoy
announcements, starting with a demonstration of the fire alarm at 6am. They
do not understand why they are there, and they do not know when they will
get out.
Most have not been charged with, let alone convicted of, any crime. They are
foreigners whose right to remain in the country is being investigated by the
Home Office, or whose deportation orders are being reviewed by the courts.
The great majority have applied for political asylum. Most have been there
for two or three months, but some claim to have been in detention for more
than a year.
Last July there were 317 such asylum seekers in detention in the UK. Apart
from short-term facilities at airports and police stations, the largest
numbers were at Harmondsworth detention centre near Heathrow (which can hold
95) and at Haslar prison, Hampshire, which has 100 places for men. But many
were also held in regular prisons.
It was ostensibly to avoid sending the 'overspill' to ordinary prisons that
the government opened Campsfield last November. The Immigration and Asylum
Appeals Act, which came into force last July, was also intended to reduce
the number of detainees by speeding up the procedure for deciding who stays
and who is deported.
But the effect seems to have been the opposite. The proportion of asylum
applications refused jumped from 14 per cent in the first half of 1993 to 72
per cent in the second half, while the proportion granted 'exceptional leave
to remain' fell from 76 per cent to 22 per cent. (The latter formula is used
when applicants are considered to have a good case in equity, but do not
clearly qualify as refugees under the UK's restrictive interpretation of the
1951 Geneva Convention - for instance, if they have fled from civil war,
rather than from persecution directed at them as individuals.)
Those who are refused leave to remain seem to be detained, pending
deportation, as a matter of course. As a result, the 200 places in
Campsfield were filled straight away, and the total number in detention is
now more than 700.
Eleven days ago, 105 detainees in Campsfield went on hunger strike - not
against the conditions of their detention but against the fact that they are
detained at all. The Home Office reacted by moving nine of them - whose
behaviour is alleged to have been 'disruptive and intimidatory' - to prisons
in Birmingham and near Bicester, Oxfordshire. Yesterday the number of
Campsfield strikers had fallen to 80, according to the Home Office.
Meanwhile, the strike has been joined by 18 detainees at Haslar, 16 at
Harmondsworth and 46 at seven other prisons across the country. This clearly
poses a serious challenge to the whole policy of detaining asylum seekers.
Virtually all the Campsfield detainees claim to have been victims of
repression in their own countries, or have plausible reasons for why they
are afraid to return. Some of their stories are harrowing. A Cameroonian
woman told me both her parents had died after being arrested and tortured
for organising a boycott of French products. She herself had been a member
of their association and had distributed leaflets, but had been able to get
out of the country last September. She had left her two children aged 10 and
three in the care of a friend, but had had no news of them. 'I don't know if
they are alive or not,' she says.
Needless to say, the truth of such stories is not easy to establish. No
doubt some are invented and others exaggerated. It is the job of the Home
Office and the courts to decide in each case. What seems bizarre, however,
is that applicants are in effect treated as guilty until proved innocent.
Mr Charles Wardle, immigration minister, has said that 'if they decide to
leave the country, they are perfectly free to go'. That means, of course,
that they are free to be deported to their countries of origin. But the
asylum seekers contend that they would not be safe in those countries.
Mr Wardle has also explained that 'if they don't comply with restrictions
while they are here, a tiny proportion (of asylum applicants) are detained
while their cases are being considered'. Those I spoke to said they were
quite willing to comply with any restrictions, only no such option had been
offered.
Many of the detainees are genuine political activists: intelligent,
articulate, middle-class people, who have had the courage to stand up for
human rights and democracy against corrupt and dictatorial regimes. Just the
kind of people, in fact, that Britain claims to support. 'Before we came
here,' they said in the statement announcing their hunger strike, 'we knew
that the UK is the leading country in the world in human rights.' Sadly,
they now know better.

FT  22 MAR 94 / The gas-man cometh: Robert Corzine on Qatar's efforts to
shift its fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Friday in Geneva
amid continuing signs that its members lack the political will to make the
deep production cuts needed to drive up oil prices, now lingering near
five-year lows.
There are fears in Opec that its influence on prices might weaken further in
a world where oil supplies from independent producers remain abundant. The
expectation that production quotas may stay at low levels for the next three
years or so has prompted some members to look beyond oil for new sources of
income.
For Qatar, the quintessential small Gulf emirate, oil revenues have allowed
the 150,000-200,000 Qataris to live free from material want and taxes. But a
combination of declining reserves and weak prices has prompted the ruling
al-Thani family to base its international commercial ambitions on the one
resource in which Qatar is a giant - natural gas. The world's largest single
concentration of natural gas, likely to become the fastest growing and most
environmentally acceptable fuel, lies off the coast of Qatar in the North
field.
Qatar is already a privileged society, where petrol costs the equivalent of
just 50p a gallon, less than bottled water, and housing is heavily
subsidised. An army of expatriate workers from India, Pakistan and the
Philippines fill blue-collar and lower-level clerical jobs, leaving most
local males free to fill management positions in the public sector. Women
mainly remain at home.
But this state of affairs is based on dwindling reserves of 3.7bn barrels of
oil, modest by Middle East standards and likely to last for only another
25-30 years. Hence the attempt to shift Qatar's fortunes from oil to gas.
In January these ambitions surfaced in a way which sent shock waves through
the Arab world. Officials confirmed direct talks with Israel about supplying
natural gas in spite of the Arab economic boycott. Syria in particular was
furious that Qatar might undermine the embargo before a comprehensive
settlement was in place. But Qatar has shrugged off the criticism.
Mr Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, Qatar's energy minister, now concedes gas
sales to Israel would depend on a peace settlement between Tel Aviv and its
neighbours. But a feasibility study will go ahead and 'Qatar is ready to
supply gas to anyone' if commercial terms are right, he says. 'We consider
Israel as we would any other potential customer.'
Qatar's commercial drive is fuelled by the North field's 227,000bn cubic
feet of proven reserves, a pool of gas which dwarfs UK reserves of 19,100bn
cubic feet. Experts say Qatar's reserves could last 200 years.
The challenge for the country is to ensure that its two multi-billion-dollar
gas export projects based on North field reserves - known as Qatar Gas and
Ras Laffan Gas - come onstream in the late 1990s. Success in these inaugural
schemes might open the way for further, more lucrative gas projects. But
expanding gas infrastructure established for domestic purposes into one of
the world's biggest exporters is proving difficult.
All large gas export projects are tricky to put together. The capital costs
for liquefied natural gas or pipeline projects run into billions of dollars,
while it can take 25 years or more to recoup the investment and make a
profit. Oil can be sold on well-established markets in London and New York,
but gas producers must first line up buyers willing to enter long-term
contracts and agree a complex pricing formula linked in part to unknown,
future oil prices.
Qatar's task has been complicated by inexperience on international capital
markets. Its location is also problematic - far from the world's main gas
markets but at the heart of potential conflict, sandwiched between Saudi
Arabia and Iran, which has a small portion of the North Field in its
territorial waters.
Yet Qatar is managing to bring its gas export plans to fruition where
similar projects suggested in many countries' in the Middle East, the former
Soviet Union, Africa and Asia remain mere paper planning.
The infrastructure for both Qatar's gas export projects is being built at
the port of Ras Laffan. A visit reveals the scale of the task. Camels graze
on scrub vegetation just yards from the fence enclosing the largest port
construction project under way worldwide. Offshore, the world's
second-largest dredger works alongside the 6km-long main breakwater that
juts into the Gulf to shelter the harbour for liquefied natural gas
carriers.
By the time the port is completed next year, Dollars 750m will have been
spent and Qatar will have established its credibility as a prospective gas
exporter. But that is only the beginning of a stream of financial
commitments and construction milestones which Qatar must meet in coming
years.
The first hurdle is the financing of Qatar Gas, the first of the two
projects. Costing Dollars 4bn, it will supply 4m tonnes of liquefied natural
gas a year to Japan from 1997. Financing of the deal was been split into
chunks to ensure that 'it didn't scare off international markets', according
to one western banker.
Japanese banks and government agencies dominate the financing of the
'downstream' processing and transport portion of Qatar Gas. This includes
Dollars 1.6bn for a liquefaction plant and Dollars 1.8bn for seven liquefied
natural gas carriers.
Within weeks Qatar will choose from among three competing consortia of banks
from the US, Europe and the Gulf to arrange the final tranche of the Dollars
4bn total, amounting to Dollars 650m-Dollars 700m. This will pay for the
offshore platforms and pipelines to produce and bring the gas ashore.
'Qatar's future access to international financial markets is largely
conditional on the success of this financing,' says a western banker. The
financing of a second, larger and more expensive project, Ras Laffan Gas led
by Mobil Oil of the US, will need to follow shortly afterwards if it is to
meet its 1998 start-up date to export up to 9m tonnes of liquefied gas a
year to South Korea and Taiwan.
A third project, Eurogas, to supply gas to Italy has collapsed. Europe
remains a coveted market for Qatar gas, but there are doubts that such a
project will pay until well into the next century.
Not every Opec member has the gas reserves to emulate Qatar. Those states
that do, such as Iran and Nigeria, are keen to initiate projects, while
existing exporters, such as Algeria and Indonesia, are expanding their
activities. But all will remain dependent on oil revenues until well into
the next century.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government tinkering over cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP ROBIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government is tinkering at the edges over its latest proposals to
limit the use of private cars ('Gummer aims to reduce car use', March 16).
Without a clear strategy to find and develop superior public transport
systems as an alternative, car usage will continue to grow.
The aim of the Planning Policy Guidance Note on Transport, to limit the use
of private transport to reduce fuel consumption and harmful emissions, is
laudable, but the proposals have not been thought through. A massive
cultural change would be needed to wean the public away from cars. To have
any hope of achieving this, the alternative system must be exceptionally
efficient, comfortable and secure. This has a price, but so far the
environment secretary has ducked the issue.
His policy does set out some measures to reduce the attractiveness of cars,
including increasing duty on fuel, electronic tolling and congestion
charging in urban areas. But these will only serve to force less well-off
car owners to use public transport rather than choose it as an alternative.
If the government is really committed to reducing car usage, cutting the top
speed limit to 50mph would have an immediate impact. This would at least get
more people travelling on long journeys by rail. Otherwise the government
has got to make a major financial contribution to public transport to prove
it is serious.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Building society boards are fully
accountable to members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G R LISTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Birch's suggestion (Letters, 11 March 1994) that rival financial
institutions be allowed to distribute literature to building society
customers takes the concept of direct mail to new extremes. Such customers
might well feel that the fact that they have a mortgage or savings account
with a particular society should be regarded as confidential information,
and thus unavailable for distribution to any organisation that feels it
would like to know their names and addresses for its own commercial
advantage.
There is, however, a more fundamental point. Mr Birch draws a parallel
between public companies and building societies, but ignores a crucial
difference. Building society customers have paid nothing for their
membership rights. It is not clear, in equity, why those customers that
happen to have such rights at a time when a third party makes a bid for a
building society should be entitled to a windfall gain. The situation in a
public company, owned by individuals or institutions that have put up equity
capital and who face the risk of loss as well as the possibility of profit,
is quite different.
Mr Birch apparently feels that building society boards are not accountable
for their actions. In fact, building societies have no monopoly over the
mortgage and savings markets, as recent trends in market share show. In
today's climate if they do not offer the right product at the right time to
the right customers they rapidly diminish in importance, as customers take
their business elsewhere.
Uniquely among financial institutions, building societies are required by
their legislation to contact their members, and gain their approval, before
moving into new business areas outside of their mainstream mortgage and
savings activity. Moreover, boards face their electorates at the annual
general meeting each year. Over the past few years, members of societies
have been elected as directors without the backing of the existing board
(including a member of Abbey National to its board when it was still a
building society) and this year has once again seen a hotly contested
election at a large society.
Building societies' corporate governance is based on the principle of 'one
person one vote'; votes are not for sale in the market place. Most of the
shares in our large plc financial institutions are owned by other financial
organisations. The question of who is accountable to whom, and how
responsibility for that accountability is discharged within a relatively
small group of organisations, mostly based in the City of London, is perhaps
a more fruitful starting point for any investigation into issues of
corporate governance than the building societies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ANTHONY GRANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Graham Allen MP (Letters, March 18) is absolutely right in calling for
wide-ranging reform of Parliament. The silly confrontational style in the
chamber itself, especially at question time, is now pure pantomime for the
benefit of the media.
This, coupled with the modern MP's desire to join the executive rather than
to scrutinise it, is why Parliament, though much harder working, is much
less effective.
The only useful work is done in select committees, but this has been impeded
by the petulant 'non-co-operation' policy of opposition leader, Mr John
Smith.
However, a start on reform was agreed by all parties in the Jopling report
just prior to the last election. Subsequently, the Labour 'establishment'
has gone cold on this. Despite the wishes of its more sensible backbenchers,
the front bench remains terrorised by a small leftwing clique opposed to any
change.
Labour should put this right before embarking on 'a new constitution for a
new century'.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Time out for reflection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Con-servatives bad-ly need to lose a general election. They are
not at ease with themselves. They are confused, bothered, dispirited,
disillu-sioned. They should be relieved of the burdens of government. This
would give them time to reflect on what they have to offer us. When they
have cleared their heads they might once again be permitted to form an
administration. How long should they be out? If they are fortunate enough to
go in 1996, a return early in the 21st century sounds good.
The latest manifestation of the Tories' doctrinal disarray is the current
argument over the system of voting in the ruling council of the European
Union. As matters stand, Britain can block EU decisions it does not like if
it can form an alliance with, say, Germany and Denmark. The government hopes
to retain this qualified minority veto when the EU is enlarged by the
admission of Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria. The other member states of
the EU, except Spain, want a small increase in the necessary number of
blocking votes. A strong, united Conservative government would be confident
that Britain could as readily find three or four allies out of 15 other
members as it can two out of 11. This Conservative government is not.
What should be a typical Eurodebate, rich in technicalities, ripe for a
compromise resolution, has reached apparent stalemate. Last week Mr Douglas
Hurd tried to prepare his party to accept a trade-off. Tory Eurosceptics,
and some others, are saying that they will do no such thing. The foreign
secretary argued that enlargement of the EU was a Conservative prize worth
negotiating for. The Europhobes, who have an apparent armlock on the prime
minister, will only countenance a settlement on their terms. Mr Hurd appears
to be trapped.
It could be different in opposition. The party would be as divided as ever
about Britain's place in the evolving European community, but it would have
space in which to settle its arguments. There would be no need to take
decisions on the run. The Conservative coalition could reassemble itself,
with an eye to an audience wider than that constituted by its own depleted
ranks. Liberal nationalists could argue their case, as Mr Michael Portillo,
Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Michael Howard now do in veiled terms from their
ministerial chairs. Christian Democrats and Europeans un-der the skin -
like, say, Mr Kenneth Clarke  - might enjoy the unchallenged ascendancy that
should come naturally in a popular Conservative party.
Moderate conservatives who have the capacity to reflect on such matters are
to be found inside the government, but many of them are out of sight. One,
Mr Stephen Dorrell, emerged from cover earlier this year. In an address to
student Tory reformers at Downing College, Cambridge, the financial
secretary to the treasury rejected both minimalist government and the
'exaggerated histrionics of flag-waving nationalists'. Love of country, he
said 'does not imply hostility to foreigners'. He did not mention Mr
Portillo, nor did he need to. Mr Dorrell projects the kind of decency that
has won Mr Tony Blair of the Labour party much applause, although neither of
them will thank me for saying so. For example, speaking of family
responsibility the financial secretary said that 'in this respect western
culture needs to relearn forgotten lessons from some members of its own
ethnic minority communities'. Plenty to chew on there.
There is more food for thought in a new pamphlet by Mr David Hunt, published
yesterday by the Conservative Political Centre. This should be read. The
employment secretary, a known Tory Christian Democrat who grovelled to the
Eurosceptics at last year's party conference, confronts the
liberal-nationalist wing of his party head-on. 'That is what troubles me
with the obsessive individualism of liberals: its potential drift into
insularity,' he says. He goes further. 'Tories have always re-garded human
beings as social beings - ours is a communitarian philosophy, and we regard
communities and society as being somehow organic. The Kantian conception of
the self - an abstract, rootless being with absolute characteristics - is
alien to us.' There are plenty of similar sentiments. One more: '. . . we
must not let our opponents on the left claim that we endorse the worst, most
selfish, manifestations of the capitalist spirit. It falls to us to police
the market.'
Mr Hunt's contribution would be better expressed, and therefore even more
valuable, if it had been produced in opposition. The employment secretary
has been obliged to dot his observations with the butter of support for all
the stated policies of the government of which he is a member. He throws in
little dabs of praise for the prime minister he serves. Perhaps he wants the
job of chairman of the Conservative party, a post he is tipped to be offered
in a midsummer reshuffle. There is some sense in this, although possibly
more political advantage in giving the task to Lord Archer. When Mr Chris
Patten, now governor of Hong Kong, was Tory chairman he helped Mr John Major
win an election. Like the employment secretary, Mr Patten is both a
thoughtful European and a wistful Christian Democrat. You and I might regard
it as crazy to accept the chairmanship of a disintegrating party, but Mr
Hunt is an optimist, the kind who would tell himself that, starting from
here, the Tories' fortunes can only improve.
Just who leads the Conservatives to what should be defeat is of small
significance. What they discuss while out of office is more important. The
division between Christian Democrats, proponents of the social market
economy, and the faction called liberal by Mr Hunt has already become
blurred. It may be less relevant at the end the decade than it seems to be
now.
To take one specific example - will the fashion for adding layers of
management to public services, as with health, survive? Private companies
are downsizing their white-collar staffs; perhaps the Tories discovered
1970s management 20 years too late. There are other, more universal,
questions, like how do you re-instil a sense of structure in an atomised
polity? Mr Dorrell and Mr Hunt are both aware of this one. They know about
Europe, too.
A long period of sabbatical leave from government would enable them, and
their colleagues, to search for 21st-century answers.

Sir, Your entertaining article on worldwide beach fashion ('Art of wearing

Germans may be covered up in the Baltics, but in the Balearics they are more
or less totally uncovered - and the larger they are, the less they wear.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good time to write off Africa debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir DAVID STEEL MP and Mr TOM CLARKE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Holman is right to point out the shortcomings of the World
Bank's structural adjustment programmes in Africa ('Long snakes and short
ladders in Africa', March 15).
We have just returned from an Oxfam-sponsored visit to Uganda, where we saw
the impact of that country's debt burden on the most vulnerable groups in
society: orphans, people with disabilities and the poor.
Burdened with a debt burden of Dollars 2.6bn, Uganda is forced to spend one
third of its annual budget on repayments, more than four times what it is
able to spend on health and education.
We were alarmed to discover that nearly 70 per cent of Uganda's debt is owed
to multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund, whose rules forbid rescheduling.
Most outrageous of all is that, over the next five years, Uganda will be
forced to make a negative transfer of more than Dollars 200m to the IMF - an
institution which, by selling only 10 per cent of its gold stocks, could
write off debts owed to it by all the countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
This year sees the 50th anniversary of the World Bank and the IMF. What
better time to review the development role of these institutions and to
reward countries such as Uganda, which has done all it can under existing
rules to tackle its debt crisis?

FT  22 MAR 94 / Arts: Rare Cocteau and Strindberg - Fringe theatre in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jean Cocteau (1889-1963) did some terrible things in his time, but for our
sakes I hope The Eagle Has Two Heads (L'Aigle a Deux Tetes, 1946) is the
worst. It is a miracle that its audience at the Lilian Baylis does not
laugh, or groan, out loud. On the one hand, there is its plot, which is
three acts of melodramatic royal romance - a kind of cross between The
Prisoner of Zenda, Queen Christina, and Mayerling; on the other, there is
its language, which is typically inflated stuff, reminding you of whatever
irritated you most in Wilde, Maeterlinck, and Cocteau himself. Glamorous,
and wholly phoney.
The widowed Queen still mourns her royal husband and keeps herself from her
public ten years after his death - when, suddenly one stormy night, into her
room bursts his lookalike, a peasant poet who happens to have plans to
assassinate her but whom she saves from death. They promptly fall in love
and (natch) start hatching plans for a double suicide. She, 10 minutes after
meeting him: 'You are my destiny . . . It is my death whom I have saved from
death . . . You are my death.' He, later: 'We are the dreams of a man who
dreams so soundly he does not know he dreams.'
In between, Cocteau drags in his usual King Charles's heads. Poets, love,
death. People talk of the blood of a poet in all three acts; spout such
bravado as 'The one unpardonable crime is failure' and 'If I were not a
queen I should be a revolutionary myself'; solemnly produce sub-Wildean
lines like 'Assassination is the privilege of princes', 'Gossip is about
poets, not by poets', and 'Police and poets never do get on with each
other'; and wax fancy, as in 'What is a queen? She is a woman in an evening
dress who is trying to overtake time.'
Susannah York has somehow found time amid her current performances of
September Tide to direct this; and she has cast Lisa Harrow to play the
Queen - a role created for Edwige Feuillere, and played later by Eileen
Herlie and Jill Bennett. Harrow, with her gloriously sculpted face and
cheekbones, has beauty, charm, polish, and variety. Her performance,
however, reminded me of problems I had with York's in September Tide: the
lines seems to call for a more scintillating spontaneity, and a more violent
sincerity, than she yet provides.
As the poet, Stash Kirkbride does some intelligent and sensitive
line-readings without investing the role (which was for Jean Marais) with
much stature. Both the carriage of his head and the use of his eyes are
dull. Maybe York wants to dust any superfluous glamour off the play. Who
knows? Alas, she dilutes its romance too. But who cares? Though some of
Cocteau's material is exhilarating, not a jot of it rings true.
Beneath all his wretched determination to be surprising is a quite maudlin
flair for cliche. 'I could kill you so as not to lose you.' 'I know this
love could not endure (and so I took poison).' 'All love is a little death,
and great love is suicide.' Finally, the Queen (stabbed by the poet) says to
him (as she reels from the poison he has taken) 'Thank you for making me
live . . . Thank you for making me die.' Thanks, but no thanks.
Meanwhile, down in 'the room' at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond,
Strindberg's rare 1907 play, The Pelican, is receiving its second-ever
production in this country. Not unlike Gorky's Vassa Zheleznova (seen at the
Gate in 1990), a play begun at the same time, this is about a latterday
Clytemnestra and her children. The Mother has deceived her husband and
forced him to his death before the play begins; Strindberg's stage action
concerns her children's discovery of her crimes.
The pelican is a bird that, in legend, gives its own blood to feed its
children. The Mother here has brought her children up in starkest poverty,
and has seemed to be such a pelican. Now they discover that she deprived
them - skimming the milk and keeping them in the cold - so as to save money
for herself. She is a compulsive cheat; she has even stolen her new
son-in-law from her daughter. And they come to recognise not only her evil
but her odd helplessness in it: she is 'like a sleepwalker who can't be
woken.' They know, however, that their own lives remain ruined.
As the Mother, Jan Waters gives the most detailed and intense performance,
though also the most over-cultivated. (She projects not greed but vanity;
not meanness but hyper-sophistication.) Charlotte Williams (as daughter and
maid), Brett Fancy (the Son-in-law), Alan Westaway (the son) are sometimes a
tad too pallid, but keep the absorbing, horrid surprises of Strindberg's
drama unfolding freshly. Sean Holmes directs; the new translation, very
effective, is by Eivor Martinus. Like The Eagle with Two Heads, the play is
given without an interval, and gains thereby. It lasts only 95 minutes and
holds its audience's attention with easy command.
The Eagle with Two Heads is at the Lilian Baylis, EC1; The Pelican is at the
Orange Tree, Richmond. Both run until April 2.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Arts: A singular vision - William Packer finds himself
looking over Goya's shoulder into his dark, ironical world at the Royal
Academy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goya is generally acknowledged as one of the supreme masters in the
post-Renaissance western tradition, and for once we should not be shy of an
accolade all too often given. Rather more to the point, he has a real claim
to being the first great modern painter, providing the link between that
older tradition and the modern movement that we so glibly read as a break
with the past. All art has its history and context.
The Goya link is more of a complex double-knot than a simple tie. The
threads within it are the humane profundity of Velasquez and the rococo
virtuosity of the 18th century on the one hand, the romantic realism of
Courbet and Delacroix and the proto-impressionism of Manet and Degas on the
other. And all the while there is Goya himself, with his singular vision of
the world, at once natural and fantastical, delighted and appalled,
mordantly ironical.
There has been no finer painter of the male portrait than he, not in its
grander pretensions but on the intimate scale of conversational scrutiny,
head and shoulders, one to one. Yet that same sensibility, capable of such
profound psychological insight, spent half a career producing decorative
schemes, both religious and secular, the rival of anything out of France or
Venice. And all the while his eyes were open to the incidental and the
everyday, to the common sports and festivals, picnics and bull-fights, and
to the darker spectacles of the prison and the asylum. The step across into
fantasy, albeit the ironical fantasy of the rational man, with its travesty
of true religion in the black arts, was not so great.
We find the whole artist in the intimate, reflecting glass of his smaller
paintings, that are now brought together as never before. The small
painting, whether preliminary sketch, or cabinet picture complete in itself,
is not unique to Goya, but what is peculiar to him in his time is its sense
of immediacy and privacy. We discover an artist working more and more for
himself as he grows older. So lively and direct are these things in the
making, it is as though the paint were still wet and we looking on at the
artist's shoulder.
Goya lived through difficult times, born in 1746 in the repressive Spain of
the failing Bourbons, to whom he was appointed Court Painter in 1786, a post
that somehow he still held at his death in exile in Bordeaux in 1828. The
French Revolutionary wars and Napoleon's subsequent invasion of Spain,
inspired his bleakest work and darkest inventions. Illness in the early
1790s left him stone deaf, which could only have increased his alienation,
spiritual quite as much as physical, that is so clear in the work.
None of the etchings of the 'Horrors of War', nor any of the 'Black
Paintings' of this period, from the Prado, are in this exhibition. Even so,
the contrast of mood could hardly be better pointed than by the presence of
the early tapestry sketches, the 'Four Seasons' of the mid 1780s for example
and, next door, the grim prison interiors, the Witches Sabbaths, the
gypsies' caves, the cannibals, shipwrecks, and the robbed coach - owned
incidentally by a bank - of the 1790s.
But there are more subtle contrasts to draw, consistencies even. There was
ever a darker, more violent side to Goya's imagination, as perhaps to the
Spanish temperament itself, with his tavern brawls, the cat up a tree and
the strange straw mannikin thrown in the air to set against the real horrors
to come.
In more poignant contrast, The Meadow of San Isidro of 1788 gives us the
image of the perfect Spring afternoon, and the company en fete for the
communal picnic, across the river from Madrid. The fair is down on the
water-meadow, and on the grassy slope the girls sit beneath their parasols,
and the men lounge and flirt and have another drink.
Some 30 years on and it is a 'Bullfight in a Village' that is the festival -
not that there is any inference to draw from that. But the company is
clearly rougher, the evening drawing on, and the eye is held not so much by
the protagonists, bull and picador, as by the squat triangular back-view of
hat and greatcoat beneath and between them. It is the formal fulcrum of the
picture, and self-portrait besides. Would only a deaf man, as Sacheverell
Sitwell has suggested, give only his back to the world?
The self-portraits, indeed, are the key to the show, from the opening image
of the early 1770s, the young man fresh-faced and confident, to the odd
self-mockery at nearly 50, caught contre-jour in brocaded jerkin and funny
hat. But it is the tiniest of them, painted only a year or two later, that
hangs in the memory. A shock of hair, black coat and high stock, together
frame a face half in deep shadow. The brow, catching the light, is tense and
furrowed, and out of the shadows those two dark eyes fix us for ever.
Truth &amp; Fantasy: Goya - the Small Paintings; Royal Academy of Arts,
Piccadilly W1, until June 12. Sponsored by The Times and Classic FM, with

The extraordinary and fascinating thing about Italy's political situation is
that matters could so easily go either way: after all the quick change
governments since the second world war, the results of the impending
election could be total chaos and the virtual disintegration of the country
into northern, central and southern sectors - almost like the pattern in the
middle ages. Or the country could emerge with the most stable government of
the modern age. Assignment tries to answer the question 'Quo vadis Italy?'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Arts: Democracy in the Deep South
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the result of the American civil war, or the war between the states, as
people in the south still call it, had gone another way, the history of the
world after 1865 or thereabouts would have been quite different. How
different, in what ways and whether for good or ill, no-one can tell. But if
you think about the question for a moment, you will realise that the
proposition is true: the preservation of the American union was a decisive
historical event.
It was also one of the most brutal campaigns ever fought, mixing new
technology in the north with older notions of valour and chivalry in the
south. There were more recorded casualties than in any previous war.
That is part of the background to the new piece at the Bush by the Canadian
writer, John Murrell. Democracy is one of the most cerebral plays you are
likely to see. It consists largely of a dialogue between Ralph Waldo
Emerson, the thinker, and Walt Whitman, the poet: the rationalist opposed to
the romantic. The exchanges take place near Washington as the battle rages
in Gettysburg in 1863.
Murrell writes beautifully. Emerson has a speech about war which goes on so
long that it must qualify for the Guinness Book of Records in the theatre.
Spoken by Hugh Ross, it remains riveting throughout. Describing the
aftermath of the conflict, he relates: 'Some of the boys coming home from
Gettysburg didn't even seem to recognise the name of the great battle that
they had fought.'
When he says: 'It was hell, Walt. It was hell itself', there is not even the
faintest suggestion that such words could be a cliche. This is an immaculate
performance by Ross.
The other star in Democracy is Robert Jones, who designed the set. When you
enter the theatre, the stage is concealed behind billowing red curtains.
They disappear to reveal a set of woods and wet grasses so naturalistic that
some of the audience started to show symptoms of hay fever.
This is the romanticism behind the war. Whitman has given shelter by his
pond to two young drop-outs from the conflict, one a southern deserter, the
other a dying soldier from the north.
They talk, sing and achieve a kind of harmony while the main business
remains between Whitman and Emerson.
Democracy is not a play that I would recommend to all-comers. There is too
much shouting in the first act. It could be said to have more than a share
of north American sentimentality: too much of the fondness for the pond. The
nature of the dialogue is not the most obvious subject for the theatre. Yet
under John Dove's direction I admired it enormously, and enjoyed it.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Spanish state aids can continue -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice has ruled that Spanish tax exemption
provisions benefiting the public sector were state aids. But the Court said
the provisions could remain in operation since they predated Spanish
membership of the European Community and had not been declared incompatible
with the common market by the European Commission under the appropriate
procedure.
The ECJ gave its ruling in response to questions from a Valencia court
relating to the interpretation of the EC competition and state aid rules.
The questions arose in the context of a dispute between the Banco de Credito
Industrial SA and the Valencia Ayuntamiento over the imposition of a local
business tax during the tax years 1983 to 1986. Banco de Credito claimed
that it was exempt from all public taxes.
The Luxembourg Court clarified a number of preliminary matters before
turning to the Spanish court's questions. It noted that Banco de Credito was
considered by the Valencia court to be a state company, because of an
indirect capital holding by the state. It pointed out that the questions
were irrelevant with regard to the tax years 1983, 1984 and 1985, because
they predated Spanish accession to the Community. And it said that the
factual background of the case indicated that only the Treaty rules on state
aids were relevant to the national litigation.
Accordingly, the ECJ redefined the questions referred. It said the Spanish
court was really asking whether treaty rules governing the public sector
read together with the prohibition of state aids precluded the application
of a national law granting a tax exemption to public sector businesses.
The ECJ held that, although such national laws were state aids, they could
continue in operation so long as the Commission had not declared the aids
incompatible in accordance with the procedure applicable under the treaty to
existing aids.
The Court confirmed that the state aid rules apply to public and private
business alike, subject only to the exception available to the provision of
public services of a general economic interest. It said that a measure
whereby certain businesses were granted a tax exemption not available to
others constituted a state aid. Where such an aid was of a type to affect
trade between member countries and to restrict competition, it was
incompatible with the common market unless it could benefit from the
exceptions provided for by the treaty state aid rules.
However, the system for monitoring state aids set up under the treaty
requires constant review of aids by the Commission, which is responsible
therefore for declaring the incompatibility of aids, subject to the control
of the Court, in accordance with the applicable procedures. The Commission's
powers extend to aids granted to public sector businesses, and in particular
to those to which member countries have entrusted the provision of services
of a general economic interest. The distinction made between the procedure
applicable to existing and new aids applies equally.
The ECJ said that, since the aid in question was created prior to Spain's
accession to the Community, it was to be categorised as an existing aid. In
accordance with the Court's case law, existing aids may continue in
operation so long as the Commission has not declared them incompatible.
Consequently, it followed that, so long as the Commission had not declared
an existing aid incompatible, it was not necessary to examine if, and to
what extent, the aid could escape the treaty prohibition of state aids under
the public sector exception available to businesses entrusted with the
provision of services of a general economic interest.

There is considerable pessimism about the future growth of company in-house

finance and industry carried out by the Law Society. The growth of recent

less qualified staff.
The survey also found that many employed lawyers were extremely dissatisfied
with the society's efforts to address their specific interests and problems.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Lender to bear loss resulting from
negligent valuation - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A finance house which lent money for the acquisition of a commercial
property based on an incorrect valuation cannot recover any of its capital
loss from a negligent valuer, the English High Court has ruled. The court's
decision in Nyckeln Finance v Stumpbrook Continuation comes shortly after
the Banque Bruxelles Lambert v Eagle Star case in which it was ruled that a
negligent valuer was not liable for losses resulting from a collapse in the
property market. But the judge in the latter case had left open the
possibility of a claim by the lender for loss of its 'cushion' - the
difference between the amount of the loan and the perceived value of the
property. In Nyckeln, the judge did not award damages for loss of 'cushion'.
Mr Edwin Cheyney of Wilde Sapte, Nyckeln's solicitors, said the decision
would take many in the property world by surprise. 'It means capital losses
can now only be recovered if the lender has lent more than the actual value
of the property after the drop in the market value has been taken into
account,' he said. The administrator of Nyckeln, Mr Maurice Withall of
accountants Grant Thornton, is considering an appeal.

<TEXT>
Paul Revell is the new managing director of Derwent Valley Foods,
manufacturer of one of the more successful snackfood brands to be invented
in recent years.
Revell (left) had a ten-year stint with United Biscuits before joining DVF,
most recently as commercial director of McVitie's (UK). UB bought DVF in
February 1993 for Pounds 24m. Before his job with McVitie's, Revell worked
in another UB branch, KP Foods. A decade's experience of snackfood brands
will be useful for Revell's steerage of DVF's Phileas Fogg snacks, a premium
range including eccentric nibbles such as Tortilla Chips and Punjab Puri.
DVF's founder and former managing director, Roger McKechnie, has stepped
down from his chairmanship of the company though stays on as a non-executive
director. He set up DVF in 1982; by 1986 it was joint winner of a Business
Enterprise Award.
McKechnie has now ploughed some of his Pounds 2m cash from UB's acquisition
of DVF into a new venture called the Medomsley Road Seed Capital Company,
which - as its name implies - provides seed capital for start-up companies
in the north-east of England.

FT  22 MAR 94 / People: Taking a chair in social housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Former Mercantile House chairman John Barkshire, who in the 1970s and 1980s
was one of the City's more entrepreneurial figures, has taken on the
chairmanship of Chaco Investments which is pioneering ways of attracting
institutional finance into social housing.
Chaco, a subsidiary of TR Property Investment Trust, was set up four years
ago by Leon Clifton, 45, who had been helping finance inner city
developments. Its name comes from Chaco Canyon in New Mexico where a group
of Indians had pioneered community housing.
The rapid growth of housing associations, and the cutback in government
funding for social housing, has led to increasing calls for private sector
funding to augment the resources provided by banks and building societies.
Chaco's brief is to encourage the big investment institutions to start
investing in social housing again after an absence of over 30 years caused
by worries about rent controls and other financial restrictions.
Chaco recently helped Scottish Amicable buy 500 housing association
properties, worth Pounds 8m, from Coventry's CCHA Housing. It was the first
time that an institution had taken an equity stake in housing association
properties built before 1988 and was welcomed by the Housing Corporation,
the government regulator.
However, if Chaco is to do more deals of this type it needs access to a much
bigger pool of institutional funds and the company is hoping that under John
Barkshire's chairmanship its name will become better known in the City.
Barkshire, 59, who sits on the boards of Sun Life, Savills, Household
Mortgage Corporation, and TR Property Investment Trust, expects to appoint
at least one more non-executive to the Chaco board. He has also not ruled
out the possibility of widening Chaco's shareholder base at some stage. At
the moment TR Property owns 90 per cent and Clifton owns 10 per cent.

Nicholas Sheehan has resigned from his role as chief executive of London and
Edinburgh Trust, the UK property arm of SPP, the Swedish insurance group.
His resignation follows a structural reorganisation of SPP's international
property interests, which have incurred heavy losses in recent years.
Jeremy Plummer has been appointed head of the group's international property
portfolio, with overall responsibility for SPP's property portfolio in the
UK, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, the US and Singapore.
SPP is integrating the operations of SPP. LET, which is the manager of SPP's
international property portfolio, into its own portfolio management
operations. The company says the decision marks SPP. LET's transition from a
development company to an investment institution.
Anders Ek, chief investment officer for SPP, says Sheehan's skills 'had been
invaluable in rationalising the UK portfolio in difficult market
conditions'.
SPP bought London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the UK property company, for Pounds
491m in 1990. The company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 448.6m in 1992.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Analysts wary of tighter net - Robert
Rice looks at the impact of expanded insider dealing regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quashing last month of the insider dealing conviction of Mr Thorold
Mackie, a Scottish investment analyst, has done little to calm the nerves of
the UK securities industry about the new insider dealing laws which came
into force at the beginning of March.
His conviction in 1992 sent shock waves through the securities industry. To
many Mr Mackie's prosecution seemed little more than a heavy handed attempt
to punish a respected analyst for doing his job well.
Events leading to the conviction involved Mr Mackie, who worked for
Edinburgh stockbrokers Bell Lawrie White, learning from Mr Peter Runciman,
chairman of waste disposal company Shanks McEwan, that things were not going
well at the company. Mr Mackie subsequently advised his clients to sell
short. Soon afterwards Shanks McEwan issued a profits warning. The shares
sold by Mr Mackie's clients realised Pounds 1.4m more than they would have
done after the warning was issued.
Mr Runciman gave evidence at Mr Mackie's trial that he had told Mr Mackie
that the company was about to issue a profits warning. Mr Mackie maintained
that he had merely said there would be little by way of growth in earnings
per share during the current half year.
But his ordeal also served as a sharp reminder to the investment community
of what the new law had in store. The drive to create open and fair markets
by widening the scope of the UK's insider dealing laws appeared to threaten
irreversible change to the traditional relationship between investment
analysts and the corporate sector.
Since the Mackie trial many analysts will now only talk to companies in
pairs so that corroboration of what was said is possible if required. And it
has become increasingly common for analysts to begin meetings with company
chairmen by begging them not to tell them anything which may make them an
insider.
In spite of Mr Mackie's subsequent acquittal the investment community
remains wary and there is little sign of them relaxing their guard while the
full impact of the new laws remain uncertain.
Their concerns were on display in Edinburgh last week at a seminar organised
by the Securities Institute. Mr Frank Doran and Ms Kathleen Stewart of
Scottish solicitors McGrigor Donald attempted to calm nerves by pointing out
that despite the wider ambit of the new regime many of the principles of the
old law still applied.
The new laws make it an offence to deal in securities or encourage another
to do so when in possession of inside information, or to disclose inside
information other than in the proper performance of a job.
Their scope has expanded in three respects: the securities covered; the
markets regulated; and the geographical area of the offence. Dealing now
includes any off-market deal made through a professional intermediary as
well as those on a recognised stock exchange. Securities has a wider meaning
and will include debt securities, depositary receipts, options and futures.
The offences now cover markets in 19 European countries and extend to any
investments made through intermediaries, and disclosure or encouragement
made to persons in the UK from anywhere in the world.
Inside information is defined as specific price-sensitive information
relating to particular securities which have not been made public. The 1993
Criminal Justice Act provides that it will be judged price-sensitive when,
if made public, it would be likely to have 'a significant effect' on the
price of any securities. There is no longer any requirement for a connection
between the insider and the company to which the information relates, but
the individual must have obtained the information from an inside source.
There are a number of general defences: the insider had no expectation of
any profit, or the avoidance of any loss would result from dealing on the
basis of the information; the insider reasonably believed that no parties to
the transaction would be prejudiced by not having the information; and the
insider would have done the same thing even without inside information.
There are also specific defences for market makers acting in good faith;
persons acting reasonably on market information; and those acting in
conformity with the price stabilisation rules in the 1986 Financial Services
Act.
Part of the problem faced by the financial community in interpreting the new
law over the coming months is the lack of any precedent. Since insider
dealing laws were first introduced in the UK in 1980 there have been just 32
prosecutions and 15 convictions, of which 9 pleaded guilty leaving only 6
convictions resulting from contested cases. As Mr Neil Davidson QC pointed
out six cases under a previous regime are not much of a guide as to the
likely impact of the new law.
Companies fear the new law will interfere with normal contacts with
investment analysts. Mr Brian Fidler, finance director of Christian
Salvesen, told the seminar that if the net result of the new regime was that
companies stopped talking to analysts it would be a big step backwards in
the drive to create more perfect markets.
His views were echoed by Mr Adrian Fitzgerald, director of equity research
for NatWest Securities in Edinburgh. The new laws could seriously threaten
valid lines of communication between analysts and companies, he said. If the
effect of the was that analysts would be forced to tell companies 'please
don't tell me anything which may help me to make a better value judgment'
then there was a serious danger of information and communications becoming
sterile.
He said the regulations would lead to less efficient markets with securities
incorrectly priced; more speculative comment; more volatile securities
prices; and an increase in profits warnings under stock exchange guidelines
on dissemination of price-sensitive information.
But there are more specific concerns. Mr Fitzgerald said it would often be
unclear whether information had been made public or not. This meant that
when analysts wanted to use information but were unsure whether it was
public they would have to consult a compliance officer and possibly lawyers.
There is also concern about what is and what is not price-sensitive
information and what constitutes 'significant impact' on the price of
securities. To many in the City significant means movement of 10 per cent or
more. But Mr Fitzgerald said there was 'little logic in a law which says
here is a grey line, step over it and you commit an offence, stay behind it
and you are OK'.
He added that if 'significant' was judged by an arbitrary movement in share
prices you could end up with odd and unfair results. A fund manager who got
it right and made Pounds 150,000 would escape prosecution if the shares
moved only 3 per cent, whereas an individual who got it wrong and shares
moved 10 per cent could face prosecution even if only Pounds 100 profit was
made.
In addition to these concerns, many believe that the only people to benefit
from the new law will be lawyers. But until precedents have been established
analysts and fund managers should bear in mind that even the best legal
advice cannot guarantee whether conduct remains within or outside the law.
Their only real comfort is as Mr Doran pointed out: 'The Act was not created
to punish people who are acting innocently.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Wanted, a more
gentlemanly style - Engineering 'subbies' still have an uneasy relationship
with their larger customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They want better standards and improved quality, which we deliver, but then
won't pay higher prices to meet the extra costs. So we lose out.'
The complaint comes from one of 50 small engineering companies, mostly
subcontractors, surveyed recently for the 600 Group, the UK machine tool
producer. It shows that, in a world of partnerships, preferred suppliers,
long-term deals and single sourcing, the relationship between the humble
'subbies' and their larger customers can still be an edgy one.
There are thousands of subcontractors in the UK and they tend to keep a low
profile. The changing nature of their role, however, has increased their
importance, and made it all the more crucial that they can work effectively
with their customers without feeling they are being put upon.
The traditional role of subcontractors, to provide extra capacity for
manufacturers at peak demand, has virtually gone; instead, they have become
a vital part of industry's manufacturing strategy as customers prefer to
concentrate their own efforts on activities where they can add value and
outsource as much as possible of everything else.
This makes a great deal of sense, says Andy Sandford, editor of Subcon
magazine. The customer gets a predictable supply and total flexibility, and
does not have to invest in new machinery which may be under-utilised. The
subcontractor, meanwhile, becomes a manufacturing specialist, spreading the
cost of expensive but efficient manufacture over a number of contracts.
The new approach is already quite sophisticated, and subcontractors have
responded well to the challenge of, for example, supplying an automotive
sub-assembly rather than a simple part, or adding more value to a component.
That could involve, for example, sending out a machined part to be
electroplated before delivering it to a customer.
As its role develops, the engineering subcontracting industry is also
becoming better at getting its message across to potential customers. More
than 500 'subbies' will be showing what they can offer at the Subcon'94
exhibition at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre from April 11-15.
But many believe that, behind the rhetoric of supplier development
programmes and long-term partnerships, there is still some way to go before
an ideal level of trust between both sides of the industry is achieved.
'Things are moving in the right direction,' says Bob Knox, managing director
of Luton-based Stanbridge Precision Turned Parts, 'but one is always a
little bit worried about a long-term partnership. What happens if someone
comes along and offers to cut the price for the customer by 1/2 p on each
part?'
The problem of lack of trust was highlighted last month in a report by
Professor Richard Lamming of Bath University School of Management for the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders. The necessary levels of trust are not present in the motor industry
for 'lean supply' and consequently comprehensive lean production - to become
a reality, he says.
Sandford agrees that the automotive industry has had a reputation for being
ruthless with its suppliers, whereas partnerships in the aerospace industry
are more established. Overall, he says, when there is trust in a partnership
it works well, but when the relationship is poor it can be unfair on the
supplier. 'The supplier must be able to invest and make a reasonable profit,
otherwise when the next contract comes up it will lose out on cost,' he
says.
One potential problem area is abuse of the open-book costing system, where
subcontractors - but not, usually, their customers - reveal all their
costings and profit margins. 'If the books show the subcontractor is making
a 5-6 per cent profit margin and the customer says, 'We think you should
only be making 2 per cent and investing in new equipment,' that's when the
problems start,' says Sandford.
Fortunately for the subcontractors, many customers realise they would be
harming themselves by ending a long-term relationship simply because a rival
supplier offered a slightly better deal, as the relationships are becoming
deeper and thus less easy to end.
Companies such as Stanbridge, meanwhile, are developing their own expertise
to ensure that they can retain their long-term customers and win new ones.
The survey for the 600 Group pointed to the need for 'subbies' to invest in
high-quality equipment. 'A state-of-the art facility pulls a lot of weight.
Customers like to see progress being made improving efficiency,' says Edward
Kydd, managing director of Gatehouse Industrial Services, based in
Mildenhall, Suffolk.
Gatehouse, which makes sheet metal parts for the electronics, furniture and
office equipment industries, has just spent about Pounds 250,000 on new
equipment, which has led efficiency to rocket, says Kydd. Then there is the
need for proof of quality manufacturing. Kydd is awaiting accreditation
under British Standard 5750, and says that with 75 per cent of his customers
having achieved the quality assurance standard already, Gatehouse needs it
to maintain its position.
At Stanbridge, Knox says the company's commitment to quality over the past
five years, symbolised by its achievement in 1991 of Ford's highly demanding
Q1 assessment, has helped it win extra business.
Sometimes, the commitment to quality leads to increased costs that cannot be
passed on to the customer. But the 'subbies' are also forming their own
long-term relationships with their suppliers, for example of raw materials,
so that costs and benefits can be balanced.
Kydd sees this as a return to a 'more gentlemanly' way of doing things,
echoing a call from one of the companies quoted in the report for the 600
Group: 'We're all in this together and should work together more to weather
the storm.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Twists and turns of the
tax maze - Exporting / Ian Hamilton Fazey answers questions on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two types of foreign trade as far as European VAT authorities are
concerned - trade within the European single market and 'third country'
trade with the rest of the world. The following answers to common questions
have been compiled with the help of UK Customs and Excise officers, notably
Barry Price, a VAT specialist since 1972.
Q: Are exports free of VAT?
A: Third country trade is zero rated, provided you can prove goods have been
exported. Export evidence must be obtained within one month and retained to
justify zero rating, otherwise VAT will be charged at standard rate.
Documents must identify the exporter, the customer, the goods and the export
destination. Vague descriptions are not acceptable.
Q: Which documents will be accepted by VAT inspectors?
A: Authenticated bills for air or sea carriage, as well as standard
international consignment notes or bills of lading - receipts of goods
placed on board a ship - are all considered primary evidence of export.
Secondary evidence - such as a certificate of shipment - is also acceptable
if issued by a carrier, but the carrier must hold the necessary primary
evidence so it can be traced if verification is required.
Q: What if a company sells to a foreign customer but does not ship the goods
itself or appoint the carrier?
A: This sort of indirect exporting happens commonly when a customer arranges
collection of goods direct from the factory or warehouse. The exporting
company needs something to prove the goods have arrived at the other end,
such as transit documentation and receipts.
Customs officers advise taking a deposit equal to the amount of VAT,
returnable when satisfactory proof of export is obtained. This gives the
customer an incentive not to forget to send the evidence.
Q: Is trade between European Union countries also zero rated?
A: Zero rating is allowed, provided supply is made in the UK to a person or
company in another EU country registered for VAT there. The exporter must
obtain the local VAT registration number of the customer, show it on the
sales invoice and keep copies. Evidence of removal of goods from the UK must
also be obtained and retained. If these conditions cannot be met, then VAT
must be charged to other EU customers at the UK rate.
Q: Do you need to register for VAT in EU countries where you trade?
A: It depends on where the supply of goods is deemed by the local VAT
authorities to have taken place. If you have a warehouse in another EU
country, transfer of your own goods to it will be deemed a supply and you
will need to be registered in that country so as to zero rate the
consignment in the UK - otherwise you will have to charge yourself VAT.
Goods offered on sale or return terms are treated similarly.
Another pitfall is the VAT-registration threshold in any EU country where
you trade. This was raised to an annual turnover of Pounds 45,000 in the UK
last November in order to take tens of thousands of small businesses out of
having to account for VAT at all. But the threshold is zero in Belgium,
Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.
Technically, this means you cannot legally, say, take a stand at an
exhibition or trade fair in any of these countries and sell the actual goods
displayed on it, as many companies have done in the past to save
transporting the goods home afterwards. You cannot sell the stand either, as
some companies have done to help pay for going to the trade fair in the
first place. You can, of course, take orders to supply the goods from the
UK, even if they are the same goods you had on exhibition.
Q: Does the type of goods being exported make any difference?
A: Supply of anything that has to be installed or assembled by the vendor
takes place in the EU country where this work is done, so local registration
may be necessary. The UK has simplified procedures so this will not require
registration of companies selling such items into the UK, but there is not
yet universal reciprocity on this. Customs and Excise advises exporters to
contact the fiscal authorities in other countries to find out if
registration is necessary.
Q: So what if I have to register? Is it going to cause problems?
A: Not if you have the language skills and knowledge of local accounting
terms and systems to fill in another set of quarterly VAT returns in Dutch,
French, Italian, Spanish or whatever. In practice, exporters without the
necessary administrative infrastructure in the country concerned use local
fiscal agents - some countries may require this anyway. Some large firms of
accountants with offices spread throughout the EU offer this as a service to
UK clients. Charges vary individually, but will almost certainly not be
economic without a volume of regular business to make them worthwhile.
This in turn brings us back to a central theme in this series on exporting:
as the Institute of Export advises consistently, do not do it on a one-off,
intermittent, sporadic or casual basis. Ian Campbell, the institute's
director-general, never tires of stressing that exporting should always be
part of the main thrust of a business, not a bolt-on function. The regular
exporter should have the sales volume to pay for and cope with any
administrative burdens, such as VAT, which foreign trade brings with it.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Technology: Keeping a sense of balance - Ian Rodger on a
treatment that could prolong the life of tyres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A start-up Swiss company has developed a polymer compound that provides
continuously adjusted balancing for the life of a vehicle tyre when applied
to its inside wall.
Everbalance, led by Swedish entrepreneur Bertil Carnehammar, claims its
compound lengthens significantly the life of tyres and provides a more
comfortable ride for passengers than tyres balanced with conventional lead
weights.
So far, testing of the compound has been concentrated on commercial
vehicles, but it is now being extended to cars.
The development is based on the discovery that vibrations caused by
imbalances in the tyre and rim of a vehicle will cause a liquid within the
tyre to move away from the source of the vibration.
Carnehammar, a former marketing executive with Philips and Rank Xerox, says
he and his colleagues learned of this phenomenon by reading patent
applications for compounds designed to seal tyre punctures.
The origin of their own research was, in fact, a tyre sealant compound that
had been developed by a Danish scientist for Volvo in the early 1980s.
However, they soon became disenchanted with the notion of sealing and
concentrated on balancing. The challenge was to develop a compound that had
the properties of a liquid but would also adhere all around the inside wall
of the tyre when the vehicle was stationary. It also had to be viscous in
all climates, nontoxic, noncorrosive and effective on several types and
sizes of tyre.
By 1988, they were sufficiently satisfied to begin road tests with a few US
fleet operators. 'The reception was very good, but people did not come
back,' Carnehammar recalls.
It seems that customers were nervous about putting a chemical compound in
their tyres. Also, tyre manufacturers threatened to invalidate warranties.
This forced Everbalance into new research and testing to prove that the
compound would have no ill effects on tyres. This has now been completed,
and the group, with endorsements from recognised German and US testing
organisations, is starting general distribution.
The compound, which is made mainly from non-toxic glycol, cellulose fibres
and corrosion inhibitors, sells for about Dollars 25 per kilogram, enough
for one truck tyre.
Carnehammar says the increase in tyre life varies with brands and with
vehicle types, but 20 per cent is typical. It will not work on tyres that
are more than 500g out of radial balance nor on tyres with a significant
lateral imbalance.
One of the main distributors is Sumitomo Corporation, the Japanese trading
company at the centre of a group that includes tyre-maker Sumitomo Rubber.
Carnehammar says that tyre companies, still reeling from the reduction in
their sales caused by the universal adoption of long-lasting radial tyres,
are unhappy about the introduction of a product that will make their tyres
last still longer.
But Sumitomo concluded that the compound would be successful and saw it as
an opportunity to build market share.
Everbalance hopes to introduce a balancing compound for cars next year, but
development has proved complicated. Whereas the normal life of a truck tyre
is a year or less, car tyres tend to remain in service longer, so the
product's endurance must be ensured. And it must be tested on a much wider
range of tyres, some 200 compared with 30 truck tyre types.
Also, the existing formula does not perform well at speeds of above 100mph,
although that would seem to be a problem only in Germany.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Technology: Gold rush - Matthew Curtin reports on advances
in mining which may transform productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technology has come to the aid of the volatile South African gold mining
industry more than once over the past century. Today, new advances are being
sought to transform productivity as companies recover from a crisis which
brought many mines to the brink of closure.
Executives are still nervous at memories of the early 1990s, when a
combination of steadily declining real gold prices, double-digit inflation
and the deteriorating quality of the ore reserves sent the industry into a
spiral.
In the event, only two big gold mines closed. South African gold output
steadied above 600 tonnes a year from the late 1980s, but cost-containment
and improved productivity meant the mines shed more than 150,000 jobs or
nearly a third of their workforce between 1989 and 1993.
Yet successful as this restructuring of the industry has been, the mines
need technological advances or consistently higher gold prices of at least
Dollars 450 an ounce - compared with around Dollars 385 today  - if gold
production is not to go into slow but steady decline.
The problem is, says Kobus Olivier, chief consulting engineer at the Gencor
group's gold division, that a breakthrough which would transform the mines'
productivity underground has proved elusive.
However, two new techniques are now in sight, generating more excitement
about the technological possibilities than there has been for years, he
adds. The techniques are: diamond wire cutting pioneered by Gencor and Anglo
American, the country's biggest gold producer; and the impact ripper, an
industry research project recently taken over by mining house Gold Fields.
The first simply applies the established method of quarrying granite and
other hard stones to underground mining. A synthetic-covered steel cable
less than a centimetre thick and studded with industrial diamonds saws
through the rockface, cutting away the ore in large chunks. The impact
ripper is an hydraulically powered chisel, mounted on rails, which attacks
the rockface with an accuracy that blasting lacks.
Olivier says the potential benefits are huge because either technique could
transform the cost structure of the industry and underground productivity.
Diamond wire cutters can operate 24 hours a day, require less labour and
minimise the amount of waste rock mined. Diamond wire is expensive - the
first material Gencor ordered cost R1,000 (Dollars 290) a metre - but
greater demand would reduce its cost and eliminate much of the need for
explosives used for the 900,000 blasts the gold mines make every day.
Ken Dix, general manager of Anglo American's Freegold operation, which is
using diamond wire cutters on a trial basis, says the technique would lead
to the redesign of underground mining plans and thus save more tunnelling,
timber and explosive costs and shave 60 per cent off transport costs.
Underground safety would improve, too, bringing new efficiencies, because
the narrower stope-widths and minimal use of explosives would do less to
aggravate the rock pressure underground. Rockfalls kill about 270 workers a
year underground on the gold mines.
Much the same benefits apply to the impact ripper. Len Gibbs, consulting
engineer at Gold Fields which has a number of machines operating at its
Kloof mine, says: 'The possibilities have to be exciting. The deeper you go,
the more you need mechanised mining methods and less reliance on manpower.'
This has been true since the early days of gold mining; the geological
challenges of extracting the precious metal at deeper and more dangerous
levels have forced producers to refine their techniques. Much gold output
now comes from mines sunk to below sea-level or more than 3,000 metres
underground.
The MacArthur Forrest cyanide process saved the South African gold mining
industry when it was introduced in 1890 at the Salisbury mine near the
mining camp of Johannesburg. Existing mercury-based techniques, adequate for
recovering gold from surface ore, were no good for treating metallurgically
difficult underground material which the mines had to exploit because they
had exhausted surface reef outcrops. Gold recovery rates had fallen to less
than 50 per cent, but to the surprise of miners at the time the new process
quickly achieved recoveries of 85-95 per cent.
Yet impressive as the refinements made over the years have been,
metallurgical and mechanical mining technology has not changed for decades.
The cyanidisation process has been modified to push recovery grades to more
than 99 per cent, allowing the retreatment of millions of tonnes of
low-grade waste material in recent years, but leaving little room for
improvement.
The labour-intensive underground production routine of drilling holes in the
rockface, filling them with explosives, blasting once a day and cleaning up
the broken rock before hoisting it to the surface, is the same as it was 100
years ago.
South Africa's remaining gold reserves are huge, well-defined, but deep.
Exploration has identified extensive high-grade ore reserves in the
Potchefstroom Gap, an area south-west of Johannesburg, but at depths of up
to 5,000 metres below surface. The capital cost of a sinking a new mine
shaft to that depth would be more than R2.5bn.
Despite the excitement about the new methods, there have been teething
problems. Gencor gave up its experiment with diamond wire cutting last year.
Olivier says the group 'knows it works', but found the wire tended to get
pinched as the rockface closed once it had been cut. Gencor seems happy to
wait and see what progress Anglo can make, given that the group's mining
equipment and industrial diamond businesses have a keen interest in the
technology's success.
Dix points to the excessive wear and tear on expensive equipment, but
stresses that 'it's early days'. Gold Fields has found that the first
orebody on which it tried the impact ripper proved more susceptible to the
technique than the orebody at Kloof where the equipment would most likely be
used.
However, Olivier says the problems are unlikely to be insurmountable. He
adds that while one technique might not transform gold mining, a combination
of the new technologies with further refinements still promises the
breakthrough for which the miners are yearning.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Technology: Smart move on fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smart cards, with chips rather than magnetic strips in the plastic, have yet
to make much of a mark outside Europe, but China and India are giving them a
close look as ways of checking identities and preventing fraud.
Sempac, a small Swiss company, hopes to benefit from trends in both markets,
as well as in Japan where smart cards are being considered as a replacement
for magnetic cards in making telephone calls.
Based on the methods developed by Esec, its parent, to make semiconductor
equipment, Sempac produces a line of machines which have introduced a new
technology into smart card manufacture. Its process enables cards to be
printed and have chips embedded in one step.
Willi Truckenbrod, Sempac's vice-president for marketing, says manufacturing
costs can be cut by up to 50 per cent. This is because its system uses four
machines instead of the eight or more in other techniques, though the Sempac
output of 700 or more cards an hour is less than in rival systems.
The main technologies used for smart cards are: the lamination of several
layers, with the chip module then placed into cavities; processing of cards
in large sheets with the cavities milled into the card; and cards with
pre-moulded cavities. Sempac's process uses semiconductor assembly
technology with injection moulding machinery.
Truckenbrod says some 300m smart cards are now produced a year, which is
expected to rise rapidly to 1bn, mainly in Europe. Its customers include
Rexroth Electronic of Germany, which has ordered an assembly line to make
forgery-proof cards in which colour photographs and computerised data are
printed on to the plastic.
Sempac has held talks with the Chinese who are thinking off issuing smart
identity cards to Hong Kong inhabitants when they take over there in 1997.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Labour attacks utilities over avoidance of VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, ALISON SMITH and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday accused Britain's gas and electricity companies of
depriving the government of millions of pounds in potential revenue by
allowing customers to pay for supplies in advance and so avoid paying some
value added tax when it is levied on domestic fuel.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the government could lose up to
Pounds 100m of revenue as customers rushed to pay for future gas and
electricity consumption before the introduction of 8 per cent VAT on fuel on
April 1.
Mr Brown said that gas and electricity companies would make windfall profits
from the interest earned on customers' advance payments. About 300,000
customers had taken advantage of pre-payment schemes and the figure was
likely to rise sharply in the next 10 days. 'The system benefits those who
have money and who need VAT help least. It gives no benefit to those who are
poor,' he said.
Some of Britain's building societies expressed concern yesterday that they
were suffering a large outflow of money as customers sought to make the
pre-payments. City economists have suggested that the overall transfer of
funds from banks to the energy suppliers could be as high as Pounds 1bn.
Last Friday Building Societies Association figures showed that in February
societies suffered an outflow of Pounds 404m from their retail funds - the
highest for 7 1/2 years. Mr Adrian Coles, the association's
director-general, said: 'It has been a factor, and will be one in March as
well.'
According to Labour party calculations about Pounds 10m is being transferred
in advance payments each day.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said yesterday that the flow
of funds from the retail banking sector was so great that it might be
difficult for the government to bring about another cut in interest rates.
Treasury officials have said, however, that there is little the government
can do to change the long-standing principle that VAT can be charged and
paid in advance for goods and not merely at point of sale.
Sir John Cope, paymaster general, said imposition of VAT on domestic fuel
would 'raise revenue in as fair a way as possible.' He accused Labour of
seeking to 'pile more taxes onto British business' and compared advance
payments to pre-budget purchases of alcohol and tobacco.
He said: 'To have stopped that would have involved an enormous amount of red
tape for everyone. That is the Labour way, but it certainly is not the
Conservative way.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Patten halts reform tide for schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No more education legislation is planned for England and Wales in the
lifetime of this parliament, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said
yesterday.
Mr Patten's pledge was interpreted as an attempt to pacify teachers' unions,
which are still considering a boycott of this summer's national curriculum
tests.
He said the legislation to set up a quango for administering teacher
training was 'the last major piece in the jigsaw' of a new settlement for
education which has been introduced by successive acts of parliament since
1988.
Education department officials said several measures to widen the scope of
nursery education would still be possible. But significant changes to the
system controlling primary and secondary schools would not be possible.
The announcement appears to rule out speculation that the government could
force all schools to opt out of local authority control. This would require
primary legislation.
Financial incentives for schools to opt out will be increased, however.
Mr Patten also announced an extension of the government's specialist
colleges plan, which will not be open to local authority schools. He said:
'By the autumn I hope to be in a position to invite bids from those wishing
to set up business and language schools specialising in three or more
foreign languages linked to business studies.'
He said that the scheme, to run on the same lines as the technology colleges
announced earlier this month, would produce 'youngsters able to make the
most of the opportunities offered by the single European market'. Schools
would be required to raise Pounds 100,000 from business sponsors, which
would be matched pound-for-pound by the government.
Mr Patten hopes to invite bids for schools to become specialist sports
colleges at the same time, although business interest has been harder to
define.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers reacted angrily. He said: 'It is
profoundly unhelpful to suggest that some schools specialise in languages,
business studies, sports and so forth. All schools should offer these and
other subjects.
The Standing Conference on Schools' Science and Technology launched a scheme
which will aim to help 2,000 primary school teachers each year in teaching
science and technology.
Ciba, the Swiss chemicals company which is underwriting the scheme, said it
was concentrating on primary schools because many teachers were not fully
qualified in science.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Mr Punch plans comeback with aid of Tidy sum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stories about the death of Punch, a battered remnant of the traditional
British sense of humour, have been greatly exaggerated it seems. Two years
after United Newspapers quietly interred the 150-year-old satirical magazine
because of its mounting losses, Punch is showing signs of life.
Mr Gary Smith, chief executive of Winchester, the merchandising company
which owns the worldwide rights to the cartoon series Love Is . . . and the
cartoonist Mr Bill Tidy, who drew for Punch for three decades, are believed
to be in advanced negotiations with United.
Mr Tidy has been trying to find financial backing to buy and relaunch the
magazine for some time.
Its assets include not only the title but also a library containing bound
volumes of every issue of the magazine, more than 2,000 original cartoons
and the lunch table where the very famous were encouraged to carve their
names. Many of the cartoons are still in demand for use in other
publications.
Mr Smith said yesterday: 'We never comment on market rumours.'
Such a purchase would fit Winchester's ambitions to accumulate rights to
characters such as Mr Punch that are suitable for merchandising.
Mr Tidy is interested in ensuring that such a prominent shop window for the
cartoonist's art does not perish.
Winchester recently completed a flotation which raised Pounds 1.5m so the
company is in a position to buy the Punch assets, although it is believed to
have other expansion plans including producing a film called Rainbow.
United has made no secret of its intention to sell the Punch title although
the library still earns some money in reproduction fees. No contracts have
yet been signed with Winchester and Mr Tidy, although a deal is believed to
be close.
Punch closed on April 8 1992 after a decision that funding the magazine's
Pounds 1m-a-year losses was no longer funny.
The magazine's recent history has been one of sad decline. From a peak
circulation of about 175,000 in the 1940s it fell below 100,000 in 1976 and
reached an average of only 33,000 in 1991.
Punch suffered from the reputation of being a dentists' waiting-room
publication and from growing competition from sharper-edged publications
such as Private Eye. The British sense of humour may also have changed.
Mr Smith and Mr Tidy look as if they may manage to revive Mr Punch. But
making the comeback permanent will still be a considerable challenge to
their sense of humour.

FT  22 MAR 94 / London post office staff likely to strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Post office counter staff in London look likely to take industrial action
before the end of the month.
Yesterday it was announced they had voted by a three-to-one majority to back
their trade union's call for disruption in protest at main post office
closures.
There was a 45 per cent turnout in the postal ballot called by the Union of
Communication Workers with 664 backing industrial action and 243 voting
against.
The union's executive committee is due to meet today to decide its next
move. Mr Ernie Dudley, the union's national officer for Post Office counter
staff, called on the public to join staff in calling for a halt to closures
and franchising of services in London.
More than 120 main post offices in London have shut since 1989 while across
the country 650 have been cut.
Mr Dudley said the public was suffering from an inferior service as post
office counters were opened in supermarkets.
He said: 'They are putting profit before service. They employ staff who are
inexperienced, poorly trained and badly paid which causes problems and
threatens service quality. These closures are quite simply ripping the heart
out of communities.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / The construction industry: have the foundations been laid
for recovery?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decline in the construction industry has halted and a slow recovery
appears to be under way, recently published statistics suggest, Andrew
Taylor writes.
They show output no longer declining and construction orders rising
consistently since the autumn in almost every sector. Bricks, cement and
ready-mixed concrete sales have increased, albeit slowly, for the first time
since the late 1980s.
Prices of some building materials have started to rise, increasing pressure
on contractors to put up their own prices. Commercial property sales have
risen, although it will be a long time before this works through to
increased development activity.
Housebuilding is leading the way out of recession. Demand for new homes has
increased as the cost of buying has fallen to the lowest for more than a
decade. Prices have also started to edge up again, according to building
societies.
The Building Societies Association says net new mortgage commitments, the
best guide to demand for home loans, totalled Pounds 2.93bn last month, a
7.8 per cent increase on last February.
The pace of recovery for the construction industry as a whole is likely to
remain slow, reflecting the faltering nature of the recovery in the general
economy.
Companies remain concerned that recent progress could be reversed if the
fragile confidence of prospective house buyers were sapped by tax increases
scheduled for the end of this month.
Contractors and building material producers are alarmed that efforts to
restrain public spending could damage parts of the industry further if the
government announced further reductions in the road programme.
Demand over the next few years is expected to remain well below levels in
the late 1980s.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Construction output
UK construction output is forecast to rise by up to 2 per cent this
year, having fallen by a similar amount in 1993. Since 1990 the annual
value of output at constant prices has fallen by more than 12 per cent.
Orders won by contractors in the UK rose by 30 per cent during the
three months to the end of January 1994 compared with the corresponding
period 12 months earlier. The value of orders in constant prices rose
last year by 12 per cent, the first annual increase since 1988.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Building equipment
Unit sales rose 42 per cent last year after falling 45 per cent in the
previous three years. The Corporate Intelligence Group forecasts a
further 11 per cent rise this year, still leaving sales at 1986-87
levels.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Housing starts
Builders started work on 185,400 homes last year, an increase of 18.4
per cent on 1992. This was the first annual increase since 1988. Work
was started on 142,200 private sector homes last year, also an increase
of more than 18 per cent.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Construction company failures
About 640 companies went into receivership in the 12 months to last
December compared to 977 in the year before. There were 27 company
failures last December, compared with 78 in December 1992, according
to accountants Touche Ross.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. House sales
Total house sales rose by 5 per cent last year to 1.19m. This was the
first annual rise since 1988, when 2.15m sales were recorded, according
to Inland Revenue conveyancing figures.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
6. House prices
The annual rise in house prices increased to 3.8 per cent in February,
according to the Halifax Building Society. It expects prices on average
to rise by about 5 per cent this year, following a 1.2 per cent
increase last year, the first annual increase recorded by the society
since 1990.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Building materials
Bricks: Unit sales rose by 6.8 per cent to 3.13bn, the first annual
increase since 1988 when the industry sold 4.72bn bricks.
Cement: Sales are estimated to have risen by 5 per cent during the
first 10 weeks of this year compared with the corresponding period in
1993. Annual sales last year were flat, having fallen by a third since
1989.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Employees in industry
Employment peaked at 1.85m in 1989. By this January it had fallen to
1.4m, with a sharp rise in self-employment offsetting a fall in direct
employment.
Building employers say there is little sign of recent increases in
orders feeding through into jobs. At their most optimistic they say
that employment stabilised late last year.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Value of overseas acquisitions rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies spent Pounds 2.2bn on acquisitions of overseas companies in the
fourth quarter of last year, figures published yesterday by the Central
Statistical Office show.
Expenditure on overseas acquisitions for the whole of last year was Pounds
9.3bn, compared with Pounds 7.2bn in 1992.
While the value of transactions increased last year the number of deals fell
to 452, from 679 in 1992.
The CSO said US acquisitions accounted for 53 per cent of the value of deals
done during the year, compared with 29 per cent in 1992.
Spending on UK acquisitions by overseas companies rose to Pounds 4.7bn, from
Pounds 4.1bn in 1992.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Pledge sought on Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French-owned company hoping to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder
in receivership, said yesterday it would not bid for the company unless it
received immediate assurances about the Ministry of Defence's future policy
on awarding naval contracts.
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie said it wanted written confirmation
that if it bought Swan Hunter:
It would be allowed to tender for future MoD contracts.
Its tenders, provided they were competitive, would be given equal
consideration to those of rival UK yards.
The MoD's Defence Export Services Organisation would support it in the
export field.
CMN is the only company to confirm that it intends bidding for Swan Hunter.
But yesterday joint receiver Mr Ed James, of Price Waterhouse, said:
'Discussions are continuing with a number of parties working towards a
deadline of March 24.'
This date is the MoD's deadline for tenders for the Sir Bedivere refit, a
contract worth about Pounds 30m for which there will be fierce competition.
While in receivership Swans cannot win unless its tender is underwritten by
a prospective purchaser. A bid for Swans from any company is likely to be
conditional on winning the Sir Bedivere refit.
Mr Fred Henderson, leader of the CMN bid team, said that in spite of
receiving 'lots of verbal come-on' during months of talks with the MoD, CMN
had not received categorical assurances on future policy. Unless this was
obtained in writing by tomorrow CMN would not bid for Swan Hunter and would
not underwrite its tender for the assault ship Sir Bedivere.
'There's no point making a final bid for the yard unless we get these
assurances,' he said. Swans needed UK defence contracts to compete with
credibility for overseas naval orders.
Mr Henderson said: 'If it really is the situation that the British
government would rather Swans did not survive we would want to know before
we bought it.'
The MoD said it had no objection to Swans in foreign ownership bidding for
MoD work provided it was on a sound financial footing, could comply with
national security arrangements and guarantee any MoD work would be done in
the UK.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Non-EU trade deficit narrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's visible trade deficit with non-European Union countries narrowed to
Pounds 672m in February from a revised Pounds 788m in January. But the
improvement disguised a continued deterioration in trade volumes.
Over the three months to February the volume of UK imports - excluding oil
and erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones - was 3.5 per cent
higher than in the previous three months, while exports rose by only 2 per
cent.
Import volumes in February were the highest ever recorded. The Central
Statistical Office estimates that, on a trend basis, import volumes are
rising by 1 per cent a month while exports are broadly unchanged.
The deterioration in volume terms has been disguised by an improvement in
the terms of trade. British exporters have been increasing their prices
while import prices have been falling.
Over the three months to February, export prices were 7 per cent higher than
in the same three months a year ago, while import prices were 1.5 per cent
lower.
The main reason for the improvement in the headline figure in February was
the oil balance, which improved to a surplus of Pounds 14m from a deficit of
Pounds 75m in January. If oil and erratics are excluded the trade deficit
widened to Pounds 673m in February from Pounds 612m in January.
In the three months to February the deficit, exc-luding oil and erratics,
was Pounds 1.76bn, compared with Pounds 1.71bn in the previous three months.
One encouraging trend is that, according to the CSO, imports of intermediate
and capital goods increased in the three months to February while imports of
consumer goods, excluding cars, fell. This suggests that the rise in imports
is due to manufacturers expanding capacity rather than a consumer boom
sucking in imports.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said the outlook for
exports was relatively bright as world trade grew and Britain remained
competitive.
Figures for trade outside the EU are compiled separately from, and published
earlier than, those for trade with Britain's EU partners.
The EU figures for December were published earlier this month and showed a
sharp deterioration, with a deficit rising to Pounds 903m from Pounds 543m
in November.
The trade figures for the EU are compiled under a new system - Intrastat -
which is based on value added tax, and the statistics are regarded as
unreliable.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Revenue faces 3,000 job cuts in tax system shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue said yesterday that it would lose up to 3,000 jobs as a
result of the introduction of self-assessment for tax by the end of the
century.
About half of the cuts will be made in the 1998-99 tax year and the rest in
the following year. There are no plans to cut jobs during implementation of
the system.
Estimates of the number and timing of staff reductions have been circulating
in the last few weeks as part of the process of planning for the
introduction of self-assessment, which starts in the 1996-97 tax year.
The system, details of which are contained in the finance bill, will shift
the responsibility for assessment of liabilities from Revenue officials to
up to 9m taxpayers and their professional advisers.
Mr Tony Kuczys, project leader for self-assessment at the Revenue, said
3,000 was a net figure after significant shifts of staff from assessment to
both greater taxpayer assistance and to increased compliance efforts.
He said that self-assessment should bring similar savings to taxpayers. 'The
current system is based on 19th-century legislation that leads to a great
deal of rigmarole for both us and taxpayers. We are trying to cut through
all that.'
The job cuts will form part of the reduction of 10 per cent to 15 per cent
in staffing over 10 years which was announced by the government two years
ago. This equates to between 7,000 and 11,000 jobs.
Details of the prospective cuts sparked strong opposition from unions
yesterday. Mr Doug Gowan of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation said: 'We
are not anti-efficiency but we do think because of the complexity of
self-assessment it will require more staff helping taxpayers and in
compliance.'
The Revenue stressed that it planned to avoid compulsory redundancies
wherever possible.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Rural stress seen in farmer suicides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stress, loneliness and de-pression are rife in rural communities and farmers
have one of the highest suicide rates of any occupational group, a
conference in Warwickshire heard yesterday.
The suicide rate among male farmers and farm workers is 187 per million,
compared with the national average of 110 per million. About 39 per cent of
suicides use shotguns or other firearms, easily available on the farm. Only
vets, who often share the rural isolation and have access to drugs, have a
markedly higher level of suicides.
The National Farmers' Union said: 'Farmers are up there with vets, dentists
and pharmacists as the groups having the highest suicide rates.'
The conference on rural stress, organised by a coalition including the NFU,
the Department of Health, the agriculture ministry and the Samaritans, heard
that causes included poor rural services, long working hours, unpredictable
weather and a sense of having little control over the future of the farming
business.
The decline of agriculture has cut the farming workforce by more than half
to 622,000 in the past two decades. The NFU said people were leaving the
land at an average of about 6,000 a year, putting added pressure on those
who remained.
The industry faced further change, with the reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy and the conclusion of a world trade deal likely to lead
to more production cuts and greater rural unemployment.
Public opposition to the set-aside programme, under which Brussels pays
arable farmers to leave some of their land idle to cut overproduction, was
making things worse.
The NFU said: 'They're seen as jolly farmers racing round the countryside in
their Range Rovers not doing very much on the farm, and in most cases
they're saying that's not true. The public doesn't understand the grim
reality of farming.'
The Department of Health is funding a two-year research project by Oxford
University into the causes of rural stress and how it might be eased.
Health professionals will be encouraged to learn more about the problems
facing farming so that they can discuss these when they detect signs of
stress.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Consumer confidence sinks to four-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer confidence con-tinues to decline as April's tax rises approach and
is at a four-year low, according to a new poll.
Gallup found in its March survey of consumer confidence that 42 per cent of
people think that their household's financial position will deteriorate in
the next 12 months and only 17 per cent think it will improve.
The balance of pessimists over optimists has risen for two successive months
and is at its worst level since April 1990.
Consumers have also become more pessimistic about the prospects for the
economy in general.
While 23 per cent of people think that the economic situation will improve
in the next 12 months, 40 per cent of people say that it will deteriorate.
The negative balance of 17 per cent is the worst since February last year.
People are increasingly concerned about unemployment. The balance of people
expecting a rise in the number of jobless in the next 12 months against
those expecting a decline is 44 per cent, up from 33 per cent in February.
The survey shows more people are thinking of postponing their spending.
Gallup reports that a balance of only 9 per cent of people say that there is
an advantage in making an important purchase now, down from 11 per cent last
month.
Gallup says the survey's findings suggest 'that many people are expecting to
be worse off when the new tax year begins, and this obviously has serious
implications for the strength of economic recovery'.
The report says that next month's survey may show more confidence in the
recovery since February's fall in unemployment was announced too late in
March to influence people's feelings for this month's poll.
The survey of 2,029 people was conducted by Gallup for the European
Commission between March 3 and March 15.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Calls to backdate change in insolvency law resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, ANDREW JACK and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night resisted demands for the emergency legislation on
insolvency to be made retrospective to 1986 to safeguard the position of
insolvency practitioners appointed as administrators and receivers to
companies in trouble.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, described as 'speculative'
estimates that practitioners could face claims of up to Pounds 1bn if the
Insolvency (No 2) Bill, which yesterday passed through all its Commons
stages, takes effect only from March 15 1994.
From that date the bill protects administrators and receivers from the
consequences of a Court of Appeal ruling on Paramount Airways which in
effect made them responsible for the contractual employment obligations of a
company after 14 days.
The Confederation of British Industry and the British Bankers' Association
have called in the past few days for the legislation to be made
retrospective as far back as the introduction of the 1986 Insolvency Act.
The latest estimates from the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency suggest
about Pounds 500m could be at stake in additional employment obligations
following the ruling.
Mr Hamilton told MPs it was possible that an appeal against the judgment
could still be considered by the Lords in its judicial capacity. The bill
comes before the Lords today.
He said the government had not been persuaded that the arguments about the
possible liabilities facing accountancy firms justified making the
legislation retrospective to December 31 1986.
Mr Hamilton assured MPs that if developments resulted in the accountants
facing a 'serious problem' the government would be prepared to consider the
matter further.
Mr Stuart Bell, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said parliament
should use its power to pass retrospective legislation if the original 1986
Insolvency Act, which had given rise to the problem, was shown to be
defective.
Meanwhile, the administrators to Paramount Airways at accountancy firm
Touche Ross are expected to start their appeal to the Lords today. If the
appeal fails practitioners may search for alternative test cases, delaying
further payments to creditors while the position is clarified.

All unions with political funds have to ballot every 10 years on whether to
keep them.
Almost all unions have already won endorsement for their political funds in

A senior Ministry of Defence official was found guilty yesterday of
accepting bribes in an armaments contract fraud.
Mr Bernard Trevelyan, head of the ministry's light armoured engineering
systems, used a front company to leak technical and financial secrets on
orders, Southwark Crown Court heard.
Mr Trevelyan was convicted on four counts of corruption involving a total of
Pounds 8,652 and one charge of attempted corruption, which could have netted
him Pounds 28,580. He was acquitted on three corruption charges. Sentence
was adjourned until April 22 for reports.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Bad debts hit profit at Unity Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unity Trust, Britain's trade union bank, suffered a fall in the size of its
retained profit to Pounds 104,000 last year, compared with Pounds 364,000 in
1992, Robert Taylor writes.
It said yesterday when announcing its results for its tenth year of
operation that the fall was partly because of provision for bad debts and
partly because of investment in new services, particularly pensions.
Operating profit before bad-debt provision and taxation was Pounds 2.3m last
year compared with Pounds 1.7m in 1992. Operating income rose to Pounds
7.18m last year from Pounds 6.08m in 1992. Last year the bank wrote off
Pounds 5.72m of bad debt.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Receivers close Daf chapter with final sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Administrative receivers yesterday completed the sale of the last part of
Leyland Daf, the former UK subsidiary of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle
maker which collapsed last February with debts of more than Fl 3bn (Pounds
1.1bn).
The former Leyland Daf test track and technical centre at Leyland,
Lancashire, was sold to a combined management buy-out and buy-in team led by
Mr Peter Capon, former Leyland Daf product development director.
It is understood that the receivers - Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop
of Arthur Andersen - have raised about Pounds 110m net from the sale of the
various Leyland Daf businesses, but it is unlikely that there will be any
payment to ordinary creditors.
After the payment of preferred creditors, the bank consortium led by
ABN-Amro of the Netherlands, which includes National Westminster, Lloyds and
Barclays, is expected to receive about Pounds 100m.
The new company, Leyland Technical Centre, has financial support from
Barclays.
The administrative receivers have secured the survival of all the elements
of the former Leyland Daf business by splitting it into independent units.
Mr McKillop yesterday welcomed emergency legislation to clarify insolvency
practice. Without it, he said, the rescue of a business as large and complex
as Leyland Daf would not be possible in future.
The Leyland centre sold yesterday was completed in 1980 at a cost of Pounds
27m. The new company, Leyland Technical Centre, will employ 53 people and
will seek contracts from vehicle and components manufacturers.
The first breakthrough was achieved in late April last year when the
receivers sold the former Leyland Daf van operations, based in Birmingham,
to a management buy-out team, saving about 1,000 jobs.
The early rescue last year by the Dutch and Flemish governments of the
former Daf heavy truck operations in the Netherlands and Belgium - now
trading as Daf Trucks - was the key to the viability of the rest of the UK
operations.
Daf Trucks is the main customer for Lancashire-based Leyland Trucks, sold to
a management buy-out team last June.
Daf Trucks also took over the former UK sales and marketing operation of
Leyland Daf from the receivers.
The receivers created separate rescues for:
The former Leyland Daf spare parts sales and distribution business in
Chorley, Lancashire with 350 jobs, which is now trading as Multipart
Distribution.
The components manufacturing businesses in Glasgow and Leyland, now trading
as Albion Automotive.
The six African subsidiaries sold to local businesses.
The engine reconditioning plant at St Helens, Lancashire, sold to British
Polar Engines.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Rescue plans 'impractical'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government proposals intended to help companies facing financial
difficulties to survive could be counter-productive, the British Bankers'
Association said yesterday.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds bank and association
vice-president, said: 'There is a real risk the proposals would work in the
opposite direction.'
The association gave a cautious welcome to the consultation paper on
insolvency when it was published by the Department of Trade and Industry
late last year.
The paper suggested that companies should have a 'breathing space' of 28
days, renewable for up to three months, while they tried to find proposals
acceptable to creditors representing at least 75 per cent of their debts.
Mr Pitman said yesterday legislation that impaired the rights of a bank  -
or another lender which had taken a floating charge - could lead to banks
reducing the amounts they were prepared to lend against stock and debts. He
criticised the proposal under which banks would have to give seven days'
notice of their intention to appoint receivers as 'impractical'.
The association also has reservations about proposals in a DTI consultation
paper on late payment of commercial debt. The paper includes the possibility
of introducing a statutory right to interest on late payment.
The Institute of Directors said a statutory right would alter the behaviour
of companies which found it advantageous to pay after the due date.
But the association doubted whether such an arrangement would work. 'One of
the worries is that in practice many small business would decide it was not
worth the candle, since it would so offend their customers that they could
suffer more,' Mr Pitman said.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Pension scheme compromise wins support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals aimed at ensuring that occupational pension schemes will not have
to sell equities and buy bonds to meet suggested rules on solvency have won
tentative support from the government.
Actuaries had warned that large-scale withdrawals from equities would have
severely depressed the market.
However, the proposals may require legislation allowing pension scheme
trustees to give members less than their actual accrued benefits if a scheme
is wound up. The proposals broadly follow recommendations from the Institute
and Faculty of Actuaries.
Mr Peter Tompkins, partner at consulting actuaries Lane, Clark and Peacock,
said: 'What lawyers have drawn attention to is that there will be cases
where pension schemes are a bit short.'
But he added that the pensions industry believes a 'watertight' solvency
standard would be far too expensive for employers to bear and would
discourage them from offering final-salary schemes.
The proposals, to be sent today to employer groups such as the Confederation
of British Industry, relate to so-called minimum solvency standards proposed
by the government's Pension Law Review Committee. That committee, chaired by
Professor Roy Goode, proposed that schemes be required to have almost enough
assets so that each member could receive cash to buy out their accrued
benefits.
However, the deferred annuity contracts, which would be used to secure
pension rights in such circumstances, are linked to yields on government
gilts, while the average scheme has about 80 per cent of its assets in
equities.
Because gilts have historically yielded less than equities, pension funds
would have to sell equities and employers would have to top up their cash
position to allow the funds to buy gilts.
Only then could the fund be sure of having enough assets to secure benefits
in the event of wind-up.
The CBI and parts of the pension fund industry have objected to the minimum
solvency proposals since they were made last September, arguing that they
would create an additional burden on employers.
But the actuarial profession has proposed a new way of calculating minimum
solvency. For younger scheme members, actuaries could compute cash
equivalent values assuming investment in equities, and gradually shift
towards gilt yields as employees aged.
The government is suggesting that pension schemes have at least five years
to phase in the solvency rules after an omnibus pension reform bill is
passed, probably next year or in 1996. The government is also prepared to
allow schemes which fall short of the 90 per cent of minimum solvency to
have a longer period in which to add assets to their fund.
The government is considering whether it should set the standards by which
actuaries will calculate minimum solvency or whether it should leave it to
scheme actuaries.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Transport police muddle resolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears expressed by Labour MPs that the jurisdiction of British Transport
Police may be curtailed to provide new business for private-sector security
companies were rejected by the government in the Commons last night.
Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, insisted that a bill hurriedly
introduced to repair an omission in the legislation privatising British Rail
would ensure that the jurisdiction and powers of the transport police were
unimpaired.
The error arose because the railway privatisation act ignored several
amendments to the act that nationalised the railways which had widened the
powers of transport police.
In effect, the legislation would have allowed transport police to deal with
incidents affecting privatised railway companies but would have prevented
them carrying out further inquiries.
Transport police also warned that the legislation as it stood made it
unclear whether they would have the authority to pursue offenders outside
railway property.
Mr Freeman confirmed that the transport police would have 'complete
jurisdiction' wherever necessary when pursuing a suspect off railway
premises.
The transport police (jurisdiction) bill now goes to the House of Lords.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, urged the Lords to examine the
bill closely to ensure that it would not lead to more of the railway network
being exempted from coverage by the transport police.
Mr Dobson warned that if the bill resulted in the ending of the transport
police's comprehensive coverage of the rail network it would become more
vulnerable.
He said that the bill had been introduced as an emergency measure because of
'another fine mess' by the government.
Mr Freeman said some 'non-core activities', such as the guarding of freight
depots, might be undertaken by private security companies.

FT  22 MAR 94 / MPs to be lobbied on mine pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cross-party delegation of Durham county councillors will today lobby MPs
and the House of Lords in an attempt to win amendments to the Coal Industry
bill, Chris Tighe writes.
The delegation wants the bill to spell out who will be legally and
financially responsible for minewater pollution, subsidence and methane gas
build-up arising from abandoned and working mines after the industry is
privatised.
The sudden closure of all Durham's remaining pits, removing British Coal's
operational need for minewater pumping, has sparked particular concern in
the county but the issue has implications for other British coalfields.
Bodies including the Country Landowners Association, the National Farmers
Union and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have urged the
government to make explicit provision in the bill for the transfer of
environmental liabilities. The government has said it considers the bill as
now drafted to be adequate.
Today's delegation will also press for a commitment from the government that
British Coal and its successor, the Coal Authority, will continue to pump
minewater until a satisfactory solution is achieved, and will be given
adequate government resources to meet environmental responsibilities.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Icelandic trawler detained in disputed Rockall waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Icelandic-owned fishing vessel, the Rex, is being held in Stornoway
Harbour, Lewis, for alleged illegal fishing in disputed waters near Rockall
island.
The trawler was spotted by a Fisheries Protection Agency plane on Sunday
about 150 miles west of Rockall, claimed as British territory since 1955. An
agency patrol boat and the Royal Navy vessel HMS Orkney escorted the Rex to
Stornoway. According to the Fishery Limits Act any unlicensed foreign vessel
caught fishing within 200 miles of British territory is breaking the law.
Ownership of Rockall, which is 200 miles west of the Outer Hebrides and
uninhabited, is disputed. Iceland and Denmark claimed in 1985 that Rockall
was within a 'continental-shelf boundary' around their countries, which
would give them territorial rights. The Irish republic also rejects
Britain's claim to the island, which is only a few hundred square yards.
The Foreign Office said: 'As far as we are concerned it is not disputed at
all.'
The waters around Rockall are valuable for fishing and there is strong
evidence of oil below the island.
The skipper of the Rex could be liable for a fine of up to Pounds 50,000.
Mr Helgi Agustsson, Iceland's ambassador to Britain, said his government had
offered the owners help in finding legal assistance.
Iceland maintains that uninhabited rocks are not a basis for the extension
of fishing limits but is not planning to file a claim on Rockall.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Matrix prosecutor attacks Whitehall secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief prosecutor in the Matrix Churchill trial yesterday launched a
scathing attack on the conduct of Whitehall in the case at the heart of the
arms-for-Iraq affair.
Mr Alan Moses QC told the Scott inquiry that if he had been told by
officials about the extent of their knowledge of British arms-related
exports to Iraq he would not have gone ahead with the case.
He said: 'The people concerned should have told the prosecution that their
position was: 'We knew as near as dammit that it was going to military
production'.'
Mr Moses described the difficulties he faced in gathering relevant Whitehall
documents and in obtaining truthful witness statements.
The inquiry heard that among the documents Mr Moses was not shown before the
trial was an intelligence report in October 1989 from GCHQ, the government
listening post. This linked Matrix Churchill to Iraq's military build-up.
Mr Moses said this had been the 'most disturbing omission' as it seemed to
him the 'clearest possible indication of (government) knowledge' and thus
supported the case for the defence in the Matrix Churchill trial. 'I can't
understand why on earth I didn't know about it. I can't say I would have
gone on with the prosecution had I known,' he said.
He said that in preparing his case he had not been shown documents relating
to the minutes of the Restricted Enforcement Unit, a secretive Whitehall
department, where Customs, intelligence officers, and officials exchanged
information about arms exports to Iraq.
Mr Moses described the obfuscation he encountered at the heart of Whitehall
on the eve of the trial. He had been given access to key files held by the
cabinet office only on the Friday before the Monday on which the trial had
been due to start. The files include many which the Scott inquiry has been
examining.
He and a senior Customs investigator had been led into the office of Sir
Robin Butler, the head of the civil service, and left alone at a table with
badly identified and unsorted files. Mr Moses said: 'I was furious . . .
what I should have done was walk out and say . . . these are not the
circumstances, on the last working day before a trial, for me to look at
anything sensibly.'
Mr Moses criticised by name only Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister,
for being responsible for the eventual collapse of the trial. He said Mr
Clark had given evidence at the trial which was inconsistent with what he
had told Customs officials in pre-trial witness statements.
But he said government lawyers had used 'red pens' on draft witness
statements by civil servants, with the apparent intention of preventing
wider knowledge of 'what had been said to whom'.
Mr Moses said he understood officials at the Department of Trade and
Industry had been unhappy with the trial because 'it was going to expose all
the defects in the system'.
Customs, said Mr Moses, had been both determined to make up for the 'laxity'
of the DTI and to reassert its independence from government interference.
Mr Moses admitted that as prosecuting counsel he bore some responsibility
for not having made a greater effort in securing the necessary information
before the trial.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, came under renewed pressure from
Labour MPs in the Commons yesterday to explain the decisions he had taken
over the Matrix Churchill trial, James Blitz writes.
He said that he was 'looking forward' to giving evidence to the inquiry on
Thursday, when MPs would hear his record of events.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Industry plans may form Tory agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has set up a high-level cabinet committee to oversee the
government's planned white paper on competitiveness.
The move has reinforced suggestions in Whitehall that the prime minister
wants the document to become a mid-term manifesto for his government rather
than a more narrow analysis of the immediate problems facing manufacturing
industry.
Mr Major has told colleagues that he intends to make enhancing Britain's
competitive edge a central theme in the second half of the present
parliament.
The white paper will thus be expected to pull together all of the policies
which have an impact on the success of British industry.
Ministers serving on the committee say they plan to combine a detailed
assessment of how British industry is faring on world markets with a much
broader view of the fundamental forces underlying competitiveness.
That implies a reassessment of the government's approach to education and
training; a further drive to encourage the private sector to take on
large-scale infrastructure projects, and a commitment to maintain the pace
of deregulation.
Early drafts circulating to members of the committee also emphasise an
overriding commitment to a stable macro-economic framework and to keeping
business taxes low.
The committee, chaired by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, is hamstrung to a degree by the Treasury's insistence that the
white paper must not be an excuse for increased public spending.
In spite of his avowed support for the private-sector financing initiative,
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is being accused by cabinet colleagues of
being over-zealous in his defence of the Treasury's public borrowing rules.
But ministers still see an opportunity in the white paper to give coherence
to a disparate range of policies which have all been aimed at giving support
to manufacturing industry.
Mr Major is particularly keen to see a much closer relationship between the
government's education and training policies with an emphasis on breaking
down the distinctions between academic and vocational qualifications.
Some ministers also want Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, to take
the opportunity to revamp the government's approach to training by
restructuring Training and Enterprise Councils.
For its part, Mr Heseltine's department is examining ways in which the
government can help to build stronger links between industry and the City
and methods of bolstering government support for British exporters.

FT  22 MAR 94 / BBC to end Far East TV service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC World Service Television broadcasts from London to northern Asia will
cease in a month under a deal signed yesterday between the BBC and Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation.
The BBC will give up its broadcasts to north eastern China, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Korea and Mongolia on the northern beam of the Star TV satellite
system from April 17.
In return Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general and chairman of World
Service Television, has negotiated a contract extension to preserve
broadcasts to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Both the BBC and News Corporation had the right to terminate the Star
contract by the end of this year. Mr Murdoch, who bought control of Star
last year, made it clear he wanted the BBC off the system.
The BBC negotiated the compromise in return for vacating early the northern
beam, which Mr Murdoch wants for a Chinese-language film channel aimed at
Taiwan. An announcement on the channel is expected this month.
The BBC will be able to continue broadcasting its news and information
channel on the southern beam until at least the end of March 1996.
No other satellites are available in the region at the moment but the BBC
believes that before March 1996 there could be at least three.
Mr Phillis said yesterday the BBC regretted the withdrawal or contraction of
any service but the agreement with Star TV placed no restriction on the
BBC's future access to the region.
The BBC will now push ahead with plans to launch an Arabic language
satellite service in the Middle East by the autumn. It has also finally
signed a joint venture deal to launch a service in Japan.
Ten thousand BBC technical and production staff are to hold a strike ballot
over proposed changes to working practices and the introduction of
performance-related pay. This follows the breakdown of talks between the
management and broadcasting union Bectu.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Sky faces another challenge from pirates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sky Television is facing another challenge from pirates selling unauthorised
cards to unlock its scrambled subscription channels.
A Bristol-based company is advertising pirate cards which allow viewers to
avoid payment for satellite subscription services such as sport and film
channels. Telephone callers to Euroservices of Kingswood are told that for
Pounds 89.99 an unauthorised card will be provided. This will unlock all
available subscription television channels.
Sky and News Datacom, the 'smart card' decoder company, said in October that
they would pursue pirates in the courts.
A representative of Euroservices said yesterday: 'It's not illegal to sell
the cards. It's not illegal for you to buy them, but it is illegal to use
them. What you do in your own home is your business.'
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act it is, however, illegal to advertise, sell
or use unauthorised cards. Sky Television - a consortium in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - has already taken legal action
against a number of other pirate suppliers.
The Euroservices technical department said that the cards had a detachable
chip. If satellite companies took anti-piracy measures and changed the
broadcast signal a new chip would be sent within three days at no extra
charge. It said the cards were being imported rather than produced locally.
The price of Pounds 89.99 is one of the cheapest on offer so far. Sky
charges Pounds 19.99 a month for a package that includes all its
subscription channels.
European satellite television operators are so concerned about the threat
from pirate cards that they have formed an international group to
co-ordinate counter-measures.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Cross-border united front on Ulster restored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London and Dublin yesterday sought to restore a united front for their joint
Northern Ireland peace initiative after remarks at the weekend by Mr Dick
Spring, the Irish foreign minister, raised fears of a rift.
Senior ministers from both countries, including Mr Spring, joined forces to
emphasise that there could be no negotiations with Sinn Fein without a
permanent end to IRA violence.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, edged towards accepting
Mr Spring's weekend message that a temporary IRA ceasefire would be 'a step
in the right direction'. Sir Patrick acknowledged that a temporary ceasefire
would be 'better than violence'.
Their efforts came as the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic
Unionist party, emerged from a stormy meeting with Mr John Major to declare
that June's European elections in Ulster would in effect be a referendum on
the Downing Street declaration.
Mr Paisley said he intended to meet the prime minister again after the DUP
had secured 'a firm mandate from the people'.
The DUP leader - whose party is boycotting the political talks process  -
traditionally secures the biggest vote in the province's European elections.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, said Mr Major 'took Mr
Paisley to task' for misinterpreting the joint declaration on a number of
occasions, and areas of common ground were 'fairly few and far between' in
the course of a 'very frank' 30-minute meeting.
Downing Street officials said Mr Major told Mr Paisley and his DUP
colleagues that he had a UK-wide mandate for the task of stopping the
day-to-day horror in Northern Ireland.
In Dublin, Mr Spring and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, emphasised
after talks that there would be no negotiations with Sinn Fein unless there
was 'a clear and unequivocal renunciation of violence' by the IRA. But Mr
Spring reiterated that Dublin would seek to build on any temporary IRA
ceasefire.
Mr Hurd used a speech in Dublin to the Institute of European Affairs to
argue that the relationship between Britain and Ireland had been transformed
and was 'no longer transfixed by difficulties rooted in the past'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has called for the structure of
local government to be left alone in Oxfordshire, which includes his
constituency of Witney.
He is the first cabinet minister to express publicly opposition to the local
government review, which is drawing up plans to replace the present two-tier
structure of counties and districts with 'unitary' authorities.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has said he only expects to see
two tiers survive in exceptional circumstances in any area.
But Mr Hurd said: 'I have come to the firm conclusion that the right answer
is to leave things as they are.' There was a theoretical case for unitary
authorities but he doubted whether the advantages outweighed the dislocation
and possible expense. He had detected 'no popular demand for change'.
The Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, is due to
announce plans for restructuring Oxfordshire and 11 other counties in early
June.
Plans for the reorganisation have raised alarm about the effects on
education, currently a county responsibility.
Ms Margaret Morrissey, co-ordinator of the National Confederation of
Parent-Teacher Associations, said parents' groups were campaigning against
the move, which they feared could leave schools under-resourced.

cell ablaze.
More than 2,000 prisoners went on the rampage at Pietermaritzburg prison, in
Natal, and prisons spokesman, Colonel Barry Eksteen, said warders fired
teargas in an attempt to control the inmates. He said some 120 people were
injured.
Prisoners on death row at Pretoria jail also joined the protest, setting 18
cells alight, and destroying bedding and furniture. The authorities gave no

FT  22 MAR 94 / N Korea's 'sea of fire' threat shakes Seoul: Pyongyang may
be set on cultivating a nuclear madman image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mood in Seoul has turned distinctly sombre since last Saturday when the
chief North Korean delegate at an inter-Korean meeting declared: 'Seoul will
turn into a sea of fire.'
After four decades, South Koreans had thought they had grown accustomed to
the bellicose rhetoric of their northern brothers. But the inflammatory
remarks by Mr Pak Yong-su are the talk of Seoul; the average South Korean
has been made starkly aware of the potential seriousness resulting from the
dispute over the North's nuclear programme.
It was the first time in more than two decades that North Korea had
threatened the possibility of war in a meeting with South Korea. But South
Koreans appeared more shocked by the personal threats directed against their
delegates and journalists attending the meeting at the truce village of
Panmunjom.
The outburst was triggered when Mr Song Young-dae, the chief delegate for
South Korea, mentioned the possibility of UN sanctions being applied against
North Korea for its refusal to accept full international nuclear
inspections.
'It does not matter what sanctions are applied against us. We are ready to
respond with an eye for an eye and a war for a war,' said Mr Pak.
'Seoul is not far away from here. If a war breaks out, Seoul will turn into
a sea of fire. Mr Song, you won't survive the war,' he added.
Meanwhile, North Korean journalists covering the meeting were telling their
southern counterparts: 'You'd better prepare passports for flight to the US
if you are not prepared to risk your life for your country.'
But some government officials in Seoul yesterday were speculating that the
barrage of insulting comments was carefully orchestrated and that North
Korea is deliberately cultivating a 'madman' image as a new psychological
negotiating tactic to win concessions.
'The North's whole strategy on the nuclear issue is based on intimidation,
playing on international fears that they will lash out if they are pushed
too far,' one government official said.
The prevalent view in Seoul has long been that North Korea has fostered its
image as a nuclear power to try to blackmail the US into granting
concessions, including diplomatic recognition, the lifting of trade
sanctions and the supply of aid for its tottering economy.
Some analysts even believe the North is now blocking full inspections by the
International Atomic Energy Agency not because it has something to hide, but
because it does not want to disclose that its nuclear programme is an empty
threat. This would seriously weaken its negotiating position.
Most officials in Seoul are convinced that the North is pursuing a nuclear
weapons programme, although Pyongyang might agree to abandon it if the US
offers concessions.
Complicating the game of diplomatic poker are signs of a power struggle in
Pyongyang over the nuclear issue.
Economic pragmatists, who want to open the country to foreign investment in
a Chinese-style reform programme, may be urging President Kim Il-sung to
play the nuclear card soon to avoid further international isolation. Plans
to create economic zones for foreign investment have proceeded apace in
parallel with the nuclear dispute over the past year.
But the conservative old guard fears that allowing foreign influence into
the country will undermine the government. They view a nuclear programme as
their chief security guarantee against absorption by the South.
What has added to the North's frustration in reaching an agreement with the
US is the involvement of South Korea in the negotiations. Seoul has insisted
that Pyongyang fulfil its 1991 bilateral non-nuclear pact before the US
makes significant concessions to North Korea. Washington has supported the
South Korean stance.
North Korea has consistently sought to establish ties with the US and ignore
South Korea's demands in an attempt to drive a wedge between Seoul and
Washington. Pyongyang used a similar 'divide and rule' strategy in playing
off its former patrons, China and the Soviet Union, to gain concessions from
both and maintain its independence.
The vehemence of Mr Pak's remarks against the South Korean delegates
reflects Pyongyang's belief that Seoul is trying to block a direct deal
between North Korea and the US.
But government officials in Seoul believe that the North Koreans may have
miscalculated this time with the 'sea of fire' outburst. 'Many South Koreans
appeared to have been little concerned about the nuclear problem,' said Mr
Kim Jong-pil, the chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party. 'They
will now have to wake up from their illusions and prepare to meet the
situation quietly but firmly.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / Self-reliance may soon be put to the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea has preached for years that its ideology of juche
(self-reliance) is one of the world's greatest doctrines. It may soon find
that principle put to the test if the UN Security Council imposes economic
sanctions for Pyongyang's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear
facilities.
The self-sufficient nature of North Korea's economy is likely to enable it
to withstand several years' sanctions. Analysts also believe sanctions would
do little to stop vital food and oil supplies from China and
foreign-exchange transfers from Japan.
One reason is that North Korea's border with north-eastern China is porous
and that Chinese officials would covertly support continued trade even if
Beijing would allow a sanctions resolution to pass the Security Council.
'The last thing China wants is to see North Korea collapse on its doorstep
and have refugees pour across its border,' said Mr Michael Breen, a North
Korean analyst for Merit Communications in Seoul.
China accounts for three-fourths of the energy and food supplies imported by
North Korea and is Pyongyang's largest trading partner at an estimated
Dollars 860m (Pounds 577m) in 1993. Those supplies are important to bridge
the shortages that North Korea suffers.
Although Japan has said it would support economic sanctions, it may have
difficulty in stopping hard-currency transfers, estimated at between Dollars
600m and Dollars 1.8bn, that flow annually from Korean residents living in
Japan.
'The remittances might be regarded as humanitarian aid and thus would not be
subject to UN sanctions since they are given, at least theoretically, by
Korean-Japanese to support their relatives in North Korea,' one South Korean
government official explained.
Japanese officials have expressed reservations about clamping down on funds
to North Korea. They fear that stopping the money transfers would lead to
terrorist acts ordered from Pyongyang and carried out by some of the
estimated 260,000 pro-North Korean-Japanese.
Sanctions would stop North Korea's trade with Japan, its second largest
trading partner with an estimated volume of Dollars 480m last year. Trade
would cease with Russia and South Korea, North Korea's next largest trading
partners, which supply oil and food products.
North Korea's arms exports, one of its biggest foreign currency earners,
would also be cut off if a naval blockade was imposed. This would lead to a
collapse in trade with Iran, which supplies oil in exchange for Scud
missiles.
Sanctions would eventually take their toll on North Korea if they were
rigidly enforced. South Korea estimates that while the North needs 6.6m
tonnes of grain to feed its people, it produced only 3.88m tonnes last year
due to poor weather and a lack of fertilisers. The country is also running
out of anthracite coal, its main source of energy. It produced 29m tonnes
last year, far short of the 52m tonnes needed to keep its factories running
at full capacity.
North Korea could make up the shortfall by drawing on its war reserves of
food and oil. Some analysts warn Pyongyang might fulfil its threat of war in
response to sanctions, from fear its defence would be weakened if it was
forced to use emergency stocks to support the economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talks continued late yesterday between Palestinian and Israeli officials
about measures to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories, but
Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said they expected the
discussions to adjourn without a solution to the row which has stalled
resumption of full peace talks between the two sides.
Mr Dennis Ross, the US Middle East peace envoy, arrived in Tunis for the
second time in a week to join the talks. He described only as 'useful' an
early session with Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. Mr Ross is expected to
continue his shuttle with stops today in Jordan and Egypt - where he will
meet President Hosni Mubarak.
However, PLO officials in Tunis said they did not expect Mr Ross to be
carrying a solution to the dispute about protection of Palestinians in the
occupied territories which has stalled resumption of full PLO-Israeli talks
since the Hebron massacre more than three weeks ago.
The PLO has insisted that Israel must toughen its control of Jewish settlers
in the occupied territories and accept the UN call, made in resolution 904
last week, to install an international presence to safeguard Palestinian
security in the occupied territories. The PLO leadership has said it cannot
otherwise resume full peace talks with Israel.
PLO officials said the Israeli delegation in Tunis, led by Mr Uri Savir, had
rejected a call to remove Jewish settlers from the centre of Hebron and had
instead proposed gathering all the settlers together in Hebron as a means of
increasing control over them. This suggestion was dismissed by one PLO
official as 'unacceptable'.
PLO officials in Tunis said both sides were nevertheless exchanging ideas,
but that 'nothing has crystalised yet'. The officials said they did not
expect the Tunis talks to continue into today. 'We have a long way to go
before we can resolve this,' said one.

Bombay
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan has closed its consulate general in Bombay in a move which is
likely to inflame its diplomatic conflict with India.
Pakistani officials accused India of making it impossible for the consulate
to function by refusing to grant Pakistan the use of Jinnah House - the
Bombay home of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's independence leader and first
governor-general.
The move follows weeks of public argument between the two countries over the
troubled north Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, part of which is claimed
by Pakistan.
Pakistan earlier this month failed in a high-profile attempt to persuade the
United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva to send a fact-finding
mission to Kashmir. Pakistan argued that Indian security forces were
committing atrocities against the mainly Moslem population of the Kashmir
valley but it failed to secure sufficient support from other countries.
Diplomats in Delhi are concerned that the decision to close the Bombay
consulate general, which opened only in August 1992, may start a series of
damaging diplomatic actions by the government of Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto.
Indian officials, delighted with Pakistan's debacle in Geneva, are keen to
prevent the 'internationalisation' of the Kashmir troubles, which Delhi
treats primarily as a domestic security problem.
But they also want to keep foreign countries informed of India's views on
the troubles, notably that Kashmiri Moslem insurgents are supplied with arms
and advisers from Pakistan.
Indian officials will have an opportunity to present their case to two US
officials who are visiting India - Ms Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of
state responsible for south Asia, who arrives on a four-day trip tomorrow,
and Mr Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary, who is due to visit next month. Mr
Talbott will go to Pakistan.

<TEXT>
When China's Premier Li Peng hinted at the weekend the US should make some
gesture towards recognising North Korea, he was repeating standard Chinese
advice for easing the nuclear crisis.
But Beijing's prescription for dealing with a rogue regime appears not to be
attracting much support in the west, where pressure is building for stronger
UN condemnation and possible trade sanctions.
It is this latter possibility that alarms China. At this stage, it would be
likely to oppose vigorously any attempt to impose economic penalties on
North Korea.
The question for the US and other western powers would be whether to risk
fracturing the Security Council consensus, or yielding to Chinese pressure
for further diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis.
Western officials in China believe Security Council consensus would be hard
to achieve on any punitive measures. At best, Beijing may be persuaded to
abstain on a resolution of condemnation. They contrast the North Korea
crisis and the Gulf War of 1990-91, in which China abstained on the vote
imposing sanctions against Iraq, but fell into line on implementing them.
This time, the stakes for China are higher and the complications infinitely
greater. North Korea may be seen in the west as a renegade state, but to the
Chinese, North Koreans have been allies in war, and their two countries
share a common border and a fairly extensive trading relationship.
Chinese leaders may well regard recent developments in North Korea with
dismay and its idiosyncratic leadership a menace to civilisation. But they
seem firm in their views that confrontation carries greater risks than
likely rewards.
The immediate question for western powers is whether to give quiet Chinese
diplomacy further scope and possibly active encouragement without any real
hope that such an approach might work.
Chinese officials believe the west has failed to appreciate fully the depths
of North Korean paranoia over its growing isolation following the collapse
of the Soviet Union, the virtual disappearance of friends in eastern Europe,
and vast changes in China, which proved a less-than-steadfast ally by
normalising relations with South Korea in 1992.
These officials say Pyongyang wants to reduce its isolation, and it is
prepared to make concessions to escape from its predicament; hence Beijing's
advice to the US that they should try to avoid at all costs placing the
North Koreans in a corner.

Hizbollah guerrillas yesterday killed two Israeli soldiers and two allied
militiamen in a series of attacks against Israel's occupation zone in south
Lebanon, Reuter reports from Marjayoun. Israeli reprisal shelling killed a
12-year-old schoolgirl and wounded 22 other school-children in the market
town of Nabatiyeh, witnesses said. Guerrillas firing anti-tank rockets and
machine guns ambushed an Israeli army patrol in the Rihan area just inside
the 15km deep zone. The pro-Iranian Hizbollah said five Israeli soldiers
were killed or wounded in the ambush.

FT  22 MAR 94 / The Israeli security leak that could save Rabin: David
Horovitz on the prime minister and the judicial inquiry into the massacre in
Hebron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until this week, few Israelis had heard of the 'Territories Forum,' a
top-secret gathering at which Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister and
defence minister, hosts his most senior army and intelligence officers for
discussions on all aspects of the Israeli presence in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
Now the existence of this forum has taken on tremendous importance: a
meeting held last October may prove crucial to Mr Rabin's efforts to avoid
taking personal responsibility for failing to prevent the massacre last
month of Palestinian worshippers at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs by
Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein.
On October 16 last year, the Moslem authorities in Hebron sent Mr Rabin a
letter, accusing a settler they named only as 'Baruch' of attacking Moslem
guards and pouring acid on Moslem prayer mats in the mosque. The Moslem
authorities insist now that the 'Baruch' in question was Goldstein -
although they didn't know his surname at the time, they had witnesses who
could have described him to Mr Rabin or any Israeli investigating official.
Mr Rabin never responded to their letter.
However, on October 22, at the defence ministry in Tel Aviv, he convened the
Territories Forum. According to an excerpt from the minutes, leaked to the
Israeli media this week, Mr Rabin warned his top officers that, among West
Bank settlers, were several individuals who would stop at nothing to torpedo
the peace process.
The acid-pouring incident 'must put us on alert', he cautioned. 'I wouldn't
be surprised if there were those among the Jews who don't just want to
destroy prayer mats, but who will try to create a religious conflict to
destroy the peace deal as well.'
The aim of this extraordinary leak, from the highly-confidential discussions
of a security forum, seems plain: to demonstrate that, months before
Goldstein carried out the massacre, Mr Rabin had urged his commanders to
take precautions against precisely such an incident. And while, as minister
of defence, Mr Rabin in theory carries ultimate responsibility for the
entire Israeli military establishment, the leak seems clearly designed to
exonerate him from personal blame. The guilty men, runs the implication, are
the commanders in the field who failed to heed his warning.
In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, Mr Rabin at first resisted calls
for the appointment of an independent commission of inquiry, fearful, it was
presumed, that the finger of blame might point in his direction. He only
gave in when he realised how overwhelming was the cabinet majority against
him.
Now, day after day, new evidence is emerging of security blunders, imperfect
precautions and unclear orders at the tomb. Low-ranking soldiers have been
blatantly contradicting evidence given by their decorated seniors. The
stench of failure is rising ever-higher. Tomorrow the commander of the
army's Central Command, General Danny Yatom, is being recalled to testify
again about open-fire regulations - approved late last year both by Mr Rabin
and by chief of staff Ehud Barak - which some soldiers interpreted as
forbidding them ever to shoot at settlers. Later tomorrow, chief of staff
Barak is himself to give evidence.
Officials at the inquiry refuse to say whether Mr Rabin will also be called.
But there are reports that he has instructed a lawyer attached to his
office, Shmuel Hollander, to begin gathering relevant material, just in
case.
Mr Rabin knows he may have cause for concern. The Kahan Commission of
inquiry, which investigated the massacre in 1982 of Palestinians at Beirut's
Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps, found that Ariel Sharon should have
realised Christian Phalangists were 'liable to commit atrocities' against
the Palestinians, and in the end forced Mr Sharon's resignation as defence
minister.
Mr Moshe Negbi, Israel's most prominent legal analyst, says that the present
commission under the chairmanship of Meir Shamgar, the Supreme Court
president, has equivalent powers to the Kahan Commission, that at some stage
he believes Mr Rabin will be summoned, and that 'there is a possibility' the
inquiry could badly damage him.
As the army's top legal officer in the 1960s, Mr Justice Shamgar worked
closely with then-chief-of-staff Rabin. Last year, a full
quarter-of-a-century on, after Mr Rabin had ordered 400 alleged Islamic
militants into exile, it was Mr Justice Shamgar who headed the Supreme Court
panel that allowed the deportations to proceed, saving Mr Rabin from
considerable embarrassment and possibly resignation.
One question is whether the commission will consider Mr Rabin's warning on
October 22 to his commanders as sufficient grounds for his exoneration.
After all, the inquiry has heard that the army's governing strategy in
devising security precautions at the Cave of the Patriarchs was that while
an attack by Arabs on Jews was quite probable, an attack by Jews on Arabs
was unthinkable.

The European Union has imposed tariffs of nearly 50 per cent on Chinese and
South African imports of ferro-silicon, a material used in iron and steel
production, saying these producers are dumping their products on EU markets.
The tariffs, which will last for five years, follow a six-month commission
study which shows thatin the last four years Chinese and South African
imports have risen from 9,000 tonnes to 31,000 tonnes while European
production has fallen from 190,000 tonnes to 102,000 tonnes, the study says.
Chinese and South African imports now represent 6 per cent of the market.
The new anti-dumping tariffs, which came into effect on Sunday, will be set
at 49.7 per cent for Chinese imports, and 47.4 per cent for most South
African imports.

FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Super 301 is not for you, EU told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US has sought to ease transatlantic trade tensions by insisting it is
not considering invoking Super 301 sanctions in its disputes with Brussels
over public procurement and audio-visual markets.
Mr Stuart Eizenstat, the US ambassador to the EU, also expressed cautious
optimism Washington was making progress in its efforts to improve European
understanding of its attempts to open Japan's market.
'There is at least a beginning of (EU) interest in talking to the US and
trying to learn more,' he said. However, their approaches still differed
widely, and Brussels' suspicions of US tactics remained high.
Although Mr Eizenstat said the US would continue a firm line with Brussels
on outstanding bilateral trade problems, his generally conciliatory tone
suggests Washington is anxious to lower the temperature of its dealings with
the EU.
In particular, he went out of his way to soothe recent concern in Brussels
that Washington would take Super 301 action unless the EU acted more
decisively to open its telecommunications equipment markets to foreign
suppliers.
The EU and the US are holding further talks on public procurement in
Washington this week to try to resolve their differences before next month's
ministerial conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in
Marrakesh.
Although the two sides have sought to clarify their dispute by commissioning
an independent study of transatlantic procurement markets, their
interpretations of its preliminary findings appear to differ sharply.
The EU claims the study shows US markets are less open than its own. But Mr
Eizenstat said the study merely confirmed the lack of transparency in
tendering for European state and municipal contracts.
He said the US was taking a 'co-operative' stance on audio-visual trade,
where its main priority was to avoid further EU broadcasting restrictions.
Washington hoped talks between entertainment industries on both sides of the
Atlantic would lead to a more open EU market and increased collaboration.
The US would accept the outcome of a forthcoming review by Brussels of a
five-year exemption from competition law of the leading Hollywood studios'
European distribution arrangements, providing the case was a given 'a
transparent, fair, due-process hearing on its merits'.
Mr Eizenstat said he was 'gravely concerned' that that objective could be
prejudiced by recent moves in the European Parliament in support of Europe's
television industry and statements by Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European
culture commissioner.
Mr Eizenstat said the US and the EU had 'an identity of interest' in working
to cut the Japanese trade surplus, but Japan had obscured it by persuading
Brussels that Washington was engaged in an attempt to manage trade.
He did not want the EU and the US to give the impression that they were
'ganging up' on Japan. 'If we the EU understands what we're up to, if we can
get the EU to focus on its own self-interest, it would send an important
signal.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Americas embrace 'open regionalism' -
Stephen Fidler on rapid - some say worrying - trade integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic integration in Latin America seems to be going forward at breakneck
pace. Hardly a week passes without a trade deal being signed or a new
initiative announced.
In the last few weeks, Brazil has launched an initiative for a South
American free trade area and Mexico has signed a free trade agreement with
Costa Rica.
The US administration also has announced that a summit of the leaders of
elected governments in the Americas would be held in Miami in December. Free
trade in the western hemisphere will be one of the main talking points, with
the coming into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the
US, Canada and Mexico at the start of the year.
These government moves are being accompanied by a sharp rise in trade within
the region. Other Latin American countries accounted for 16.7 per cent of
the region's exports in 1992, up from 10.8 per cent in 1990, according to
the Economic Commission for Latin America. Trade expanded by more than 50
per cent in 1991 and 1992 and grew further last year. US exports to Latin
America have doubled in seven years, rising to more than Dollars 80bn in
1993.
Most governments claim the proliferation of free trade areas, customs unions
and bilateral trade deals point in one direction - to what they call open
regionalism. This means intensifying their relationships with other
countries in the region while remaining open to the outside world.
But not everybody believes that the haphazard network of trade alliances is
necessarily benign. Mr Moises Naim, senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment in Washington and a former Venezuelan minister, says that far from
being the building blocks of a hemispheric free trade zone, sub-regional
free trade agreements 'are more likely to be stumbling blocks'.
The Madrid-based Institute for European-Latin American Relations argued last
year that the current round of market-driven regional trade accords - with
ever greater links between those countries with the most dynamic economies -
could reinforce rather than reduce wealth differentials among countries in
the region.
Even free trade with the US may not yield many trade benefits. A 1992 report
from two World Bank economists suggested only Brazil and Mexico would
benefit substantially from free trade with the US since most exports from
most other countries already face low duties there.
In July, Washington will name those countries that, in principle, would be
eligible to negotiate free trade agreements with the US. The nomination does
not commit the US to negotiations and says nothing about whether accession
to Nafta or a bilateral trade accord with the US is the right way forward.
The list will be next reviewed in 1997.
In spite of the lack of trade benefits, most Latin governments will be
anxious to see their names on the list. They are emphasising other reasons
for joining Nafta: insurance in case the world further develops into
regional trade blocs and the increased investment they believe is implied by
being in the Nafta club.
The process towards Nafta may not be that easy. Despite its promises to
Chile that it will be next on the US free trade agenda, the administration
of President Bill Clinton may not want to open another trade debate in a
hurry. A lot of political capital was spent on securing the Nafta accord and
other countries do not have the strategic significance to the US that Mexico
has.
Nonetheless, Nafta's attraction may well loosen the ties that are binding
Latin American countries together. Argentina is generally thought to be next
in line after Chile for Nafta treatment, but it is committed to negotiate
with the US as part of Mercosur, a regional common market to come into force
next year with Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil.
Yet Brazil's economic problems and the traditional mistrust of its
governments for the US mean that Nafta is a low priority for Brazil.
While Mercosur governments this month reiterated their intention of trying
to negotiate jointly with third parties such as the US, Brazil also took the
opportunity to launch its own South American free trade zone. The Brazilian
government stressed that this was not meant to be a competitor to Nafta and
that the two initiatives were complementary.
But to some governments in the region, the initiative looks like a Brazilian
attempt to recover some political weight lost in the region over the last
decade and to counterbalance North American influence.
Whatever the case, some economists believe the idea may have real economic
merit if it gives neighbouring countries free access to the big and still
relatively protected Brazilian market.
'In the short run,' says Mr Naim, 'Latin American exports could increase
more through freer access to the Brazilian market than they could by signing
a free trade agreement with the US.'

FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Caution on labour rights sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday warned industrialised countries not to use trade
sanctions to enforce environmental or labour standards.
'Simplistic demands for drastic trade remedies against so-called eco-dumping
or social-dumping' sometimes bore a striking similarity to more conventional
protectionist rhetoric, he said. In some ways they were more dangerous
because of their popular emotional appeal.
Mr Sutherland's remarks, in a speech for delivery to the Canadian Club in
Toronto, can be interpreted as a caution to the US and some European nations
which are keen to see environmental objectives and worker rights put on the
agenda for future trade talks.
Gatt members are currently trying to draw up a work programme on trade and
the environment. However, developing countries are fiercely resisting any
suggestion that this should include discussion of 'levelling the competitive
playing field' by harmonising national environmental standards. Worker
rights is an even more sensitive issue.
Mr Sutherland said increased pressures for industrial adjustment as a result
of the globalisation of trade and production threatened to overload the rich
world's economic and political circuits. Differing approaches by newcomers
to environmental protection or social welfare were proving a touchstone for
claims that these countries wielded unfair trade advantages which must be
met by trade restrictions.
'Resisting adjustment on the grounds of discredited theories of the threat
of 'pauper labour' will impoverish our societies all the faster, not lay the
grounds for rejuvenation of our economies and the creation of well paid new
jobs,' he said.

<TEXT>
The US is coming under mounting criticism from some of its most important
trading partners for its apparent willingness to consider delaying the
implementation of the Uruguay Round of trade agreements until next year.
Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and Singapore all attacked the US at the
weekend meeting of finance ministers from the 18-nation Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation forum in Hawaii, warning that any slippage from the US
could encourage other countries to delay carrying out their own promises to
cut tariffs and reduce trade barriers.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, told his colleagues that the
Clinton administration was committed to completing the agreement this year,
or at the latest in the first half of next year. This assurance did not,
however, satisfy all his fellow ministers.
Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, warned: 'It would be a tragedy if
the immense human effort that led us to this agreement - which brought with
it so much expectation of improved world trading relations and economic
performance - were now to be postponed and perhaps dissipated through slow
implementation.'
The Uruguay Round of negotiations to liberalise the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade is due to be wrapped up in Marrakesh next month, but the
US has recently indicated that it might not be able to ratify the agreement
this year.
Mr Richard Gephardt, the leader of the majority Democrats in the House of
Representatives, has warned that it will be difficult to get agreement on
the tax increases or spending cuts which, under US budget rules, will be
required to offset revenue lost from the tariff cuts the US has agreed to.
'It can be done this year, but I'm not sure it needs to be done this year,'
Mr Gephardt said.
Other countries are indignant at the idea that the Gatt deal might be held
up because of revenue supposedly lost, since the whole premise of the pact
is that it will boost growth, and hence government revenue, around the
world.
The Uruguay Round tariff cuts are estimated to cost the US government around
Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in tax revenue over five years, but Mr Mickey
Kantor, the US trade representative, told Congress last week that the Gatt
agreement would bring in an extra Dollars 3 in federal tax revenue for every
Dollars 1 of lost import duties.

One of the most senior politicians named in an inquiry into corruption in
Brazil's Congress yesterday announced his resignation as a congressman.
Mr Genebaldo Correia, former leader of the Party of the Brazilian Democratic
Movement (PMDB), the country's largest, was one of 18 politicians named in
the investigation's final report, released in January. It alleged a
widespread network of corruption by a government budget committee, which
involved politicians earning fees in return for approving building
contracts.
Further investigations are under way and Congress is expected to vote
whether to expel the 18 in the next few weeks.

The Clinton Administration is rushing Dollars 30m of emergency assistance to
fishing communities in the north-east suffering from a collapse in fish
stocks.
The US Commerce Department said this was the first crisis in the fishing
industry which warranted extensive federal assistance. Some 20,000 jobs are
in jeopardy from the fall-off in stocks and new federal rules designed to
rebuild them.
Washington is still worried about jobs, which are being created at a slower
rate than in past economic recoveries. Such funding as is available in these
days of stringent budgetary restraint is given high profile treatment.
The Commerce Department credited the assistance to President Clinton's trip
to Boston last week when he directed Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary and Mr
Leon Panetta, office of management and budget director, to develop an aid
package for New England. The department had been working on the package for
several weeks.
Mr Brown was in Boston yesterday with members of New England's congressional
delegation, Massachusetts governor Mr William Weld, a Republican, and
members of fishing communities to make the announcement.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Left set to force second poll in Salvador
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN SALVADOR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The race for the presidency in El Salvador is likely to go to a second
round, according to preliminary results of Sunday's poll - the first to be
held since the end of a bloody civil war two years ago.
With 75 per cent of the votes counted the supreme electoral tribunal
declared that Mr Armando Calderon Sol of the ruling Arena party was ahead of
Mr Ruben Zamora by 49.26 per cent to 25.59 per cent. Mr Zamora is running
for a left-wing coalition including the former FMLN guerrillas. A first
round victory would require 50 per cent or more of the vote.
President of the tribunal, Mr Lus Arturo Zaldivar said: 'Looking at the
results we have been giving, it makes us think that, yes, there will be a
second election.'
Observers say that although Mr Calderon Sol would be favourite to win a
second round, the right-wing party's failure to secure an outright win would
help provide greater checks and balances in El Salvador's fledgling
democracy. A second election for president would be held on April 24. Mr
Calderon Sol had predicted victory in the first round.
The elections have proved a notable success for the FMLN, which has become
the second most important political force in the country, two years after it
laid down arms following a United Nations-brokered peace agreement.
The FMLN, which was running its own candidates in simultaneous congressional
and municipal elections will now head the opposition in congress and appears
to have won a substantial number of municipalities, particularly in areas
which it controlled during the 12-year civil war.
Election day was marred by irregularities, which the left-wing coalition
said amounted to fraud on the part of the electoral tribunal, controlled by
Arena.
The coalition claimed that various strategies had been used throughout the
electoral process to reduce the number of voters, on the premise that a high
turnout would favour the left.
'The tribunal has done everything to impede the holding of a proper
democratic election,' said Mr Facundo Guardado, a senior FMLN official.
Tens of thousands of voters who had electoral cards were unable to vote
because they did not appear on electoral lists, while some 74,000 people, a
high number of which were from areas believed to be sympathetic to the FMLN,
were excluded because they did not have birth certificates.
FMLN leaders put the the total number of excluded voters at over 300,000.
Most of these are new voters who, they believe, are more likely to support a
left-wing coalition.
The UN mission in El Salvador, which has highlighted the country as a
success story for peace where democracy is being consolidated, played down
the irregularities. However, independent observers have questioned the will
of the tribunal to ensure the election was as free and fair as possible.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A former Arkansas municipal judge, who has alleged a link between President
Bill Clinton and a questionable loan in the Whitewater affair, will today
enter a plea bargain with Mr Robert Fiske, the prosecutor investigating the
affair.
Mr David Hale was to go to trial on March 28 on four felony charges
unrelated to Whitewater. However, as part of his plea bargain over these
charges he has agreed to testify on Mr Clinton's alleged role in Whitewater.
Whitewater was the name of an Arkansas holiday development in which Mr and
Mrs Clinton invested with their friends, Mr James McDougal, head of the
Madison Guaranty savings and loan institution, and his wife Susan.
Questions have been raised about the Clintons' investment and whether Mr
McDougal illegally funnelled depositors' money into Whitewater and to retire
a Clinton campaign debt.
Mr Hale had offered last September to testify that Mr Clinton eight years
ago pressured him to make a Dollars 300,000 loan to Mrs McDougal. Mr Hale
then owned a company which made loans backed by the Small Business
Administration.
The loan to Mrs McDougal went to her small public relations company. Mr Hale
alleges some of the money went to the Whitewater account.
Mr Clinton has long denied exerting pressure on Mr Hale to make the loan and
claims not to remember the loan at all. Justice Department lawyers rejected
Mr Hale's story, However, Mr Fiske is more interested. After pleading to
lesser charges, Mr Hale will be brought before the grand jury on Whitewater.
Mr Hale admitted misleading the SBA about his assets to get additional
federal funds.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Land fuels quest for Hawaiian sovereignty: George Graham on
a struggle for nationhood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One hundred and one years after the overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani by a US
gunboat acting on behalf of white sugar planters, native Hawaiians are
striking back.
Sovereignty for the indigenous people of Hawaii has become one of the most
fiercely debated political issues in the Pacific archipelago, and
nationalists see signs that success may be within their grasp.
A sovereignty advisory committee appointed by Mr John Waihee, the first
Hawaiian to win the governorship, has delivered a report recommending a
plebiscite - to take place perhaps in June next year - on whether to
'restore a sovereign Hawaiian nation'.
That could lead, in turn, to a constitutional convention for the
establishment of such a nation, which might include 20 per cent of Hawaii's
roughly 1m population. Demands for sovereignty range from autonomy within
the state - such as is enjoyed by a number of other American Indian nations
over education and policing, for instance - to full independence outside the
US.
The resurgence of demands for native Hawaiian rights reflects some of the
islands' complex divisions. Dominated by white Americans, or haole, until
the second world war, Hawaii's political establishment has changed
complexion with the enfranchisement of its inhabitants of Japanese, Chinese
and Filipino origin.
But class divisions overlay the racial splits: for example, Portuguese, who,
like many of the Asian population, came to Hawaii as field labourers, are
not always considered haole.
Although some of the more radical Hawaiian nationalists, such as Professor
Haunani-Kay Trask of the University of Hawaii's Center for Hawaiian studies,
have often been accused of reverse racism, the sovereignty movements insist
on a more inclusive definition of Hawaiian than the state's, which counts
only those with more than 50 per cent Hawaiian blood.
Of all the archipelago's ethnic groups, native Hawaiians have, since the US
takeover in 1893, fared worst. Their life expectancy is five years less than
for all other groups in Hawaii and their high school dropout rate is a third
higher.
They are also the only major native people in the US not to be recognised as
at least partly autonomous by the federal government. But the issue is not
just one of social neglect or cultural identity. It has much to do with 1.6m
acres of Hawaiian crown land held in trust for native Hawaiians who are
supposedly eligible to live on it and farm it.
Native Hawaiians have received some recognition of their claims on these
lands. The state last year agreed to pay Dollars 136m in overdue rent on
ceded Hawaiian crown lands to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a state agency
set up in 1978 whose trustees are elected by people claiming Hawaiian
ancestry.
But the OHA, and this settlement, are greeted with derision by sovereignty
groups such as Ka Lahui, which declared itself a new nation in 1987 and
boasts 23,000 adult members.
The OHA says the Dollars 136m payment from the state in no way extinguishes
the Hawaiians' land claims, but some state officials have suggested
otherwise, and sovereignty activists consider it unlikely that the state
government will willingly abandon the trust lands, which make up virtually
its entire land holdings.
Internal disagreements may have weakened Hawaiians' drive for sovereignty,
but Ms Lilikala Kame'eleihiwa, a Ka Lahui activist and colleague of
Professor Trask's at the University of Hawaii, retorts: 'Hawaiians are
always being compared to crabs in a bucket, all pulling at each other. What
I say to that is crabs don't belong in a bucket; they belong on the beach,
and Hawaiians belong on their land.'
With native Hawaiians making up three quarters of the state's homeless,
other sovereignty groups such as Ohana have begun occupying land to press
their claims to the ceded territories.
The OHA is itself, to some extent, a sovereignty group with 69,000
registered voters, but it is working for the establishment of a Hawaiian
nation within the state of Hawaii along the lines of the other native
American peoples.
'There is one sovereignty movement, though it may be moving in different
directions,' says Ms Linda Delaney, an OHA official. 'Where we do disagree
is in terms of what happens to Hawaiian statehood.' She argues that
Hawaiians have more leverage within the state, where they make up 20 per
cent of the population, than in the wider US.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Krajina talks hold the key to overall peace deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for an overall peace settlement in former Yugoslavia hang in the
balance today, with the Croatian government due to meet Serb leaders of
Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in Croatia.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the region will mediate in
today's negotiations, which are considered crucial for cementing a
settlement between the Bosnian Croats and Moslems. Any such settlement would
determine the status of internal borders in Bosnia and Croatia.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia said yesterday that peace in Bosnia
'will not be reached until the question of Krajina is solved', the Serbian
daily Politika reported.
The future status of Krajina could determine what boundary concessions the
Bosnian Serbs are prepared to make to the Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who
signed an accord in Washington last week.
That accord paves the way for a Bosnian Croat/Moslem federation in one part
of Bosnia which will have a loose confederation relationship with Croatia.
But it failed to address the federation's new boundaries, largely because
any agreement on boundaries depend on what relationship President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia wants with the Bosnian Serbs - and with the Serbs in
Krajina.
An agreement on Krajina's status could also lead to a peace treaty between
Croatia and Serbia.
Mr Tudjman is demanding the return of Serb-held territories to Croatian
control. But Mr Milan Martic, leader of Krajina, who takes instructions from
Mr Milosevic, yesterday repeated that he would accept 'nothing less than
self-determination' for the Serbs. This would amount to independence for
their 'state' carved out during a six-month war in 1991 - something Mr
Tudjman would never accept.
Mr Martic agreed to back the Russian initiative for today's talks, which
will be held in the Russian embassy in Zagreb, partly because Mr Milosevic
wants a peace accord with Croatia which would eventually end sanctions
against his country.
Mr Churkin remains optimistic, according to the Serbian media, which
reported that 'both sides wanted to endorse a settlement'.
Before any real compromises can be made, said Mr Slobodan Jarcevic,
Krajina's foreign minister, the two sides must agree on a ceasefire and the
withdrawal of the Croatian army from Krajina.
According to Belgrade radio, the Serbian delegation will include Admiral
Dusan Rakic, defence minister, General Mile Novakovic, national security
adviser, and Mr Jarcevic.
The Croatian delegation is expected to be led by Mr Hrvoje Sarinic, the
republic's national security adviser.
Meanwhile, in Bosnia, as part of the growing Croat/Moslem rapprochement,
President Alija Izetbegovic invited Mr Tudjman to visit Sarajevo as 'another
step towards implementing the agreement'.
Bosnian Serb forces have positioned weapons inside the exclusion zone around
Sarajevo, the United Nations claimed yesterday. Three tanks, three
anti-aircraft cannon, four howitzers and 18 mortars have been found,
although they are not pointing at Sarajevo and 'are not capable of engaging
Sarajevo', according to a spokesman. The Bosnian Serbs claim the weapons are
outside the zone.

FT  22 MAR 94 / More US aid for Kiev to disarm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, yesterday promised Ukraine an
additional Dollars 100m (Pounds 68.4m) to help dismantle its nuclear
warheads and finance defence industry conversion, Reuters reported from
Kiev.
Mr Perry's visit is part of a broader American effort to reward Ukraine for
its decision last month to give up its nuclear arsenal. The three agreements
he signed in Kiev earmark Dollars 50m to help dismantle the nuclear missiles
in Ukraine, Dollars 40m towards the conversion of Ukraine's powerful
military industries to civilian production, and Dollars 10m to fund tighter
security for the shipment and storage of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Mr
Perry's assertion that America's relationship with Ukraine 'is of great
strategic importance to us' was a welcome signal for his Ukrainian hosts.
The Ukrainians have been feeling increasingly threatened by their Russian

FT  22 MAR 94 / French mainstream parties advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French political landscape has regained a certain stability after the
first round of local elections. Although the governing centre-right parties
underlined their supremacy, the opposition Socialists and their left-wing
allies managed to recover from recent electoral disasters.
The mainstream parties gained at the expense of the fringes. The
environmentalist vote slipped to less than 4 per cent, to the benefit of the
left, and the National Front vote (9.8 per cent) dropped for the first time
for many years below that of the Communist party (11.3 per cent), which
rallied after a long decline. Despite record unemployment and violent
anti-government protests, prime minister Edouard Balladur's coalition won
44.7 per cent of the vote, compared with 43.9 per cent in last year's
legislative poll, and the Socialists and their allies took 28.8 per cent, up
from 20 per cent last year.
In the short-term, therefore, the Balladur government will be reinforced in
its determination not to cede further to the trade unions over its plan to
allow French employers to pay some young people less than the national
minimum wage, in return for extra training-on-the-job. While also continuing
to meet yesterday with the unions to try to win their acquiescence to the
youth wage plan, Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, said over the
weekend the government would stand as firm against the protesters as France
had against the German offensive at Verdun in 1916.
For his part, Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist leader, claimed that his party
had showed itself 'half way' to regaining power.
But in a poll in which almost every party claimed satisfaction, if not
victory, the National Front could point to its success in doubling the vote
it gained in the 1988 cantonal elections, even if it fell well below the 12
per cent it scored in 1992-93 polls. In the south, the National Front did
well in the scandal-ridden Var department, whose president, Mr Maurice
Arreckx, after being questioned by police searching for the killers of the
murdered MP, Mrs Yann Piat, has been forced into a difficult run-off. But
allegations of financial misconduct did no harm to Mr Bernard Tapie, who
came out top in a Marseille canton.
While last Sunday's first voting round was a pure test of parties' relative
popularity, next Sunday's run-off is more complex as eliminated candidates
throw their support to those still in the race. These alliances sometimes
cross the classic left-right divide.
The broader consequence of the polling will be to silence, temporarily at
least, critics of Mr Balladur and Mr Rocard inside their own parties.
Supporters of Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist RPR leader and Mr Balladur's
rival for the presidency, openly acknowledged the poll's apparently positive
verdict on the Balladur government.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Romanian inflation edges up: Economic Watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Romanian consumer prices rose by 5.9 per cent in February, compared with
January, taking the average monthly inflation rate for the first two months
of the year to 5.4 per cent. Consumer prices increased by around 5 per cent
in January over December. Monthly inflation rates were 14 per cent in
November and 7 per cent in December. The country is aiming at inflation in
1994 of 70 to 80 per cent and 35 per cent by the end of 1995, down from
295.5 per cent in 1993. In February, food prices increased by 6.9 per cent,
service prices rose by 6 per cent and prices for commodities increased by
4.7 per cent. Net average wages increased by 4.5 per cent in February,
compared with January, to 106,378 lei (Dollars 1 is worth 1,650 lei).
Industrial production increased by 2.1 per cent in February over January,
but was down by 3.4 per cent from February 1993.
Spain's merchandise trade deficit on a customs basis shrank 47 per cent to
Pts89.69bn (Pounds 431.2m) in January from Pts168.91bn in January 1993. The
January trade deficit was 60 per cent lower than the December shortfall of
Pts221.80bn.
Switzerland's industrial production rose by 4 per cent and new orders to
industry by 1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared with a year
earlier. However, total order books at the end of 1993 were 5 per cent lower
than a year earlier.
Denmark's Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 per cent in February from January,
taking the year-on-year inflation rate to 1.8 per cent.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Turin seeks a new driving force: The city's dependence on
Fiat poses problems for its politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turin does not look like a city with an identity crisis. The graceful
squares and palaces of the centre and the less picturesque factories of the
periphery bear witness to the domination of two dynasties: the royal House
of Savoy and, in this century, the industrial House of Agnelli, founders of
the Fiat motor group.
But this legacy is not enough to sustain the city. At the centre of the
intriguing election campaign being fought on the piazzas and production
lines is the question of Turin's economic and industrial future.
Mr Gino Giugni, labour minister in the country's current technocratic
government, and one of the leading candidates in Turin for the left's
Progressive Alliance, sums up the problem. 'If the city lives by praying to
Fiat, and identifies itself with the Avvocato (Gianni Agnelli, Fiat
chairman), Juventus (the Fiat-controlled Turin soccer team) and other
symbols of Fiat power, then it is destined to decline.'
Turin's dependence on Fiat has benefited the city during the good times, but
when the company is facing difficulties, as it has recently, the city also
suffers.
This is a particular conundrum for the Progressive Alliance. Turin has
always been a citta rossa, a stronghold of the left, which has drawn on the
support of Fiat employees. But advocating that Turin reduce its dependence
Fiat will, not be enough unless the left can also propose alternatives which
will tackle the 11.2 per cent unemployment rate and restore some of the
city's pride.
Mr Giugni points to high-tech industry - for example, telecommunications and
electronics - as one alternative path which the left intends to encourage,
but he admits that north-west Italy still needs to encourage the strong
entrepreneurial spirit which has developed in the north-east.
The days are also gone when the left could rely on the inherent militancy of
the city's workers. In last year's run-offs for the election of a new mayor,
the hard-left candidate was defeated by Mr Valentino Castellani, a
university professor representing the more moderate Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS), the main party in the Progressive Alliance. According to Mr Ezio
Mauro, editor of the Turin-based daily La Stampa, 'that proved that in Turin
a space had opened up in the centre for a non-radical left which could beat
both the right and the radicals'.
Mr Castellani himself admits that the general elections will be a tougher
test of this moderate support. His candidacy for mayor was eventually
supported by the traditional Torinese families, white-collar workers, Fiat
and the city's employers' federation, but opponents say that was mainly
because Mr Castellani represented the lesser of two evils.
This time around, the PDS will have to confront in a direct contest the
challenge of the centre parties, and more importantly, the right-wing
alliance of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new party, Forza Italia, the federalist
Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance.
The PDS may also be handicapped by its uncomfortable alliance with
Reconstructed Communism, the hammer-and-sickle communists who refused to be
absorbed into the reformed PDS. In Turin, the task of playing down the
contradictions is made doubly difficult by the fact that Reconstructed
Communism's leader, the articulate Mr Fausto Bertinotti, is standing for
election there.
As Mr Enzo Ghigo, co-ordinator for Forza Italia in Turin, puts it: 'We are
the real alternative to the left: we are the centre.' Forza Italia and the
League are hoping to encourage support among entrepreneurs and employees by
reducing the cost of employing new, particularly younger, workers, and
encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises. To answer Turin's desire for
more autonomy from Rome, a mild fiscal federalism along US or German lines
is also being stressed.
The Progressive Alliance is likely to win more support in Turin, however, in
spite of these obstacles. One reason is that it has carefully tailored its
party list to run along the city's political dividing lines. Reconstructed
Communism's Mr Bertinotti, for example, is standing in one of the
constituencies dominated by Fiat workers, while in the historic centre the
Progressive Alliance is fielding the moderate PDS candidate Mr Franco
Debenedetti, soft-spoken brother of Carlo, chairman of the Olivetti computer
group.
Mr Debenedetti faces the toughest task of any Progressive Alliance
candidate. One of his opponents is Mr Valerio Zanone, a former mayor
standing for the centre parties; another is Mr Gipo Farassino, who made his
name as a singer of dialect ballads and is now secretary of the Northern
League regional branch.
Mr Farassino is particularly critical of the costly deal struck with Fiat
last month by Mr Giugni in his capacity as labour minister, to avoid big job
losses and industrial unrest in the motor industry. Fiat itself appears not
to be taking sides in the campaign, but the right claims the Giugni accord
may have bought the votes of many of the company's 115,000 Turin workers for
the Progressive Alliance.
But although the agreement should be enough to help Mr Giugni's election,
the big question for Turin is whether it will also buy breathing space after
the poll, during which a new government can help the city develop new
confidence and a new sense of identity.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian state-controlled oil group which is due to be privatised,
has announced job reductions which will lower its workforce by a fifth over
the next two years, Reuter reports from Vienna.
The company said the number of employees at its parent company would be cut
to 4,000 by 1996. That would represent a 50 per cent reduction from a decade
earlier.
A statement said OMV strategy was to strengthen the business 'with the
emphasis on reducing personnel costs.' It would also focus on central
European markets, in particular the growing demand for natural gas.
The statement did not say whether the planned job cuts had been agreed with
union leaders, nor did it remark on their significance for the company's
privatisation prospects.
The Austrian government wants to reduce its 72 per cent stake in OMV to
below 50 per cent through a sale to a strategic partner. Abu Dhabi is tipped
as a leading candidate, but Austrian partners are also being sought.
OMV has said it expects to make a 1993 loss of Sch4.7bn (Pounds 264m),
including restructuring costs.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Italian voters warned of 'conquerors of power'.
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Catholic Church yesterday issued a thinly veiled warning to Italians to
avoid voting for media magnate Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia
movement in the March 27 elections, writes Robert Graham in Rome. A document
from the Italian bishops' conference urged voters to be wary of 'conquerors
of power'.
The church has traditionally warned of the dangers of voting for communists
and the left, and has also never concealed its distaste at the moral tone of
Italian commercial television, mostly controlled by Mr Berlusconi.
But yesterday's document appeared to be an implicit reference to the
political ambitions of Mr Berlusconi and his electoral promises. No other
politician in the campaign has so openly exposed his desire to run the next
government.
Monsignor Dionigi Tettamanzi, the bishops' conference secretary, explaining
the document, reinforced the church's oblique criticism of Mr Berlusconi by
saying that voters should judge electoral policies by their content not
their form. Mr Berlusconi has been promising lower taxes and large-scale
job-creation.
Throughout the post-war era the church has thrown its considerable weight
behind the governing Christian Democrat party.
But with the DC's collapse, it can no longer call for a unified Catholic
vote. Thus Mons Tettamanzi yesterday called for 'coherence' in the catholic
vote - an elegant way of admitting voters face a difficult choice.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Hopes fade for Russia-IMF pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Agreement between Russia and the International Monetary Fund seems unlikely
in the near future, and is likely to require government measures to convince
the Fund that the 1994 budget is viable.
Talks between Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, and Mr
Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the Fund, set for yesterday, were
postponed until today, following Mr Chernomyrdin's sudden decision to fly to
Sochi for talks with President Boris Yeltsin. However, the outline of a
longer term deal is already emerging, though very strong doubts remain on
both sides about its feasibility.
A senior Russian official was quoted as saying that 'the talks have got
nowhere because of the IMF's non-constructive attitude'. Fund officials in
Moscow will not comment on the talks, though sources say they are impatient
with the lack of information provided on the budget.
The talks, which began on Friday, have been going on at two parallel levels.
The first, between Mr Chernomyrdin, Mr Camdessus and Mr John Odling-Smee of
the IMF, focus on broader policy and political aspects of managing the
economy.
The second, involving Mr Sergei Dubinin, the finance minister, and the wider
IMF team, concern the details and the underlying assumptions of the budget.
The key problem for the IMF team is the income side of the budget, where
high inflation and low tax collection point to the government's inability to
collect the Rbs120,000bn for which it has budgeted.
The likelihood is that the IMF will work out with the Russian government
various ways of attempting to increase the tax take - and wait for around
two months to judge whether or not these measures are working.
This approach, a standard IMF technique, would also test how committed Mr
Chernomyrdin's government is to radical economic reform. The prime minister
has repeatedly committed his government to observing the budget, and has in
the past month given other public indications of his desire to continue
economic change.
Mr Mikhail Zadornov, the chairman of the parliamentary budget committee,
said that 'no agreement on the second tranche of the IMF facility is likely
to be signed in the near future' - a prediction with which the Fund and the
government are unlikely to disagree.

Sunday. Itar-Tass news agency said Mr Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of
Primorye region, ordered the polls postponed to October 23. Mr Nazdratenko,
appointed by President Boris Yeltsin, is in dispute with Vladivostok's

Viktor Cherepkov, and last Thursday the governor sent police to evict him
from his offices. Mr Nazdratenko said that he had postponed the elections
because there was no money for them and because of the need 'to find funds

The deal will be its first investment in the property sector and its first
project in St Petersburg. It involves the refurbishment and restoration of
Nevsky Prospekt 25, an 18th century building in the centre of the city. The
refurbished building will provide 10,000 sq m of office and retail space.
The building will be the first substantial development of modern office
space in the city when it is completed in 1995. The EBRD expects the project
to encourage the development of Russia's competitive sector, by enabling
international companies to set up businesses more easily in the city.

Mr Indro Montanelli, the 84-year-old doyen of Italian journalists, was set
to rediscover his voice today as editor-in-chief of a daily newspaper making
its first appearance on the country's news-stands. La Voce, which is
expected to have a liberal political flavour, is published just in time for
next weekend's general election and a few months after Mr Montanelli stepped
down as editor of Il Giornale after the proprietor, Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
entered politics as leader of Forza Italia.
Mr Montanelli, a veteran anti-communist whose support for the populist
Northern League in last year's mayoral elections in Milan is said to have
been worth thousands of votes, is of such stature that his name will appear
under the newspaper's masthead. He has, however, criticised all sections of
the Italian right wing and, in recent interviews, has advised voters to
'choose the lesser evil' by weighing up candidates and voting tactically. La
Voce, a Milan-based broadsheet with an editorial staff of 75, is aiming at a
break-even circulation of 100,000. Financial backers, which include the
Benetton group, are limited to a 4 per cent stake.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French economy is on course for a progressive return to growth this
year, according to the economy ministry, with gross domestic product set to
increase by 1.4 per cent in 1994 and by 2.7 per cent next year.
At present the French economy is still in a fragile state. Business surveys
in recent months have registered an improvement in confidence, but there is
no sign of a pick-up in economic activity and unemployment is still
increasing, albeit at a slower pace. The economy ministry expects the
situation to improve steadily during the coming months and to see
'significant signs of recovery' in the second half of the year as
'reductions in interest rates stimulate consumer demand and industrial
investment'. France, said the ministry, should also benefit from the pick-up
in other European countries.
However, the employment situation is not expected to improve until the
second half of this year, when there may signs of job creation in the
service sector. Retail price inflation should remain low, with the ministry
forecasting a 1.6 per cent increase for 1994 and 1.7 per cent next year.

EU finance ministers yesterday agreed to a Ecu110m (Pounds 83m) balance of
payments loan to Bulgaria. The agreement paves the way for the release of a
Dollars 600m (Pounds 411m) IMF and World Bank package to help the Sofia
government reschedule its Dollars 9.3bn debt to commercial banks.
Ministers held back a further Ecu40m in the hope that a disbursement of
Ecu150m will be matched by other members of the Group of 24 nations,
including Japan and other OECD countries. Without G24 support, Bulgarian
officials have warned that Sofia would have to renegotiate a new package
with the IMF and World Bank. Foreign financing is needed so that Bulgaria
can meet a June 30 deadline for rescheduling its commercial debt. The IMF is
providing stand-by loans and funds of Dollars 400m, with the World Bank
providing Dollars 200m.
Finance ministers agreed to delay offering further macroeconomic aid to
Romania until later this year under the German presidency of the EU. 'The
(reform) situation is not yet ripe,' said one official.

FT  22 MAR 94 / US gives Seoul missile pledge as attack fear rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON, NANCY DUNNE and PATRICK BLUM

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, WASHINGTON, VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US president Bill Clinton yesterday agreed to the deployment of Patriot
missiles to South Korea as a 'purely defensive' move and said the US would
defend South Korea against attack from the communist north.
Mr Clinton's assurances followed defiant statements from Pyongyang claiming
that US demands for further inspections of nuclear sites were 'perfidious
acts . . . creating a grave situation on the Korean peninsula, which may
bring the Korean nation back to the phase of confrontation and war'.
Pyongyang's tough language has prompted concern in Seoul and accelerated
plans for the deployment of Patriots. But the US, while making a show of
toughness, is allowing time for a diplomatic solution. The Patriot missiles
will be sent to South Korea by sea, a voyage that could take as long as
30-45 days.
In response to the mounting tension with North Korea, Mr Clinton said: 'We
have agreed that it is in our national interests and the interest of the
people of South Korea and the security of our armed forces there to proceed
with the Patriot deployment. So we will do that.' Mr Clinton did not
disclose the dates of the deployments or the numbers of missiles involved.
In a letter to President Kim Young-sam, Mr Clinton also said that the US
would defend South Korea if it is attacked by the North.
Pyongyang yesterday maintained its defiant stance against concerted
international pressure to open its nuclear sites to full inspections. North
Korea threatened to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if
the US resumes its annual military exercise in South Korea and if the
International Atomic Energy Agency decides that North Korea has not complied
with its nuclear obligations.
The IAEA is likely to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN
Security Council today after Pyongyang last week blocked inspection tests by
the agency at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. The UN Security Council may then
consider economic sanctions on North Korea.
Leaving room for Pyongyang to avert an international crisis, the IAEA called
on North Korea to allow the agency's inspectors to undertake meaningful
tests at a radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon, north of the capital, and
at other sites.
After belligerent statements at the weekend, the North yesterday accused
South Korea of 'driving the North-South relationship into a situation of
confrontation and war', after the collapse of inter-Korean talks on the
proposed exchange of presidential envoys.
Seoul also resumed preparations for the Team Spirit military exercise,
although a decision on its timing has been delayed until President Kim
Young-sam discusses the situation on the Korean peninsula with Chinese and
Japanese leaders later this week.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said US policy would take
account of all the risks, but stressed that some form of international
action was necessary to combat nuclear proliferation. He insisted that China
would co-operate with US strategy because it was in its own best interest.
In Moscow, the foreign ministers of Russia and Japan added their countries'
support to the IAEA.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Russian coup plot reports spark urgent Yeltsin talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, cancelled talks with the
head of the International Monetary Fund yesterday and flew to the Black Sea
resort of Sochi for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, amid allegations of
a coup plot.
The prosecutor-general's office was yesterday investigating a document
published in the liberal daily Obshchaya Gazeta at the weekend, which said
that a group of senior officials had agreed to overthrow Mr Yeltsin because
of his physical inability to fulfil his presidential duties.
The Tass news agency quoted the prosecutor's office as saying all steps were
being taken to check whether the report 'corresponds to reality'. In a brief
editorial comment, Obshchaya Gazeta said the document appeared to be a fraud
aimed at compromising top officials.
The prosecutor general's office said if the report proved to be false, it
would start legal proceedings on charges of slander. However, the
allegations have been taken seriously and security services spent the
weekend interrogating ministers.
The alleged group, which included Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime
minister, General Mikhail Koslenikov, the head of the general staff, Mr
Vladimir Shumeiko, the leader of the upper house, and Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the
Moscow mayor, is a curious one, since most of its members have been close
allies of the president.
A senior official close to the Russian government said last night that there
was some truth to the allegations - highlighting the degree of concern about
President Yeltsin's ability to lead the country. However, Mr Soskovets had
not been involved, he said, and had been named only as a way of removing him
from the political scene.
The same official said Mr Chernomyrdin had gone to the spa town of Sochi,
where Mr Yeltsin is recuperating from a recent bout of ill health, to brief
the president on the allegations. One of Mr Yeltsin's press spokesmen said
Mr Chernomyrdin's unscheduled trip was no more than a routine meeting at a
date convenient to both men. However, Mr Chernomyrdin broke an appointment
with Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, which had been on his
schedule as late as Sunday night.
The allegations of a plot caused alarm in the west, but officials in
Washington said they could not verify the claims.
The Obshchaya Gazeta report said Mr Yuri Skokov, the secretary of the
Security Council, had been due to appear on Central TV on March 10 to
proclaim Mr Yeltsin's unfitness to govern and present a video portraying Mr
Yeltsin as a man 'in poor health, who also is drinking heavily'.
At the same time, a parallel process was due to be set in train in
parliament to transfer presidential powers to Mr Chernomyrdin. However, the
head of Central TV refused the broadcast and informed the president's
office.
As a result, Mr Skokov and Mr Koslenikov went abroad, the report said. But
the conspirators did not abandon their plan, instead seeking to persuade the
head of state oil producer Gazprom, Mr R. Byakhirevo, to make the broadcast.
The document also refers to circumstantial evidence of a coup plot,
detailing the reluctance of the defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, to
leave Moscow at the time.
The influential daily Izvestiya in its main story today confirms that a plot
had been hatched but says that 'once again a state coup did not take place'.
Meanwhile, politicians said the upper echelons of government were in
turmoil. Mr Boris Fyodorov, a former vice-premier, said that 'it's clear
something is going on, and that the situation is very tense'.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Novell challenges Microsoft with Dollars 1.4bn software deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Novell of the US, the world's leading supplier of computer networking
software, is to acquire WordPerfect, another North American company and one
of the main developers of word processing software, in an all-share deal
valued at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 950m).
The transaction will make the combined company the world's second-largest
personal computer software company behind Microsoft, also of the US.
Revenues of the combined group totalled about Dollars 1.9bn last year,
against Microsoft's Dollars 3.75bn
Novell and Microsoft, headed by Mr Bill Gates, one of America's richest men,
are fierce rivals and Novell officials have played an active role in
providing information to the US Justice Department which is investigating
Microsoft for possible anti-competitive marketing activities.
The deal changes the balance of power in the personal computer business. The
key companies are Intel, which makes 90 per cent of the world's
microprocessors; Microsoft, which dominates the operating software market;
and Novell, which controls the networking market.
Microsoft is promoting a new operating system, Windows NT, which it hopes
will recapture the networked computers market.
Utah-based Novell, which had revenues of Dollars 1.1bn last year, said it
had signed a definitive agreement to acquire all WordPerfect's shares for
59m shares of Novell stock and options. It also announced an agreement with
Borland International, another leading software maker, to buy its 'Quattro
Pro' spreadsheet business for about Dollars 145m cash.
Mr Raymond Noorda, Novell president and chief executive, said Novell aimed
to accelerate the market transition to networked computers.
WordPerfect's word-processing systems and Borland's spreadsheet are typical
of the applications which large companies might wish to distribute
throughout their organisations across networked personal computers.
Mr Ad Rietveld, president and chief executive of WordPerfect, said: 'We are
helping Novell create a software powerhouse.'
Novell's move, coupled with Microsoft's activities in multimedia, shows how
larger software houses, often limited to one successful product, are
attempting to lay claim to developing areas.

FT  22 MAR 94 / Housebuilders voice concern at sharp rise in land prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Land prices have risen exceptionally quickly over the past 12 months,
stoking inflationary pressures in the housing market and the general
economy, housebuilders warned yesterday.
Prices for quality sites have risen by an average of 20 per cent nationally
during the past 12 months and by up to 50 per cent in south-east England,
according to Mr David Wilson, chairman of Wilson Bowden, one of Britain's
most profitable housebuilders.
He blamed restrictive planning policies by local and central government for
creating a shortage of good sites and forcing up the price of land as the
housing market started to recover.
Mr Roger Humber, director general of the Housebuilders Federation, said the
government's determination to display its green credentials meant there was
a serious shortage of sites in areas where people wanted to live.
He said that might rebound on the economy as higher land prices started to
feed through to higher house prices. The government's only weapon to
restrict house price inflation would be to increase interest rates - harming
other parts of the economy. 'We could have a rerun of the late 1980s if
house prices start to chase up land costs,' Mr Humber said.
Builders may face serious difficulties, however, if house prices initially
rise more slowly than land costs. According to Halifax Building Society,
house prices rose 1.2 per cent in 1993, and are forecast to rise a further 5
per cent this year.
Pressure on land prices is likely to increase further, with many builders,
including Wilson Bowden, announcing share issues to finance land purchases.
Most plan to increase their output substantially over the next few years.
Sales by Wilson Bowden increased by about a tenth during the first 11 weeks
of this year compared with the corresponding period in 1993, according to Mr
Wilson, who says the recovery is still patchy.
That has not prevented a big rise in land prices. According to Countryside
Properties, which builds mainly in Essex, Kent, Hertfordshire and London,
land prices in the past 12 months have risen from Pounds 300,000-Pounds
350,000 an acre to Pounds 450,000-Pounds 500,000 an acre.

A senior official close to the government said last night that while there

FT  22 MAR 94 / Gates and McCaw launch world telecoms odyssey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Gates and Mr Craig McCaw, two of America's richest technology
entrepreneurs, set out yesterday on an ambitious space odyssey: the creation
of a Dollars 9bn global satellite communications system by the year 2001.
The two billionaires, each using 'a few million dollars' as seed capital,
aim to launch a fleet of 840 small satellites into orbit about 400 miles
above the earth. The system would offer wireless data, video and voice
communications services worldwide.
The plan, however, faces technical and commercial doubts as well as daunting
financial and political hurdles.
Mr Gates, aged 38, is co-founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's
biggest software company. Mr McCaw, 44, built McCaw Cellular Communications
into the largest US cellular telephone company. It is now being sold to AT&amp;T
for Dollars 12.6bn.
Mr Gates, Mr McCaw and McCaw Cellular each will own 30 per cent of
Teledesic, the new venture. Mr McCaw is chairman, but Mr Gates does not hold
an executive position. Microsoft itself is not involved.
Teledesic revealed its plans yesterday by applying to the Federal
Communications Commission for permission to begin construction of the
satellite system.
Using very high frequency transmissions, the refrigerator-sized satellites
would send and receive digital signals from telephone directory-sized
receivers and small antennas installed in homes and businesses. Each
satellite would, in effect, be a telephone switching system.
The small satellites could be launched in clusters, reducing the cost.
However, low-orbit satellites tend to fall out of their orbits far quicker
than the 22,300-mile-high geostationary satellites now used for telephone
communications.
They must therefore be replaced more frequently, adding to the cost of
maintaining the system.
Teledesic has yet to begin raising the Dollars 9bn needed to build the
satellite system. It aims to draw together a broad alliance of
manufacturers, telecommunications companies and governments to back the
massive effort.
Regulatory approvals would be required from the governments of the countries
to which the system offered services. Alliances would also have to be formed
with telephone companies all over the world. If it gets off the ground,
Teledesic faces competition from less expensive satellite projects such as
Motorola's Iridium, which will provide mobile communications to car drivers.
Teledesic also envisages rivalry from stationary wireless communications

Motorola has spent three years raising Dollars 800m to launch Iridium, which
is expected to cost a total of Dollars 3.4bn. The new venture would also
have to compete with Iridium for funding.
According to Mr Russell Daggatt, Teledesic's president: 'The real promise of
the system is to bring access for rural and remote areas of the world to the
health and education services that you get in major urban centres.'
AT&amp;T said yesterday: 'At this point, Teledesic is a gleam-in-the-eye
venture, but we'll be delighted to benefit financially from it.'

Scandinavia's biggest construction group should show a strong rebound from
its disastrous 1992 results when it unveils 1993 figures on Thursday. The
group will be relying on capital gains on disposals to compensate for
continued recession in the Swedish construction market and big property
write-downs. At the half-way stage, the group predicted a SKr2.2bn (Dollars

season - Other companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's reporting season moves into full swing this week, kicking off
with full-year earnings from Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of
Beijing's China International Trust and Investment Corporation. Last year
the group bought into Hongkong Telecom.
The market is looking for around HKDollars 1.86bn profits after tax, a rise
of 79 per cent. A growth rate of 83 per cent was achieved in the first half
after Dah Chong Hong (DCH) almost doubled car sales in China. But it was
thought Chinese austerity measures would hamper progress in the second half.
Also today, Hongkong Land, Jardine's property arm, is expected to reveal
flat earnings. Stronger gains are slated to come on Thursday, with reports
from Mr Li Ka-shing's main company, Cheung Kong and its subsidiary Hutchison
Whampoa, Hong Kong's largest conglomerate.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Main parties lose out in German local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Both Germany's main political parties, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats, suffered setbacks in
yesterday's local elections in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.
Fears of voter apathy and gains for extreme right-wing parties proved
unfounded, with a 70 per cent turnout of the 2.1m voters in Germany's
northern-most state.
The main beneficiaries of the swing against the big parties were the
environmentalist Greens and a series of local interest electors' groups in
the 1,100-odd council elections.
The poll, the second of 19 elections to be held in Germany this year, offers
the first sign that the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), as well as
the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is facing a backlash among
electors.
It also suggests that predictions of a rise in the far right wing may have
been exaggerated, with protest votes going instead to the Greens.
The first firm projection last night, issued by the state statistical office
2 1/2 hours after the polls closed, gave the SPD 38.7 per cent of the vote,
down 4.2 percentage points on its total in the 1990 local elections. In
elections for the state parliament, held in 1992, the party won 46.2 per
cent.
The CDU failed to overtake the SPD in the polls, according to the
projection, but lost less support: the party was set to gain 37.6 per cent,
down 3.7 percentage points from 1990.
The Greens saw a clear pick up in votes, from 6 per cent in 1990 to 10.6 per
cent last night, according to the forecast. In contrast, the Free Democratic
party (FDP), Chancellor Kohl's junior partner in the Bonn coalition, had
another bad night, down from 6.1 per cent four years ago to 4.8 per cent
yesterday.
Far-right parties like the Deutsche Volksunion (which gained entry to the
Schleswig-Holstein state parliament with 6 per cent support in 1992) and the
Republicans only put up candidates in a few towns yesterday and failed to
make any significant showing.
Independent electors' groups, including the party for the Danish minority
living in the north of the state, picked up support and seats on a number of
councils.
The SPD was expecting a backlash in the poll, following the resignation last
year of Mr Bjorn Engholm, its state premier and national party leader. The
party suffered a particularly sharp drop in support in Kiel, the state
capital, falling 12 points to 39.3 per cent, while the Greens more than
doubled their vote from 7.3 to 15.1 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
About 6,000 militant Kurds went on the rampage over the weekend in the
southern German town of Augsburg and on a nearby motorway, after authorities
had barred them from holding a rally which had been declared illegal, police
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Augsburg.
They said 85 police officers and two firemen were injured in the
demonstrations at Augsburg and in Berlin. About 30 Kurds were arrested.
At Wiesbaden, Kurdish demonstrators poured petrol on a train carriage and
set it alight, police said. Officers had earlier prevented the Kurds staging
a rally in Frankfurt, after which about 100 militants took the train to
Wiesbaden.
Nearly 50 of the officers were injured in the Augsburg disturbances, which
broke out on Saturday after police had stopped the Kurds who were travelling
in several buses outside the Bavarian city.
The demonstrators, supporters of the banned Kurdistan Worker's party (PKK),
responded by commandeering the buses and using them to block the motorway.
They also poured fuel on the asphalt and set it alight to block a motorway
exit. Other Kurds blocked intersections at Augsburg and threw firebombs, a
police spokesman said.
He said Kurds tried to douse two officers with petrol and set them on fire.
Another officer was knocked down and his gun was taken. Police used a water
cannon to clear the motorway after nine hours.
In Berlin, about 800 Kurds demonstrated on Saturday night against Turkish
policies. The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
homeland in south-eastern Turkey. Germany banned the PKK in November.

FT  21 MAR 94 / French right claims success in local polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, was last night anxiously
awaiting the final outcome of the first round of voting in France's local
council elections after exit polls suggested that his centre-right coalition
had won a majority of the votes.
The centre-right won 44.3 per cent of the votes, according to a BVA poll for
France Television, leaving the left, which triumphed when the same seats
were contested six years ago, with 42.1 per cent. A Sofres poll for the TF1
television station gave the government parties a larger lead with 46 per
cent, against 40 per cent for the socialists and commun ists.
Yesterday's poll, which encompassed 2,018 of France's 4,033 local council
seats, was the first significant test of confidence in Mr Balladur's
centre-right government since its election in March last year. It has come
at a critical time for Mr Balladur, whose popularity has slipped recently on
concern about high unemployment and a wave of violent strikes and
demonstrations.
Mr Balladur, whose capable manner made him one of Europe's most popular
politicians during his first months in office, has seen his approval rating
fall from 55 per cent to around 50 per cent since the end of last year. The
prime minister, tipped as a contender for the centre-right candidacy in next
spring's presidential elections, desperately needs a vote of confidence in
the local vote which will be concluded with a second round of voting next
Sunday.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the hard-line interior minister who was a candidate in
yesterday's vote, declared the result a 'success for the government'
pointing out that its share of the vote was 'slightly higher' than in the
1988 local elections and more than in the 1993 legislative elections.
However Mr Michel Rocard, the socialist leader, was swift to highlight the
narrowness of the government's lead. Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, head of the
extreme-right wing National Front, described his party's 10 per cent of the
votes as 'a very good result'.
Yesterday's vote included the local council seats which were last contested
in 1988. France swung to the left during that year with the socialists
triumphing in the parliamentary elections and winning an extra 89 seats in
the local vote.
The left has since lost support culminating in its crushing defeat in last
spring's parliamentary elections. Opinion polls last week predicted that the
Balladur centre-right coalition, which already controls 75 of France's 95
conseils generals or general councils, would win up to 200 extra seats after
next Sunday's second round.
The polls also forecast that the centre right eventually emerge with
majorities of another eight conseils generaux thereby bringing the total
under its control to 83 regions.

Tuesday: The French trade surplus is expected to fall to FFr7.5bn in January
from the very large FFr13.2bn in December. Italian inflation is under
control and consumer prices should show only a small increase in March.
Wednesday: The German M3 money supply figure is expected from the Bundesbank
any time from Wednesday on. It is forecast to show an annualised rise of
15.0 per cent in the money supply in February, after January's 21.2 per cent
increase. The peculiar method of calculation, comparing each month with
1993's fourth quarter average, will continue to produce high rates of growth
for some time. Germany's March cost-of-living indices may show subdued
inflation.
Thursday: Final estimates of UK gross domestic product in the final quarter
of 1993 are unlikely to show a change from the previous estimate of 2.6 per
cent annual growth in Q4, but will provide a breakdown of the balance of
payments for 1993.
Friday: The UK Confederation of British Industry's monthly survey of
manufacturing trends will provide clues as to how optimistic industry is
about the recovery.

21 MONDAY
N Korea atom row deepens
The US has cancelled high level talks with North Korea, which were scheduled
to take place in Geneva today. The move follows the refusal of the North
Koreans to allow International Atomic Energy Authority officials to complete
their inspection of nuclear installations.
The Authority's board of governors is holding a special meeting in Vienna at
which it is expected to decide to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to
the UN Security Council, which could impose economic sanctions.
Russian partner
Russia, the US and several European countries will for the first time hold
large-scale joint naval manoeuvres off Norway.  Russia last week announced
it was going to join Nato's Partnerships for Peace programme. This aims to
draw former Warsaw Pact adversaries closer to the alliance without extending
them the full security guarantees that go with full membership.
Global warming
The Rio treaty becomes international law, following ratification by more
than 50 countries. Signatories undertake to draw up plans for curbing
emissions of so-called greenhouse gases.
Scott inquiry
Alan Moses QC, prosecution counsel in Matrix Churchill trial, begins two
days of evidence to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into arms exports to Iraq.
UK trade figures
The visible trade deficit with non-European Union countries is expected to
widen to Pounds 800m in February from Pounds 785m in January. Whole-world
trade figures for December showed a large increase in imports into the UK
and a poor export performance, particularly to the EU.
Oscar comes to Hollywood
The 66th annual Academy Awards ceremony takes place today. Steven
Spielberg's Schindler's List looks the surest bet in years for best film and
best director. Also worth a flutter: Tom Hanks for best actor (Philadelphia)
and Holly Hunter for best actress (The Piano). Britain this year may be on
the outside looking in. Recent victors Hopkins, Day-Lewis and Thompson are
re-nominated but not tipped to win. But Wales's Hedd Wynn may triumph as
best foreign film.
Fading tiger
Experts gather in Geneva to try to co-ordinate programmes to stave off the
threat of extinction to the tiger. It is estimated that only 5,000 survive
in the wild.
Holidays
Japan, spring equinox national holiday (markets closed). Iran celebrates New
Year and puts its clocks forward one hour.
22 TUESDAY
Europe strives to expand
European Union foreign ministers hold another crisis meeting to try to
settle the enlargement row. Norway resolved its dispute over fish last week
and is now set to join the Union together with Austria and Scandinavian
neighbours Finland and Sweden.
However, the applications of all four have been thrown into doubt by
Anglo-Spanish objections to proposed changes to the council of ministers
voting procedures to take account of the new members. Several compromises
are on offer.
Croatia accord
Leaders of Croatia and the self-styled Serb state of Krajina, which takes up
one-third of Croatian territory, are due to meet in the Russian embassy in
the Croatian capital Zagreb. The two sides have never formally ended their
war, which began in 1991 and spilled over into Bosnia.
Russia's envoy Vitaly Churkin, who set up the meeting, hopes to arrange a
formal end to hostilities between Zagreb and the Serb separatists, who have
close ties with Belgrade. The hope is that widening the scope of the peace
will stabilise the region.
US economy
Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents meet in Washington to
review monetary policy. Many analysts expect the Fed to raise short-term
rates either immediately or in the next few weeks. The likeliest move is a
quarter point rise in the federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent, possibly
accompanied by a half point rise in the discount rate, also to 3.5 per cent.
More flattering US trade figures are in prospect. Starting with the release
of January data today, the merchandise trade report will be expanded to
include monthly data on trade in services. Last year the US ran a services
surplus of Dollars 55.7bn, partially offsetting a merchandise deficit of
Dollars 132.5bn.
Japan's spring wage negotiations
Japan's spring wage negotiations, starting today, are expected to bring
smaller rises in most sectors than last year, holding down consumer demand.
Hungary's parliament votes
Hungary's parliament votes on legislation regulating the gas industry. It
will prepare for privatisation of the five regional distribution companies.
The country's balance of payments figures are also due out. Both foreign
investment flows and the current account deficit are set to break records.
Apprenticeships plan
David Hunt, UK employment secretary, is to launch a scheme to raise the
number of young people trained to skilled crafts level. Training and
Enterprise Councils will run 2,000 prototype apprenticeships.
23 WEDNESDAY
Sarajevo roads to open
An agreement between Serb and Moslem leaders to allow the limited opening of
roads, linking Serb and government-held areas of Sarajevo is due to come
into force.
The agreement, brokered by the United Nations, is hedged with conditions on
the movement of civilian traffic because the two sides have not yet reached
a political settlement.
The deal bans commercial traffic from a city whose 380,000 inhabitants are
dependent on humanitarian aid, but if honoured, it will be an
important step towards lifting the 23-month Serbian siege of the Bosnian
capital.
South Korea and the US
South Korea and the US are to discuss reviving their joint military
exercise, Team Spirit, following the inability of International Atomic
Energy Authority officials to complete their inspection of North Korea's
nuclear facilities.
Look east Euroman
Jacques Delors, European Commission president, chairs a brain-storming
session at the European Commission aimed at producing ideas for accelerating
the political and economic integration of eastern Europe into the European
Union.
European Parliament
The European Parliament begins a two-day mini-session in Brussels.
Fraud busters
The UK will unveil an initiative to tackle fraud in the European Union at a
meeting of justice ministers in Brussels. The plan is for all 12 member
states to adopt similar legal measures.
UK inflation
The retail price index for February will be watched closely for clues as to
whether Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has room for a further base-rate
cut.
The headline inflation rate is expected to fall to 2.2 per cent, from 2.5
per cent in January. Underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest
payments) is expected to fall from 2.8 to 2.6 per cent.
Computer at work
Details of a computerised database to co-ordinate the digging-up of
Britain's road are due to be unveiled at a conference in Birmingham. About
8,000 holes are dug every day to repair or lay cables and pipes.
The proposed national register of information on planned street-works hopes
to avoid companies digging up the same stretch of road, one after the other.

Franco-German relations
Germany's foreign minister Klaus Kinkel (left) meets France's President
Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Alain Juppe, French
foreign minister, in Paris. The two sides will doubtless be anxious to
smooth over last week's strains in Franco-German relations, following an
off-the-record briefing by France's ambassador in Bonn.
South Korean President starts three-day visit to Japan
South Korean President Kim Young-sam starts a three-day visit to Japan. He
is due to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Emperor and Empress,
and business leaders.
On Sunday, he travels on to China. He will ask Chinese leaders to exert
pressure on North Korea to accept nuclear inspections or, if persuasion
fails, back sanctions against it.
Safety at sea
European Union transport ministers meet in Brussels to attempt to finalise
plans to combat maritime accidents caused by substandard ships.
Emissions standard
European Union environment ministers, meeting in Brussels, are expected to
approve a directive cutting car exhaust emissions by half. It will apply to
new vehicle types from 1996 and to all new vehicles from 1997 and will bring
the EU in line with US federal standards.
Scott inquiry
Sir Nicholas Lyell, UK attorney general, gives evidence to Lord Justice
Scott's arms-for-Iraq inquiry. He will be questioned about the reasons why
he agreed to the prosecution of businessmen from the company Matrix
Churchill for illegally exporting arms to Iraq, although it is alleged he
knew the company had been providing the government with intelligence.
US savings and loans
The House of Representatives' Banking Committee holds a hearing on the
semi-annual report of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency in charge
of mopping up the 1980s savings and loan debacle. This includes the affairs
of Madison Guaranty, the failed Arkansas savings and loan at the heart of
the Whitewater controversy.
Some Republicans may seek to turn the hearings into a Whitewater probe, but
it is far from clear whether this will be allowed.
25 FRIDAY
Opec considers oil price
Oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in
Geneva amid continuing signs of oil price weakness. Analysts say there would
have to be a cut of at least 1m barrels a day in the present Opec output
ceiling of 24.52m b/d to have any significant impact on prices.
Ugandan poll
In the country's first experiment in democracy since 1980, Ugandans start

FRANKFURT
Bayerische Hypobank opens the German banks' reporting season tomorrow with
Hoare Govett forecasting a 27.8 per cent rise in operating profit for 1993,
the strongest rate of increase for the sector. Vereinsbank, whose figures
come on Thursday, is expected to show a 26 per cent rise. Full-year figures
from Veba on Thursday are expected to show a continuation of the trend seen
at nine months, when net profits fell 14 per cent.
Tomorrow sees the start of the subscription period for Porsche's
one-for-four rights issue, aimed at raising DM200m to help fund new sports
car developments.
PARIS
A busy week is in store for financial sector, where stocks have been
recouping some lost ground recently. UAP is due to report today, with
NatWest Securities forcasting net profit rising by 39 per cent to FFr 1.5bn.
Flat figures are expected from Cie Bancaire and Credit National when they
report tomorrow. Consensus estimates are for a 7 per cent rise in net
profits from Societe Generale on Friday.
MILAN
Another busy week for the soon to be privatised telecommunications sector is
expected as the country prepares to go to the polls next Sunday and Monday.
With no further opinion polls permitted ahead of the vote, the market is
likely to be dominated by speculation about the likely composition of the
new coalition administration.
ZURICH
Georg Fischer, the engineering group which is heavily dependent on the
depressed German motor industry, is expected to post a full-year loss of
around SFr40m to SFr45m tomorrow. However, many analysts believe that the
worst may now be over for the restructured engineering group as the global
economy begins to pick up.
Sandoz is due to report on Thursday and consensus estimates are for a 13 per
cent rise in net profit to about SFr1.7bn.
TOKYO
The market faces a final round of profit-taking ahead of the March book
closing, although foreign demand remains strong. However, figures for
household spending in January and the diffusion index of business and
economic conditions could support share prices.

Hungary acts to curb insider trading
Hungary's stock market authorities have acted to curb insider trading and
boost the confidence of investors drawn to the Budapest bourse since it
began to take off in the new year, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
The state securities supervisor, in an unprecedented step, has asked the
police to conduct a criminal investigation into a suspicious rise in the
share price of Novotrade in late 1993.
The supervisory authority is also conducting an investigation into heavy
trading - 20 times the normal volume - in Danubius Hotels shares on January
27.
The wave of buying anticipated the announcement that three US institutional
investors were paying Dollars 23.6m for 29 per cent of Danubius. The share
price leapt 120 per cent on the next day of trading.
The stock exchange authorities reject accusations that half of all activity
is fuelled by inside information and officials say that Budapest is no worse
than any other market.
Nevertheless, the stock exchange is aware that there is a problem and is
putting new emphasis on enforcement of trading rules.
'These cases show that the regulators are not sleeping,' said Mr Jozsef
Rotyis, chief executive of the Budapest stock exchange.
Hungary last month also instituted stricter penalties for insider trading.
The use of privileged information to make a profit through securities
trading now carries a prison sentence of up to three years.
The BSE hopes that a new system of automatic computerised trading,
introduced this month to handle growing volume, will also serve to curtail
market manipulation.
Action against stock market malpractice is all the more vital for Budapest's
reputation now that the market has attracted the interest, and the scrutiny,
of western funds. Budapest has been one of the best performing emerging
markets so far this year with its IFC index rising 43 per cent in dollar
terms since last December.
The collapse last month of Lupis, one of the largest domestic brokerages,
has also spurred the authorities to supervise financial markets more firmly.
Lupis allegedly diverted clients' funds to its own account in a vain attempt
to stave off bankruptcy.
WARSAW
Mr Marian Rajczyk, president of Bank Slaski, resigned on Thursday.
The bank has been in the news recently following criticisms over the pricing
of its offer for privatisa-tion.
The country's finance minister has already resigned, partly over the
contro-versy.
INDONESIA
Moody's, the international rating agency, has assigned an investment grade
rating of Baa3 to the foreign currency debt issued by the Republic of
Indonesia.
Moody's said the rating reflects the marked economic progress that Indonesia
has made and the government's strides in fostering free market principles.
The agency said the rating also takes into account that Indonesia still has
a debt service ratio of nearly 30 per cent, along with a modestly high level
of foreign currency debt.
Some Dollars 97m of Dollars 300m worth of floating rate notes issued by
Indonesia in 1986 and due in 2001 is still outstan-ding.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Currency overlay strategies find wider
appeal - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The currency overlay, long a practice of US investors, is slowly making its
way across the Atlantic and is attracting increasing attention from UK fund
managers.
Since good value in a bond or stock market does not necessarily mean good
value in its currency, portfolio managers can use overlay strategies to
separate their currency decision from their underlying bond or equity
decision. This enables them to offset their currency risk, and in some cases
to enhance their returns.
Imagine a UK pension fund with a 15 per cent holding in US equities, says Mr
Les Halpin, chief executive at Record Treasury Management. 'We would hedge
the currency exposure on that position so that, if the dollar drops, the
fund is short dollars,' he says. Conversely, 'if the dollar rises, we would
try to ensure the fund is neutral on the currency position so that it
benefits from the rise.'
European bond markets last year provided a classic example of the benefits
of overlay, says Mr John Stopford, bond and currency manager at Guinness
Flight. The high-yielders - Italy, Spain and Scandinavia - offered the
best-performing bond markets but the worst-performing currencies. 'If you
had held bonds unhedged you would have gained on the bonds, but lost on the
currencies. By separating the two investment decisions, you could benefit
from both the fixed-income and the currency element.'
Guinness Flight has been using overlay strategies on its international bond
portfolios for years. The fixed-income allocation of its Global Bond Fund
currently includes a 5 per cent holding in US Treasuries, 20 per cent in
Italian bonds and 10 per cent each in Australian, Spanish, Danish, Japanese
bonds and gilts. The fund's currency exposure diverges markedly: 57 1/2 per
cent is held in US dollars, 15 per cent in Australian dollars, 10 per cent
in Italian lire and 5 per cent each in Canadian dollars and Swedish kronor.
Rather than seeking merely to limit their downside risk, more and more money
managers are using dynamic currency strategies to boost their returns.
'You increase your exposure to foreign currencies when they strengthen and
reduce it when they weaken,' says Mr Reza Vishkai, director of international
equity research at US consultants Rogers Casey. This strategy protects
investors' downside but allows them to participate in the upside.
According to Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan,
there is good reason why currency overlay has taken so long to catch on in
Europe.
'Correlations between bonds and currencies switch from positive to negative
depending on the force of European convergence,' he says. In an environment
of currency stability, as between 1987 and 1992, currencies and bonds
perform as though they were the same asset class.
But in an environment of divergence, as in the UK since September 1992 when
it left the European exchange rate mechanism, 'bonds and currencies have
become very separate asset classes and currency overlay adds significant
risk reduction to a portfolio,' he says. Between October 1993 and January
1994, sterling's 5 - 6 per cent rise contrasted with a 2.5 per cent fall in
10-year gilt prices.
Currency markets have been relatively calm since the ERM turmoil. However,
'currencies will continue to be volatile, and there are gains to be made,'
predicts Ms Celia Cull, director of fixed income at BZW Investment
Management. BZW last year developed a currency trading model. 'If it is
successful, an overlay product may fall out of it,' she says.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Hostage to US interest rates - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1993, the flood of US money into overseas financial assets was one of the
driving forces behind the bull market in the debt and equity of developing
countries. Such was investors' appetite for foreign securities, that last
year more US money poured into stock and bond markets in Asia and Latin
America than in any previous 12-month period.
Yet the past few months have not been so kind to emerging markets. In
February, rising US long-term interest rates - which quickly pushed up rates
in Europe - unnerved investors in emerging markets, leading to heavy selling
of stocks and bonds.
Since then, prices on most emerging markets have fallen, in many cases far
enough to wipe out the gains earned from a strong start in January.
How are US investors reacting to this unexpected setback? It is a crucial
question, because if the recent declines prompt US investors to withdraw the
money that has been keeping stock and bond prices in Latin America and Asia
buoyant this past year, many emerging markets would be in danger of
collapse.
So far, however, there seem to be few signs of panic. According to traders
and analysts in New York, most investment institutions, pension funds and
insurance companies have reacted relatively calmly to the February and early
March declines.
Yet, the immediate outlook for emerging debt markets is not bright. The
selling began when interest rates in the US and Europe began to rise sharply
in early February. When bond prices in Latin America and other emerging
markets began to tumble, US dealing houses were caught with sizeable long
positions.
With US funds, Japanese, European and US banks, and hedge funds also selling
into a declining market, liquidity rapidly deteriorated, and 'the Street'
(the US dealers) was left sitting on a mountain of emerging market debt
which they could not shift.
As one trader at a big US securities house explains: 'I have estimated - and
the numbers check out with people around here - that there is between
Dollars 2bn and Dollars 5bn of emerging market bonds on the Street that need
to be moved along to clear up the inventory accumulation. This will not
happen in days: it will take weeks, probably months.'
Yet, there are buyers out there, says Mr Peter Frey, head of emerging
markets institutional sales at JP Morgan in New York. 'The only consistent
source of demand for bonds (recently) has come from US institutions,
predominantly mutual funds and insurance companies.'
Mr Frey says some US funds are buying because they believe that prices are
heading in the right direction over the longer term. Also, he points out
that US institutions have plenty of resources committed to tracking those
markets.
Mr Mark Siegel, head of emerging markets at Putnam, the US mutual fund
group, agrees, and his funds have been buying recently because they
lightened their positions at the end of 1993 and had cash to spare.
'If you kept your powder dry, based on the assumption that the shape of the
price curve was ridiculous at the end of the year, you've been able to buy
at bargain prices.' Yet, Mr Siegel admits, 'no matter how intellectually
well briefed you might be, when you get into one of these downdrafts, it can
be very uncomfortable'.
While some US investors have been hunting bargains, there has still been a
great deal of selling. Investors in some funds which specialise in emerging
markets have seen money flowing out recently.
The New Markets Income Fund run by Fidelity, the biggest US fund group, has
shrunk in size from a peak of Dollars 358m at the end of January, to just
Dollars 200m.
Mr Robert Citrone, who runs the Fidelity fund, admits that there have been
plenty of redemptions recently, but points out that the fund is only Dollars
38m smaller than it was at the start of 1994.
'The very short-term and trading-oriented investors felt they had to get out
during the correction,' says Mr Citrone. Yet, he says, some of that money is
beginning to trickle back, and the total amount that the entire Fidelity
group has invested in emerging markets is up Dollars 1bn from the start of
the year to Dollars 8.5bn.
Mr Citrone says the big funds, which hold only pieces of emerging markets,
viewed the recent losses as a good opportunity to buy cheaply.
The situation is a little different in emerging equities markets, where the
recent declines were not as worrying as they were in bonds.
While there is evidence that some US investors have lightened their
positions lately, Mr Juan Mesa, head of Latin American research at JP
Morgan, points out that most of the damage in emerging stock markets was
caused by domestic investors selling stocks.
'As we have seen with the Nafta situation in Mexico, the people who are the
most frightened (by uncertainty) are always the locals.'
Mr Mesa points out that if US investors had been big sellers of emerging
markets in Latin America, trading volumes would have been very high. Yet, he
says, volume has been low, most notably in Mexico, where average daily
trading volume dropped from 190,000 shares a day in January to 130,000 in
February and March.
One US fund manager who has been selling emerging markets is Ms Kelly
McDermott, who runs two global equity funds for the Dreyfus fund group in
New York. Last year she had more than 35 per cent of her funds invested in
emerging markets. That figure is now down to about 18 per cent, because, she
says, 'the downside is bigger than the upside over the next few months.'
Ultimately, the performance of emerging markets depends greatly on what
happens to US interest rates. As Ms McDermott says: 'The bigger question is
what happens to the overall flow of funds, and that will be dictated by what
happens to interest rates. If you see money coming out of mutual funds
generally, that will be a problem for emerging markets.'

FT  21 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: At the fickle mercy of US securities -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market continued to take its medicine manfully last week - smiling
when the construction sector delivered a fresh batch of dividend increases
and then grimacing when the UK and global bond traders showed they still had
the power to disrupt the share market as well as their own. The flow of data
on the domestic economy tended to confirm investors' belief that the British
consumer is proving a poor leader for economic recovery.
It is clear that equities will remain strongly influenced by the gilt-edged
market until the institutions have finished reshaping their portfolios in
the light of the rise in bond yields since the beginning of February. Shares
are still at the mercy of sudden swings of mood in bonds and, with the
Bundesbank effectively sidelined for a month, are now at the fickle mercy of
the US Federal securities market.
It is difficult to be sanguine ahead of a trading week which will include a
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, auctions of Dollars 28m in US
short-term bonds, trade figures on both sides of the Atlantic, and be topped
up by an Opec meeting. The latest domestic retail price index arrives at
mid-week, but should not change the timescale for the next cut in base
rates.
'Rebalancing the recovery away from consumption . . .' sums up the new view
taken of the stores sector by BZW, and others in the market. The UK
investment bank, pinpointing 'the problem that the economy has in sustaining
consumer-led growth', believes that the weakening of gross margins in the
stores sector over Christmas will continue, perhaps for a full 12 months.
Combined with the effective breakdown of orderly, non-price competition in
such areas as the electrical, DIY and durable goods sectors, this implies an
unusually risky outlook for the stores sector. Such strong names as Marks
and Spencer, GUS and Boots are benefiting from the protection afforded them
by brand franchises, cost advantages and the difficulties any upstart rival
would find in entering their established markets. At the other end of the
defensive scale, Argos, Dixons and Kingfisher are identified by BZW as
facing vulnerable profit margin structures; gross margins on DIY are around
five points below those for the industry average already.
Longer-term views on the stock market are still bullish. 'The bull market is
now well established,' is the opinion at Strauss Turnbull, which expects
domestic interest rates to fall to 5 per cent very soon. Downward pressures
on European rates and benign inflation in the UK should balance UK tax rises
in April.
The overall opinion is still that rates will come down, the economy will
recover and this combination can only be good for share prices in the medium
term. But the underlying worry is that the bond market may have already
decided that interest rates are going higher later this year and that the
stock market may have already discounted all the recovery on offer at
present.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Shares set to tumble if Fed tightens - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the Federal Reserve poised to lift short-term interest rates for a second
time in two months? Most Wall Street analysts are convinced it will do so
today or soon after the Fed's policy-making session tomorrow. But rate
increase or not, the perceived threat is sure to bear heavily on investor
sentiment this week.
If the Fed strikes, stocks are expected to tumble, just as on February 4,
when the central bank lifted its Federal Funds target by 25 basis points to
3.25 per cent. That day, the Dow Jones Industrial index plummeted 96 points
and has regained scant ground since then.
Opinions vary over just how far equities would fall this time, and how soon
they would begin to rebound.
Mr Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New
York, believes the market's rate concerns are already sufficiently priced
into stock values. If the Fed decides to nudge up the Fed Funds target
another 25 basis points, he expects a 'knee-jerk reaction' by stocks,
followed by a quick recovery.
But Mr David Shulman, equity strategist at Salomon Brothers in New York,
takes a more pessimistic view of the market's intermediate prospects. He
finds no compelling reason to revise his investment house's forecast of a 4
per cent Fed Funds rate by June, accompanied by a 10 per cent 'correction'
in share prices.
Since reaching its apex of 3,978.36 five days before the Fed's first strike,
the Dow is down a net 82 points, or about 2 per cent, at 3,895.65. If Mr
Shulman is correct, the index has a long way to go before hitting bottom.
Several other factors are likely to influence stocks this week.
Unfortunately, their effect is likely to be negative, and that could
exaggerate any sell-off that may follow a move to more restrictive rates.
At Kemper Securities in Chicago, Mr Gregory Nie says technical factors
suggest the market is 'over-bought' and expects it to begin working off some
of the excess during the week, regardless of whether a policy change is
forthcoming from Washington.
Institutional investors are also starting to look ahead to the end of the
first three months of the year, with an eye to putting 'window-dressing' on
their quarterly reports to clients.
With a net decline in the S&amp;P 500 in prospect this quarter and the
unfavourable trend in interest rates, Kemper's technical analyst fears
portfolio managers may make a 'dash for cash' as March 31 draws near. A
heavy outflow of funds from the market could badly damage stock values.
But what if the Fed chooses to remain on the sidelines? Mr James Solloway,
director of research at Argus in New York, is one of the minority who takes
such a view.
Given the economic fundamentals and the sharp reaction to last month's rate
boost, he argues the Fed will hold its fire. If so, he says, 'pessimism has
reached such an extreme, we are likely to be on the verge of a decent rally
this week'.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Nerves on edge ahead of Fed meeting -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges will this week focus on the meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee which is expected to herald a further tightening of US
monetary policy.
Although the market has discounted a 25 basis points increase in the Federal
funds rate, nerves are on edge following the unscheduled meeting last Friday
between President Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed.
When the Fed last tightened policy, on February 4, foreign exchanges
remained largely immune from the ensuing turmoil in financial markets.
Anxiety remains, however, because a further divergence in US and European
interest rates could prompt shifts in international asset allocation which
would affect currencies.
Indeed, a key issue in the weeks ahead will be the extent to which US and
European interest rates can decouple. Put differently, how fast can the
Bundesbank ease policy while the Fed is tightening?
This is important for the dollar, weaker now than before the Fed raised
rates, because some observers believe the US currency will strengthen only
if German interest rates are cut sharply.
This issue is also important for European currencies. Mr Paul Chertkow, head
of global currency research at UBS, argues that 'the still cautious monetary
stance of the Bundesbank, in circumstances of bond market deterioration,
threatens to renew strains within the ERM'. He believes that the French
franc is most vulnerable to such pressures.
In the UK, the key concern is whether a good retail inflation figure on
Wednesday will prompt a cut in interest rates.
Opinion is divided. Some argue the government will want lower rates to
offset higher taxes that take effect next month. Others are firmly opposed.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, says if the Bank of
England cuts rates again, 'It will run an enormous risk of further eroding
the confidence of the marketplace'.
He predicts a 'very definite chance' that a cut in base rates will see the
pound slip into the DM2.45 to DM2.50 range.

The US bond markets will be dominated this week by tomorrow's meeting of the
Federal Reserve Bank's policy-making Open Market Committee, amid widespread
speculation it will sanction a further tightening of US monetary policy.
Market analysts are braced for the Fed Funds rate to rise from its current
3.25 per cent to 3.50 per cent over the next few weeks, possibly as early as
the next few days, as the Fed tries to rein back the rapid rate of US
economic expansion.
The market will have several hurdles to face during the week, as well as two
substantial auctions of Government paper: Dollars 17bn of two-year Treasury
notes on Tuesday and an Dollars 11bn sale of five-year notes the next day.
Wednesday will also see the publication of durable goods orders for
February. Stripping out defence and transport equipment, which tend to
distort the statistics, the market is expecting orders to rise for the
eighth successive month, with analysts' forecasts ranging from 1 to 3.5 per
cent.
Friday will bring figures for existing home sales for February, which are
expected to show a sharp rebound during the month.
Thursday could also bring further market nervousness over the Whitewater
political affair, concerning President and Mrs Clinton's investment in a
controversial Arkansas land development scheme.

The six-point cut in the securities repurchase agreement or repo rate to
5.88 per cent last week signalled the Bundesbank's willingness to maintain
its slow relaxation of monetary policy.
This was not enough, however, to temper the market's disappointment over the
reluctance of the central bank to cut either the Lombard or the discount
rate last Thursday.
This week, the prevailing unhappy mood on the bund market is unlikely to be
reversed by preliminary data on inflation for March.
This is likely to be down from a year-on-year rate of 3.4 per cent in
February, showing progress towards the 2 point something the German central
bank is expecting by the end of the year.
But with M3 money supply growth seemingly out of control, the Bundesbank
cannot cut rates generously even if wanted to.
A further reminder of M3 distortions will come this week with the figure for
February. Following a 20 per cent-plus rise for the seasonally adjusted,
annualised January figure, M3 growth in February is likely to be at least 16
per cent.
Even if this can be explained away by special factors, such a figure is
still highly embarrassing in relation to the Bundesbank's M3 target corridor
of 4 to 6 per cent for 1994.

The gilt market faces a new week in a fragile state after another volatile
trading day on Friday.
For some time now, the market has been unable to focus on what, by and
large, have been favourable UK economic fundamentals, because gilts have
been caught up in weakness of the international bond markets.
Last week's statistics were on balance positive, with a lower than expected
public sector borrowing requirement and weak producer prices figures
offsetting the upturn in average earnings.
The announcement of a March 30 gilt auction, the first floating-rate note
issue for some time, was generally seen as positive, since it may tap a new
appetite for gilts among banks and building societies.
The main economic figure this week will be the inflation numbers for
February, published on Wednesday. The market consensus is that the headline
rate will drop from January's 2.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent while the
underlying rate (excluding mortgage payments) will fall from 2.8 per cent to
2.6 per cent.
A weak RPI number may allow the authorities to make a further 0.25 per cent
cut in base rates. However, they could easily decide to wait until after the
next meeting between the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor,
on March 30, before making their move.

FT  21 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors bank on decisive Italian poll
 -International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Italy's voters go to the polls on March 27 and 28, they will have a
vast array of parties - on the right, left and centre - from which to choose
and a new electoral system to try out, consisting of a mixture of first past
the post and proportional representation.
For the Italian government bond market, however, the primary concern is
whether a stable government can be formed.
Bond market investors want to see a government which has a working majority,
and which has a commitment to tackling the budget deficit, keeping inflation
under control, and pushing ahead with the privatisation programme.
Economists point out that on paper, at least, the economic fundamentals and
background to the Italian government bond market look good.
Italy was one of the best performing government bond markets in local
currency terms last year and investors piled in for the high yields and
scope for capital gains as interest rates declined.
However, as with most of the other European government bond markets, 1994
has not been so rosy. Italy has witnessed a sharp back-up in yields - from
8.5 per cent on 10-year bonds in early February 1994 to 9.8 per cent in
early March.
This reflects the general unease over US inflationary prospects, heavy
selling by big investors, such as the US-based hedge funds, irritation at
the slow pace of easing by the Bundesbank, and political uncertainty at
home.
Yet, as Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets,
points out, Italian inflation remains well under control with an annual rate
of 4.2 per cent in January and February.
'The fall in inflation since 1990 has undoubtedly been facilitated by the
recession, but the labour market reforms of the past two years should mean
that inflation stays low despite economic recovery,' he says, forecasting an
average inflation rate of 3.7 per cent in 1994 and 3.1 per cent in 1995.
On the budget deficit, Mr Marco Pianelli, southern European economist at
Nomura Research Institute Europe, argues that due to lower financing costs
this should 'come well below the L144,200bn target, even in the absence of
supplementary measures.'
Mr Jessop points out that on the debt front, Italy is expected to over-fund
in 1994 by L30,000bn in order to take into account the big jump in bond
redemptions, from L78,000bn in 1994 to L178,000bn in 1995, and says this
implies net issuance in 1994 of around L175,000bn which he believes should
be manageable.
Meanwhile, the privatisation programme is expected to generate funds which
will be used to repay debt.
There are concerns that some of the proceeds could be diverted to other
parts of the state holding companies rather than used to pay off debt, but
even so, Mr Jouni Kokko, European economist at SG Warburg Securities, says
these privatisation proceeds 'should make a significant contribution to pay
off debt rather than fund current expenditure'.
As inflation comes down, and as the Bundesbank continues to cut interest
rates (albeit at a snail's pace over recent months) there should be scope
for the Bank of Italy to lower its key discount rate, and for the bond
market to rally.
Mr Kokko is forecasting a 10-year yield spread of 230 basis points over
German bunds in 12 months' time, against the recent 310 basis points.
However, the difficulty lies in predicting the short-term scenario. The
uncertainty comes from whether or not a workable majority can form after the
election, with many economists admitting that they are unsure whether there
will be a centre-left coalition or a centre-right alliance, or a hung
parliament.
'Picking the winner of the Italian election . . . is a mug's game,' says Mr
Jessop.
'It doesn't matter what it is, just as long as it's a decisive majority,'
says Mr Andre da Silva, bond strategist at PaineWebber.
If a stable coalition forms quickly, the bond market ought to rally
strongly.
Mr Pianelli at Nomura points out that 'the environment is very good for the
bond market, so the market would fly if it got a stable coalition', such as
one formed between the socialist PDS and centre parties, or by the right
wing parties (Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the Northern League, and the
National Alliance) and the centre parties.
If the PDS managed to form a stable coalition and it kept Mr Ciampi as prime
minister, the market would be even happier.
However, both Mr Pianelli of Nomura and Mr Kokko of SG Warburg Securities
believe this particular scenario of an easily-formed coalition is highly
unlikely.
'None of the three big alliances is likely to get a majority, and even if
they do, they will be fragile coalitions. After the election there will
probably be a lot of horse-trading and it will be difficult to find a
sensible coalition,' says Mr Kokko.
Against such a background, the bond market is likely to remain nervous and
volatile and the spread over German government bonds will probably widen
initially.

FT  21 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Decoupling from US yet to take place -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest sell-off in the world's bond markets at the end of last week
showed plainly that a definitive 'decoupling' of European bonds from the US
market has yet to take place.
The sharpest falls in European bonds came on Friday as US bond prices
tumbled on the news that Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
had been summoned to the White House by President Bill Clinton.
But European bond markets looked vulnerable even before the latest panic
over US interest rate movements. The economic fundamentals still point to
further rate cuts in Europe - but the lesson of the last two months has been
that economic fundamentals are not enough to drive markets.
'We spent most of the week pushing the market up gently, then it was another
classic Thursday and Friday, with no rate cut (from the German Bundesbank)
and interest rate uncertainty in the US. The worrying thing is that there is
just nothing on the horizon to entice any buyers back into the market,' said
the head of trading at one London house.
There are, on the other hand, plenty of things to worry about, as the market
started churning out rumours - that Mr Greenspan plans to resign; that
several large gilt market-makers are unloading large loss-making positions;
that Japanese fund managers are poised to dump bonds and buy equities when
they return to the market at the start of their new financial year in April.
The short-term outlook in the US seems to be for more pain, with many
traders now hoping the Fed will raise rates by half a point this week,
rather than prolong the agony with small,  1/4 point hikes. In fact, many
dealers are now cursing the Fed's failure to act more firmly first time
round.
'The Fed is now in a no-win situation: if they don't tighten next Tuesday,
people will think the administration is running monetary policy and that
there will be a tendency to keep rates low, allowing inflation to rise. And
if they hike by  1/4 point, people will say the Fed's move has been
moderated by the administration,' said Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at
IBJ International.
Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg believes that people
would prefer a bigger rate hike: 'That would mean 'that's it for the time
being' and would calm inflationary fears.'
European monetary authorities also find themselves in rather a tight spot.
'Everyone thought that dollar weakness would eventually help, giving more
room to lower rates in Europe whatever happens in the US, but that has not
happened.'
European markets are also becoming weighed down by supply worries, he says,
describing last week's French BTAN (short-dated government bond) auction as
disappointing.
The German market, which has, it seems, partially decoupled from the US,
continues to outperform other markets, despite weakness at the long end.
Mr Kokko expects a 'fairly big repo cut of five to 10 basis points' this
week. The previous repo rate was set at 5.88 per cent but the call money
rate has fallen to 5.75 per cent.
The gilts market, meanwhile, has fared particularly poorly, as the UK market
is more closely linked to the US - perhaps logically, since the UK is ahead
of continental Europe, and therefore closer to follow the US in raising
interest rates.
The yield spread between 10-year gilts and Bunds has almost doubled, from 62
basis points a month ago to 114 basis points late Friday.
However, selling is still concentrated in the futures rather than cash
markets.
Dealers said that some investors who had sold futures to hedge cash
positions several weeks ago had returned to the market to buy back their
short position too early, and the market weakness at the end of last week
forced further futures selling.
'Conventional fund managers are reducing their overweight positions in bonds
into (market) strength,' said Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at
Lombard Odier's London-based fund management arm. 'We knew that would be a
problem for the market on the way up, but it has happened very quickly.'
Fund managers are also shortening the duration of their bond holdings,
because the short end of the market is generally considered safer, and
likely to benefit most from rate cuts when they come.
'We have done a little bit of shortening using structured medium-term notes
with embedded swaps,' said Mr Abberley. The notes have a redemption value
based on one-year German, French and Italian swap rates.
'We still like the 10-year end of the market but, risk-adjusted, the short
end looks better,' Mr Abberley said.
While a German rate cut would undoubtedly help get the market moving again,
many fund managers now feel that they need to rebalance their portfolios,
shifting away from bonds.
'Lots of fund managers are going into their quarterly meetings and deciding
that, at least for the moment, cash is king again,' said one trader.

Expectations of a further improvement in the economy and worries over extra
supply will continue to weigh on the Japanese government bond market.
The market is closed today for a national holiday, but investors are
focusing on the spate of important economic figures to be announced later in
the week.
Gross domestic production figures for the fourth quarter of last year are
expected to confirm weakness in the economy at the end of last year. Market
participants are expecting annualised negative growth of around 3.4 per
cent.
Leading economic indicators of business sentiment are expected to rise to a
four-month high, while household consumption for January is also projected
to reflect the recent pick-up in spending by households, which are now tired
of scrimping and saving.
Such data is expected to prompt a further shift in the perception of the
economy, and prevent a rise on the bond markets.
The Bank of Japan, however,is poised to continue to allow short-term money
market rates to remain at low levels due to the high level of demand for
funds ahead of the business year-end.
Investors are also expected to remain cautious ahead of an increase in bond
issuance by municipal governments starting next month.

FT  21 MAR 94 / The Markets: All eyes on the Federal Reserve - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve this week runs the risk of being damned if it does -
raise interest rates, that is - yet even more damned if it does not.
The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets tomorrow amid
widespread expectations in the capital markets that it will approve a
further tightening of US monetary policy.
There are certainly good reasons for it to do so. Although a succession of
statistics last week showed that inflation remains subdued, America's
economic expansion has proved surprisingly robust in the first months of
this year, and as labour and product market slack diminish, inflationary
forces will start building.
But it remains unclear how far and how fast the Fed will decide to push up
rates following its initial turn of the screw, on February 4, when it
tightened monetary policy for the first time in five years, with a quarter
of a point increase in Fed funds to 3.25 per cent.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has spoken of wanting to move from an
accomodative to a neutral stance, leaving the market guessing as to just
what constitutes neutrality. But many analysts are anticipating a 4 per cent
Fed funds rate by year end, while forward rates are suggesting that this
level could be reached by mid-year.
The Fed might decide in principle on further tightening tomorrow, while
leaving an actual move until April, perhaps after it has had a chance to
view the employment figures for March, due out on the first of the month.
However, a failure to tighten within days of the meeting would risk further
unsettling a jittery market. Its edginess was graphically illustrated on
Friday when a visit at short notice by Mr Greenspan to the White House for a
discussion on 'economic fundamentals' with Mr Clinton prompted a sharp
sell-off in bond markets around the world.
Mr Clinton, traders theorised, was trying to dissuade Mr Greenspan from
increasing rates, though the White House denied that any messages on
interest rates were given or received.
Whatever the president's motives, the fact that the discussions took place
so near to Tuesday's FOMC meeting points to a curious insensitivity on the
part of both the White House and Mr Greenspan to the anxiety of the credit
markets.
If the Fed fails to tighten in the wake of the meeting, it will risk being
seen as succumbing to White House pressures, and thus undermining its
inflation-fighting credentials.
Mr Greenspan has several options.
The market's jitteriness makes its reaction to any tightening move
particularly hard to judge. The Fed seems most likely to put another quarter
point on Fed funds, which would fit with Mr Greenspan's reputation for
gradualism. The danger in this course is that, rather than calming the
market, it will simply keep it in a state of nervous suspense, waiting for
the next 25 basis point increase.
Some analysts suggest that an immediate half-point increase in Fed funds
would dramatically underscore the central bank's inflation fighting
credentials and end the Chinese water torture of slowly rising rates. The
danger here is that it could spook the markets into thinking that the Fed
views inflation as far more serious a threat than it really is.
A middle way could be to accompany a 25 basis point increase in Fed funds
with a rise in the psychologically important discount rate - the rate the
Fed charges banks for loans - from 3 to 3 1/2 per cent.
Whatever path is chosen, there seems a good chance that a rise in Fed funds
will be accompanied by an increase in commercial banks' prime lending rates.
Last week Morgan Guaranty, alone among the largest banks in keeping its
prime rate below 6 per cent, moved it up in line with the rest of the
market, possibly anticipating a further upward shift.
Still, if Mr Greenspan plays his cards carefully it is possible that a Fed
tightening this week could improve the tone of the market, rather than
prompting the further sell-off which many analysts fear. After all, a
quarter point on Fed funds is already well factored in to bond prices and
last week the market showed encouraging signs of stabilising, before Mr
Greenspan's summons to the White House. With uncertainty over the Fed's
intentions out of the way, a market which is looking oversold might just
rally.
Japanese equities
Is it time to substantially increase portfolio weightings in the Japanese
equity market? After all, over the past week two prominent London analysts
have redoubled their advice to do so.
Mr Nick Knight, of Nomura, argues that the Nikkei index, which has been
stuck in a trading range just over 20,000 is set for a rapid move to 24,000,
with an outside chance of reaching 28,000.
'The bull story,' he says, 'is very simple and now difficult to refute -
economic recovery, with profits explosion due to corporate restructuring
with low inflation, low interest rates and high liquidity, all in a cycle
which is way behind the US.'
Mr Michael Howell, global strategist at Baring Securities, who focuses on
flow of funds rather than traditional valuation criteria, says Japan tops
his list of world stock markets.
Liquidity is rising, helped by Central Bank intervention, while Japanese
investors, with their lowest exposure to stocks in 13 years, have Y7
trillion in cash, banks and money market funds, which is ultimately likely
to return to equities.
Japan is certainly showing the first signs of light at the end of the
recessionary tunnel, with a report from the Bank of Japan last Friday
suggesting that the economy appeared to have ceased weakening.
The general expectation is for a slow upturn, with companies sticking to
conservative capital investment programmes and banks slowly strengthening
their balance sheets, weighed down with non-performing loans.
With only a modest fillip to personal consumption later in the year from the
June income tax cuts, GDP growth for the year may only just be positive.
Certainly, the fact that Japan is three years behind the US economic
recovery suggests that the market has the potential to offer substantially
greater capital gains than the US over the next few years, justifying some
portfolio shifting. But with US earnings still rising sharply, too great a
move could mean missing out on a final North American bull run.
The greatest risk in Japan is another sharp rise in the value of the yen to
the dollar, which could squeeze off the incipient recovery.
The continuing trade friction between Washington and Tokyo means that the
danger of the US talking up the yen is not going to go away.
Japanese concessions over the past few weeks - including Friday's
announcement of a sharp jump in semi-conductor imports - have taken a little
heat out of the issue. But it may boil up again if the Clinton
administration finds inadequate the unilateral market-opening initiatives
which Tokyo is promising to produce shortly.
Even so, it is hard to see the yen appreciating to greater than Y100 to the
dollar, and it could fall to between Y100 and Y115 later in the year on the
back of economic recovery and a falling trade surplus.
The Oscars
The big question facing Tinseltown is how many Oscar awards Steven Spielberg
will pick up for the much-acclaimed Schindler's List.
The awards will give a much needed fillip to Universal Studios and its
parent MCA, owned by Japan's Matsushita Group, which were responsible not
only for Schindler's List but for Spielberg's far bigger hit of last year,
Jurassic Park.
But the Oscars are not a particularly good guide to film industry investment
stocks. Warner Brothers, the studio owned by Time Warner, may not feature
prominently in the Oscars, but it has been top of the US box office league
for the past three years, thanks in no small measure to its steady,
long-time management team.
Time Warner stock has been weak recently because its cable television arm
has been hit by government-mandated rate reductions. But, with the
multi-media age looming, the shares look cheap, and have the added
attraction of a potential bid stock, since Canada's Seagram drinks group has
built up a 13 per cent stake.

FT  21 MAR 94 / The Markets: Conundrum of assessing inflation credibility -
Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the examples set by New Zealand and Canada, the UK and Sweden have
both adopted explicit inflation targets. While such an objective can be
helpful in establishing a coherent framework for monetary policy, it offers
no guarantee that the target will be adhered to or is credible.
A key issue relates to a phenomenon known as 'time inconsistency'. In
essence governments may say one thing, but find that it is in their interest
to do something different.
Suppose, for example, the government stated that its objective was to secure
zero inflation and that initially this was believed by wage bargainers. Wage
settlements would then be struck on the basis of zero price inflation. But
would it be optimal for the government to deliver this? Almost certainly
not. If, instead, the government engineered a little bit of inflation,
companies would find that prices were increasing faster than costs, making
it attractive to take on more workers.
From the government's perspective, for the price of a small increase in
inflation unemployment would have been lowered.
This is not the end of the story. The fall in unemployment would have come
about because the government had managed to 'trick' workers into believing
that it would deliver zero inflation, thereby forcing them to accept a cut
in real wages. Workers would be unlikely to fall for that again.
The 'time consistent' policy is one where inflation is at a level where the
cost of 'cheating' by the government exactly outweighs the benefits. This
may coincide with the government's official target, but it could easily not.
Crucially, it is this level of inflation that will get built into wage
settlements over the longer term.
Such a situation may be developing in the UK. The Governor of the Bank of
England continually stresses his commitment to reducing inflation into the
lower half of the 1 to 4 per cent target range. Yet no government in the
last 30 years has ever achieved this. If, instead, people come to believe
that the authorities would be content with inflation simply within its
target range, then it could prove impossible ever to lower inflation
substantially below 3 to 4 per cent without a further deep and damaging
recession.
A further issue relates to the difficulty of forecasting inflation.
Inflation responds with long and variable lags to monetary policy changes.
This means that the UK authorities are obliged to set interest rates with a
view to securing underlying inflation within its target range in one or two
years' time.
To achieve this they need to be confident in their ability to forecast
inflation developments. Yet the government's poor track record in delivering
consistently low inflation in recent years clearly calls this into question.
One promising approach for the authorities to pursue is to take greater
account of the expectations of inflation contained in financial markets.
Market expectations should embody all the available information on inflation
and these expectations provide an immediate guide to the credibility of the
government's stated inflation target.
This information is captured to a large extent in the yield curve. The
standard yield curve shows the average interest rate expected over the
period to maturity of bonds outstanding. It is more useful to turn the yield
curve around to derive implied forward rates. Thus, for instance, the yield
on a two-year bond can be re-expressed as the yield on a one-year bond
together with the yield expected on another one year bond in one year's
time, along with any risk premium that investors may require in case their
expectations are not fulfilled.
If we assume that this risk premium is small, then the forward curve will
show the time path of short-term interest rates expected by the market.
Furthermore, changes in the shape and level of the forward rate curve will
carry important information about changes in market expectations for the
path of interest rates and inflation.
Developments in the UK forward interest rate curve over the past six weeks
are shown in the accompanying graph. Prior to the base rate cut on February
8, market expectations were for interest rates to rise gradually over the
next few years, settling down eventually at about 7.5 per cent. Following
the base rate cut, short-term interest rates obviously fell, but the forward
rate curve suggests that lower rates are not expected to be sustained beyond
one year. After six years, interest rates expectations are actually higher
than they were prior to the base rate cut.
This shift in the forward rate curve can be interpreted directly as a
worsening in long-term inflation expectations. In other words, the last base
rate cut was viewed by UK financial markets as damaging the credibility of
the government's inflation target.
Since then there has been a further upward revision to interest rate
expectations. Compared with the situation prevailing in early February,
interest rates are now expected to be about 1 per cent higher from 1997
onwards, with rates expected to stabilise eventually at close to 8.5 per
cent. The bulk of the deterioration would seem to reflect a further
worsening in inflation expectations.
Real yields on index-linked gilts are running at just under 3.5 per cent for
maturities beyond five years. Even if we allow for an inflation risk premium
on conventional gilts relative to index-linked gilts, it would now seem that
the market no longer believes that the government's inflation target will be
achieved over the longer-term.
This is a marked turnround from the situation prevailing at the time of the
Bank of England's last inflation report and should be of concern to the
authorities. If the UK government is serious about reducing inflation into
the lower half of the target range, it may soon have to think seriously
about the possibility of raising interest rates to bolster its
anti-inflation credibility.

FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Boeing net earnings set to drop
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, forecast that its operating margins
would be largely maintained in 1994, positioning it for the next expansion
cycle, Reuter reports from Seattle.
In its annual report it added that corporate net earnings would fall as a
result of declining sales and research and defence expenditures that will
increase from last year's Dollars 1.7bn level.
The group again warned that it expected sales to fall in 1994 to around
Dollars 21bn from Dollars 25.4bn as aircraft deliveries continue to decline,
reflecting the downturn in the world travel market,
Sales at its defence unit should rise by about 10 per cent over the Dollars
4.4bn level of 1993 because of the company's recent designation by the space
agency Nasa as prime contractor for the space station.
Because of higher R&amp;D expenses, mainly on the 777 commercial jet and a
next-generation 737, 'there will be a significant decline in net earnings as
a per cent of sales for 1994', Boeing said.
It predicted that the world air travel market would grow at an average
annual rate of slightly more than 5 per cent until 2010, creating a total
world market for commercial jets of about Dollars 800bn over the next 16
years.

FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nikkei derivatives for Simex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOCA RATON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Singapore International Monetary Exchange has become the first
non-Japanese futures exchange to be given the licensing rights to trade
futures and options contracts based on the newly-created Nikkei 300 Japanese
stock index. The rights were granted by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the
Japanese newspaper,
The capitalisation-weighted Nikkei 300 is expected to supplant the
widely-followed Nikkei 225 as the benchmark index of the Japanese stock
market, and the futures licensing agreement gives Simex the opportunity to
continue its lead in Asian stock index futures derivatives.
The Simex intends to trade Nikkei 300 derivatives in direct competition with
the Osaka futures exchange, which already holds rights to the same index.
The Singapore exchange has not announced a launch date for the new Nikkei
products, but says it will trade its Nikkei 300 and Nikkei 225 stock index
products side by side.
In January and February there were more than 1.3m Nikkei 225 futures and
options contracts traded on Simex, substantially more than similar contracts
in Osaka or on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Separately, the Simex and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have agreed to
extend their mutual offset arrangement for five years. The arrangement,
instrumental in Simex's creation in 1984, allows trades made at either
exchange to be offset on the other's trading floor.
It was implemented to give the CME a presence in the Asian time zone, and
has continued despite the invention of Globex, an international after-hours
futures trading system.

<TEXT>
Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese construction company, is to sell its 25 per cent
stake in Frankfurt Properties Investments and withdraw from planned property
development in the centre of Frankfurt.
Kumagai is selling the stake to Telenorma, an electronics equipment maker
and a subsidiary of Bosch of Germany.
The Japanese group is closing its wholly-owned subsidiary in Holland, KTN
Realty which held the stake in Frankfurt Properties Investments. Telenorma
will take over the Frankfurt company.
Kumagai said it had sold the stake because of difficulty in obtaining
planning permission from the German authorities, the weakening of the
property market and gloomy prospects for the planned project.
Its withdrawal from the Frankfurt project, initially valued at Y70bn to
Y80bn, and the closure of its Dutch subsidiary will result in Kumagai
incurring a Y6bn (Dollars 57m) loss.
The move comes on the heels of its withdrawal from a highway project in
Bangkok, Thailand, and highlights the problems Japanese construction
companies are facing in their overseas ventures.
Kumagai said that as a result of the sale it would incur a greater loss from
its overseas operations than previously forecast. Its extraordinary losses
from overseas businesses is now expected to be Y32bn, rather than Y21bn as
forecast in February.
However, the company does not, as a result, foresee a larger net loss in the
current year to the end of March.
It is being helped by a larger operating profit than previously estimated
and plans to offset the increased overseas loss by selling assets, such as
bonds and trust funds as well as properties.
Japan's ministry of finance has ordered Kankaku Securities, a medium-sized
broker, to suspend corporate client transactions from March 25 to April 7
over the broker's illicit client deals, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.

FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: SCA buys French packaging group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, plans to buy a 90 per cent
stake in Otor Holding, a privately-held French packaging company, in a deal
worth up to FFr2bn (Dollars 346m).
The move will be partially funded by a SKr1bn share issue to foreign
investors. It is the biggest acquisition by a Swedish forestry group on the
continent for three years.
SCA said the deal would increase its share of the European transport
packaging market to 11 per cent from 9 per cent and assist it in its
ambition of building a 15 per cent market position.
Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, SCA president, said: 'This gives us a strong presence
in one of Europe's four big markets and consolidates our position as
Europe's leading transport packaging group.'
The move comes only months after SCA announced investments of SKr3bn,
including a joint venture newsprint plant, based on 100 per cent recycled
paper, at Aylesford in southern England.
Otor is France's second largest producer of packaging used for transporting
goods, with a 12 per cent market share.
It produces 360,000 tons a year of corrugated board in six French and two
British plants. It also produces 250,000 tons of container board, based on
recycled fibre, and its operations include a recycled-paper company. Profits
of FFr108m last year, on sales of FFrs1.9bn, are expected to rise to FFr170m
in 1994.
SCA said the acquisition would bring FFr100m in synergy benefits and improve
1994 earnings after financial items by SKr190m. It will pay an initial
FFr1.77bn and up to FFr255m more if Otor's 1994 and 1995 profits exceed last
year's.
The vendors, Mr Jean-Yves Bacques and family, will subscribe to SKr300m of
the share issue, with the balance being placed with international investors.
SCA noted it had already tapped its own shareholders with a SKr1.4bn rights
issue last year.
The group has a reputation for being the least cyclical of the Nordic
forestry groups, because of a strong bias towards hygiene products through
its Molnlycke unit.
Its resilience was apparent last year when it achieved a SKr1.21bn profit
after financial items, despite a weak pulp and paper market. This compares
with a SKr451m profit a year earlier.
The group expects profits to rise to SKr1.7bn - SKr2.2bn this year, helped
by an improving pulp and paper market. The dividend is raised to SKr3.40 per
share from SKr3.10.

Argentina and Iberia, Spain's state-owned national airline, have settled
their three-year dispute over the privatisation of Argentina's flag carrier
Aerolineas Argentinas.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, and Mr Javier Salas,
Iberia president, signed a deal last week requiring Iberia to inject Dollars
500m into the heavily loss-making Aerolineas, raising its stake to 85 per
cent from 30 per cent.
The latest crisis at Aerolineas was sparked off last year by Mr Cavallo's
refusal to commit its share of the Dollars 500m capital increase.
The government's 33 per cent stake will drop to 5 per cent, with the
employees holding the remaining shares. The government will, however,
continue to recognise Aerolineas as Argentina's flag carrier.
Most of the capital injection will be used to reduce the Dollars 700m in
loans Iberia had advanced Aerolineas, and Dollars 100m is earmarked for new
investments. The Spanish and Argentine banks that held most of the remaining
shares in Aerolineas on behalf of Iberia have withdrawn from the company.
As part of the deal, the government will ban charter flights, removing a
growing source of competition on international routes. However, it rejected
Iberia's demands for tighter regulation of domestic flights. Iberia wanted
it to restrict the entry of strong, possibly foreign-owned, competitors into
the local market.
Iberia will also be allowed to provide ground services for Aerolineas, which
are monopolised by an air force-controlled company, helping to reduce
operating costs.

Jardine motor arm

Jardine International Motor Holdings, the car distribution arm of the
Jardine Group, surprised the Hong Kong market with a 23 per cent jump in net
profits to USDollars 73.2m in 1993, from USDollars 59.5m in 1992.
Gains were fuelled by strong performances in distribution and service
operations in Hong Kong, Macao and China, and helped by a lower tax bill.
There was also a turnround in the UK and Australia while sales in China
surged despite the austerity drive in place for part of 1993.
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said: 'While the year has begun well in China
and Hong Kong, with continuing demand for Mercedes-Benz motor vehicles,
there remains uncertainty over the impact on car sales of the introduction
of new taxation in China.'
The new taxes, which come into effect next month, put a 150 per cent levy on
top-range big engine cars sold to joint ventures - where around two-thirds
of China sales are made.
Earnings per share rose 19 per cent to 15.34 US cents from 12.93 cents, and
directors are recommending a final dividend of 5.80 cents for a total payout
of 7 cents, up 16 per cent.

float

<TEXT>
Shell Australia, part of the Anglo-Dutch oil group, plans to float its
metals division on the stock market. Its 37.5 per cent interest held in the
Worsley bauxite/alumina project in Western Australia will, however, be
excluded from the sale.
The company declined to say when the float might take place, but claimed
preparations were 'at an advanced stage'.
The main assets to be floated include a 30 per cent interest in the
Boddington gold mine and a 42 per cent interest in the Cadjebut zinc/lead
project, both in Western Australia.
The metals division (including Worsley) made a pre-tax profit of ADollars
30m (USDollars 21.4m) last year, on sales of ADollars 225m. Gold production
was 113,000 ounces; zinc production (concentrate), 43,000 tonnes; lead
production (concentrate), 12,000 tonnes.
The announcement comes as Gencor, the South African resources house, and
Royal Dutch/Shell, Shell Australia's parent, continue discussions over
Gencor's purchase of a major part of Royal Dutch/Shell's metals interests.
These talks were announced last May, and if the deal goes ahead, it is
reckoned to be worth USDollars 1.5bn - Dollars 2bn.
But as far as Shell Australia is concerned, Gencor's primary interest is
thought to centre on the Worsley joint venture, which produces around 13 per
cent of Australia's alumina. This is understood to be the main reason for
excluding the holding from the flotation plan.

FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney attendance shows
fall in second year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group that last week agreed terms with its
banks for a FFr13bn (Dollars 2.25bn) rescue package, has suffered a sharp
fall in attendance over the past year, according to Mr Philippe Bourguignon,
chairman.
Mr Bourguignon told Journal du Dimanche, the French newspaper, that about
9.5m people will have visited the EuroDisneyland theme park by the end of
its second year on April 12, against 10.5m visitors during the first year.
One cause of the decline was a reduction in the number of British visitors.
The UK was one of EuroDisneyland's largest markets in the first year.
However, the pound's weakness against the French franc, following the autumn
1992 currency crisis, triggered a significant fall in British bookings last
spring and summer.
The pound has since strengthened slightly against the franc. Mr Bourguignon
said Euro Disney plans to try to boost attendance from the UK. 'Our priority
for this season is to reconquer the British market,' he added.
Mr Bourguignon did not disclose details of the company's plans for the UK.
However, Euro Disney last year secured a significant increase in attendance
from the French through a successful campaign of aggressive advertising and
price promotion.
Euro Disney last year was also hit by a fall in the number of German
visitors. More recently it is understood that advance bookings for the
coming spring and summer season have been depressed by uncertainty over the
progress of the financial restructuring.
'Understandably, parents were worried about promising their children a trip
to Euro-Disneyland only to find that the park had been closed,' said one
insider. 'Now that the rescue has been agreed, we ought to see a rush of
bookings.'
Despite the rescue, Euro Disney is expected to remain in the red this year.
Morgan Stanley forecasts a net loss of FFr1.5bn for the present year to
September 30 with the company scheduled to break even only in the 1995/96
financial year.

Hyundai of South Korea has shelved the re-opening of its CDollars 400m car
assembly plant near Montreal indefinitely because of doubts that projected
output of its Elantra from 1995 would be economic, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal.
The plant was closed temporarily last summer when production of the
slow-selling Sonata fell to an annual rate of 15,000, or 15 per cent of
capacity.
The company last year negotiated with governments to help re-equip the plant
to make the Elantra.

FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: LCH gets price tag of Pounds 140m - Four
more companies set their sights on a stock market quote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Capital Holdings is emerging from the financial wreckage of the
former Randsworth Trust property company and will get a listing valuing it
at around Pounds 140m.
Randsworth was one of the most aggressive property companies of the 1980s,
but following its privatisation in 1989 it went into receivership and was
rescued by its bankers, Citibank.
Citibank is expected to sell 65-75 per cent of LCH through a placement and
public offer which will raise up to Pounds 100m. The bank said it would
retain its remaining shareholding of up to 35 per cent as a long-term
investment.
The flotation is scheduled for May.
The bank said it was selling down its shares in LCH to free the management
from financial restrictions imposed under US banking regulations while
Citibank retained control.
LCH retains much of Randsworth's portfolio. Its 14 properties, valued at
Pounds 227.6m in December, are almost entirely located in London's West End.
LCH is one of a growing list of property companies aiming for flotations in
the first half of 1994.
The company will be run by two joint managing directors, Mr Nigel Kempner
and Mr Stephen Musgrave, who joined Randsworth in 1987.
Mr David Newbigging - former chief executive, or taipan, at Hong Kong
trading group Jardine Matheson and the current chairman of Rentokil - is to
become chairman of LCH after the flotation.
Mr Kempner said West End property values offered substantial upside
potential because of the limited availability of new space and strong demand
for property in core locations.
The company plans to use the rental stream from its core portfolio,
estimated at Pounds 17.5m in 1993, to fund development of some of its
existing properties. It will also look for property purchases, or joint
venture projects.

He will leave his current post as deputy chief executive of British

He was also chairman of Rover Group, BAe's vehicles arm.
Mr Simpson, 51, was elected to the board at Lucas last Friday - the day on

into the ownership of BMW, the German carmaker.
Lucas sought for months to secure the services of Mr Simpson.

FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lihir Gold flotation threatened with delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRNS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of Lihir Gold Company, which will have the RTZ Corporation of
the UK as its biggest shareholder and operator, is threatened with delay
because of recent upheavals in the government of Papua New Guinea.
The company, which will develop one of the world's biggest gold mines in the
crater of an extinct volcano on the PNG island of Lihir, is scheduled to be
floated on the Australian stock exchange in September. It is expected to be
valued at more than Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 820m).
However, the PNG government has not yet issued a Special Mining Lease for
the project, without which the flotation process will stall. This lease was
expected to be issued in January at the latest. But, Mr Pias Wingti, PNG's
prime minister, reshuffled his cabinet and the new minister for mines, Mr
John Kaputin, will not be hurried into giving a decision.
The delay is costing RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, some useful
cash flow. Only after the licence is issued will RTZ complete a deal agreed
a year ago to sell another 16 per cent to Nuigini Mining, its partner in the
project, for Dollars 48m. The PNG government is to take 30 per cent of the
project for Dollars 42m, its share of the Dollars 138m spent by the partners
so far.
When Lihir Gold is set up, RTZ will raise about Dollars 300m in debt
financing. Lihir will be floated to raise Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m. PNG
citizens will get preferential treatment to take about 10 per cent of the
company and the Malaysian Mining Corporation is expected to emerge with up
to 20 per cent, either bought from RTZ or via a placement or
sub-underwriting.
RTZ would be left as operator of the mine with 24-30 per cent of the new
company, and Nuigini Mining, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold of the US,
with 18-23 per cent.
Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of Nuigini, said at the weekend that he was
confident the Special Mining Lease would be issued. 'But we are all on
tenterhooks. Obviously, if the lease is not issued until mid-year the
flotation schedule would have to be changed.'
RTZ was continuing talks with bankers about raising the debt and some
technical work was being carried out on the Dollars 625m project.

FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Persona valued at Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Persona Group, a Surrey-based distributor of personal computer networking
products, is coming to the market by way of a placing which values the
company at about Pounds 20m.
Some Pounds 9m is being raised of which about Pounds 2.5m will be available
to the company to cut debt and strengthen the balance sheet.
The group lost money in 1989 and 1990 and was then reorganised. Between 1991
and 1993 sales rose from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 22.9m, while pre-tax profits
grew from Pounds 78,000 to Pounds 1.75m.
Mr Wayne Channon, chairman and managing director, said the company
distributed products mainly of US companies.
Persona is a direct competitor to the larger Azlan Group which came to
market earlier this year. The two companies have similar product and
marketing strategies. Azlan's striking price was 230p. It is now trading at
264p.
Persona is in one of the fastest growing parts of the personal computer
business as customers seek to tie their machines together in local and wide
area networks. Persona distributes products from companies including 3Com,
Mountain Networks and SynOptics directly to resellers.
Sponsor to the flotation is Beeson Gregory. Impact day will be March 28.

FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lombard Insurance to float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four months after Independent Insurance became the first general insurance
company to gain a stock market listing for more than 30 years, another
insurer is set to float.
Lombard Insurance, a Tonbridge-based company bought out by its managers last
year, expects to raise Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m from the flotation, planned to
take place in the next few months. Overall, Lombard is expected to be valued
at Pounds 60m-Pounds 70m. After the fund-raising, net assets would be
roughly Pounds 50m.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.5m for the seven months of
1993 that followed the management buy-out. Annual underwriting profits of
Pounds 3.1m compared with losses of Pounds 2.8m in 1992 and Pounds 5.9m in
1991.
Mr Andrew Laing, managing director, said the extra capital would 'raise
awareness of Lombard', especially in the broker markets where it competes
with companies such as Independent, Norwich Union, Commercial Union and
Zurich Insurance and help sustain rapid recent growth. Premium income
increased by 25 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 87.7m, following a 33 per cent
rise in 1992.
Some 60 per cent of Lombard's income comes from personal lines such as
household and private car, where the company specialises in insuring 'mature
drivers' with good safety records. In commercial lines the company
specialises in insuring small and medium-sized companies, focusing on
property and business interruption risks.
Mr Laing stressed the importance of an agreement negotiated with the
company's previous owners last year, indemnifying Lombard for losses
occuring prior to the buy-out. A trust fund of Pounds 38.9m is designed to
cover all liabilities on claims occuring before June 1 1993.
The group's management, which owns about 10 more per cent of the company's
equity, expects to retain its shareholding, although the venture capitalists
who backed the management buy-out last year could sell some of their shares.
A placing and intermediaries offer will be handled by Charterhouse Bank and
Charterhouse Tilney Securities.

FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Fiscal Properties seeks Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiscal Properties is hoping to raise Pounds 25m through a flotation next
month.
The group invests in commercial properties that are mainly let to the
government. The portfolio has grown from a value of Pounds 12.3m at the end
of December 1991 to Pounds 52.9m at the end of January this year.
A combination of new ordinary shares and convertible unsecured loan stock
will be issued. The size of the issues will be announced, along with the
pricing, on impact day on Wednesday week.
Last year the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 247,000 on rental
income of Pounds 3.2m.
The company was founded by Mr Terry Goddard, chairman and finance director,
and Mr Gordon Bloor, chief executive and managing director, in 1985.
All its investment properties are outside central London and do not command
high rents, a factor which the directors believe leaves it less exposed to
downturns.
Half the income stream is guaranteed to the year 2006, and all contracts
feature upward only rent reviews.
After the flotation the group's venture capitalists - Montagu Private
Equity, 3i and SO. PA. F of Italy - will hold around 35 per cent of the
company. The three are not selling any shares.
The two founders will hold 15 to 20 per cent. Mr Goddard will be selling
some shares for personal reasons.
Sponsor and broker to the issue is Paribas. Dealings are expected to
commence on April 15.

FT  21 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Barnes &amp; Noble approach to Pentos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos, the specialist retailing group which includes the Dillons bookshop
and Athena cards and poster chains, is considering an approach from Barnes &amp;
Noble, the US bookstore group.
Any arrangement between Pentos and B&amp;N to open a range of cut-price
bookshops would revive the controversy over the future of the net book
agreement, which governs most book sales in the UK and allows publishers to
decide on the minimum price for a book.
However, while Mr Bill McGrath, Pentos chief executive, is said to be keen
to explore whatever possibilities arise, any decision is some way off.
Analysts expect the group to make a rights issue in the near future, and an
announcement on any arrangement with B&amp;N would not come until after that -
probably in December or early next year.
Mr McGrath, who took over as chief executive in December, is said to believe
that the NBA will disappear, but not to favour taking the pro-active stance
of his predecessor, Mr Terry Maher, in undermining it.
In particular, he is unlikely to want to intensify pressure on the NBA,
which is supported by publishers, when the group is keen to maintain cordial
relations with its suppliers. A similar rationale appears to lie behind the
group's denial that Athena might not be able to reach new payment
arrangements. 'Athena would not contemplate doing anything unilaterally that
would damage the relationship with its suppliers,' the company said.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Rescue near for Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is this week expected to unveil its rescue package for
Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank which is set to announce on Thursday a
hefty loss for 1993.
The government is ready to inject around FFr4bn (Pounds 450m) of fresh
capital into the bank, according to recurrent press reports. It could also
take much of the bank's non-performing property loans and put them into a
new state-backed company.
Credit Lyonnais has refused to comment on a report in the Nouvel Economiste
weekly that last year's losses would total FFr4.5bn, despite a sharp
reduction in provisions against bad loans because some FFr40bn of these
loans would be shifted into a shell company. This new company would be
financed by a Credit Lyonnais loan, but this would be guaranteed by the
state which would bear any losses on the loans.
In its 1992 annual report Credit Lyonnais said its exposure on direct
property lending amounted to FFr24bn. Of this 'a fraction seems compromised'
and therefore it only made a provision of FFr6bn. The Nouvel Economiste
article claims that the bank was grossly under-provisioned and had told the
finance ministry that - in the absence of a state rescue - FFr22.5bn of
provisions would be required in its 1993 accounts. Of this, FFr13bn would be
to cover property loans, with the rest for industrial loans and
shareholdings.
Some private French banks, as well as the European Commission, may question
the state aid for Credit Lyonnais.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Rancour grows on William Hill acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The temperature is rising in the dispute between Brent Walker and Grand
Metropolitan over the Pounds 685m acquisition of the William Hill and Mecca
Bookmakers betting business.
Last week GrandMet started court proceedings to seek 'rectification' of the
sale agreement, claiming Brent Walker had changed its interpretation of one
aspect of the deal.
Brent Walker appears incensed by GrandMet's move which it sees an an attempt
to rewrite the agreement, and will today issue a statement. It seems to be
suggesting GrandMet expects to come off worse in arbitration and so is
trying to change the terms of the deal.
The two parties have been in dispute over the deal since autumn 1990, and in
July 1992 agreed to go to arbitration.
A partner of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, was appointed and is
preparing to receive final submissions. Although the parties agreed the
arbitrator's decision would be final, followers of the saga have always
thought the loser would resort to the courts.
The property and leisure group's statement today will argue that
rectification 'is not concerned with the interpretation of agreements, but
with the correction of alleged errors in the drafting of an agreement'.
Brent Walker and William Hill will say they will resist the proceedings
because they do not accept there were errors in the agreement.
The statement continues 'the writ issued by GrandMet has nothing to do with
interpretation, but is an attempt to rewrite parts of the agreement'.
The agreement was signed in September and the deal completed in December
1989. GrandMet promised the business would achieve profits of Pounds 55m in
the year to end September 1989. Brent Walker could reclaim part of the
purchase price if profits fell below Pounds 51m. In that case it could
reclaim 12.82 times the difference between the profits made and Pounds 55m.
By September 1990 Brent Walker was claiming a Pounds 160m refund of the
purchase price and refused to pay the final Pounds 50m then due. The courts
ruled in 1991 that Brent Walker had to pay the Pounds 50m.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Tantalising prospect of a better
diet - Volkswagen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An issue exercising at least one of the analysts summoned to Volkswagen
headquarters on Thursday is whether there will be asparagus for lunch.
Not unrelated, since it governs the prospects for a good lunch and jam
tomorrow, is how convincingly the board spells out VW's medium-term earnings
outlook.
Last year's figures, released last week, showing a DM1.94bn (Pounds 750m)
group deficit, 'don't mean anything', according to one invitee.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, is expected to issue a cautious forecast of
break-even for this year. But he is likely to wax lyrical on rapidly rising
profits thereafter. The board may also clarify the restructuring at Seat,
the Spanish subsidiary whose near-collapse has been blamed for last year's
earnings slump. VW expects it to be the only one of its marques to remain in
the red this year.
Although there are hefty doubts about the effects on unit labour costs of
the four-day working week currently in effect in Germany, and the overhang
of 30,000 surplus employees, analysts appear to have been convinced that new
production methods are enough to have turned the tide.
Ample portions of asparagus, usual at analysts' meetings traditionally held
in May - when the green stuff is in season and cheap - may serve to underpin
their belief.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Shaking off some dire conditions -
Prudential
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in the US weather and the prospects for the regulatory climate in
the UK will both have an impact on tomorrow's results announcement from
Prudential, the financial services and life insurance company.
The biggest turnround is expected from Mercantile &amp; General, the reinsurance
subsidiary, which in 1992 incurred a loss on its non-life operations of
Pounds 143m - described as 'dire' by Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential's chief
executive.
In 1992, two North American hurricanes alone produced losses of Pounds 56m.
More recent US disasters, such as the Californian earthquake and the
flooding, have not affected the insurance industry so badly.
Further growth is expected from the UK life and pensions side - Prudential
is the UK's largest life insurer - but the longer-term prospects for the
life sector are under something of a cloud. The need to compensate people
who were badly advised to transfer out of an occupational pension scheme is
worrying for the market while the impact remains unquantified. Further
uncertainty is added by the combination of a new regulator and the prospect
of new products and charging structures in the light of compulsory
commission disclosure.
The range of analysts' forecasts for pre-tax profits go from Pounds 510m to
Pounds 570m compared with Pounds 406m in 1992 - more than double the 1991
figure. The consensus on the dividend is for a 10 per cent increase.
Among other less central issues also likely to come up is the direction of
Jackson National, one of the largest US life insurance companies, which was
acquired by Prudential in 1986. There may also be questions about some
aspects of Prudential's fund management, following the loss of some
management contracts for pension funds, such as that of British Rail.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Soft commodities, hard prices: Deborah Hargreaves explains a
change in the market for coffee, sugar and cocoa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago coffee and cocoa farmers worldwide were leaving crops to rot
in the fields after a spectacular collapse in commodity prices. Today, the
picture is different as prices for 'soft' commodities such as coffee, sugar
and cocoa are surging, encouraging financial investors to turn their
attention to these previously unsophisticated markets.
Prices have been buoyed by crop difficulties, rising consumption and
declining world stocks for coffee and cocoa. The end to the recession in
many countries is expected to fuel demand.
Rising prices and an upturn in speculative interest in the soft commodity
markets has resulted in financial investors returning to commodities after
an absence of several years.
'New capital is increasingly focused on commodities and this is reflected by
growing exchange membership among international finance houses and banks,'
says Mr Robin Woodhead, chief executive of the London Commodity Exchange.
Poor returns expected on world bond markets have also encouraged
institutional investors to put cash into commodities. Even the metals
markets, where world stocks remain high, are benefiting from renewed
interest in basic commodities.
But it is not just speculation that is fuelling this year's rise in the soft
commodity markets. Coffee, cocoa and sugar crops are all expected to be
lower than forecasts for world consumption leading to a deficit, to be made
up from stockpiles.
Cocoa prices reached a five-year high at the end of last year with prices
breaching Pounds 1,000 a tonne on the London Commodity Exchange after
forecasts of a growing shortfall in production. Prices remain firmly above
Pounds 950 a tonne and production is expected to be between 120,000 and
170,000 tonnes lower than consumption.
The International Sugar Organisation last week revised its deficit forecast
to 2.4m tonnes this year - just over 2 per cent of world consumption - from
1.4m tonnes in December.
Prices have risen by almost 20 per cent for both raw and white sugar with
the May futures contract at New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange
reaching over 12 cents per lb last week.
Similarly, coffee prices hit their highest level for 19 months last week
when the LCE's second position futures contract touched Dollars 1,341 a
tonne. Coffee prices have also received a boost from the operation of a
producers' retention scheme.
Last October, 40 coffee-producing countries put together a plan to withhold
up to 20 per cent of supplies from the export market until prices increased.
This followed a dramatic collapse in the coffee market when prices fell to
their lowest level since 1974.
The retention scheme has been successful in adding to investors' fears of a
squeeze on stocks.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, works out production costs for
commodities each month. This shows a price below which it is not economic to
continue production. By this measure, commodity prices overall are 7 per
cent undervalued when compared with the costs of production.
Cocoa prices are 5 per cent below the costs of production and sugar prices 4
per cent lower. However, Goldman reckons coffee prices are 15 per cent
higher than production costs as the producers' retention scheme has begun to
bite.
Goldman points out that the low valuation of some commodities makes them a
good investment opportunity.
But not everyone is happy about the appearance of futures funds and
speculators in the traditionally gentlemanly commodity markets. The extra
cash can exaggerate a market move and some traders complain that the soft
commodity markets are becoming dominated by fund activity.
'Funds can push a market, but it is not the case that these markets are
bucking fundamental trends,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity analyst at
GNI, the London brokerage house.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Banks form alliance for sell-offs: Kleinwort Benson and BZW
in joint bid for electricity sale work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An alliance between Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, and BZW, the
investment- banking arm of Barclays bank, in bidding to become the
government's adviser on the next stage of electricity privatisation, could
mark the start of a trend in joining forces to win such work.
BZW confirmed yesterday that it had teamed up with Kleinwort to bid for the
task of selling the government's remaining 40 per cent stakes in National
Power and PowerGen, the two electricity generators. The sale is expected to
raise more than Pounds 4bn.
Both banks will be involved in giving advice and in placing the shares.
Kleinwort Benson advised on the original privatisation, while BZW was lead
financial adviser to the government over the sale of the Scottish
electricity companies, and advised Northern Ireland Electricity over its
privatisation.
Written presentations have already been submitted, and the competing banks
will present in person to the Treasury today. Warburgs, which advises
PowerGen, is not seeking the task, and other merchant banks would also face
conflicts of interest in applying: Schroders, for example, advises National
Power.
'The government is faced with quite a difficult task in finding in one house
the range of advisory and distribution skills they're looking for,' one
banker said yesterday. 'It wouldn't be surprising if a number of alliances
were being forged.'
Another banker pointed out that it was more commonplace elsewhere for banks
to join forces.
'We could be seeing the start of a trend that has come across the other side
of the Atlantic,' he commented.
Last year, for example, First Boston teamed up with Merrill Lynch to win the
mandate to act as global co-ordinators in privatising YPF, Argentina's
national oil company.
The timescale for the sale of the government's residual stake in the
generators remains uncertain, although the Treasury is keen to get the
proceeds in the 1994-95 financial year.
The decision not to refer the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission removed one possible obstacle to going ahead in the autumn.
But the delay in reaching a price-capping agreement with the electricity
regulator could contribute to putting back the sale until February 1995.

The City is expecting only modest growth from the publisher of the Daily
Express, which also announces on Thursday.  Recovery in advertising has been
fragmentary and United's national titles, like much of the national press,
have come under severe competitive pressures. Pre-tax profits could inch
ahead to Pounds 115m, from Pounds 109.9m.

Today, Lucas, the motor and aerospace components group, is expected to
report interim profits of Pounds 15m-Pounds 19m, compared with Pounds 5.2m.
Analysts still hope the Midlands-based group will make more than Pounds 80m
in the full year. The first half was affected by continuing tough trading
conditions - particularly in continental Europe. Most interest centres on
the impact that will be made by Mr George Simpson, who is leaving British
Aerospace to become Lucas's chief executive next month.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Swiss bank threatened with lawsuit over meaning of 'm'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two British businessmen are threatening to sue Union Bank of Switzerland
after one of its Swiss branch managers supplied a reference saying that a
customer was good for Pounds 18m, but later insisted that it had meant
Pounds 18,000. Two managers said that in Switzerland 'm' refers to 'mille',
not millions.
The dispute arose after the collapse of the sale of a Spanish resort
development, in which the two British businessmen had a majority stake.
The sale of the development depended on the receipt by the investors who had
agreed to buy it of a loan of Pounds 18m.
The transaction is one of several thought to be under investigation by the
Metropolitan Police. Detectives want to interview Mr George Lagoudontis, a
Greek businessman who allegedly agreed to lend Pounds 18m last May.
After Mr John Collins and Mr Tony Etridge had agreed to sell their majority
stake in a Valencia golfing and leisure resort last year, they tried to
verify the standing of Royal Trust of Greece, Mr Lagoudontis's company.
Mr Beat Hunold, manager of the UBS branch in Glarus, replied in German to
Barclays, Mr Collins' and Mr Etridge's bank, that Mr Lagoudontis was 'good
for 18m sterling'.
However, when the reference was checked again after delays in the transfer
of Pounds 18m and the exchange of contracts, Mr Hunold and a fellow manager
wrote on July 15 to say that he had not meant Pounds 18,000,000.
'In Switzerland, 'm' is used as an abbreviation for 'mille' (thousand) and
'mio' for million. Therefore, we understood your request to be for 18,000,
so our reply to you was absolutely correct,' they wrote.
The legal department of UBS in Zurich has defended its stance and said it
cannot give more information to Mr Collins' and Mr Etridge's solicitor
because it supplied the bankers' reference to Barclays in London.
Mr Collins said that UBS was trying to 'defend the indefensible' in not
admitting that it was at fault over the reference.
UBS in Zurich said that Glarus was a rural branch that might easily believe
'm' to be an abbreviation for thousand.
Although a price of Pounds 18m was agreed for the development - in which Mr
Collins and Mr Etridge held a controlling stake through companies in the
Isle of Man - the buyers now believe it is worth less than Pounds 10m.
Mr Zack Goodman, who acted as agent on behalf of Jouvin, a Channel Islands
company that intended to buy the development for private investors, said the
Spanish recession, together with prolonged uncertainty, meant that its value
could have been 'at least halved'. He said the sale had been delayed solely
because of uncertainty over the loan.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Dublin willing to back a temporary IRA ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government sought to breathe fresh life into the Northern Ireland
peace process yesterday by indicating that a temporary ceasefire by the IRA
would be welcomed in Dublin.
Speaking on Irish radio, Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, said a
temporary ceasefire would be 'a step in the right direction'.
The Irish government's decision to encourage a temporary ceasefire contrasts
with the previous approach in both London and Dublin of concentrating on the
prospects for a permanent cessation of violence.
Mr Spring said the Irish government would 'encourage' the IRA to move to a
permanent end to violence, and 'would want to build upon' a temporary
ceasefire.
His comments followed weekend reports of an interview given to New Century,
a leftwing British magazine, in which he appeared to suggest that a
temporary ceasefire could help to break the deadlock in the peace process.
In remarks intended to reassure unionist opinion, Mr Spring said Dublin's
view on the timing of talks with the republican movement remained 'very
firm'.
'I have to repeat that we will not negotiate with the IRA/Sinn Fein as long
as they support violence. If they want to enter the political process, there
has to be a permanent cessation of violence and a very firm declaration to
that effect,' he said.
That formula fits in with the consistent approach by the British government
since the publication of the British-Irish Downing Street declaration on
Northern Ireland in December.
But Dublin's increased willingness to welcome a temporary ceasefire appeared
to take the British government by surprise.
The Northern Ireland Office was unwilling to endorse Mr Spring's views.
Officials would say only that Sinn Fein could enter exploratory talks with
the British government within three months of a permanent cessation of
violence.
In the New Century interview, parts of which were published yesterday in The
Observer, Mr Spring appeared to indicate that a temporary ceasefire could be
built upon 'without making concessions' to the IRA or Sinn Fein, its
political wing.
In the interview, given two weeks ago, Mr Spring said the republican
movement's strategy appeared to be to offer a temporary cessation of
violence 'in order to sit down round the table with other nationalist
parties'. He said this would 'pose a bit of a dilemma'.
The apparent contradiction in Dublin's position would seem to lie in a
semantic distinction being drawn by Dublin between 'talks' and
'negotiations'.
An Irish government spokesman was unable to confirm or deny that talks,
either directly or indirectly with Sinn Fein - as distinct from negotiations
 -could take place after a temporary IRA ceasefire.
The IRA admitted yesterday carrying out the attack on Crossmaglen police and
army post, which seriously injured a policeman and brought down an army
helicopter on Saturday night.

FT  21 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs of a life in the UK housing market prompts the question of who will
win the extra mortgage business. The banks' share of net new lending has
grown to the point where last year it equalled that of building societies
for the first time. Despite the jump of more than Pounds 1bn in new lending
commitments by building societies in February, the market still looks tilted
in favour of the banks. Not only are building societies constrained by
limits on wholesale funding. Their regulator has also showed signs of
restiveness about the amount of fixed-rate business they do. Taken too far,
it could lead to a noticeable reduction in their overall margin without any
compensating fall in risk.
The trend could be distorted by the fact that Abbey National is likely to
give up some of last year's abnormally high 18 per cent share of the new
mortgage market. But it looks as though banks will again have a high share
of what for them has turned out to be a particularly lucrative source of
operating profit. Less certain is whether higher volume will be sufficient
to preserve the juicy interest spreads of some 2.5 percentage points which
banks have been earning on variable rate mortgages. Such spreads are already
tempting back foreign banks and centralised lenders who fund entirely in the
wholesale market. If the government's present review leads to building
societies being allowed to raise more wholesale money, they too would be
scrambling to win back some of the market share they have lost.

FT  21 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: German chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Results from the big three German chemicals companies - Bayer, BASF and
Hoechst - have struck an unexpected note of optimism. Dividend cuts aside,
the figures were marginally better than expected. More importantly, all
agree that chemicals markets turned some time in the fourth quarter, since
when improving conditions in the US have offset only gentle decline in
Europe. If that improvement is sustained, investors judged the turn quite
neatly: the shares of each have outperformed the German market by up to 10
per cent from a low-point in November.
There are still reasons for caution. While the outlook in industrial
chemicals is improving, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals could act as a
drag. History suggests that benefits flowing from a turn in the chemicals
cycle will not be spread evenly. Bayer and Hoechst outpaced the German
equity market from mid-1983 to mid-1984, the year after European economies
turned. BASF's higher exposure to petrochemicals delayed similar
outperformance until 1987. Given the scale of overcapacity in plastics
markets, that pattern could be repeated.
While costs are being cut and markets are no longer deteriorating, though,
earnings growth looks assured. The steady stream of restructuring
announcements - such as Hoechst's plan to spin-off its fibres business -
points to an encouraging emphasis on self-help. If the companies can avoid
the temptation to retrench as European economies improve, the combination of
earnings recovery and attractive yields will prove difficult to resist.

FT  21 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Media
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The media sector has been wafted higher on a breeze of good news over the
past year, outperforming the market by 26 per cent. The promise of an upturn
in advertising spend, the high operational gearing of many companies,
television bids, and racy headlines about the wonders of multimedia have
fuelled demand for media stocks. But the rise has been somewhat
indiscriminate. It now appears there are some worrying cross-currents in the
wind for printed as opposed to electronic media stocks.
Recent media groups to have reported, such as Reed Elsevier and Mirror Group
Newspapers, have seen little or no top line sales growth. Big paper
producers, such as Arjo Wiggins Appleton, MoDo, and SCA have also been
talking excitedly about the possibility of pushing prices higher. Demand for
paper is increasing as Europe's economies claw their way out of recession.
The pick-up in UK advertising has already been translated into fatter
newspapers. Merchants are restocking in the belief that the paper cycle has
turned. Utilisation rates in many paper mills seem set to climb to more than
90 per cent.
Fine papers for magazines have already experienced strong price rises this
year. Newsprint prices, too, appear to be pushing upwards - or, at least,
discounts are being reduced. Many publishers have locked into fixed price
contracts for newsprint for months ahead. But those companies which are more
reliant on circulation than advertising revenue could yet experience a nasty
margin squeeze. It is time to pick media stocks more selectively.

FT  21 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: The currency factor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England seems concerned that companies may have used devaluation
to boost margins rather than increase overseas sales, and recent trade
figures give some support to that idea. Such windfall profits gains might
also be expected to have an impact on earnings. The art is knowing in which
sectors it has been strongly felt when in aggregate the currency benefit
seems modest. Brokers' estimates for the non-financial part of the FT-SE-A
All-Share index show that currency gains account for about 3.5 per cent of
total earnings and around 10 per cent of the increase over last year.
Hedging of currency risk may mute the impact, but even in 1994 currency
gains are likely to be modest. The aggregate numbers may be misleading. The
utilities and stores sectors are almost entirely sterling-based. Some
sectors, notably pharmaceuticals, are, by contrast, strongly affected.
Still, overall for 1993, falling interest costs have had almost twice the
impact on earnings, and are likely to be an even more important factor this
year.
Currency and interest bills will moderately flatter the earnings recovery,
but the bulk of the 18-20 per cent rises estimated for 1993 will come from
productivity gains as slack is taken up. While the economy will expand
faster this year, earnings rises are likely to remain around 20 per cent,
and will be more dependent on volume increases. With such a marked variation
in currency and interest effects, it would be worth taking a close look at
companies' 1993 report and accounts as they plop through the letter box over
the next few weeks.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Railtrack's proposed contracts upset train operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Potential train operators have attacked Railtrack, the company set up to
take over British Rail's track and signalling after privatisation, for
abusing what they see as its dominant position in contract negotiations.
The proposed contracts appear to offer operators the repayment of their
track charge if a bridge or stretch of line becomes unusable but to provide
no compensation for any loss of income.
'The terms and conditions clearly transfer all the risk and obligations of
running a railway to the franchisees,' said Mr Peter Field, managing
director of South West Trains, which hopes to win a franchise on routes from
London Waterloo.
'We need guarantees that provide an absolute assurance that the
infrastructure will be looked after. The performance regime really has to
hurt Railtrack if it does not deliver.'
Mr Chris Green, who is due to take over the running of ScotRail next month
with plans ultimately for a buy-out, said: 'There should be a sharing of
risk, but at the moment it feels like a one-way transfer. The consequences
of a bridge washing away for three months would be huge in terms of the
train operator's income but low in terms of the cost of bridge replacement
to Railtrack.'
He also called for contracts that take account of economic changes beyond
the control of the operators, with Railtrack's charges falling in a
downturn.
Another area of disagreement has emerged over timetables. One prospective
franchisee, who declined to be named, said Railtrack was pressing for very
frequent changes to allow it to slot in more trains if a new operator came
along. That would pose difficulties to existing operators, he said.
Railtrack responded that it was negotiating 'in the open' and under the
scrutiny of the government, the franchise director, who is to arrange the
sale of BR franchises, and the British Rail board.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Italy's election
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Which of two starkly contrasting versions of Italy's future will emerge from
the elections due in less than a week's time? One version is the Italy of
political confusion, where an old order has collapsed and politicians trade
slogans over how to replace it. The other is the Italy of economic reform -
of curbed budget deficits, low inflation, rising exports and privatisation.
Will the election herald political as well as economic renewal, or will it
intensify political uncertainty and thus risk undermining economic progress?
Probably it will do neither. The election is unlikely to deliver a clear-cut
result that would break with the past of corrupt coalition politics. But nor
need the ensuing turbulence derail economic reform. More likely, it will
lead - after a period of party horse-trading - to formation of a government
committed to the sensible reformist path charted by its two predecessors.
Plus ca change . . .
To suggest that the new order will not be so dissimilar from the old might
seem odd. Italy is experiencing an unparalleled upheaval, with most of its
former political class discredited by scandal. For the first time, voters
appear to have a genuine choice between politicians preaching social
democracy and others espousing conservative and economically liberal values.
But neither side seems likely to secure an absolute parliamentary majority.
The hybrid electoral system may well produce a parliament just as fragmented
as the last, while the alliances of left, right and centre will splinter as
soon as the campaigning is over.
At least as important as the electoral arithmetic will be the economic
constraints facing a new government. They are so severe that, in practice,
the voters' choice may well turn out to be a mirage.
In the past two years, the technocratic governments of Giuliano Amato and
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi have made great strides towards reducing the budget
deficit, curbing the relentless rise in government debt, and encouraging
wage restraint. Their efforts have brought a fall in interest rates and a
devaluation-led surge in exports. But the virtuous circle they have created
remains fragile, and the financial markets are on the alert for signs of
back-sliding.
It is in this context that the politicians' sometimes extravagant campaign
promises must be judged. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the businessman leader of the
Forza Italia movement, tantalises Italians with the prospect of a lighter
tax burden without troubling to explain how it might be achieved.
Translating this into government policy, however, would produce an instant
lira sell-off and a rapid rise in interest rates.
Most informed Italians know that the real choice they face is between
persevering with economic change and being ejected from the mainstream of
European integration. The benefits of reform are already evident. If the
politicians throw it off course, they will reap a bitter reward.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Atlantic flights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Britain have stepped back from the brink of an airline trade war.
We should be thankful for that. A tit-for-tat scrap would have harmed
transatlantic passengers. It would also have put back the cause of global
airline liberalisation since the two countries profess to be the keenest on
opening the world's skies to competition.
But it would be too soon to celebrate. Washington's decision last week to
extend for a year a ticket 'code-sharing' arrangement between British
Airways and its affiliate USAir merely buys time to break the logjam over
creating an open skies regime between the two countries. Negotiations
stalled when the US pulled out of talks late last year. There are still no
plans to resume discussions.
What is needed is a bit more vision from the key players: Mr Federico Pena,
the US transportation secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, his British
counterpart. They must free themselves from a mercantilist perspective,
whereby their negotiating positions have been driven by their national
airlines. That is a recipe for procrastination and ultimate failure as the
established players have an incentive to maintain their existing positions.
Instead, Mr Pena and Mr MacGregor should look to wider national interests.
From this perspective, the benefits of opening the skies is great. The
present bilateral agreement between London and Washington specifies which
airlines can fly how often between which airports. Freeing up the system
would lead to more competition and cheaper fares. It would also enable new
air routes between the two countries to be opened up. Regional airports such
as Manchester and Cincinnati would be the biggest gainers. Passengers would
not need to travel so often to gateways such as Heathrow and New York's JFK
to catch their transatlantic flights.
Lower fares and greater convenience would boost traffic. This would have a
knock-on effect on trade and tourism. It would also enhance Britain's
position as Europe's principal hub for US flights and allow it to build on
its comparative advantage in aviation vis-a-vis the rest of Europe.
This, in turn, would help Washington secure similar open skies deals with
other European countries. At present, its only liberal regime covers traffic
to the Netherlands. Though some progress was made last week in opening up
traffic to Germany, the US has no agreement with France. If Paris and Bonn
saw more of their transatlantic traffic being diverted through the UK
following an open skies agreement with the US, they would have every
incentive to follow suit. Such a dynamic of competitive liberalisation has
been apparent in the telecommunications industry, also characterised by a
maze of bilateral deals.
With so much to gain, Mr Pena and Mr MacGregor must set a date for new
talks. With the right spirit, it should be possible to break the logjam.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Global warming
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's first treaty on combating the threat of global warming - one of
two conventions agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit - becomes international
law today. Last Wednesday in Geneva, 80 countries also reached broad
consensus on setting up the Global Environment Facility, a Dollars 2bn fund
to help developing countries pursue this goal.
These agreements represent some of the past decade's most ambitious attempts
to tackle global 'green' concerns. However, neither the treaty nor the fund
come close to a solution.
The global warming hypothesis is that increasing amounts of 'greenhouse
gases' in the atmosphere - particularly carbon dioxide - will cause the
planet to warm. Scientists say that it may take decades to establish or
reject this theory conclusively. Nor will it be clear for years whether, if
warming is occurring, its effects are damaging or beneficial.
Rio set out to find ways of curbing growth in emissions of these gases, in
case the hypothesis proves correct. However the treaty, in the much-amended
version which finally received agreement, requires signatories only to draw
up plans for curbing emissions, not to make actual cuts.
The GEF is also unlikely to do more than scratch the surface of its task,
given the small size of its budget and the dozens of countries petitioning
for a share.
In practice, devising a workable agreement on curbing emissions is likely to
be impossible. First, policing such agreements is hard since emissions are
difficult to monitor. Second, countries will be tempted to renege,
particularly if they are convinced that they will benefit from other
countries' continued observation of the rules.
The greatest obstacle, however, is securing agreement on the distribution of
cuts in emissions between different countries, given that any deep cuts are
more than likely to slow economic growth. Developed countries see the rapid
projected growth in emissions in China and India - and in Russia, should its
economy revive - as the greatest threat to atmospheric stability. However
developing countries may reasonably respond that the present atmospheric
concentration of these gases comes from industrialised countries, which will
continue to supply the bulk of emissions for years.
A more fruitful route may be to pursue the co-ordinated removal of subsidies
to fossil fuels, particularly coal, which would also encourage energy
efficiency.
Countries should also redirect their time and money towards considering how
to mitigate the effects of climate change if it occurs. That could mean
changing agricultural patterns, or even building dams around low-lying
regions in case sea levels rise.
Governments showed at Rio that they wanted to take precautionary steps while
global warming remains a potential but unproven hazard. These two approaches
 -eliminating subsidies and mitigating the effects of climate change -
should provide the way ahead.

Meanwhile, Lord Walker of Worcester, Britain's first environment minister,
must feel a sense of deja vu at his party's latest U-turn on out-of-town
shopping centres.
Back in 1971 Peter Walker, as he then was, attended a conference of the
cities in Indianapolis where he learned first hand about the social problems
caused by US shopping malls in terms of unnecessary congestion and inner
city decay. On his return to Britain he issued a circular to local
authorities urging them to resist the advances of hypermarkets.
If John Gummer, the environment secretary, wants to give local authorities
further guidance on the perils of out-of-town shopping he could do a lot
worse than re-issue his predecessor's advice.
Probably only needs a change of date.

Say what you will about Sir John Banham, the former director general of the
CBI, he keeps rattling the establishment cage. His criticisms of the way
Britain is run in his new book, Anatomy of Change, will not endear him to
Whitehall mandarins, and he has not made his chairmanship of the Local
Government Commission any easier by highlighting the Government's own
inability to make up its mind.
Given that Sir John has just added the chairmanship of Tarmac to his growing
portfolio of directorships, he could be forgiven for wanting to lighten his
load of public duties in order to concentrate on his business career.
However, Sir John's job of reviewing local government is only halfway
through and he insists he has every intention of staying on until the task
is finished in about a year's time.
That sort of devotion to public duty is surely worth a peerage. Will it be
Lord Banham of Avon, covering Gloucestershire, Somerset and Bristol, or Lord
Banham of Centrepoint?

Much mayhem in Australian stockbroking circles - or, more precisely, the
upper echelons of Ord Minnett, one of the country's largest broking firms
which recently bought itself out from Westpac with the help of Jardine
Fleming.
Neville Miles, Kerry Packer's old chum who organised last year's MBO, has
been deposed as joint managing director after losing the support of his
troops. Matters came to a head when half a dozen top analysts and the head
of the London office threatened to move to James Capel, which is desperate
to be a big player in Australia.
It is the second top management upheaval at Ord Minnett in less than a year
and the swift response to the threatened defections may have been prompted
by memories of what happened when
S G Warburg took control of Potter Partners. The nucleus of Potter's
research team defected to County NatWest's Australian operation and quickly
turned it into number one in its field.

If ICI's first joint venture in mainland China - a Pounds 15m paint factory

Its opening was dictated by a soothsayer who figured March 18 was the day
which would provide the proud owners with the maximum amount of good
fortune. As an extra precaution, ICI laid on 60 lion dancers to frighten
away any lingering evil spirits.
However, the highlight of the opening ceremony was the premiere of the ICI
song, specially composed by Chen Shuliu of the Guangzhou conservatory, with
vocals by Miss Zhu, a police lady, backed by the brass band of the local
People's Liberation Army unit. Sir Denys was particularly moved by a bit in
the song which compared ICI to China's three great river systems - the
Yellow river, Yangtze river and the Pearl river.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Personal View: Russia finds independent foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SERGEI KARAGANOV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The electoral success of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party has
 -naturally - made the future direction of Russian foreign policy an
important international issue.
The emergence of a movement like Zhirinovsky's was predictable. It was a
normal reaction from those strata who are suffering economically, who have
witnessed the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which they thought would
be their homeland for centuries, and who are now left with no vision of
where their country is going.
If, however, a lesson has been learnt - and it looks as if President Boris
Yeltsin is learning it - it is that Zhirinovsky is a dark cloud on the
horizon but not the horizon itself. There is still a long way to go before
we glimpse light. But the road to normalcy is the one Russia is on.
Being normal naturally means having a normal foreign policy. This is now
emerging; and it is emerging in direct reaction to the recent past, the
period immediately after the failed coup of 1991 and the emergence of Russia
as an independent state. During that period, Russia was too inclined to say
'yes' to our new friends in the West - even before being asked to. We
suffered a temporary loss of our vision and of our ability both to
understand, and act in, our own interests. This created a backlash.
Under foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev, an attentive listener, Russian
foreign policy has since made big adjustments while never changing its basic
course towards strategic rapprochement with the west. It is now better
formulated and less one-sided. It has achieved a significant success in
persuading the Serbs to pull back from Sarajevo. It is focusing much more
than before on the Commonwealth of Independent States and on former partners
in Europe. And it is active in Asia, too.
Russia has learned to express its differences with others as well as to
chorus its assent. Differences have centred on former Yugoslavia and on the
continuing inaccessibility of Western markets to our goods; in particular,
Russia's ruling elites and the increasingly influential military oppose
plans to enlarge Nato by admitting east-central European states (but not
Russia), believing this threatens Russia with geopolitical isolation.
At the heart of the problems and tensions between Russia and the west is,
and will remain, the relations Russia strikes with the former Soviet
republics.
In autumn last year, Russia took decisions which forced most CIS countries
out of the rouble zone. The decisions were prompted by exasperation at the
lack of reform in these states, especially Ukraine, and by Russia's
unwillingness and inability still to subsidise them.
In any reintegration of former Soviet states, Russia will play a different
role from that in the old Soviet Union (which was a strange combination of
political metropolis and economic colonies) or in the first two years of the
CIS's existence. During the latter, Russia was uncertain about how to
proceed; it knew it could no longer be donor and boss but it did not know
whether to increase separation or try a new form of re-integration.
Now, it seems, there is a growing consensus. Most feasible regimes in Moscow
(except for a national socialist one, which would try to force political
reintegration) would probably attempt a modality under which CIS countries
would remain independent politically but be dominated economically. No sane
politician in Moscow would choose to take responsibility for managing both
the surrounding weak economies and their turbulent societies - as that would
mean taking responsibilities off the shoulders of local leaderships and free
them to blame Russia for all their ills. Russia also cannot afford total
separation, nor a policy of benign negligence.
In this model, Russia would play the role of first among equals in
interstate relations in the CIS - rather like the US in Nato, or Germany in
the European Union - but not big brother protecting and feeding his younger
kin (though elements of these roles will remain).
Russia will also have to continue to be a local peace keeper or peace
enforcer. To do this effectively and avoid becoming a militaristic state,
Russia needs two conditions fulfilled. First, her role as peace keeper
should be legitimate; and second, it should be part of an international
effort - under the control of international organisations and constrained by
international law. That would deter Moscow from unlimited use of military
power and ultimately dangerous uni-lateralism.
Russia is now beginning to act - but neither as the former Communist enfant
terrible nor as the terribly nice guy of the late Gorbachev/early Yeltsin
period. Is the west ready to part with this nice guy, this Mr Yes - and work
with an independent partner and prospective ally? I trust the answer will be
in the affirmative - though, of course, I well understand how nice it was to
talk with Mr Yes.
The author is deputy director of the European Institute of the Russian
Academy of Sciences and a foreign affairs adviser to President Yeltsin.

FT  21 MAR 94 / On trial for dangerous dealing: The impact of derivatives on
financial market stability is unknown. Tracy Corrigan asks if regulators
should worry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a new breed of bogeymen in the financial markets - hedge fund
managers, who make large bets on price movements using private clients'
money.
They have been demonised, in particular, for driving bond prices down
sharply last month by suddenly withdrawing bets on European bond markets.
They had taken fright at the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest
rates for the first time in five years.
The Bank of England is now investigating the activities of hedge funds -
pools of money which are switched between financial markets to exploit
short-term opportunities. Regulators worry that excessive lending to hedge
funds could leave banks vulnerable to heavy losses.
But there is an aspect of the hedge fund industry that strikes greater fear
into the hearts of regulators: their heavy use of derivatives. These are
sophisticated financial instruments such as options and futures, which give
investors the right (options) or the obligation (futures) to buy securities,
currencies or commodities at a set price at a later date. Swaps (agreements
to exchange interest rate or currency liabilities) are bilateral deals
conducted 'over the counter', while futures and some options are listed on
exchanges.
Derivatives are already widely used by banks and securities houses; but the
emergence of hedge funds - most of them unregulated - as significant players
in the derivatives market worries market supervisors. The notional value of
futures contracts traded on world exchanges is about Dollars 140,000bn a
year.
One aspect of derivatives is that, for a small downpayment, the purchaser
can control a larger portion of the market. For example, Dollars 10,000
could buy a contract to purchase Dollars 100,000 worth of bonds later. Such
leverage means potential gains or losses are magnified.
To address their concerns about these instruments, US and UK securities
regulators last week agreed to share information on derivatives trading. The
move reflects an awareness that derivatives regulation is outdated - and
possibly ineffective.
In most countries, regulators supervise specific types of companies - banks,
insurers and securities houses, for example. But the derivatives market
spans a range of financial institutions and national borders.
Regulators have two main concerns about derivatives. The first is that poor
management or a lack of understanding of these complicated financial
instruments could cause companies to incur heavy losses. For example, a
trading subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft, the German oil and metals company,
faces final losses of Dollars 1bn on dealings in the oil derivatives market
last year. The second is the broader impact on other financial markets,
particularly whether derivatives increase price swings and have a
destabilising influence.
Banks and securities houses welcome volatility as it increases their
opportunities to make money, either through trading their own capital or by
charging fees to buy and sell on behalf of clients. But non-financial
companies - and less sophisticated investors - do not like large price
swings which could leave them facing losses. Central banks want to pull all
the levers and do not like to feel that they are losing control of monetary
policy.
Evidence that derivatives destabilise markets is, however, far from
conclusive. No empirical study over the past 20 years has yet shown that
derivatives increase volatility, and some have concluded they may even
reduce it.
Most recently, in December a study of the effect of derivatives on the
London stock market by Mr Gary Robinson of the Bank of England concluded
that 'futures trading has been associated with a significant reduction in
volatility of around 17 per cent'.
Other observers agree that derivatives markets may dampen volatility. During
the sharp bond price falls in February market participants were able to
trade bonds via the futures market when dealers became unwilling to quote
prices in the underlying bond market. Mr Fred Stambaugh, a vice-president of
Chase Manhattan Bank, says: 'If there were no derivative markets, and
traders had those heavy positions on their books, you would have seen
greater movement in the (conventional) physical instruments, because a lot
of what happens in the derivative markets is designed to diffuse risk.'
But the academic evidence does not always impress market participants.
'Various studies say there is a benign relationship between the two markets,
but it certainly doesn't feel like that some days,' observes one UK fund
manager. It is not just a gut feeling of traders. There is a case for
arguing academic studies have asked the wrong questions, or focused on
excessively long time periods, which iron out glitches. 'The sort of tests
that have been conducted do not determine whether in abnormal conditions
derivatives create volatility,' says one regulator. One theory is that, in
periods of volatility, because market participants holding futures have to
provide for potential losses, they may have to sell other holdings to
generate the extra cash needed.
A likely explanation for the divergence of views is that derivatives produce
different effects depending on market conditions. Moreover, their impact
could vary according to whether they are used mainly to hedge risks, or to
speculate on markets. The worrying feature about hedge funds is that -
despite their name - the latter is more usually the case.
One problem in isolating the effects of derivatives is that they have become
an integral part of a fast-evolving world financial system. A decade ago
fund managers were concerned mainly with their own domestic stock or bond
markets. But the dismantling of regulatory barriers and improvements in the
infrastructure of financial markets have allowed investors to gain access to
a wider range of products.
Derivatives have heightened that trend. Because transaction costs are lower
and derivatives are often more actively traded than conventional
instruments, it is easier, for example, to switch from the German to the
Japanese stock market by using futures rather than by selling a portfolio of
individual stocks.
'Derivatives have created much greater linkage between markets, and the
leverage involved means that positions can turn much quicker,' said Mr
Carter Beese, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which regulates the US securities industry.
The trend towards global investment may itself be partly responsible for
increasing volatility. When a particular market looks attractive, large
amounts of capital flow in from around the world - and out again quickly
when fortunes turn.
At the same time, there has been a trend towards pooling money - retail
investors are now more likely to buy unit trusts or mutual funds. Wealthy
individuals may turn to hedge funds.
'The speculative side of the business has been institutionalised and the
markets are now driven by the interests of the new institutional
speculators,' says Mr Hunt Taylor, managing director of Reynwood Trading
Corporation, a New Jersey-based hedge fund.
The risk regulators face is that the rapid evolution of the world's
financial markets may have created a potentially dangerous cocktail of
aggressive traders, specula-tive investors, and highly complex financial
instruments which users might not fully under-stand.
In the US, where memories of the cost to taxpayers of bailing out the
troubled savings and loans industry in the 1980s are still fresh, efforts
are being made to monitor derivatives across a broader range of users. A
working group on financial markets, with representatives from the relevant
US regulatory bodies, meets regularly.
Such co-operation between regulators, not just in the US but elsewhere,
seems an obvious way of identifying the risks which derivatives may be
creating. That thinking lay behind last week's agreement between the SEC,
the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission and the UK's Securities and
Investments Board. Such an approach may be needed in other financial
markets, anyway, given the trend towards internationalisation.
Beyond that, it may be necessary to accept that markets have become liable
to big swings, which can have a knock-on effect across continents and
time-zones, and that they are the result of the liberali-sation of financial
markets heralded since the start of the 1980s.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Jobs conundrum that must be tackled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr EDWARD DE BONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('Summit for good jobs', March 16) rightly points out that
the cyclical and structural unemployment considered at the G-7 jobs summit
is not the whole story. Fine tuning existing concepts will not generate
ideas needed to cope with the third type of unemployment, 'conceptual
unemployment'. Such areas as non-commercial values, low risk
entrepreneurship, non-transferable wealth and the protectionism of local
currencies need thinking about.
At every point technology, design and competitive pressures will produce
more value from fewer people. Within a few years full employment will
produce more value than can possibly be absorbed by those who can pay for
the value.
There is as much need for fundamental new thinking about economic habits as
there is for new ideas about employment. The maximising mission of
capitalism and the distributive mission of socialism are only the opposite
sides of the same coin. We need new coins involving pluralism and
parallelism in which different values have their own economies.
I suggest that the EU sets up a commission to do some seriously creative
thinking about these matters now that the Detroit parade has elevated
employment to the level of international concern rather than domestic
housekeeping.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH SYMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his Personal View article (March 17), William Waldegrave suggests
that the Citizen's Charter is a 'glass half full', and filling rapidly.
He went on to claim that the Financial Times had made the mistake of not
recognising that his reforms in the public sector are far wider than merely
charters, and involve privatisation and contracting out as well. The problem
is that it is almost impossible to get any hard information from the
minister for open government on exactly how much is being spent on these
various reforms.
For example, in answer to the three parliamentary questions within one week
on the value of consultancy contracts government ministers claimed that the
information is either 'commercial in confidence' (parliamentary questions to
the trade and industry secretary January 31, and to the minister, Department
of Health February 7) or that the work involved in preparing an answer would
be disproportionate (parliamentary question to the minister, Welsh Office
January 31). The minister claims that Pounds 100m was saved last year
through market testing and contracting out but he will not give a detailed
breakdown of the figures involved.
Equally, information on the value of consultancy contracts varies
enormously. The Treasury will provide information on the value of such
contracts, for example on job evaluation and auditing, but excludes all
information connected with privatisation. Meanwhile, the ministry of defence
is prepared to give a total value to all consultancies awarded including
privatisation, and then excludes all consultancy contracts of less than
Pounds 10,000.
Given these variations in practice, and the impossibility of eliciting true
costs for these various reforms, the minister can hardly wonder that
fundamental questions are raised at just how much value for money there
really is in public sector reforms.
We now see a move towards contracts being awarded without competitive
tendering; and answers to parliamentary questions since last March reveal
many departments and agencies are not going out to tender before placing
market testing consultancy contracts.
Until the minister, and perhaps as importantly Sir Peter Levene, the prime
minister's efficiency adviser, can answer straightforward questions with
straightforward answers there will continue to be suggestions that this
single-minded policy is based more on dogma than common sense value for
money.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Openness in US airline industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOCHEN MURACH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is amazing to observe the way that American industry conducts its
trade policies. On the one hand, it accuses the Japanese of shutting down
their domestic market to foreign competitors. On that point, the Americans
are certainly right. However, on the other hand, it would be logical if they
behaved themselves the same way they demand from other countries. For
example, the latest row over the BA-USAir code-sharing agreements ('US
stalls over BA-USAir code-sharing', March 17) proves that contradictory
attitude clearly.
Just as the Japanese companies enjoy their competition-protected home
market, so the American airline industry still does on its domestic routes.
The strategy, which is especially being pursued by American and Delta
Airlines, to refuse foreign carriers access to the US 'core' market does not
correspond to the trade policy of market liberalisation, often lectured on
by the Clinton administration.
It is time to bring the everlasting quarrel in the American airline business
to an end. Good sense demands it.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Efficiencies alone will not be enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JANET LANGDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Last year, Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry
regulator, requested water companies to canvass customers' views on a big
scale. They were asked what improvements they would like, for their own
benefit and for the benefit of the environment. They were also told the
likely impact on prices of the options put before them.
It seems curious therefore that, to judge from your report of his recent
speech ('Water companies told to cut costs', March 15), the regulator will
not provide the water companies with the means, in his forthcoming review of
price caps, to provide the quality of service customers desire.
Criticising the high profits of water companies in recent years, the
regulator makes no reference to the fact that two-thirds of them have been
re-invested in the business.
The companies will continue their already significant progress towards
greater efficiency and cost cutting. But this alone will not square the
circle.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Pitted against past failures: The outlook for companies
mining collieries discarded by British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 59, he had never worked for a private sector company and his job for 36
years, with British Coal, ended when he was sacked. But that has not stopped
him making one of the most remarkable debuts on the London Stock Exchange in
recent years.
It is just six months since Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal
commercial director, took over as chairman of Geevor, a once renowned tin
mining company. But since then shares in the company, renamed Coal
Investments, have increased more than sevenfold in value to 76p. Although
dealings in the shares have been suspended, pending a capital raising
exercise, the company is likely to stand as a top performer of the past year
when share transactions resume next week.
The achievement is striking in a sector where fortunes are declining fast
and, as a result of the government's controversial pit closures programme,
publicly. Moreover the company plans to make its money, initially at least,
from pits rejected as unprofitable by British Coal. It currently owns one
pit, a tiny mine in Wales which was rejected as uneconomic by British Coal
several years ago. The market's main interest in Coal Investments, however,
lies in its plans to lease at least three of the corporation pits closed
recently.
Coal Investments is not the only company investors believe will thrive by
mining British Coal's cast-offs.
RJB Mining, a mainly opencast group, has seen the value of its shares
increase by more than twice the London Stock exchange average to 400p since
its flotation last June. Investors approve of its plans to lease up to four
mines closed by British Coal, one of which, Clipstone in Nottinghamshire, it
is already operating.
Meanwhile at Betws in south Wales, a management buy-out team has attracted
Pounds 2.5m of funds, mainly from Barclays Bank, to operate a mine closed by
British Coal last year.
Of 28 redundant pits closed and put out to tender for leasing and licensing
in the past year at least six are being reopened under private licence, and
bids are being considered for another four. But are Coal Investments, RJB,
and Betws Anthracite heading for a fall?
British Coal questions whether the market is big enough for all potential
licensees to succeed. It also points out that the mines being reopened will
turn out far less coal than they did under its stewardship - perhaps under
half the amount.
The licensees argue the planned scale and methods of their pit operations
will, together with their marketing, ensure profitability.
Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, says British Coal 'has the culture of
nearly 50 years as a nationalised industry - with all the problems that
brings in bureaucracy and industrial relations. We are starting with a clean
black board and we are writing the numbers.'
One burden on the pits which the private operators are shaking off is the
'dead hand of the centre'. Mr Charles Kernot, analyst at stockbroker Credit
Lyonnais Laing, explains: 'British Coal has always suffered because, as well
as running pits, it has had to perform tasks like keeping up to date plans
for the industry and supplying the government with facts and figures. The
licensed pits will not have to bear the share of centralised costs that
management did under British Coal.'
The new operators expect bigger benefits to flow from different mining
techniques at some pits, from a change in workplace culture, and from a
focus on household and industrial markets which some believe British Coal
neglected in its pursuit of the larger electricity generating market.
Mining techniques vary considerably. Betws Anthracite's 90 miners will go
back to the future by using explosives and their hands to hew the coal,
rather than the 'long wall' cutting machinery operating in most British Coal
mines.
However, at RJB's Clipstone colliery, the only licensed pit reopened so far,
there is no significant technological change. 'What will be different,' says
Mr Budge, 'will be the attitude of the men and the amount of time they use
the machinery.'
In the brave new world of leasing and licensing the role of unions will be
limited. Neither RJB nor Coal Investments will bargain collectively with
unions, although employees will be free to join unions which may represent
them in cases of individual grievance.
Both companies want their workers to be shareholders. 'That will concentrate
their minds on the business,' says Mr Edwards.
A new flexibility is also being encouraged in the workforces. At Clipstone,
electricians are being asked to cut coal when there is a lull in their usual
tasks.
Mr Alan Green, a British Coal employee for 14 years before being taken on by
RJB, says: 'At RJB we get more involved with other departments and tasks
than at British Coal. I prefer that.'
Mr Green and other workers say their earnings are comparable to their
British Coal days - Coal Investments and RJB decline to disclose rates  -
but add they are prepared to work harder for it. Mr Budge predicts RJB's
Clipstone will produce about 500,000 tonnes a year, half the tonnage under
British Coal two years ago, but with a quarter of the men.
This, of course, is a target yet to be achieved. Successful though RJB has
been in the past it has made its name largely in opencast mining. This
requires different skills and techniques from those needed for deep mines,
although RJB says it has doubled productivity in three years since taking
over two small deep pits in Cumbria. And, in the case of Coal Investments,
Mr Edwards has made his name as a marketing man rather than as a mining
engineer directly involved in cutting coal, although his company, like RJB,
is employing former British Coal managers.
Coal industry sceptics are concerned less with the ability of prospective
licensees to cut costs than with the UK coal market. Initially, the
licensees aim to displace imports of 1m tonnes-plus a year of coal for
household consumption and 1.5m tonnes for general industry (excluding
steel).
British Coal believes the licensees can aim for a market of 2.5m to 3m
tonnes a year, but warns they will have to compete with coal imported from
countries such as Colombia, South Africa and the US, and extracted by the
companies which will own British Coal's assets after privatisation this year
and next.
If British Coal's assumptions are right, perhaps five or six leased pits
each producing about 500,000 tonnes a year, plus Betws producing 120,000
tonnes, could hope to remain in business. But even that might be optimistic.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, spelt out the dangers when he said
recently he expected some producers to be 'squeezed from the market'.
Mr Edwards counters by saying pit closures this year will deprive the market
of another 750,000 to 1m tonnes of domestic and industrial coal a year. That
increases licensees' potential markets.
Mr Budge also sees scope for displacing some of the 8m tonnes of coking coal
bought abroad each year by British Steel. Moreover, he says British Coal's
estimates also make little allowance for the possibility of cutting into the
more than 3m tonnes of coal imported each year by the electricity
generators.
Arguments such as these have made a deep impression on investors in Coal
Investments, RJB and Betws Anthracite. For all three companies, however, the
hard work is ahead. They will prove their worth only if and when they
extract their targeted tonnages of coal consistently and cheaply from deep
mines, and then sell it profitably to the markets which they say are there
for the taking.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Let's think boldly about education: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I doubt you could find a politician anywhere who would challenge the need to
improve education and training, especially for the less academically
inclined. As the Detroit jobs conference illustrated yet again, policymakers
are united in believing that better education can boost productivity and
hence the supply of 'high quality' jobs.
Given this consensus, thinking about educational reform remains bafflingly
timid. Education is still organised according to guidelines advanced in the
late 19th century. For the most part this antiquated model is unquestioned,
even though we would be horrified if other aspects of social life were stuck
in such a timewarp. Imagine, for example, if we still had to rely on the
horse-and-buggy or the telegraph.
One typically 19th-century assumption is that education is something that
sets you up for life. You are educated first, be it to age 16, 21 or
whatever, then you enter the world of work, at which point you can happily
stop learning.
There are two critical assumptions here. The first is that the pace of
change is so slow that what you learn early in life will remain relevant
decades later. The second is that people can be sorted for life according to
their youthful educational attainment. The chap with an Oxford 'first' is a
genius for life; the 16-year-old school leaver (barring the occasional John
Major) forever a dunce.
Both assumptions are palpably false. It is not socially or economically
acceptable to write people off because they failed at school. Nor in today's
fast-moving economy should anybody, whatever their age, assume they can rest
on past educational laurels. We should be moving toward a new model in which
work and education occur in tandem throughout our lives.
Yet little is done to promote greater flexibility in the timing of
educational investments. Evening classes and distance-learning remain the
Cinderella of education. Governments heavily subsidise young students, many
of whom lack motivation, while largely ignoring the greater needs of adults
struggling to combine work, child-rearing and study.
A change of mindset is required. In the US, higher education imposes a
crushing financial burden on professionals (or their parents) because they
do not enter the labour market until their late 20s. A typical pattern is
four years of liberal arts followed by three years of law school or five
years for a doctorate.
Yet if the sequence were reversed and the vocational qualification taken
first, young people could start working in their early 20s. Less indebted,
they could then pay out of pocket for whatever other education they need or
desire. It ought to be regarded as normal to combine careers with continuing
education of some kind.
The 19th-century model is outdated in countless other ways. Teaching methods
are not keeping pace with technical change. When interactive multimedia
technology theoretically permits students to learn efficiently at their own
pace, most are still forced to absorb information slowly through the
medieval lecturer and class 'one size fits all' format.
The school day and the school curriculum are still salami-sliced into quite
arbitrary fragments according to a long-outdated blueprint. School children,
for example, are required to study natural sciences but not economics, which
is not necessarily more demanding and far more relevant for daily life. This
merely reflects the lack of clout of economics as a 'new' academic
discipline at the time when the modern school curriculum was being devised.
In Britain's ludicrously over-specialised universities, students can
literally spend three or four years studying just one subject such as
geography or French. And academics everywhere, for all their reputed
intelligence, are as respectful of arbitrary demarcation lines as any
forelock-tugging trade unionist. Few university economists, for example,
would dream of gaining expertise in other social sciences. Each 'expert'
inhabits his own cell, largely oblivious of the work of scholars wearing
different labels.
Why is the world of education - from kindergarten to post graduate study -
so hidebound? The short answer, I fear, is that it is an enterprise that is
almost everywhere dominated by the public sector. Without huge subsidies
higher education simply would not exist on its present scale. And this might
not matter: lack of university chairs did not exert much of a drag on the
18th-century Enlightenment.
As for schools, the paternalists deserve credit for achieving universal
access. But the price paid is turning out to be steep. We now live in a
topsy-turvy world where most parents are happy to spend large sums on cars,
homes, gadgets and holidays but regard 'free' state education as a natural
right. If more people could be persuaded to regard education as a service
for which they should pay at least something (preferably a lot), and hence
assume some direct control, they might be amazed by the subsequent pace of
reform.
As market forces took effect, teaching methods and curricula would rapidly
adjust to meet the diverse needs of children. There would probably be a
heavy investment in new technology and a resulting surge in teacher
salaries, offset by a fall in educational employment.
The most revolutionary change is that schools' priorities and procedures
would be determined not by tradition or government regulation, but by the
ever-changing demands of customer-students. Is this so frightening a
prospect, so appallingly undemocratic, that we must cling to a bureaucratic
system that is a proven failure for up to 70 per cent of the population?

FT  21 MAR 94 / Arts: A young quartet and London Brass - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past 20 years or so, first-class string quartets have been springing
up as never before. There is no simple answer to 'Why?' - but there are some
obvious factors, all interconnected. Modern recordings have made the quartet
repertoire available to all sorts of people who might never have discovered
it earlier; many more quartet teams can now make professional careers than
there used to be room for; for distinguished senior quartets, it has become
a moral duty to coach new ensembles. This is a happy state of affairs.
In the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday the young Vogler Quartet - which has been
coached by the LaSalle Quartet and the great Sandor Vegh - gave the last of
three well-planned concerts, each featuring very late works of two classical
composers and one strong contemporary exhibit. As a team, the Vogler Quartet
is a year younger than the excellent Carmina Quartet (also winner of the
crucial Evian competition). Its praises have been sung on this page often,
but Wednesday's concert convinced me that it ranks among the best, most
individual and enthralling teams to be heard.
The quartet played Haydn's and Schumann's last quartets, and Gyorgy Kurtag's
First (written in 1959 when he was a thoroughly practised 33-year-old, but
denoted 'op. 1' because it was his breakthrough into modern composing). In
each work the players were hugely impressive - above all because of their
sound: super-rich, communicatively forward and muscular, and yet laden with
the players' separate characters, without which the glories of western
chamber music would remain mere shadows of themselves.
The collective 'sound' of a string quartet is no simple thing. It involves
the subtle balancing of parts and a collectively focused attack, as well as
sheer timbre. The splendid Vogler sound bespeaks a rare musical unanimity,
one which leaves plenty of room for distinct personalities. Thus the players
could deliver the great Andante of Haydn's op. 77 no. 2 with compelling
purpose, but vitally lit up by individual thrusts: marvellous to hear.
Again, in Schumann's Quartet in A, op. 41 no. 3, the Risoluto section of the
variation-movement acquired a towering, rambunctious impetus we rarely hear.
Yet elsewhere in Schumann, the Voglers could indulge expansive rubati to
maximal affect, without dropping a stitch. Some of the curves they threw
might have bordered upon winsomeness, had their intentions been less
definite and palpable. In the six wildly inventive movements of Kurtag's
quartet, the team outdid itself. Through wickedly syncopated passages and
unmeasured dramatic suspensions, they were knife-edged and spot-on.
As for the outre range of string colours that the young Kurtag demanded, the
quartet brought it all to palpable life (at the cost of a snapped
viola-string in midstream, and a long pause while it was replaced). Every
bizarre effect made a sharp expressive point, inseparable from the literal
notes, and they all struck directly home. While it lasted, the music seemed
to have the distilled density of a late Kurtag score. It doesn't, but the
Voglers triumphantly persuaded us that it did.
*****
London Brass launched its 10-day Contemporary Music Network tour at the
Queen Elizabeth Hall with a programme reflecting the ensemble's enterprise.
The virtuoso 10-piece group - four trumpets, four trombones, horn and tuba -
which grew out of the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble in 1986, does much to
challenge perceptions of brass music.
Thursday's programme featured five contemporary works by British composers,
all London Brass commissions, with a set of Venetian canzonas in the middle.
The music of Gabrieli and his contemporaries is, of course, central to the
brass repertory, and here the pieces were dispatched with flair. The QEH is
not an ideal venue for these works - they need a church, preferably St
Mark's in Venice - but they came across.
The programme's opening works, Dominic Muldowney's Un Carnaval Cubiste and
Nigel Osborne's Canzona: Procession of boats with distant smoke, Venice,
both art-inspired, picked up the Italian theme. Muldowney's seemed the more
successful. It is based on a steady pulse provided by a centre-stage
metronome, round which rhythmic counterpoints build into flashes of
exuberance. Little tonal fanfares act like 'found objects' in a painting,
hence the title. The Osborne relies heavily on hazy, shifting sonorities,
but the sounds are more interesting than the ideas.
Indeed, much of the evening's music revealed a poverty of invention,
suggesting that composers were seduced by the sounds of the medium - brass
instruments can be wonderfully liquid and irresistibly crunchy - and forgot
about developing them. Michael Nyman's For John Cage, given its first London
performance here, is a very un-Cageian pastiche of recycled big-band
gestures. Bayo's Way by Jeremy Arden, for electronic tuba and ensemble, is
like a miniature concerto. The form is clear, but the use of electronics
unimaginative, limited mostly to highlighting the tuba's vulgarity in long
stretches of violent burping. One had to admire Oren Marshall's virtuosity.
Mark-Anthony Turnage's Set To rounded off the evening and provided a
corrective. Each of the two movements is richly textured, and both the
languid Blues and joyous Bacchanale engage mind and ear.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Arts: Sacks's The Man Who - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The writings of the neurologist Oliver Sacks are among the most exciting of
our time. Not only do Awakenings, A Leg to Stand On, The Man Who Mistook His
Wife for a Hat, and others feature some of the best-written case studies
since Freud, they also trace new connections between body and mind, time and
space, memory and present awareness, logical and instinctive thought.
And their influence on the performing arts has been remarkable: Pinter's
play A Kind of Alaska, the film of Awakenings, the Second Stride multi-media
work New Tactics, Michael Nyman's opera The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a
Hat and more. Now the theatre director/producer Peter Brook has joined these
ranks. His staging of The Man Who. . . (originally performed in France as
L'Homme qui ..) has now embarked upon a 10-week British tour - starting at
the Contact Theatre, Manchester, as part of Manchester City of Drama '94.
The good news about Brook's production of The Man Who. . . , a brisk plunge
into the case-studies of Sacks's book, is that its anecdotes are often
fascinating in the way that they are in the book. The bad news is that
anecdotes are all Brook has assembled. Neither has he turned The Man Who. .
. into a work of art, nor has he tackled many of Sacks's more exceptional
themes.
What you see is a kind of Sacks collage. There is the man mistaking his wife
for his hat; the man who has lost all sense of his own leg (he cries in
terror: 'Why have they put an amputated leg in my bed?'); the man who,
shaving only one side of his face, believes that he has shaved all; the man
who thinks he is still a boy. Astounding data, and often moving.
The atmosphere is generally cool, objective. The method is Brechtian, though
not the force. Four of the five performers swap roles, becoming patients and
doctors by turns; the fifth provides occasional accompaniment on the
kamanicheh, an Asian stringed instrument. Live videos are sometimes used to
record details of the patients' behaviour, sometimes to show the patients
things about themselves they otherwise fail to observe.
Brook does not attempt to re-create the individual characters described by
Sacks. Indeed, his staging involves a little deconstruction - chopping case
studies up into separate anecdotes, sometimes having one patient's story
re-enacted by two actors, replacing Sacks's white Anglo-Saxon characters
with African, Oriental, and French performers.
Brook never attempts one of Sacks's most abiding and profound themes - the
miraculously therapeutic effect of music. Music, indeed, is one of the most
lightweight features of the play. From time to time the kamanicheh adds its
affecting sound, but it is applied - like film music - only to heighten the
emotional effect of a scene.
Three of Brook's four speaking performers speak with French accents, which
are in two cases so strong that they start to become charming in themselves,
but distance us from what is being said. There is no scenery, only chairs,
video screens and a few smaller props. And the fact that there is a minimum
of acted characterisation is a pity, for it is so important to Sacks to show
us the effect of neurological disorder upon individual character.
The Man Who. . . is an array of interesting and touching information. But it
is a far more clinical and narrow work than Sacks's book, and not just
because it omits the philosophical and literary references which Sacks so
loves. Sacks's work keeps marvelling at the complexity of the human mind and
saying: 'What a piece of work is man.' Brook's work, more ironic and
detached, just says: 'Curiouser and curiouser.'
The UK tour of The Man Who. . . includes the Newcastle Playhouse (March
29-April 9), the Tramway, Glasgow (April 12-23), the Nottingham Playhouse
(April 26-30), and the Royal National Theatre, London (May 4-21).

You cannot escape themes these days. This is British Science Week and Radio
3 is having a 1930s season. One programme manages to fit under both
headings: Yesterday's Tomorrows looks back to a time when, it is claimed,
'there was no science fiction but there was scientific romance' from HG
Wells to Aldous Huxley (9.30 R3). Before that Radio 3 offers an opportunity
to hear Let 'Em Eat Cake, a musical by George and Ira Gershwin, first
performed in 1933. This production stars Denis Quilley, Kim Criswell and
Joss Ackland (7.30).
There is more evidence of British Sience Week on BBC2, which is mounting
four discussions on successive nights at Bristol's science museum, The
Exploratory which is also the title of the series. Today's subject is why
some people win Nobel Prizes while others are ostracised (11.15).
Earlier Horizon looks back to the extraordinary hullabaloo which followed
the claim five years ago that fusion had been achieved in water by
Fleischmann and Pons in a test tube in an ordinary lab (8.00 BBC2).

FT  21 MAR 94 / Arts: A semi-detached vision - Colin Amery finds London's
Ideal Home Exhibition short on ideas and good design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For 86 years they have come annually from all corners of the kingdom, to
honour the gods of hearth and home gathered in a great temple in the
capital. They come to perform ablutions in special cabins, to worship the
wok, to conduct arcane rites with potato peelers and chant to the rhythms of
silent pianos (courtesy of Yamaha). All this to the glory of the ideal home.
The Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition is in London at Earls Court until April
10. It ought to be a great celebration of domestic virtues and a practical
demonstration of ways to make your home more ideal.
It should give purpose to our work and its creation should be one of the
most creative exercises that we perform. I would like to think that an ideal
home, or at least an exhibition of ideal homes, had something about it of
architecture and design and that the visual and design ideals were at least
matched by ideas.
When I went there the other day, full of pious hopes, I was expecting to see
the vision that the the thousands of worshipping homemakers had come to
witness. Mrs John Major was there, a comforting figure who clearly likes the
quiet domestic virtues and is not seduced by the shallow glamour of passing
fame. I can imagine her Hoovering in Huntingdon and enjoying it. And there
is nothing wrong with that. In fact, sometimes I think the whole world has
been especially laid out for the housewife to enjoy while her chap is sealed
up in some air-conditioned box trying to find ways of paying the DIY bills.
It was Jane Austen's Emma who said: 'There is nothing like staying at home
for real comfort.' And then there was that famous chic American decorator,
Billy Baldwin, who said: 'I have been thinking lately how comfort is perhaps
the real luxury.'
It was also Jane Austen who seems to have invented the idea of 'English
comfort', when she described a pleasing English country view: 'It was a
sweet view - sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure, English
culture, English comfort, seen under a bright sun without being oppressive.'
It must be this sense of peaceful harmony that most people are thinking
about and longing for when they think of home. Any housewife, of either sex,
who can achieve this has worked a miracle.
Is it this sense of peace and perfection on earth that is at the back of the
minds of all the exhibitors at Earls Court? Are the side chapels on the
endless aisles of Earls Court full of manufacturers praying to find ways to
achieve this domestic miracle?
I would like to think that this was the case, even if only at some
subliminal level. I particularly hoped to find it in the village of show
houses; in previous years I remember this being the absolute heart of the
exhibition. It was here that I hoped to find not just the hearth of the
nation, but some inspiration for the future of domestic design.
I was not sure whether to cheer, or not, at the sight of the Marks and
Spencer show house. I wondered whether this successful retailer was about to
join the design revolution started by Terence Conran and his Habitat stores,
which brought the simplicity contemporary design to the mass market. Or is
Marks and Spencer going down a cut-price Ralph Lauren route? After all, you
can now take off your M&amp;S underwear and slip into your M&amp;S dressing gown,
take a bath with your M&amp;S soap, dry yourself with a M&amp;S towel and sleep
between your M&amp;S gingham sheets. When you wake you can revive yourself with
some M&amp;S blood orange juice and slump in your traditional club arm chair or
venture on to the terrace to sit in your M&amp;S rattan chair from 'Siam', to
enjoy a glimpse of your Lichfield or Lyndhurst or Newbury or Cadogan
furniture that graces your drawing room. This is the vision: a semi-detached
view of tradition that remains neither one thing nor the other. Neither
cheap nor expensive, not actively bad but not particularly good design.
Is this the ideal home? Or is it the 'Ducal' show house - untouched by
modernism and yet equally unaware of any real tradition of domestic
architecture? Why are these ideal homes so bad? Is it the fundamental
poverty of modern architecture that has allowed this reactionary mediocrity
not just to continue, but to be the norm when it comes to the average
British house for sale on the speculative market?
The architectural profession seems to have no interest in improving the
design of the average British house. Why is it not possible to buy a house
extension or a new bathroom or kitchen that is as well-designed as the
average car? What happened to prefabrication that it can produce loos for a
developer at Broadgate but nothing for the domestic market?
As disappointing as the show houses is the design that won the Daily Mail
Design Award. This design was by a student from the Royal College of Art,
Graham Powell, who designed something called a mollusc, which he described
as 'a series of separate units or rooms which lock together to form a
customised living space'. They looked like curved Portakabins piled one on
top of the other - not unlike the erections you see on the corners of
building sites - with no design distinction in spite of their attached
'solar assist kits'.
The Ideal Home Exhibition has one virtue. You can go there with your own
ideals of domestic bliss and emerge with them untouched. The tragedy of this
great national event is how it fails to capitalise on the one area of life
that is important to all of us. It is without ideals, and sadly without any
significant ideas, for the future of our lives at home.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Rooms where class matters - Michael
Skapinker explains what you can expect if you stay on a hotel's executive
floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you stay on the Executive floor of the Brussels Hilton, your bathroom
mirror will have a heated unit behind it to stop it misting up. On the Crown
Club floor of London's Grosvenor House hotel, you will be attended by staff
who are paid more than those on other floors to ensure that you get even
better attention.
The class system, so firmly established on the world's airlines, has now
arrived at Europe's top hotels. There are five-star hotels, promising
business travellers every comfort, service and convenience. And there are
designated floors within five-star hotels offering even more comfort,
service and convenience - at a price.
Executive floors have been a feature of Asian hotels for several years, but
are becoming increasingly common in the US and Europe.
Today, the Club floor of the Churchill Inter-Continental, near London's
Oxford Street, opens for business. For Pounds 210 a night for a single room
 -about Pounds 25 more than you would pay elsewhere in the hotel - you can
use the exclusive Club floor check-in desk, instead of the one in the lobby.
Club floor guests also have their own lounge, offering complimentary
breakfast and evening cocktails. There is also a library on the floor, and a
fax and modem socket in each bedroom. Guests have a valet to unpack their
suitcases, and their clothes are pressed without charge. A meeting room is
also provided free of charge, subject to availability.
Inter-Continental recently opened a similar floor at its hotel in Frankfurt.
At first sight, the offerings of the Churchill Inter-Continental's Club
floor do not look particularly enticing. The private lounge is small and the
view from it is uninspiring. The 'library' is even smaller, with a
glass-fronted bookcase in it. Club guest rooms resemble other five-star
hotel rooms and, although they have the promised modem and fax sockets, so,
it appears, do the other rooms in the hotel.
The idea behind executive floors in top hotels is a strange one. Hotels
already offer different levels of service at graded prices. If the service
offered by the five-star hotels is not required, or is too expensive, you
can always stay in a two or three-star hotel.
But if you do elect to pay five-star rates, you expect the service that goes
with it. If those paying even more for an executive floor in a five-star
hotel receive the sort of service that makes doing business possible, what
sort of service are guests on other floors getting?
Mr Geoffrey Breeze, vice-president of Hilton International, which offers
Clubroom, 'a new service focus' at more than 60 of its hotels, explains:
'Almost all Hilton International hotels are business-oriented and all of our
guests receive service of the highest standards. One in 10 of our guests
request executive floor accommodation. This customer requires extra
services, immediately to hand, and is more likely to use the hotel as a base
for business.
'While we would like for the other nine to get a taste for executive floors,
we are committed to providing all customers with the same quality of
service.' Got it?
Ms Melanie Baker, Inter-Continental's communications director, says the
attraction of an executive floor is that it offers guests the personal
attention of a small 'boutique' hotel, while still providing the facilities
of a large five-star establishment. 'It offers the person travelling on
business more of a private club. It's a privacy issue.'
Ms Vanessa Leak, head of travel management marketing at Thomas Cook, says
access to a smaller lounge on the same floor as the bedroom is particularly
attractive to women.
Mr Neil Kirby, deputy general manager of the Grosvenor House, puts it this
way. A room on the Grosvenor House executive floor costs Pounds 45 more than
elsewhere in the hotel. But the executive floor price includes breakfast,
which will cost you Pounds 13.95 if you are staying on one of the other
floors.
On the executive floor there is also free use of the minibar, he says, and
room service lunch or dinner is provided free. Free clothes pressing is also
offered - a service you have to pay for if you are on one of the other
floors.
Moreover, on the executive floor of the Grosvenor you get free use of the
meeting room. In most London hotels this would cost Pounds 250 to Pounds 300
a day. The executive floor provides a package of services, which, as a
business traveller, you might otherwise have to pay for individually. The
final cost therefore is unlikely to be greater than staying elsewhere in the
hotel.
The hotels are convinced their guests view the service this way, because
demand for executive floors is strong. Far from being a passing fad, special
floors are here to stay, they say.
Airlines know what this means. Offer two classes and those in the cheaper
one will ask for an upgrade.
Do hotels allow ordinary guests to upgrade to executive floor without paying
extra? 'Definitely not,' is the response from the reception desk on the
Churchill Inter-Continental's executive floor. Mr Kirby concurs: 'We don't
upgrade.' Never? 'Unless it's a very regular customer.'
While London hotels say business is picking up, occupancy elsewhere in
Europe is still low. Ask for an upgrade to the executive floor. What have
you got to lose?

FT  21 MAR 94 / Business Travel: Ringing the charges - Telephoning from
hotels around the world can cost you dear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Our recent invitation to readers to send in tales of mammoth hotel telephone
charges yielded a barrage of festering grievances.
The main complaint concerned the premium levied by hotels, both for
direct-dialled calls from bedrooms and for the use of telephone calling
cards, a prime purpose of which is to avoid extortionate hotel phone charges
in the first place.
One reader, staying at the Royal Moat House Hotel in Nottingham last month,
was charged Pounds 82 for a 22-minute off-peak call back home to Singapore.
The standard BT tariff for the call is about Pounds 17 - representing a
nearly fivefold mark-up.
His complaint was not just at the size of the bill, but at the hotel's
failure to make clear the scale of the mark-up. The list of 'hotel services'
in the bedroom states simply that 'calls are charged at 30p per unit for 5
units and 25p for subsequent units' - which, as he writes, 'provides
absolutely no information to overseas guests who are unaware of the
relationship between units and minutes'.
A reader staying at the Bellhouse Hotel in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire,
was well aware of that relationship, and used his BT calling card to avoid
it. He was caught nonetheless by a 'facility charge' for the use of such
calling cards cards of 20p a minute. Both hotels confirm the charge rates.
One-off 'access charges' are common - 75 cents being the norm in the US -
but facilities charges are in a different league. 'What next?' asks the
reader who stayed at the Bellhouse. 'Charges for incoming calls - after all,
they have to be answered by the hotel operator?'
A visitor to Taipei was faced with a four-day hotel bill of Pounds 1,050
including Pounds 600 in phone calls - 'I made some long calls to the UK and
Tokyo, but was not prepared for that amount.' However, his main complaint
was against the leading phone company whose card he was using: its
inaccurate billing system produced a grossly inflated bill.
So it pays to check your bills. It also pays to complain. The Bellhouse
visitor got a refund; so did another reader, who faced a Dollars 100 phone
bill at a central Washington DC hotel, made up of 100 charges of Dollars 1
for each call made using a calling card. He had his bill halved, and is
pressing for a discount on the access charge for travellers making an
above-average number of hotel calls.
Some readers think the age-long custom of asking people to call you back is
the only remedy. This also avoids calling-card premiums, although card
charges are far lower than direct-dial rates levied by most hotels. But if
you are using a calling card from a public phone, be careful not to be seen
tapping in your personal identification number (PIN). One reader had his
AT&amp;T code 'stolen' at Heathrow and was sent an Dollars 18,000 bill -
'presumably for drug calls all over the world'.
It is notable that virtually all responses came from self- employed
consultants or em-ployees of small companies. Are they the only travelling
executives who look at their hotel bills before paying?

Hoteliers in Corfu are trying to profit from the European Union summit which
will take place there in June, Greek minister for European affairs Mr
Theodoros Pangalos said on Friday.
Mr Pangalos said owners of the three largest hotels on the island wanted
payment for six days from those attending the June 23-25 summit. 'They were
trying to profiteer when they should have thought more seriously about their
customers,' he said.
The hoteliers demanded the Greek state pay for the extra two days when
embassies in Athens refused. 'I had no problem with the people of Corfu. I
had a problem with the three big hotel owners, none of whom is from Corfu,'
Mr Pangalos said.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Management: Novel ways to reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big companies looking for new ways to reward their employees may find
inspiration in the strategy of a leading UK local authority.
Staff at Wakefield metropolitan district council in the north of England
have been given the scope to 'double' their pay increases this year through
an array of discounts and perks with local businesses.
David Williams, head of personnel at Wakefield metropolitan district
council, says the deals are designed to help staff retention at a time of
low or non-existent pay increases.
'In the present climate of budgetary restraint, we can't offer big pay
increases but we have got enormous purchasing power and why not use it?'
He says the deals also encourage the 16,000 full- and part-time council
staff and 7,500 employees of West Yorkshire Police Authority to use local
businesses.
A report in Personnel Management Plus, a magazine of the Institute of
Personnel Management, says that among the biggest savings was one of the
first negotiated, nearly two years ago - a half percentage point off the
mortgage lending rate of the Bradford and Bingley Building Society.
'The average saving on mortgages will be Pounds 500 over three years, which
is doubling their pay rise for last year,' says Williams. Staff had a 1.5
per cent pay increase in 1993 and are expecting little more this year.
Discounts have also been arranged on personal injury insurance, holiday
travel, pizzas and electrical goods, and are being negotiated on new and
used cars.
Williams says that with the annual pay increase no longer taken for granted
such arrangements will become more common. 'It is our job to find more
imaginative ways of making people's earnings stretch further.'

FT  21 MAR 94 / Management: An African adventure - A Lincolnshire
businessman tells Leslie Crawford of his travails in Kenya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Eddie Arnold's international trading company went bankrupt in the late
1980s, he decided to take his knowledge of the food business abroad. Kenya's
thriving horticultural industry seemed a good place to make a fresh start.
Arnold knew the country well, as it was one of the main suppliers of
dehydrated vegetables for his UK clients. Deliveries, however, had become
erratic, and Arnold seized the opportunity to go and sort the problem out.
Before he knew it, he was taking over the management of a state-owned
vegetable processing plant.
Three years later, Arnold has survived crop failures, the evaporation of
bank loans, and the loss of a financial partner. He fought to rescue the
state-owned factory from receivership, but was evicted when he fell behind
with the rent. He recently convinced the Kenyan government to give him back
the lease.
Arnold certainly got more than he bargained for in the quest for dehydrated
vegetables. Did he under-estimate the complexities of operating in an
African environment? The Lincolnshire businessman, now 41, confesses that he
was seduced by a proposition few western businessmen in Africa can resist:
the challenge of turning round an ailing commercial venture whose only
handicap is its state-owned parentage.
Across the continent, African governments are under pressure from the World
Bank and other creditors to divest from their sprawling progeny. But because
public companies are in such poor shape, privatising management has proved
to be a convenient half-way house on the road to full-scale privatisation.
Foreign investors gain country experience with little or no capital risk,
while the government is freed from the day-to-day running of corporations.
For the growing number of foreign managers taking charge of hotels, fishing
companies, bottling plants and textile mills in Africa, a management
contract looks like a risk-free gamble: minimum capital outlays ensure a big
slice of the profits.
Or do they? As Arnold was to find out, it takes more than a pioneering
spirit to survive as a businessman in Africa.
When he first arrived, his intention was to work with Pan Vegetable
Processors' management and its contract farmers to ensure a smooth delivery
of export orders for his clients in Europe. The orders for dehydrated
vegetables were worth millions of dollars at a time.
Arnold realised that the para-statal's problem was that it was chronically
short of cash. 'I encountered a lack of management skills, the usual
fiddles, and the fact that farmers were not being paid,' Arnold recalls. 'No
money, no product - it was a simple as that.'
Arnold decided to advance Pan Vegetables some working capital, which
produced its magical effect: the factory suddenly had a steady supply of
fresh vegetables to process for export.
For a while, everything went swimmingly, with satisfied customers in Europe
and a factory operating under full steam in Kenya. But in 1992, Kenya's
state holding company, the Industrial and Commercial Development Corp,
placed Pan Vegetable Processors into receivership.
'I knew I could turn it into a profitable operation,' Arnold says. So in
October 1992, he negotiated a three-year lease for the plant.
Then drought struck. Throughout 1993, a merciless sun beat down on the rich
farmland of Kenya's Great Rift Valley. Farmers around Lake Naivasha, where
the factory is located, lost 80 per cent of their crop. Arnold lost his
supply of fresh vegetables, as well as Pounds 200,000 invested in seeds and
fertilisers for his farmers.
To make matters worse, Kenya was in the middle of a severe credit squeeze
and Arnold's pleas for emergency working capital fell on deaf ears. His
money dried up, he fell behind on his rent and discovered one day that he
had been locked out of Pan Vegetables.
Arnold suspects there may have been an ulterior motive for the lockout. The
factory is an attractive asset, not least because it sits on 200 acres of
prime farmland in a land-hungry country. When the government's Parastatal
Reform Committee decided the company should be privatised, Arnold suddenly
became an inconvenient sitting tenant. His financial difficulties gave the
authorities an excuse to break the three-year lease agreement.
However, squabbles between the Industrial and Commercial Development Corp
and the Parastatal Reform Committee have delayed Pan Vegetable's
privatisation. Samson Juma, ICDC's top legal officer, admits that there is a
'tug of war' between the two state organs over who should be in charge of
Kenya's privatisation programme.
While the struggle continues, Arnold has the factory on a renewable
one-month lease, which makes any long-term planning difficult, not to say
impossible.
After much knocking on doors, he has obtained some working capital from
Middle Africa Investments, a local firm of financial advisers, and he hopes
he can hang on to Pan Vegetables until mid-year, when a new harvest might
allow him to recover his original outlays.
Arnold hopes to make a bid for the factory when it comes up for sale. If he
were offered another management contract, however, he would avoid his
original mistakes: he says he badly underestimated the amount of working
capital he would need - a complaint often heard among first-time businessmen
in Africa. He negotiated too short a lease on the factory, and was let down
by local partners who did not fulfil their financial commitments. Even
gambling in Africa, it appears, requires far-sighted planning.

FT  21 MAR 94 / People: Mathis - a bear-hug from Welch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What's it like being caught in a bear-hug by Jack Welch, one of the US's
most powerful corporate bosses? Not pleasant, as David Mathis, boss of
financial services group Kemper, is finding out, writes Richard Waters.
A 'bear-hug' is Wall Street's favoured term for the tactic employed last
week by Welch, head of General Electric, to force Mathis to accept his
Dollars 2.2bn unwanted advances: offer a big premium for the company, then
sit back and wait for Mathis and his board to crumble to shareholder
pressure and accept.
The 55-year-old Mathis has every reason to feel peeved. Just two years ago,
Kemper was on its knees, weighed down by bad property investments and poorly
performing property/casualty and reinsurance businesses.
That Kemper has bounced back is largely down to him. Mathis sold off the
insurance operations (apart from the life business) and relieved much of the
pressure from real estate. Followers of the company are unanimous in their
praise for his efforts.
Mathis could be the ultimate company man. His college education was backed
by a Kemper scholarship, and he has spent his entire career at the fund
management, life insurance and broking group, based near Chicago. After
working his way up on the insurance side, (including starting the group's
operations in Europe) he stepped up to become chairman and chief executive
in March 1992, at the height of Kemper's difficulties.
It must be particularly vexing for Mathis that the company's rebound caught
the eye of Welch and his team before it attracted the attention of the
stockmarket. His argument now that Kemper should be left alone to get on
with its business rings hollow: Welch's hug is feeling tighter all the time.

FT  21 MAR 94 / People: John Tucker's international alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German corporate history was made on Friday when John R. Tucker became the
first ever American to take the helm of a big German company, writes Michael
Lindemann. Tucker will become chief executive of Munchen Motoren und
Turbinenunion (MTU), a subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), on July 1.
He joins a handful of foreigners in senior German management, as companies -
previously managed exclusively by Germans - fight to strike new
international alliances. Tucker, 46, is expected to follow in the footsteps
of his predecessor, Hubert Dunkler, and become a member of the Dasa board in
the next few weeks.
Industry analysts have suggested the appointment is meant to strengthen Dasa
ties with Pratt and Whitney, the leading US engines manufacturer, and rival
the successful co-operation between General Electric and Snecma of France.
The new MTU boss began his career at Westinghouse Electric in 1968. Most
recently he was chief executive at AEG Transportation Systems, the
Pittsburgh-based subsidiary of the German multinational which is a market
leader in propulsion and people-mover systems. He is credited with pushing
sales up to a record Dollars 210m in 1992 and revolutionising working
practices among the 1,100 workers.

FT  21 MAR 94 / People: Siew lands his plum job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Siew will be coming home - well, almost - in May when he takes up
his new role as managing director of overseas operations at Hall Engineering
(Holdings), the UK metal stockholding, steel products and automotive
engineering group, writes Andrew Baxter.
Siew, born in Kuala Lumpur and a Malaysian citizen, will be based down the
road in Singapore for what will be a pivotal role developing Hall's Pacific
Rim interests - destined to feature strongly in the future of the
Shrewsbury-based group.
A self-assured man who has risen quickly through the company's overseas
businesses, Siew came to the UK in 1979 but has always had his sights set on
a plum job in the Far East.
He trained as an accountant, but did not want to become an auditor, so -
attracted by the spread of the company's international operations - joined
Hall in 1983 to get some industrial and management experience. After working
in Saudi Arabia for four years, Siew moved to Malawi for Hall in what he
calls a 'trouble-
shooting assignment'. Three years of restructuring Press Steel &amp; Wire proved
to be a prelude to a much tougher job in South Africa, where he arrived in
1990.
Over the past four years as chief executive of Hall's interests in South
Africa, Siew has 'downsized' a business which was close to financial
collapse because of borrowing restrictions, got rid of loss-making
operations, reduced the workforce from 1,000 to about 250 and repositioned
it for the future.
If things go well, Siew will have little trouble-shooting to do in his new
role. Since he will be operating in his own backyard, he sees a unique
opportunity to develop Hall's businesses in Asia, many of which are joint
ventures with BHP of Australia.
Siew will have a twin role of exploiting emerging markets, such as Vietnam,
for Hall's more basic products, while pushing higher technology business
opportunities, such as automotive engineering, elsewhere.
China, where Hall has hardly scraped the surface so far, is a top priority.
The Hall associate companies, which overall make the biggest contribution to
Hall's profits, have been investing heavily in new equipment and
manufacturing sites in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Vietnam.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Management: Let them know you're good - Lucy Kellaway is
taught the art of self-promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the story of a yellow rubber band and a bottle of perfume. It is the
story of two behavioural scientists from Dallas who, after years of
research, found that these two objects held the key to success and
recognition.
Put thus, the tale of George Dudley and Shannon Goodson sounds an unusual
one, implausible even. Yet in the bizarre world of US motivational gurus
this smiling duo are at the normal end of the spectrum, and have earned a
reputation for down-to-earth theories and practical advice.
Their starting point is uncontroversial enough. It is that the people who
are the best in their jobs do not necessarily get promoted fastest or, to
put it in their words, 'the cream doesn't rise to the top'.
'If you want to make money, you not only have to be good at what you do, you
need to make sure that others know how good you are,' says Dudley. Most
people, he says, have been brought up to think that it is immodest, too
forward or downright pushy to promote themselves. But the world has changed,
and he argues that self- promotion is the most important thing they don't
teach at school.
Madonna has learned it, and so has Ross Perot. These two shine less for
their innate abilities than for their outstanding flair at self-promotion.
Mercifully, Dudley and Goodson stop short of promising that we can all be
Madonnas or Perots. But they do claim that everyone can overcome their
reticence and be a little more successful. To help them, Dudley and Goodson
have written a book* which promises to get over what they describe as 'call
reluctance'.
Practising what they preach, the pair were in Britain last week promoting
themselves and their book to a group of bemused British managers. Dudley and
Goodson introduced them to 12 different sorts of call reluctance, the
results of 23 years of painstaking research. Everyone has an average of two
of these traits, they said. I had barely opened my mouth before Dudley
suggested that my poor self-promotion might be due to 'role rejection', a
curious trait found in people who feel their jobs are a disappointment to
someone close to them.
Other types include 'yielders', who are so preoccupied with never offending
anyone that they can barely bring themselves to act at all. Then there are
people who suffer from 'hyper-professional' behaviour. This type is too busy
dangling the Rolex to pick up the telephone.
Companies as well as people can suffer from these disorders; Dudley
diagnoses IBM as suffering from a classic case of hyper-professional call
reluctance. 'If you need someone in our sector you'll come to us, because of
who we are,' is how he characterises the IBM malaise.
His own problem - which he shares with Goodson - is that he overprepares.
'We are people who cope with discomfort by insisting on more information. We
feel it would be a cataclysm if someone asked a question and we didn't know
the answer.'
For each of the 12 types the remedy is different. One that works well for
one type may be counter-productive for another. Overpreparers do not respond
to words and arguments. 'We need stronger medicine. This behaviour is habit
based, and we need something that would interrupt the habit in sequence.'
This is where the rubber band and the perfume come in. On Dudley's wrist he
wears a big rubber band. 'Every time these feelings hold me hostage, I
snapped them with the rubber band. It is the only thing that gets through to
me.'
To help him overcome his fear of standing up in front of big audiences he
sprays some Windsong perfume under his nose. This, he says, reminds him of a
happy time in his adolescence, and this smell makes him feel good during the
presentation and leaves no room for fear.

FT  21 MAR 94 / The Monday Interview: Getting out now the going's better -
Luciano Benetton tells Andrew Hill about his decision to eschew politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one man who has a right to appear calm, as Italy prepares for
next week's landmark elections, it is probably Luciano Benetton.
Benetton, 60 next year, founded the Benetton Group with his brothers and
sister in 1965, and built it into Italy's best-known and most successful
clothing company at a time when the now discredited political regime was at
the height of its power. During three decades in which many other
enterprises were obliged to pay off local and national politicians,
Benetton's reputation remains untarnished. Luciano Benetton now heads a
worldwide network of more than 7,000 shops in 110 countries, including
Albania and Cuba.
Indeed, the only real controversy which has touched the group has been of
its own making, in the form of a notorious series of advertising campaigns,
culminating most recently in the image of a dead Bosnian soldier's
blood-stained battle fatigues, which was banned in certain countries.
It was all the more striking, therefore, that Italy's small Republican party
should have persuaded Benetton two years ago to stand for election to the
Italian parliament's upper house, the Senate. Benetton was one of several
respected personalities not previously active in Italian politics who have
been helping to supervise the country's technocratic government. However, he
will take part in the poll as a mere citizen, not as a candidate for
re-election.
Is the birth of Italy's 'Second Republic' really the right moment to retreat
from active politics? 'I became involved in Italian politics as part of a
wider movement striving to overthrow the old political party system,'
Benetton says. He now believes Italy has nearly achieved that goal; nearly,
but not quite. 'I'm a bit less worried now than before, but there's still a
considerable amount of confusion.'
More prosaically, he points out that politics takes too much of his time. 'I
think specialists are required for politics and you cannot be a specialist
in too many things,' he says. 'I would have had to give up my job, which I'm
not prepared to do.'
It does not seem to worry Benetton that specialists are in short supply for
this election campaign. Indeed, the front-runner is another entrepreneur,
Silvio Berlusconi, who is leading the polls at the head of a new party,
Forza Italia, and fielding a list of candidates mostly new to politics.
Benetton is an admirer of Berlusconi's business acumen, but he remains to be
convinced about his political skills.
'He (Berlusconi) has said that if he wins, he will create 1m new jobs and
reduce taxes for many categories of Italians - well, I think he needs to
prove it,' Benetton says. 'It's certainly not going to be an easy task. In
this country a lot of money was squandered, a lot of public money was very
badly employed and I think that Italians cannot really be told that just one
person is going to solve all the problems of the public deficit, just like
that.'
It is easy to understand why Luciano Benetton feels happier out of politics.
The caring, 'green' image of the Benetton Group is largely the work of its
chairman. The group's headquarters in a white-painted villa near Treviso in
north-east Italy seem a long way from what its chairman describes as the
'boring' but inevitable bluster and hyperbole of the election campaign.
Any similarities between Benetton's style and that of other prominent
Italian industrialists are superficial. For example, he dismisses the
suggestion that the family holding company's 4 per cent stake in a new
daily, La Voce, is an attempt to match the media ambitions of other
entrepreneurs. The company is simply part of a consortium, he says,
investing partly out of 'curiosity', partly out of confidence in La Voce's
founding editor, Indro Montanelli, a disgruntled former Berlusconi editor.
Benetton is politically to the left of Berlusconi, whose party is allied
with the federalist Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance.
Although Benetton represented the Republican party, he now seems more likely
to favour the recently formed Democratic Alliance, part of the
left-of-centre Progressive grouping.
In any case, Benetton believes that such distinctions are less and less
relevant to the business of managing Italy: 'I believe that the economic
programmes (of left and right) should not be too different, because, after
all, certain issues which were taboo for many years, such as privatisation
and (reduction of) public debt, will have to be faced by any government.'
He cites the approach of the technocratic governments of the past two years
as an example of what could and should be done. 'Rather than seeing people
inventing something new I'd like to see good administrative management being
pursued.'
In practice, however, Benetton predicts uncertainty in the immediate
aftermath of next week's election. He, like many Italians, believes
electoral reforms and political alliances will have to be refined, and a
second election called. This could usher in a period of more stable
British-style politics, dominated by two or three parties.
It seems unlikely that short-term confusion in Italian politics will upset
the general calm at Benetton Group headquarters. Helped by devaluation of
the lira in 1992, and by the abolition of Italy's wage indexation system,
the group has continued its tactic of dropping prices to fight the global
recession.
'As a company we only want to be able to operate in a country which has a
structure and a system that enables us to compete with other countries,' he
adds. 'We don't have any specific expectations (of a new government). As
Italians, we know that the country will have to change and will have to
implement some major projects, in particular the state will have to reduce
its presence. But this is important to us as citizens, not as Benetton
Group.'

FT  21 MAR 94 / R-R to buy Pounds 14m computer design system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce will announce today the largest order ever placed by a UK
engineering company for computer-aided design and manufacturing systems as
part of its efforts to improve the design and production of jet engines.
The UK aero-engine and industrial power group is buying Pounds 14m worth of
CAD/CAM software and services for its aero-engine division from
Computervision, the US software house.
Computervision said the initial order from Rolls-Royce involved 1,000
terminals or design stations. The company added that the aero-engine
manufacturer had an option to buy and install a further 1,000 terminals by
the end of the decade.
According to the US company the order is potentially worth more than Pounds
40m over seven years.
Rolls-Royce's CAD/CAM investment reflects a growing trend in the aerospace
industry, with manufacturers increasingly turning to computer systems to
help them design and test products before they are manufactured, to reduce
production lead times and reduce the risk of malfunctions and other teething
problems.
Airframe manufacturers such as Boeing of the US and the European Airbus
consortium have used CAD/CAM to design what they call 'paperless' aircraft
to enhance the development of complex aircraft programmes.
Rolls-Royce Aeroengines in Derby has already spent Pounds 10m over the past
five years installing about 700 Unix CAD workstations.
Rolls-Royce will eventually be able to design and develop paperless jet
engines with its software. The new system will make it possible to design,
'build' and prove jet engines electronically before any metal or composites
are cut.
The two companies also say they are entering into a strategic relationship.
Mr Phil Ruffles, director of engineering of Rolls-Royce's aerospace group,
said: 'Our new joint approach is a departure from the traditional
supplier-customer relationship and is one that I believe other industries
will have to consider in the near future.'

FT  21 MAR 94 / Tourists find improved value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of foreign tourists who believe that Britain offers good value
for money rose last year following sterling's devaluation, but
dissatisfaction with the cost of hotels remained high, a survey published
today shows.
The British Tourist Authority's annual survey of foreign visitors found that
French and Italian visitors were more dissatisfied than tourists of other
nationalities with Britons' inability to speak foreign languages.
The survey found that 55 per cent of visitors last year thought London
public transport provided good value, compared with 50 per cent in 1992.
Prices in shops won the approval of 47 per cent, compared with 35 per cent
in 1992. Meals were regarded as good value by 42 per cent, compared with
only 28 per cent in 1992.
Hotel accommodation outside London won the approval of only 21 per cent,
however, up from 19 per cent in 1992. London hotels were regarded as good
value by 17 per cent, compared with 12 per cent in 1992.
Western European visitors who did not speak English expressed high levels of
dissatisfaction with the foreign language abilities of officials and staff
in the facilities they visited. Non-English-speaking visitors from other
countries, on the other hand, were generally happy with the foreign language
abilities of staff and officials.
The BTA said: 'Increasing European integration is probably making west
European visitors less tolerant of the British lack of linguistic ability
than before.'

FT  21 MAR 94 / Property price rise forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial property values could rise 7.5 per cent a year in the next 10
years, says a report by Charterhouse, the merchant bank.
It says that the next two years are likely to see an upturn in property
development as a result of property value growth and a revival in banks'
willingness to lend.
The fluctuations in the next property cycle are likely to be modest,
however. 'There are heavy odds against a repeat of the great UK credit
explosions and property booms and busts of the early 1970s and 1980s,' it
says.
The report's forecast of rising commercial property values is based on the
assumption of low inflation and falling property yields. It says that
commercial rents are unlikely to rise by more than inflation, as demand is
held back by changes in working patterns.
The report forecasts that the workforce may rise by up to 1m in the decade,
as the growth in part-time work exceeds the fall in full-time work. But the
number of workplaces needed is likely to decline, as a result of more
self-employed people working from home and a trend to more people sharing
desks. This will be partly offset by a trend for office workers to use more
space per person.
The sharp fall in property building since 1990 has left scope for an
expansion in construction. Industrial building would need to grow by 3 per
cent to 4 per cent a year through the next decade to return to the long-term
trend and office and shop building by 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Review of dentists' pay likely to propose shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to publish a long-awaited consultation paper this week
which is likely to include proposals for restructuring of the dental health
service.
The Department of Health confirmed yesterday that it would probably publish
on Thursday its first public response to the review of dentists'
renumeration by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, the former head of the Civil Service
in Northern Ireland.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said the delay in publishing the green
paper had come about mainly because of the lack of consensus in and outside
the dental profession about how to make the service more cost-effective.
Under the options presented by Sir Kenneth, reforms might include limiting
treatment available under the health service, or restricting eligibility for
free or subsidised dental care. The report favours keeping free treatment
for children, but not necessarily for all pregnant women.
Options put forward by Sir Kenneth include relatively minor changes. The
government is believed to favour more radical reform, although it has not
ruled out returning to free dental checks. Some dentists and doctors have
claimed a rise in avoidable deaths from oral cancer since their abolition
four years ago.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, predicted that the government
plans were 'worse' that reports suggested, and that a 'hidden agenda'
included denying free provision to pregnant women.
He said yesterday: 'My feeling is that the government is moving into charges
as an alternative to taxes.'
Mr Michael Watson of the British Dental Association said yesterday he
thought it likely that the government would lay out options and delay final
decisions on the scope and funding of NHS dentistry.
He said: 'We want a service that is clearly targeted where it is needed most
and not just making it easier for the well off.'

FT  21 MAR 94 / Lord Inchcape - shy but tough shipping chief: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Inchcape, the former head of Britain's biggest shipping group who has
died at the age of 76, was a shy and undemonstrative man in an industry
which has produced more than its fair share of colourful, extrovert
characters.
He was chairman of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O) at
some of its most turbulent times in the 1970s and 1980s, when its
independence came under serious threat. He also ran the trading group which
bears his name.
Kenneth James William Mackay was the third Earl of Inchcape. The link with
P&amp;O dates from the time when his grandfather merged the company with his own
shipping line, British India, and became chairman.
Born two days after Christmas in 1917, he was educated at Eton and
Cambridge, where he read law at Trinity College. After leading an armoured
car squadron in France and Italy during the second world war he returned to
run the family's commodity, shipping, insurance and other interests.
He had a toughly determined approach to business, although his diffidence
gave him a strong dislike of the publicity which developed at times of
crisis. He believed in pragmatism rather than reliance on management
techniques. 'Survival and growth depend to a great deal upon flexibility,'
he said. He became chairman of P&amp;O in 1973 after successfully opposing a
merger with the Bovis property and construction group.
In the event it was P&amp;O which later acquired Bovis in 1974. But P&amp;O then had
to cope with the impact of the oil crisis. In 1978 Lord Inchcape became
chief executive as well as chairman, and initiated a restructuring policy to
ensure P&amp;O's survival after a period of expansion. It sold significant
shipping, oil and property assets to reduce its debt.
After Lord Inchcape, a keen rider, hunter and farmer, had announced his
intention to retire Trafalgar House, also in property and shipping - through
the rival Cunard line - launched a hostile bid in 1983. It was then that the
more assertive and financially experienced Mr Jeffrey (now Lord) Sterling,
already a non-executive director, took over as chairman to mount a defence.
P&amp;O retained its independence and Lord Inchcape stayed as president until
1986.
Lord Inchcape is succeeded by Viscount Glenapp, his eldest son from his
first marriage.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Outlook for jobs improves sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong improvement in job prospects is reported today in Manpower UK's
latest survey, with a marked recovery in London.
Only the north-east region estimates any decrease in employment prospects in
the next three months.
The most positive growth in new job expectations is in the east Midlands,
followed by western England and East Anglia. London records the best level
of job prospects for four years.
The survey shows a significant increase in the employment trend in
manufacturing, with a strong showing in vehicle manufacture, and electrical
and electronic engineering.
Net jobs growth is also predicted in private-sector and public-sector
construction, insurance, hotels and catering, and retail distribution.
Only five sectors are expected to record a net fall in job prospects -
energy and water services, local government, healthcare, banking and textile
manufacture.
Ms Lilian Bennett, head of Manpower UK, said yesterday: 'It is encouraging
to see the improved trend of the first quarter is continuing and the survey
confirms our experience in the marketplace.'
The survey is based on responses from more than 2,100 leading employers.
About 22 per cent of them forecast job increases and 12 per cent job losses,
resulting in a 10 per cent positive net balance.

FT  21 MAR 94 / RJB set to reopen S Yorkshire pit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A former British Coal pit is to be reopened by RJB Mining, in a move that is
set to create 120 mining jobs.
British Coal is poised to confirm today that it has reached terms for the
leasing of Rossington colliery near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, which
closed last April with the loss of 500 jobs, to the company.
RJB has already reopened Clipstone colliery in Nottinghamshire, which was
also recently closed by British Coal, and has expressed interest in a number
of other deep mines.
After today's formal hand-over, Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB, is
thought likely to double the Rossington workforce to about 250 when the pit
is in full production.
Up to 10 former British Coal pits could reopen under private management
before the industry is privatised later this year.
Betws colliery in south Wales is set to be taken over by a management
buy-out team, and Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former British Coal commercial
director, hopes to restart production soon at Trentham in Staffordshire and
Coventry in the Midlands.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Charities face financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's charities are facing a growing financial crisis because spending
is fast outstripping the growth in their income, detailed analysis to be
published this week shows.
Among the 2,000 biggest charities the median growth in income was 7 per cent
last year, while median growth in expenditure was 10 per cent.
The figures appear in the Henderson Top 2000, produced by Hemmington Scott,
the financial information publisher, which examines the accounts of the
biggest 2,071 charities measured by either income, assets or expenditure.
The data show that the larger charities are growing at the expense of their
smaller counterparts.
Income grew 20 per cent for the upper quartile of charities but fell 5 per
cent for the lower quartile.
Concern about this trend is echoed in an article published in the guide by
Mr Perri 6, a lecturer at the University of Bath, who calls for an
examination of the charity sector by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and the Office of Fair Trading.
Thirty-one of the charities examined - mostly operating in the arts - have
accounts which have been qualified by their auditors on grounds that the
organisation may not be able to survive.
More than 17 per cent of the charities do not have a full audit of their
accounts, because they are not obliged to do so unless they are also
incorporated.
Across all 2,000 charities considered, income grew by nearly 10 per cent to
Pounds 8.053bn on average in the past year for which accounts are available,
while expenditure grew 9 per cent to Pounds 7.668bn. Net assets rose 5 per
cent in the same period to Pounds 24.895bn.
Public grants and fees provided 29 per cent of total income on average, with
a further 25 per cent from fees and charges, 20 per cent from other
voluntary income, 15 per cent from interest, dividends and rent, and 7 per
cent from legacies.
The biggest charity by income was the British Council at Pounds 414m,
followed by the Church Commissioners at Pounds 257m and the Arts Council at
Pounds 223m. As grant providers these three organisations also spent the
largest sums last year.
The largest charity by assets or funds was the Wellcome Trust at Pounds
5.631bn, followed by the Church Commissioners at Pounds 2.214bn, the Weston
Foundation at Pounds 951m and the Leverhulme Trust at Pounds 501m.
Corporate donations to charities came from 1,550 of the UK's 2,200 quoted
companies.
The total in cash and non-cash contributed was Pounds 228m, up 2 per cent
from the previous year. The largest donor was British Petroleum, followed by
Grand Metropolitan, British Telecommunications and National Westminster
Bank.
The biggest proportion of charities' expenditure was operating costs at 70
per cent, followed by grants and awards at 28 per cent and publicity and
fundraising at 3 per cent.
Comparisons are difficult because of the widely differing nature of
charities - some of which provide grants and others which provide services
directly.

FT  21 MAR 94 / OECD poised to condemn Pergau dam aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development is preparing to
criticise publicly the British government's use of aid funds to back the
controversial Malaysian Pergau dam project.
It has completed a report on British aid policy following a critical review
from Finnish and Belgium examiners appointed by its development assistance
committee. A final report will be published next month after a draft copy of
the review was circulated to members for comments.
The OECD has been reluctant to fuel the trade row between the UK and
Malaysia by being drawn publicly into the Pergau controversy but domestic
criticism of British aid policy towards Malaysia in recent weeks has been
sympathetically viewed by OECD aid specialists. The OECD examiners have
identified Pergau as a project that does not readily meet essential criteria
for the granting of aid.
A committee meeting last month, called to consider the British aid
programme, discussed the Pergau controversy and reaffirmed that aid should
be subjected to the full standards of normal assessment and procedures, and
that aid quality should predominate in government decisions. Considerable
credence is given in the OECD to last October's critical report of the
Pergau project by Britain's National Aid Office.
OECD examiners have taken evidence from British officials at the Overseas
Development Administration, which is supposed to manage the UK aid
programme. ODA civil servants objected to the Pergau project but were
overruled by ministers. The OECD is expected to welcome the government's
decision last year to change its aid and trade rules, so that a country as
prosperous as Malaysia could no longer qualify for assistance.
A recent memorandum submitted to the OECD by UK officials defines the aim of
UK aid policy as promotion of sustainable economic development in order to
'improve the quality of life and reduce poverty, suffering, and
deprivation'. The Pergau project predates this decision.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Campaign launched for injured tunnel workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A campaign to win compensation for former tunnel workers suffering from a
crippling bone-wasting disease caused by incorrect decompression procedures
will be launched today by the GMB general union.
The GMB in the northern region believes that thousands of workers employed
on big tunnelling projects in the area since the early 1960s may be
suffering from osteonecrosis.
The campaign was triggered by advice staff at the Wallsend People's Centre,
part of the TUC's network for the unemployed, who noticed many men with knee
and shoulder problems.
About 100 men in north-east England have now forward but the GMB believes
that many more suffering stiff, painful joints as their bones crumble may be
victims of incorrect decompression.
A number of those identified worked in the 1960s on the Tyne tunnel, in
which compressed air was used to keep water out of working areas.
The length of time allocated to decompression was crucial to avoid the
formation of bubbles in the body.
The union is also investigating more recent projects, including the Tyne and
Wear Metro.
One of the GMB's test cases is Mr John Hedley of Wallsend, a 57-year-old
steel erector on the Tyne tunnel in 1964.
Mr Hedley, now on invalidity benefit, said: 'Some of the chaps are crippled.
It's attacking the knee joints in my case.'
Edmund Nuttall, the main tunnelling contractor on the Tyne tunnel, said;
'The matter is in the hands of our insurers.'
Last month a miner now suffering bone necrosis who worked in the mid-1970s
on construction of the Dartford road tunnel won almost Pounds 200,000 in an
out-of-court settlement.
The GMB's campaign will be drawing on personnel records compiled during a
20-year Newcastle University research project on tunnellers' health, started
in the late 1940s.
Professor Joe Pooley, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Newcastle's Royal
Victoria Infirmary, has agreed to provide free screening for potential
victims.
The GMB has engaged Brian Thompson and Partners, solicitors specialising in
personal and industrial injury cases, to prepare compensation claims.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Easing of curbs on migrants is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Immigration restrictions are depriving UK businesses of much-needed
professional and managerial skills, says a report published today by the
left-of-centre Institute for Public Policy Research.
The institute says that changes in immigration policy could bring economic
benefits in the form of skilled labour and an inflow of investors and
entrepreneurs from overseas.
Any such change would also help in attracting international companies by
making it easier for them to transfer staff to the UK.
The report points out that other western countries actively promote
immigration to fill skill shortages and boost their economies. Britain's
policy on migrants was adopted in the 1960s to deal with large-scale
immigration to fill low-skill jobs. It neglects the needs of the labour
market for selective, skilled immigration, and erects unnecessary barriers
to entrepreneurs who would invest in the UK and create jobs.
The institute says the work-permit system operates primarily as a form of
entry control, rather than a system for identifying the UK's economic needs
for migrants. It should be revised to adapt to current migration and
economic conditions.
The UK approach is contrasted with those of the US, Canada and Australia,
where immigration is seen as a means of attracting people who can contribute
to economic growth.
The report says substantial numbers of migrants are unlikely to be needed to
fill UK labour shortages. Relaxation of immigration policy is necessary,
however, in a world where certain types of human capital have become much
more mobile.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Heath attacks 'sleaze' over Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, yesterday accused Labour of
running a 'sleazy' campaign to undermine Conservative MPs facing losses in
the Lloyd's insurance market.
Sir Edward spoke out after detailed estimates of the alleged losses faced by
14 Conservative MPs appeared in a Sunday newspaper.
The figures were extracted from an unpublished version of a parliamentary
early day motion tabled last week by Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath.
The details were removed by Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the speaker. However, Mrs
Boothroyd allowed publication of figures suggesting that Conservative Names
face losses totalling Pounds 6m.
The motion also suggested that Conservative MPs had benefited from a
'special arrangement' with Lloyd's intended to avoid bankruptcies.
Any MP judged bankrupt would be required to resign from the Commons after
six months, triggering a difficult by-election for the government.
Sir Edward said Labour MPs had a 'sleazy desire to brand certain
Conservative members as being on the way to bankruptcy, if not bankrupt'.
He said losses attributed to him were 'entirely untrue'. They bore 'no
relationship whatever to the proper provision made for loss'.
Further details of the Conservative MPs' exposure to losses are expected to
be published later this week in a supplement to the Commons register of
members' interests.
MPs are not , however, required to declare details of their personal wealth,
or their provisions for limiting their exposure.
Mr Hain said he had not sought to conceal that the losses attributed to MPs
were based on average premiums. They also failed to take into account
reinsurance by MPs.
He said that the MPs concerned should clear up the confusion by declaring
the extent of their losses and how they were being paid.
He said: 'Scores of other Lloyd's names have been driven to destitution,
bankruptcy, and some have even committed suicide. It seems inconceivable
that all of the Lloyd's Tory MPs should have miraculously escaped these
catastrophic losses.'
Lossmaking names can apply to the so-called 'hardship' relief scheme, which
reschedules their debts under terms which vary according to circumstances.
Through the scheme Names are allowed to retain an income of between Pounds
10,000 and Pounds 15,000 a year. Lloyd's takes a charge over any property
but the Name can continue living in a 'modest' home.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Labour plans to lift cost of part-time workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is considering extending employers' national insurance contributions
to part-time workers to encourage a shift back to full-time employment.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's employment spokesman, said a Labour government
would also extend full employment protection rights to part-time workers.
'We will certainly take away the incentive that means that employers go to
part-time - turning a full-time job into two part-time jobs - in order to
avoid paying national insurance and denying employment rights,' he told
Granada television.
'Most of Europe (has) rejected that philosophy and even our courts have said
it is wrong to discriminate against part-timers. We can remove the
incentives that have transformed 3m full-time jobs into 3m part-time,' he
said.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, committed the party to equalisation of
employment rights in his speech to the Trade Union Congress conference last
year.
Mr Smith also underlined Labour's commitment to improve conditions for
part-time workers in a speech to party members in Birmingham yesterday. He
said the next Labour government would give working people the job security
they deserved.
He pledged: 'Equal rights for full and part-time workers. The right to
protection against unfair dismissal. The right to proper health and safety
standards. The right to join a trade union and to union recognition. And the
right to a minimum wage.'
Labour officials said, however, that Mr Prescott appeared to have exceeded
his authority by committing the party to equalising national insurance
contributions.
The party fought the 1992 election on a platform promising increased
employment and pension rights for part-time workers, but has since
repudiated most of the manifesto.
The national insurance issue is being considered by the party's economic
commission, chaired by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. It was set up
by Mr Smith to produce a coherent economic policy in time for a general
election in 1996.
Labour has been wary of making specific proposals about part-time employment
because of fears about alienating support among part-time workers. Many in
the party believe, however, that the increasing part-time feminisation of
some of the UK's workforce has been at the expense of full-time male jobs.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Insolvency ruling could spark 'crippling' claims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountancy firms could face claims of up to Pounds 1bn from people who have
lost their jobs over the past seven years, the Confederation of British
Industry warned yesterday.
This follows a recent Appeal Court ruling which suggested that
administrators were deemed to have adopted the contractual employment
obligations of a company after 14 days.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said claims could arise in cases
where it was eventually found impossible to keep companies afloat.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, moved quickly after the
ruling because accountants acting as receivers said they could not produce a
rescue package within 14 days and would be forced to sack everyone in all
cases to avoid claims.
Emergency legislation to clarify the employment obligations of companies in
receivership is due to go through the House of Commons today. It will state
that if there have been no new employment contracts agreed after 14 days of
the receivership or administration of a company, only wages, salaries and
pensions contributions will rank as secured creditors.
The CBI warned yesterday that unless the changes in the Insolvency Act were
made retrospective accountancy firms could be put out of business as a
result of claims made on them.
Mr Davies said: 'Claims are most likely from directors and senior
management. The directors of Olympia &amp; York (developers of Canary Wharf) are
already reported to have lodged claims totalling Pounds 10m.'
Mr Davies said many businesses depended on the availability of services from
medium-sized accountancy firms. He added: 'It is of great concern that such
firms now face the possibility of crippling claims and of going under
themselves.'

FT  21 MAR 94 / Easing of media stake rules urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four of the UK's biggest newspaper groups have told the government that the
rules on cross-media ownership must be rescinded if Britain is to take
advantage of the multimedia revolution.
According to the British Media Industry Group, which includes Associated
Newspapers, Telegraph Publishing, the Guardian Media Group and Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, the UK rules are the most restrictive in
Europe.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act newspapers are limited to one 20 per cent
stake in television companies followed by further stakes of no more than 5
per cent.
The group says in its submission to the cross-media ownership review by the
National Heritage department that the restrictions need to be abolished to
give publishers the right to diversify 'into the new multinational and
multimedia market'.
The group says that newspapers and other forms of publishing are in
long-term decline compared with the rest of the media marketplace.
The Independent Television Commission said in its submission to the
department that newspapers should be able to have larger stakes in
television companies but that the limit should stay below 30 per cent, at
least for the time being.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Dreams of striking up the band: The plans of managers at
South West Trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opportunity to earn 'rail miles' on petrol purchases, the sale of rail
tickets through cut-price 'bucket shops' and an introductory free
rail-travel scheme are proposed by South West Trains once British Rail is
privatised.
Mr Peter Cotton, commercial director of South West, a division of BR's
Network SouthEast, said innovative marketing would be one of the methods
used to attract people to the railways.
South West runs trains from London Waterloo to Reading, Exeter, Weymouth and
Portsmouth.
Mr Cotton, formerly managing director of Del Monte UK, said: 'Commuters
often feel they are a captive market. We need to do more for them. It sounds
frivolous but we might have a silver band playing in the station at
Christmas.'
Mr Peter Field, managing director, said senior managers of South West were
'seriously interested' in launching a buy-out bid for their company,
probably late next year. The managers hope that they can obtain a franchise
for 15 to 20 years, longer than has been indicated by the government. South
West has a turnover of Pounds 230m and employs more than 4,000 people.
The potential for increasing the number of passengers from the present
280,000 a week is large. Sixty per cent of adults in the south-east of
England never travel by rail, 30 per cent use trains infrequently for
leisure travel and 4 per cent commute daily.
Mr Field said: 'We are fishing in a big pool. We need to get people to try
us by, for example, providing more information for non-regular users.'
He said the smaller, franchised railway companies would be able to take
greater account of local needs than was possible in BR.
South West is working with local councils and with Railtrack, the company
which will own BR's track, on proposals to build a line to link Heathrow
airport to the main line to Waterloo.
It has plans for a fast shuttle service between Waterloo and Southampton,
running air-conditioned trains at 20-minute intervals.
Mr Field said fears that rail franchisees would have difficulty raising
finance appeared unfounded. 'We have had serious expressions of interest
from venture capitalists and from potential trade partners,' he added.
South West has ambitious diversification plans. It would like to acquire its
own maintenance facilities, handle its own advertising activities and manage
retail outlets on stations.
Mr Field said: 'British Rail could not do this because it was focused on
cutting costs.'

The Home Office is to pay a total of Pounds 2.3m to 422 trainee probation
officers over an alleged breach of contract, the National Association of
Probation Officers said yesterday.
The association had filed test cases against a decision two years ago to
reduce the trainees' income by up to 80 per cent. The reduction followed an
Inland Revenue ruling that the trainees were students and not liable to
taxation.

The Treasury should be abolished as part of a drive to refocus policymaking,
according to proposals from Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local

FT  21 MAR 94 / Schools criticise council review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schools and their governors have launched a campaign against the English
local government review. They believe it will create weak, unnecessarily
expensive education authorities, staffed by inexperienced officers.
The government will be concerned as this suggests that not only heads but
also parents and governors, given more power recently, oppose the review. A
coalition of educational interest groups last year forced national
curriculum changes.
Mr Peter Downes, vice-president of the Secondary Heads Association, received
loud applause from the association's annual conference when he told Mr John
Patten, education secretary: 'We are very firmly of the opinion that the
two-tier system works pretty well as far as education (the biggest part of
local government services) is concerned, and we think that the prospect of
spending Pounds 1.5bn in transitional costs to produce a new structure which
would arguable be worse than what we have got at the moment is nothing short
of a scandalous waste of public money.'
The review, being carried out by the Local Government Commission, aims to
produce plans for a local government structure for all of non-metropolitan
England this year. Education, now a county council function, would be
transferred to smaller single-tier authorities.
The National Association of Governors and Managers predicted that schools
would 'hardly take kindly to being run by inexperienced administrators' with
small budgets.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Share registrars angry at Bank plans for Crest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has angered share registrars by proposing that the
operator of the new Crest share settlement system be allowed to punish those
who fail to meet standards.
The Bank is overseeing the design of Crest, which is aimed at introducing
paperless share trading and five-day rolling settlement by 1996.
It wants to ensure that registrars, who keep records of share ownership,
will be able to alter their records within two hours of having received
instructions to do so. The Bank believes that unless registrars can act that
quickly it will be impossible to effect five-day rolling settlement as
planned.
Britain's largest registrars say they can now - or will be able to by the
time Crest becomes operational in 1996 - alter share registers within two
hours.
But many of the 150 or so smaller registrars may fail to meet that standard.
The director of share registration at one leading bank said: 'The major ones
have or will have the capacity by 1996. What we object to is the Bank of
England singling out share registrars in the market place.'
The Treasury proposed in a recent paper a rule aimed at meeting the
registrars' objections. Under this proposal any Crest member who failed to
fulfil obligations could be expelled from the Crest system.
Moreover, the Treasury said that companies who kept the records of their
shareholders themselves and acted as their own registrar would have to show
that they had adequate technical capacity and record-keeping arrangements.
The Bank of England is said to be particularly concerned about registrars
because of their role in the failure of the Stock Exchange's Taurus system
for paperless share settlements.
Officials told it privately that constant changes to the Taurus design in
order to meet the needs of small registrars became a crucial factor in the
collapse of Taurus.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Talk Radio aims for year-two profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk Radio UK, the highest bidder in the tenders for Britain's first
national commercial radio licence, says it will break into profit in its
second year on-air.
The company bid Pounds 3.8m a year for its licence, more than Pounds 1m a
year more than its nearest rival Newstalk UK, a consortium led by Associated
Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail. Talk Radio UK will be awarded its
licence by June or July as long as the Radio Authority is convinced of its
business plan.
Mr Christopher Turner, a director of media investment fund Media Ventures,
which has a 31 per cent stake in Talk Radio, denies allegations from rivals
and some advertising specialists that Talk Radio's bid is too high for its
format to sustain. If the Radio Authority were to judge that the bid was not
viable, the licence would pass to Newstalk UK.
Mr Turner said yesterday: 'This isn't a potty scheme. It's been thoroughly
thought through.' The company is expected to spend Pounds 12m in its first
year with a loss of Pounds 1m and then move into profit.
Talk Radio is planning to have only 50 permanent staff with presenters, many
of them journalists, on contracts.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Lawsuit threatened over missing millions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two British businessmen are threatening to sue Union Bank of Switzerland
after one of its Swiss branch managers supplied a reference saying that a
customer was good for Pounds 18m, but later insisted that it had meant
Pounds 18,000. Two managers said that in Switzerland 'm' refers to 'mille',
not millions.
The dispute arose after the sale of a Spanish resort development, in which
the two British business-men had a majority stake, fell through.
The sale of the development depended on the investors who had agreed to buy
it receiving a loan of Pounds 18m.
The transaction is one of several thought to be being investigated by the
Metropolitan Police. Detectives want to interview Mr George Lagoudontis, a
Greek businessman who allegedly agreed to lend Pounds 18m last May.
After Mr John Collins and Mr Tony Etridge had agreed to sell their majority
stake in a Valencia golfing and leisure resort last year, they tried to
verify the standing of Royal Trust of Greece, Mr Lagoudontis' company.
Mr Beat Hunold, manager of the UBS branch in Glarus, replied in German to
Barclays, Mr Collins' and Mr Etridge's bank, that Mr Lagoudontis was 'good
for 18m sterling' although he did not give any further details.
However, when the reference was checked again later following delays in the
transfer of Pounds 18m and the exchange of contracts, Mr Hunold and a fellow
manager wrote on July 15 to say that he had not meant Pounds 18,000,000.
'In Switzerland, 'm' is used as an abbreviation for 'mille' (thousand) and
'mio' for million. Therefore, we understood your request to be for 18,000,
so our reply to you was absolutely correct,' they wrote.
The legal department of UBS in Zurich has defended its stance and said it
cannot give more information to Mr Collins' and Mr Etridge's solicitor
because it supplied the bankers' reference to Barclays in London.
Mr Collins said that UBS was trying to 'defend the indefensible' in not
admitting that it was at fault over the reference.
He said he had served papers on UBS indicating the two men's intention to
sue for damages.
UBS in Zurich said that Glarus was a rural branch which could easily believe
'm' to be an abbreviation for thousand.
The bank said it had been prevented by confidentiality from giving more
information.
Although a price of Pounds 18m was agreed for the El Bosque development  -
in which Mr Collins and Mr Etridge held a controlling stake through
companies in the Isle of Man - the buyers now believe that it is worth less
than Pounds 10m.
Mr Zack Goodman, who acted as agent on behalf of Jouvin, a company
registered in the Channel Islands which intended to buy El Bosque for a set
of private investors, said that the Spanish recession, together with
prolonged uncertainty, meant that its value could have been 'at least
halved'.
He said the sale had been delayed solely because of uncertainty over the
loan.
Mr Goodman said that Jouvin had agreed to pay Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 16,694)
directly to the UBS account in Glarus held by Mr Lagoudontis as an
arrangement fee for the loan, but the loan had repeatedly been delayed after
the May deal.
Mr Lagoudontis said that it had proved impossible to make a loan because one
of the companies involved had been in receiver-ship.
'These people have tried to blackmail money from our bankers,' he said.

FT  21 MAR 94 / How Bill and Hillary bit back and raised a healthy laugh:
Jurek Martin enjoyed a video coup by the First Couple at a white-tie night
out for the media grand panjandrums of Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is just possible that there are those in the darkest corners of America,
where the light of television never shines, who have never heard of Harry
and Louise.
Such ignorance will no longer be possible. The actors who play H &amp; L in TV
commercials paid for by the US insurance industry - an earnest middle-class
couple who sit in their kitchen agonising over the costs of the Clinton
healthcare plan, often for as long as the full minute allowed - have been
usurped. They now stand revealed as Bill and Hillary.
It could have been a tricky Saturday night live for the president and the
first lady. They were guests of honour of the Gridiron Club, a 109-year-old
Washington institution of media grand panjandrums. Its only activity is a
white-tie annual dinner at which politicians are roasted alive - all
off-the-record, of course, but relayed like lightning around the country
(well, inside the District of Columbia Beltway.)
The Clintons hardly needed to dress up to be skewered by the media. The
Whitewater affair, stemming from the Clintons' financial dealings in
Arkansas in the 1980s, has them on the rack and their resentment is
sometimes palpable. On Saturday, there was a frisson of expectation that the
First Couple, in the lion's den, might let it all hang out.
Enter their inspired coup de video. The president commanded his audience to
turn to the large screen at one end of the hotel ballroom. There, sitting
demurely on a sofa, was Louise (aka Hillary) leafing through a vast tome.
She was joined by a casually dressed, coffee cup-carrying Harry (Bill) and
they agonised.
'Look,' she said, 'it says here on page 7,325 (or some such number) that we
may actually get ill.' Big letters on the screen: 'Under the Clinton health
plan you may actually get ill.'
They agonised more: 'It says here on page 26,423 we may actually die.' More
big letters. The sign-off had them rolling in the aisles: 'Brought to you by
the scare-your-pants off coalition.'
Yesterday, this private screening was all over the commercial networks. It
bore the fingerprints of Harry Thomason, the Hollywood TV producer and FoB
(Friend of Bill) who last week aired a spoof commercial killing off the
insurance industry's Harry and Louise - she dies because her health
insurance has run out, of course.
Truth to tell, the real star turn of the evening was the reputed wooden man,
Vice-President Al Gore. He was wheeled to the microphone on a delivery
dolley, where he lay stiff as a board, and moved hardly a muscle beyond his
lips during a very funny speech - 'I'm an inspiration to the thousands of
Americans suffering from Dutch elm disease.'
The president got in a good crack at the young Republican Governor Bill Weld
of Massachusetts, an ambitious patrician: 'His ancestors landed at Plymouth
Rock in the Mayflower. Mine drove into Arkansas in a Plymouth truck and
worked for Mayflower van lines.'
Does an evening of laughter make a difference? Probably not, in the long
term, given the media feeding frenzy over Whitewater, but it made a welcome
break.
And we have seen the end of Harry and Louise, for which small mercy, great
thanks.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Spielberg set for Oscar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tonight promises to be the night that Steven Spielberg, financially the most
successful director in film industry history, receives the artistic
recognition that Hollywood has long denied him.
Spielberg, the director of the hit films ET and Jurassic Park, is the strong
favourite to win the best-director award at that annual rite of prize-giving
and mutual admiration, the Oscar ceremony. The awards are voted on by the
4,755 leading members of the US film industry who belong to the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The award would be for Schindler's List, a black-and-white film about the
Nazi holocaust against the Jews of Europe, which has been nominated for 12
Oscars and has won critical acclaim for its sensitive handling of the
subject.
His film's main challenger in many of the Oscar categories could be The
Piano, a highly original art-house film by the New Zealand director Jane
Campion, which deals with 19th century eroticism in the antipodes. Its star,
the American Holly Hunter, is widely tipped for the best actress award.
A fistful of awards would be a big boost for the studio which backed
Schindler's List - Universal, part of the MCA group bought by Japan's
Matsushita electronics group. Universal has had a mixed box office record in
recent years, though it had a huge hit last year with Spielberg's dinosaur
movie, Jurassic Park.
Matsushita is said to be seeking other outside investors in MCA. Its
Japanese rival, Sony, has acknowledged that it is considering bringing in
new investor to its Columbia studios, which also have a mixed record.
Oscar rewards for The Piano would be a fillip to Walt Disney, which agreed
last May to buy the film's distributor, a small independent, Miramax.
After the mutual back-slapping of Oscar night, Hollywood's financial brains
will return to focus on the film industry's next big hurdle - its release
programme for the important summer season in America.
Analysts are forecasting a summer of record US box office returns, thanks to
a group of potentially strong selling films, including a new animated
feature from Disney called the Lion King.
None of them, however, is likely to match the success of Jurassic Park last
summer.

<TEXT>
The steering committee of creditor banks in Brazil's planned Dollars 52bn
(Pounds 35bn) debt restructuring may ask the Basle-based Bank for
International Settlements to act as collateral agent for the deal.
This follows the decision last week of the International Monetary Fund not
to grant Brazil a stand-by accord. The US Federal Reserve, which was due to
act as collateral agent if the IMF accord had been in place, is no longer
willing to do so.
The steering committee is talking to the BIS about the details of the
operation. Sixty-six per cent of creditor banks also need to waive the
requirement for the Federal Reserve's involvement in the deal, due to be
completed on April 15.
The involvement of an institution other than the Fed would not be
unprecedented. The Bank of England was collateral agent in Argentina's debt
restructuring rather than the Federal Reserve.
Banks are also being asked to waive the requirement that a stand-by
agreement with the IMF should precede the deal.
The lack of an IMF accord further complicates the bank agreement since it
means the US Treasury will be unwilling to issue special zero-coupon bonds
to act as collateral in the restructuring. But Brazil has said it has
executed arrangements that will ensure the collateral is in place in time.

Finance ministers from the 18 countries of the Asia Pacific Economic

That might not seem a large achievement after a day and a half of talks, but
it represents a significant step forward for the fledgling Apec, many of
whose members remain wary of putting sinew into their informal links.
'The general view is certainly not to institutionalise this meeting but, if
we have any specific and substantive issues to discuss, we should do so,'
said Mr Anwar bin Ibrahim, deputy prime minister and finance minister of
Malaysia, Apec's most reluctant member. Mr Anwar added that there was no
commitment to further meetings beyond 1995.
Even so, the weekend talks at a beachfront hotel on the outskirts of
Honolulu yielded an ambitious programme of work on regional capital flows,
infrastructure financing and banking supervision. Ministers also agreed to
send their deputies and central bank officials to a further meeting at the
end of this year to discuss macroeconomic issues.
In a joint statement at the end of the meeting, they agreed on the need for:
sustained low-inflation growth.
increasing cross-border flows of goods, services and investment.
reliance on the private sector as the main engine of growth.
further development of capital markets in the region.
improved financing mechanisms for the estimated Dollars 1,000bn (Pounds
669bn) of infrastructure projects the region may need over the next decade.
Mellowed into conviviality by the bright yellow trousers and pink plaid
shirt of their host, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, the other Apec
ministers deliberately avoided almost all points of bilateral friction, as
well as any temptation to force concrete commitments from the discussion.
'This meeting was about co-operation, consultation, consensus. There are
more Cs this meeting was not about, like coercion, co-ordination and, I
would add, coalition-building,' said Mr Lawrence Summers, US Treasury
under-secretary for international affairs.
If Apec is to develop towards the 'new Pacific community', sought by
President Bill Clinton at a meeting of the region's leaders in Seattle last
year, it may be forced to confront some of these points of friction. These
include immediate rows, such as the US-Japan trade dispute, US pressure on
several south-east Asian countries to open their financial service markets,
and its impending clash with China over human rights and the renewal of
China's most-favoured nation trading privileges.
They also include the possible tension between the broader Apec grouping,
encompassing countries on both sides of the Pacific, and narrower groups
such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations in the east and the
North American Free Trade Agreement in the western hemisphere.
Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chilean finance minister, who took part in the meeting
although his country will not formally join Apec until the second half of
the year, and whose government wishes to become the next member of Nafta,
argued that this tension can be overcome, 'as long as both organisations do
not represent closed blocs, closed regionalism.'
Some of the problems that might arise, however, could be made Apec business,
such as energy supply problems in the region, the possible burst of China's
bubble economy, and the potential for damaging corporate bankruptcies in the
fast-growing stock markets of the region.
'If you are in farming and you have a flood, you don't just lose your crop,
you lose your neighbour's crop with it. What happens in one of these
countries spills over into the rest,' Mr Bentsen said.
'What we are talking about is the creation of infrastructure in yet another
area - financial policy infrastructure,' said Professor David McClain of the
University of Hawaii.
Mr Paul Martin, finance minister of Canada, cautioned against rushing Apec's
evolution: 'What is very clear is people want to see Apec develop under its
own steam, not be directed. Apec is an agglomeration of countries; it has to
develop at its own pace.'
The greatest threat, some observers feel, could come from the US eagerness
to press ahead. Apec will require 'a degree of patience that may tax the
American mentality, and a degree of sensitivity and cultural awareness in a
region where, it seems to me, we have often underestimated the importance of
nationalism,' warned Mr Michel Oksenberg, president of the East-West Center,
a government-funded research institute based in Hawaii.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Blacklist may help stamp out EU's agriculture fraud: Deborah
Hargreaves finds some countries more willing than others to crack down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rene Steichen, European agriculture commissioner, says he will soon
propose a 'blacklist' of people and companies which have fraudulently got
hold of European Union farm funds.
Mr Steichen's plan follows a report last month by the European Court of
Auditors, the EU's financial watchdog, which was highly critical of the
Commission and member countries for not doing enough to stamp out fraud in
the Ecu36bn (Pounds 27.2bn) agriculture budget.
The EU could be losing over Ecu200m a year from agricultural fraud,
according to some estimates. But the complexities of the Common Agricultural
Policy also mean companies can manipulate the system quite legally.
'It is such a labyrinthine muddle of regulations that anyone with a keen
mind can quite easily work out how to exploit the system legally or
illegally with little risk,' said Mr Brian Gardner, director of EPA
Associates, an agriculture consultancy. The complicated regulations
governing the CAP also make it difficult to track down fraud.
The court's report cited 5,775 reported cases of fraud and irregularities
uncovered by the Commission since 1972. Those cases had cost the union
Ecu725m, but the Commission and member countries had managed to recover only
Ecu77.7m of the funds lost.
The Commission has to rely largely on member countries to police abuses of
the system and some are more diligent than others.
Farmers themselves receive about a third of the agricultural budget
directly. The rest of the money is spent on buying up and disposing of EU
food mountains with funds being paid to exporting companies and other
operators.
The auditors point to the payment of export refunds, which subsidise the
sale of surplus produce outside the EU, as an area where exploitation has
been rife. Export subsidies account for around a third of agricultural
spending.
Some of the abuse is caused by negligence on the part of government
authorities, but some companies are plainly profiteering from agricultural
pay-outs.
The Commission is reluctant to release names of companies or individuals
involved in fraud because of pending civil actions in member countries.
But investigations conducted by the Commission show the scope for abuse. For
example, Commission officials investigating a tip-off from British
government inspectors found that high quality beef was on sale in the UK and
Italy at prices lower than the market rate.
These sales involved beef that had been released from EU intervention stores
which buy up surplus produce. It was destined for export as food aid to
Russia.
However, some exporters had substituted lower quality meat to send to Moscow
and were selling off the high quality beef at knock-down prices.
A Commission official points out that the mechanisms for recovering money
lost in cases like this are complex and can take a long time to pursue. But
a 'blacklist' of offenders should crack down on fraud in future.
'Anyone on the 'blacklist' would not be eligible to apply for EU aid for
several years - on a sliding scale depending on the degree of error or
fraud,' a Commission spokesman said. Mr Steichen has outlined his proposals
to a budgetary committee of the European Parliament, but he will need the
approval of farm ministers before a list can be drawn up.
The Commission is responsible for investigating fraud, but member countries
generally administer punishments and recover monies lost. Procedures for
doing this can vary widely from country to country.
The court of auditors stressed that the process of tracking down offenders
is further complicated by the fact that member countries do not even have a
common definition of what constitutes fraud.
The Commission has stepped up its fight against farm fraud and last year
sent out 50 missions of its inspectors to look into deception involving
Ecu400m.
Irregularities often arise because of a lack of adequate records kept by
member governments. Commission examiners made 150 applications to check
member countries' own records last year with the result that some big
revisions were made.
In Italy, inspectors found 250,000 tonnes of durum wheat missing from EU
stores.
One major investigation recently involved the inspection of olive oil stocks
in Italy which had been purchased by that country's intervention board.
However, the Commission inspectors found that one-third of the stocks were
not of a high enough quality to qualify for intervention. Of the remainder,
60 per cent was of a lower quality than the Commission had already paid some
Ecu35m for.
Companies can often exploit loopholes in regulations and lack of adequate
monitoring to make a profit from EU business. But some operators go to
elaborate lengths to defraud the EU.
The court's report picks out the payment of export refunds as a particular
problem area because the complexity of the system for claiming subsidies
leaves it open to abuse.
The auditors' report tells the tale of 10,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder
destined for export to Algeria. The powder was produced in various member
countries and loaded on to seven ships in the Netherlands. The ships,
however, never left the German port of Emden but the exporter, Dutch company
with subsidiaries in the UK and Switzerland, claimed Ecu15m of export
subsidies.
It proved difficult to pursue the perpetrators of the fraud because
applications for licences and subsidies had been made in several member
countries.
That is the problem for the Commission in stepping up its fight against
fraud - it needs co-operation from member governments and some are more
willing than others to crack down.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Modest local poll win for Balladur
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right coalition government yesterday won a
modest victory in the first round of France's local council elections. But
the socialist opposition also claimed success by improving on its dire
performance in last March's parliamentary poll.
The centre-right won 44.7 per cent of the votes in the first round which
encompassed 2,018 of France's 4,033 local council seats and which was the
first significant test of confidence in the Balladur government since it
came to power last March. The socialists and their allies emerged with 28.77
per cent of the poll and the communists with 11.45 per cent.
Mr Balladur last night described the result as 'favourable' to his
government. Mr Michel Rocard, the socialist leader, hailed it as the start
of a 'very clear revival' for the left. 'The good times are over for the
right, the bad times are over for the left,' he said.
The local elections have come at a critical time for the prime minister
whose popularity has slipped recently on concern about high unemployment and
a wave of violent strikes and demonstrations across France.
The elections will be concluded next Sunday with a second round of voting.
The extreme-right wing National Front yesterday secured 9.78 per cent of the
votes, consolidating its position after last year's parliamentary poll. The
ecologists, weakened by internal squabbles, emerged with 2.62 per cent of
the votes.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Setback for main German parties in local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Both Germany's main political parties, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats, suffered setbacks in
yesterday's local elections in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.
Yet fears of voter apathy, and new gains for extreme right-wing parties,
proved unfounded, with a 70 per cent turnout of the 2.1m voters in Germany's
northernmost state.
The main beneficiaries of the swing against the big parties were the
environmentalist Greens, and a series of local interest electors' groups in
the 1,100-odd council elections.
The poll is the second of the 19 elections to be held in Germany this year,
culminating in the general election on October 16.
It provides the first sign that the opposition Social Democratic party
(SPD), as well as the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is facing a
backlash among electors. On the other hand it suggests that dire predictions
of a strong rise in the far right wing may have been exaggerated.
Official results gave the SPD 39.5 per cent support, down 3.4 percentage
points on its total of 42.9 per cent in the 1990 local elections. The CDU
gained 37.5 per cent of the vote, down 3.8 percentage points from 1990.
The Greens saw a clear pick-up in votes, from 6 per cent in 1990 to 10.3 per
cent last night. The Free Democratic party (FDP), Chancellor Kohl's junior
partner in the Bonn coalition, had another bad night, down from 6.1 per cent
four years ago to 4.4 per cent yesterday.
Far right parties like the Deutsche Volksunion (which gained entry to the
Schleswig-Holstein state parliament with 6 per cent support in 1992) and the
Republicans only contested a few towns and failed to make a significant
showing.

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow's importance in the Yugoslav peace process was underlined yesterday
when Bosnian Serbs allowed a UN aid convoy access to the besieged
Moslem-held enclave of Maglaj in north-central Bosnia. About 20,000 people
had been trapped there by joint Serb and Croat offensives since last autumn.
Last week, Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the former
Yugoslavia, warned the Bosnian Serbs that they had to take a more
'constructive approach' in the peace process.
Access by the UN convoy to Maglaj also follows Russia's broader attempts to
persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to decide when, and how, he
is prepared to sue for peace. That would lead to an overall regional
settlement.
As part of this process, Mr Churkin is expected to hold talks tomorrow with
Croatian officials, and with Serb leaders from the self-styled republic of
Krajina in south-western Croatia.
Mr Churkin wants to persuade Croatian leaders to grant wide autonomy to
Serbs in Croatia. In return, Serbia might be persuaded to sign a peace
treaty with Zagreb.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Fury over Gillette's Spanish closure plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gillette of the US will come under strong pressure from Spanish regional
authorities this week to drop controversial plans to close a razor-blade
factory near Seville and transfer production to the UK and Germany.
The closure plan carries echoes of the row early last year over the decision
by Hoover of the US to stop making vacuum cleaners at Longvic, near Dijon in
France, and move its operations to Cambuslang in Scotland.
Hoover's move brought French accusations against Britain of 'social dumping'
by using lower wages and less favourable working conditions to lure the US
company away from France.
The Gillette case is another instance of a multinational opting to move its
production base within the single-market European Union.
Gillette management told staff at the Alcala de Guadaira factory at the
weekend that its decision to close was 'irrevocable'. Its plan for cutting
excess European capacity involved concentrating production of razors and
razor-blades at Isleworth, west London, and in Berlin.
The group had announced earlier this year plans to cut 2,000 jobs worldwide.
The Spanish plant, which employs about 250, was set up in the 1960s as part
of an industrial development plan for the region. Of the three Gillette
plants, it is considered to have the least advanced technology.
Employees' representatives claimed the Gillette decision was linked to new
investments by the company in Russia, Poland and Turkey, where it could take
advantage of lower wage costs.
Gillette sparked off a similar storm in France in the late-1980s over its
withdrawal from manufacturing at Annecy, near the French-Swiss border.
Public sentiment in Andalucia has already been primed by a furore over job
cuts at Santana Motor, a subsidiary of the Japanese Suzuki group making
four-wheel-drive vehicles at Linares.
The workforce at Linares is due to be cut by 1,500, leaving about 900.

Bonn
Not a newspaper in Germany, however small, has been able to resist
commenting on yet another hiatus in relations between Bonn and Paris.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, had obviously ruffled some
feathers during the negotiations to get Norway into the European Union last
week.
The Berliner Zeitung dismissed Mr Kinkel's playground bully approach to
international diplomacy, while the General Anzeiger in Bonn warned the
foreign minister not to go round smashing 'foreign policy china'.
The Wiesbadener Kurier even suggested that Mr Kinkel's fuse was shorter than
usual because his party, the Free Democrats, had performed so miserably in
the Lower Saxony elections last Sunday. Feathers had obviously been so
ruffled that Mr Francois Scheer, the ambassador in Bonn, decided to share
his concerns with a group of German correspondents.
He told journalists the two neighbours should be consulting more often and
that Mr Kinkel had been a bit rough with the Spaniards who were demanding
more fish in return for Norway's accession. The Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung, Germany's most august daily newspaper, then caused waves by quoting
Mr Scheer and on Thursday morning the ambassador was summoned to explain
himself.
Among close friends ambassadors are rarely summoned as the Deutsche
Tagespost at Wurzburg pointed out: 'That is a well-tried method when it
comes to dealing with banana republics. It is unacceptable as a means of
exchanging views between France and Germany.'
But defending 'German interests and goals' often called for a more
forthright manner as the Allgemeine Zeitung at Mainz wrote: 'For ages
Germany was accused of behaving like a political dwarf. Is it not normal
that it should be just as tenacious as other countries and should not
constantly have the heavy burden of the past in its sights.' As in the past
the strain in the Bonn-Paris axis is explained by uncertainties surrounding
the government's move to Berlin.
The Leipziger Volkszeitung, however, is convinced that 'with the exception
of European separatists or Republicans there is the broadest possible
consensus in this country about the continued expansion of Europe. Since
this is undisputable, there is every reason to forcefully rebut charges that
German politicians are apparently fickle or too brash when it comes to
discussing Europe.'
Overshadowing last week's diplomatic tussle are a series of celebrations to
mark the collapse of Nazi Germany 50 years ago. 'Unavoidably there are
renewed complaints about some sort of new German danger,' wrote the Bild
Zeitung, Germany's biggest-selling tabloid. 'The momentary tensions between
Bonn and Paris are a symptom of this nervousness. That's why Chancellor Kohl
and Foreign Minister Kinkel are required to use all the sensitivity they can
muster to persuade our French neighbours that Germany will continue to be an
equally dependable but also equally entitled partner.'
The biggest of the anniversary celebrations will take place in July in
Normandy, an event Chancellor Helmut Kohl long hoped he would be able to
attend because it would do him a world of good to be seen rubbing shoulders
at such a European event.
Some German newspapers, including the Berliner Morgenpost, take a rather
different view: 'You cannot simply change the significance of historical
events,' it wrote. 'The invasion is a matter for the then victors, not
something for Germany which lost. Were England and Germany to commemorate
Waterloo, they would hardly invite France.'

FT  21 MAR 94 / Italy speeds up plans to sell telecoms stake

<TEXT>
The Italian government is to speed up plans to sell its 52 per cent stake in
Stet, the national telecommunications utility, in what it is describing as
'the mother of privatisations'.
At the same time, it is preparing its telecommunications operators for
international competition by merging five separate networks into a single
unit, under plans announced at the weekend. The new company, Telecom Italia,
will be the principal asset of Stet.
Although Italy is to hold a general election next weekend, a new government
is expected to proceed with the sell-off of Stet which may now take place
before the end of the year.
The cabinet, which has yet to name advisers to the flotation, is aiming at
wide ownership. This will include a core of financial institutions as
leading shareholders, which the government hopes will provide stable
ownership.
A 0.5 per cent limit is likely to be set on holdings acquired in the public
offer, while the institutions will be able to hold up to 2 per cent.
The rationalisation of the five groups, long held up by political interests,
was agreed by the boards and is to take place in August.
Telecom Italia will be the world's sixth-largest telecoms operator in terms
of turnover, which topped L26,800bn (Pounds 10.7bn) last year, and will have
nearly 100,000 employ ees.
The merger of Sip, the quoted domestic network operator, and the four
smaller groups, is intended to cut costs, integrate overlapping
organisations and provide a single group able to compete in Europe's
deregulated market due to come into force by 1998.
Sip has a monopoly in the domestic network, but the market in cellular
telephones is being opened up. The winner of a race to run Italy's new
Europe-wide network, GSM, is expected to be announced this week.
The merger of the five companies is to be achieved by converting their
shares into shares in Sip, under terms of exchange based on the companies'
stand-alone values as determined by the government's advisers to the
restructuring, JP Morgan and Albertini Sim.

The fight against massive budget fraud will be on the agenda when European
Union finance ministers meet in Brussels today, Reuters quotes diplomats in
Brussels.
The meeting will discuss a report on the EU's 1992 budget from the
Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors which calculates that some Ecu170m was
wasted in irregular outlays and lost receipts that year.
Britain, which has pinned its flag to the fight against fraud in the run-up
to the European Parliament elections in June, is pushing for fraud against
the EU budget to be treated as a criminal offence as is fraud against
national budgets.
The meeting will also discuss the tricky issue of setting a time limit on
opening up access to the EU budget's emergency monetary reserve to include
agri-monetary costs.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, was last night anxiously
awaiting the outcome of the first round of voting in France's local council
elections. It is the first significant test of confidence in his
centre-right government since its election last March.
Yesterday's vote, in 2,018 of France's 4,033 cantons, or local council
wards, comes at a critical time for Mr Balladur, whose popularity has
slipped in recent months on concern about high unemployment and a wave of
violent strikes and demonstrations.
Mr Balladur, whose capable manner made him one of Europe's most popular
politicians during his first months in office, has already seen his approval
rating fall from 55 per cent to about 50 per cent since the end of last
year.
The prime minister, who is still tipped as a contender for the centre-right
candidacy in next spring's presidential elections, desperately needs to
secure a vote of support in the local poll, which will be concluded with a
second round of voting next Sunday.
'If we win, nobody will say anything, but if we lose, people will attack the
government,' said Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister who was a
candidate yesterday.
The vote includes half the seats in each of France's 95 conseils, or general
councils. The other seats will be up for re-election in three years.
Opinion polls last week predicted that the Balladur centre-right coalition,
whichp already controls 75 of the 95 conseils generals, would win up to 200
extra seats, following next Sunday's second round.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Relief of Maglaj bolsters Moscow's role: UN convoy reaches
20,000 people trapped in Moslem-held enclave since autumn

Moscow's importance in the Yugoslav peace process was boosted yesterday when
Bosnian Serb forces allowed a United Nations aid convoy access to the
besieged Moslem-held enclave of Maglaj, in north-central Bosnia.
A UN official said the Serbs had abandoned their checkpoints on the road to
the town as the convoy, carrying 80 tons of food, reached Maglaj.
In a letter sent to Mr Sergio de Mello, UN civil affairs officer, the leader
of the Bosnian Serbs, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said he hoped that the 'ordered
ceasefire will succeed' in Maglaj. His remarks followed last week's warning
by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, that
Bosnian Serbs had to take a more 'constructive approach' in the peace
process led by Washington and Moscow.
About 20,000 people had been trapped in Maglaj by joint Serb and Croat
offensives since last autumn. Despite this, the Bosnian government/Moslem
forces had held on to the city, a strategic point in any eventual linkage of
this part of the republic with other territory held by Bosnian-government
troops.
Access by the UN convoy to Maglaj also follows on from Russia's broader
attempts to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to decide when,
and how, he is prepared to sue for peace, which would lead to an overall
regional settlement.
As part of this process, Mr Churkin is expected to hold talks tomorrow with
Croatian officials and Serb leaders from the self-styled republic of
Krajina, in south-western Croatia.
In the talks in the Russian embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr
Churkin wants to persuade Croatian leaders to grant wide autonomy to Serbs
in Croatia. In return, Serbia might be persuaded to sign a peace treaty with
Croatia.
That treaty would involve Serbia giving up claims to Krajina in return for
Zagreb gaining complete control over the south-western and central part of
Croatia.
UN officials said at the weekend that any process towards attaining a peace
treaty between Croatia and Serbia would involve the US and Germany applying
pressure on Croatia to make substantial political concessions, and perhaps
some territorial ones.
But they added that the federal treaty between Bosnian Croat and Bosnian
Moslem forces was holding. Several hundred prisoners of war and detainees
were exchanged at the weekend following the signing of the treaty in
Washington last Friday.
Meanwhile, in Sarajevo Mr Karadzic pledged to respect the ceasefire around
the Bosnian capital.
The ceasefire has held since February 10 following Nato's ultimatum to
deploy air strikes against Serb-held positions overlooking the city.
Yesterday at least 8,000 people attended a football match between a Sarajevo
club and a UN team.
General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of UN troops in Bosnia, told
reporters that the match showed that normalisation was 'an irreversible
process'.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Gonzalez deal on top party jobs: Compromise avoids Socialist
rift ahead of European elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez , the Spanish prime minister, was forced yesterday to
accept a compromise with hardliners in the allocation of top Socialist party
posts.
The deal, reached after long hours of bargaining in the party's three-day
conference here, avoided an open rift which threatened serious damage to the
party ahead of European and regional elections in June.
Mr Alfonso Guerra, leader of the hardline faction, succeeded in placing his
most senior allies in top posts, even though his overall support within the
party's executive committee was reduced from almost half to a quarter.
Mr Guerra himself kept his job as party number two under Mr Gonzalez, after
threatening to pull out if the leadership were not 'balanced'. Against
opposition by senior moderates in the party, he also managed to keep a
prominent ally, Mr Jose Mara Benegas, in the top leadership, although not in
his previous job running the party's organisation.
That job finally went to a relatively obscure politician from Valencia, Mr
Cipria Ciscar, with Mr Benegas taking over the party's political and
institutional relations.
The committee proposed by Mr Gonzalez was approved by 89 per cent of
delegates at the conference, the party's first since 1990. All-night
negotiations, which broke off at dawn yesterday, were resumed yesterday,
delaying the end of the conference.
Mr Gonzalez had admitted earlier in the conference that there was
'considerable internal tension' in party ranks.
He has brought two of his top ministers, deputy prime minister Mr Narcs
Serra and foreign minister Mr Javier Solana, into the executive committee.
That was enlarged to make room for a larger number of women, who now make up
a third.
Infighting over the top posts obscured the policy debate, in which the
government's free-market and budget-cutting positions had an easy ride. The
party gave top priority to job-creation, backed a 'rigorous choice' in
government spending and a curb on fraud, and pledged itself to 'create
conditions in which private initiative can act more effectively'.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Fate of Dollars 600m Bulgarian loan deal in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The future of a Dollars 600m (Pounds 401m) International Monetary Fund and
World Bank loan package, aimed to help Bulgaria settle its Dollars 9.3bn
debt to the London Club of commercial banks, may be settled at a meeting of
European Union finance ministers in Brussels today.
The ministers are due to consider Bulgaria's request for Dollars 330m in
balance of payments support for 1994 from the G24 group of countries.
The positive response would enable the IMF to go ahead with new stand-by
loans and funds designed to help the reform worth Dollars 400m. It would
also unlock Dollars 200m in linked World Bank loans.
The IMF cannot agree the loan unless Bulgaria has the necessary financial
support needed to implement the economic reform programme it agreed with the
Fund last December.
Foreign financing is needed if Bulgaria is to meet its June 30 deadline to
reschedule its Dollars 9.3bn foreign commercial debt. Under a framework
agreement reached last November, the London Club banks chaired by Deutsche
Bank, agreed to halve the debt. In return, Bulgaria said it would pay
Dollars 850m immediately if it could get IMF and World Bank backing.
Bulgarian officials say it is essential that G24 agrees the funding without
delay because of the severe devaluation of the leva. The currency has lost
25 per cent of its value in the last month, making the 1994 budget
unrealistic.
'Everything will fall apart if we do not get support from the G24. Otherwise
we will have to renegotiate a whole new package with the IMF and the World
Bank which could take months,' Mr Dimitar Kostov, deputy finance minister,
said in an interview.
Bulgaria is the last former East Bloc country (outside the former Soviet
Union) with unresolved foreign commercial debt.
Foreign investment, needed to finance the country's transition to a market
economy, is not expected to pick up until the debt is settled. According to
official figures, Bulgaria had attracted only Dollars 220m in foreign funds
by the end of 1993, a fraction of the amount committed to other central
European countries.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Israeli team in Tunis to woo PLO: Public posturing hides
private diplomacy between leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A team of senior Israeli officials flew to Tunis yesterday seeking to woo
the Palestine Liberation Organisation back to the negotiating table.
It was indicative of the hardening of attitudes to Israel and the peace
process since last month's Hebron mosque massacre that the Israeli aircraft
carrying the officials was refused permission to land in Tunis. The Israelis
had to go to Sicily and switch to a US aircraft for the rest of their
journey.
Before the team set out, it had announced its acceptance of UN Security
Council Resolution 904, which called last Friday for the deployment of a
temporary international force in the occupied territories to protect
Palestinians.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said after the council vote -
which condemned the February 25 massacre by a Jewish settler of 30
Palestinians in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs - that he expected full
Israeli-PLO peace talks to resume at an early stage.
There has been talk of a meeting this week between Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman, and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, to announce
formally the resumption of negotiations. But neither Israeli nor PLO
officials sounded completely confident yesterday.
Mr Uri Savir, director-general of the Israeli foreign ministry, said as he
left for Tunis that, while he hoped to pave the way for a resumption of
talks, it would be foolish to predict a date.
He confirmed that Israel would allow the deployment of a temporary and
unarmed international observer force in the West Bank. This would possibly
be in the shape of an increased Red Cross presence, with a Red Cross office
at Hebron to deal with Palestinian complaints of human rights abuses.
Israel is also prepared to see a Palestinian police force established at
Hebron, provided it is answerable to the Israeli army.
But, as for the possibility of evacuating Jewish settlers from the heart of
Hebron, Mr Savir was adamant this was an issue for the Israeli government:
'We won't open any debate with them (the PLO) on that issue.'
Mr Nabil Sha'ath, PLO chief peace negotiator, said he regarded the issue of
radical settlers as of central importance. The Tunis talks would focus, he
said, 'on the measures to be taken by the Israeli government about the
settlers' status in the occupied Palestinian land, especially Hebron'.
Despite the public posturing, the two sides have engaged in considerable
private diplomacy. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, spoke to Mr
Arafat several times by telephone over the weekend. He declined yesterday to
brief his cabinet on the substance of some of the measures he was willing to
take to re-start the peace talks because he feared leaks.
Meanwhile, Israeli troops yesterday shot and wounded nine Palestinians, and
stone-throwers injured an Israeli motorist, during clashes in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The violence, with frustration over the continued Israeli closure of the
territories which is keeping tens of thousands of Palestinians away from
jobs inside Israel, has focused both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat on the need to
wrap-up the 'Gaza-and-Jericho-first' autonomy deal.
Mr Peres promised at the weekend that the final deal could be sewn up in
three weeks, and that the Israeli army could complete its withdrawal from
Gaza and Jericho a month after that.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Natal fans political fires in run-up to S African poll: The
regional events undermining peace hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to predict that next month's all-race elections in South Africa's
Natal province will not be free and fair, whatever is done in the next five
weeks to make it so. Those who live in areas controlled by the Inkatha
Freedom party will not dare to vote, because the IFP will be boycotting the
poll; those who live in African National Congress areas will not dare to
stay at home, because the ANC will want them to vote.
The only remaining question is how many people will die before polling ends
and, perhaps more importantly, how many will opt for violent resistance to
the new government once it takes power.
Several events last week helped to stoke political fires in Natal, where
weekend violence left 11 dead.
ANC officials, including President Nelson Mandela, tried more or less openly
to incite popular rebellion in the KwaZulu homeland. Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, the KwaZulu leader, replied with belligerence and aggression, and
sabotaged a planned peace meeting between Mr Mandela and the Zulu King
Goodwill Zwelethini by inviting armed Zulu warriors to attend.
The Independent Electoral Commission said it would soon take measures to
enforce free political activity in Natal, putting it on a collision course
with Inkatha, which is preventing voter education and campaigning in many
areas.
Then, on Friday, the prestigious Goldstone Commission of inquiry released
details of how some of the most senior men in the South African police
allegedly manufactured homemade guns and gave them to Inkatha. On the same
day, King Goodwill called on thousands of Zulu warriors - many of them
carrying firearms - to boycott the elections and defend the 'sovereignty' of
the Zulu nation 'at all costs'.
So after months of uncertainty, some clarity seems to be emerging. Barring a
last-minute miracle, Inkatha will not participate in the April poll and the
Zulu king could take leave of reality entirely and declare KwaZulu
independent.
Nonetheless, international mediation of the country's constitutional dispute
will go ahead - indeed, Inkatha negotiators say they expect to announce the
names of mediators today. But the results of mediation will be implemented
only after the poll.
According to the best-case scenario, consensus will be reached on
constitutional changes and the new constitution, to be written by an elected
constituent assembly, will be changed to reflect it. Then Inkatha would
prepare to fight the second elections (in 1999) from a base of
extraparliamentary opposition.
But Mr Philip Powell, commander of the Mlaba training camp near the KwaZulu
capital of Ulundi where some 5,000 Inkatha members have been given military
training to form 'self-defence units', makes clear that Inkatha's strategy
will be to render Natal ungovernable, just as the ANC made South Africa
ungovernable in the 1980s.
'The ANC has proved by mass action that you can make government impossible.
We've learned lots of valuable lessons from what they have done', says the
former police officer.
He says Inkatha cannot resist if the Electoral Commission uses the army to
install polling booths and enforce voter education. 'We don't even entertain
the possibility of fighting the South African Defence Force. We have no
army, no armoured vehicles, no helicopters.' But such a move would galvanise
support behind Chief Buthelezi, and provide recruits for a 'low intensity
guerrilla war against the (new) government of national unity'.
The Vietnam war is a case in point, he says. 'That war was won by people
with bicycles and homemade hand grenades.' Mr Powell concedes that no such
war is likely in South Africa. After the decision of right-wing whites to
take part in elections, fighting would be limited to Natal and Inkatha would
lack the Vietcong's powerful backers.
But if a new ANC government seeks to crush Inkatha, or if the ANC-dominated
Transitional Executive Council (which holds the true reins of power in the
run-up to elections) chooses to impose elections by force, much bloodshed
could result.

FT  21 MAR 94 / War-weakened Somalia hit by cholera epidemic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cholera epidemic is inflicting further suffering on Somalia, struggling to
recover from famine and civil war. More than 1,700 cases, and 100 deaths,
have been reported since the first outbreak of the disease in the northern
port of Bossasso last month.
The Qaraan hospital in the capital, Mogadishu, has run out of beds and floor
space, but is admitting more than 70 new cholera patients a day. Scores of
sufferers are being treated outdoors, lying on rough blankets and attached
to saline drips hanging from branches of acacia trees.
Dr Osman Dufle, who says the number of cases is rising exponentially, has
begged the departing US military for tents and camp beds, as the rainy
season is due to begin later this month. 'The epidemic,' he warns, 'will
continue to rage out of control unless UN agencies help us to chlorinate
wells and improve the sanitation of this city.'
Relief workers say cholera was a disaster waiting to happen. Big towns such
as Mogadishu and Kismayo have no piped water or sewerage systems; both were
destroyed during the civil war. Thousands of displaced people still live in
overcrowded camps. Rubbish is left to rot on the streets and drinking water
comes from a multiplicity of shallow wells, most contaminated by sewage.
The cholera epidemic also points to the failure of the UN Operation in
Somalia (Unosom) to deliver humanitarian assistance. Most of the UN's
resources have been consumed in the failed military attempt to overpower
Mogadishu's warring militias.
The UN has also spent more than Dollars 80m (Pounds 54.7m) building a
fortified compound for 1,000 UN civilian and military staff. The sewerage
system alone cost Dollars 9m.
Outside the compound walls, however, human and animal waste - the breeding
ground for cholera - lie in stagnant pools. With no government and no social
services, Somalia is ill-equipped to cope with a national health emergency
of this kind.
The few Somali doctors, like Dr Dufle, who did not flee during the war have
worked without salaries for the past four years.
They depend on non-government organisations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres
for food and medical supplies. 'Although we hoped Unosom or the World Health
Organisation would pay our salaries, no help has been forthcoming,' says Dr
Dufle.
The epidemic has struck as the west is disengaging its troops from Somalia,
following the deaths of UN peacekeepers and frustration over the
unwillingness of rival Somali factions to reach a political settlement.
The last US troops will leave Mogadishu this week. The Italian, French,
Belgian and German contingents are also leaving or have left.
The remaining UN peacekeepers, mostly Indians and Pakistanis, are unsure of
their role and fear a renewed outbreak of fighting.
Uncertainty also surrounds the future of the UN operation, the mandate of
which expires in May.
Two journalists working for Italian TV were gunned down in a drive-by
shooting in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, yesterday, Reuter reports.
The two were shot dead near the old Italian embassy. Their corpses were
airlifted by helicopter, apparently to a ship covering the withdrawal of
Italian troops from Somalia.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Japan to curb rise in car exports to EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has agreed to restrict the rise in car exports to the European Union
to 0.4 per cent this year, reducing Japanese car industry hopes for an
export-led recovery.
The deal, agreed on Saturday between trade officials from the European
Commission and Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, means
Japan's EU market share is set, in theory, to fall fractionally.
Japan and the EU agreed three years ago to set annual Union-wide import
quotas, to be reassessed every six months, to pave the way for an open
European car market by the end of the decade.
Japan's car industry accepted the small increase in exports without
complaint, reflecting the fact that their overall EU sales would be little
affected as a result of the build-up in European-based production.
'We will continue to hold back our exports and respect the spirit of the
agreement, which was made under the premise that the EU car market will be
liberalised in the year 2000,' said Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan and
the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
The accord allows Japan to export 984,000 cars to the EU this year, 8.2 per
cent of expected EU demand for 11.97m vehicles. Tokyo and Brussels differ
over how much the European market will grow, but the accord is based on an
expected 2 per cent increase in demand, a weak recovery from last year's
nearly 16 per cent decline in the European car market.
Last year, Japanese car exports to the Union fell by 18.5 per cent to
980,000 units, and it achieved an 8.3 per cent share of a total market of
11.74m cars. However, a senior Commission negotiator said the EU expected
Japan to ask for a change in its export ceiling if the market were to show a
'substantial deviation' from forecasts.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Beijing promises to work on Pyongyang: The visiting Japanese
prime minister's concern over N Korean nuclear sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday told Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the visiting Japanese prime
minister, it would continue initiatives to persuade North Korea to open its
nuclear sites to inspection, in an effort to avoid an international crisis,
but Beijing counselled patience.
Mr Hosokawa, in two hours of talks with Chinese prime minister Li Peng,
spoke of Japan's 'grave concern' over North Korea's reluctance to co-operate
with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has been rebuffed
repeatedly in its attempts to gain access to Pyongyang's nuclear facilities.
'Japan is gravely concerned about the situation, and the possibility is
increasing that the matter will be referred to the United Nations Security
Council. I believe the international community is losing patience. The role
of China is very, very important,' said Mr Hosokawa.
Premier Li's undertaking, that China would try to persuade North Korea to
accept IAEA inspections, was accompanied by the standard Chinese line that
'the international community should take more time to settle the issue.'
Mr Li added cryptically that it was important to 'give North Korea what it
wants.' The Chinese official appeared to be suggesting that the US should
accede to Pyongyang's demand for some form of diplomatic recognition.
Indications that Beijing might be prepared to increase pressure on Pyongyang
reflect deepening concern among the Chinese leaders over the possibility of
the dispute spiralling out of control.
China is anxious to forestall a sanctions process in the security council,
under which it might be obliged to take action against its ally and
neighbour. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and one of its few
international 'friends'.
But Beijing also recognises that international patience is wearing thin and
that the prospect of UN-sponsored action is drawing nearer. For several
months, Chinese officials have been urging the international community to
avoid backing North Korea into a corner.
The Japanese are making no secret of their increasing alarm over
developments on the Korean peninsula.
A spokesman for Mr Hosokawa told foreign reporters in Beijing on Saturday
that Tokyo feared a nuclear North Korea would have a 'domino effect'
throughout Asia.
Japan has pledged to support the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
indefinitely, but the Japanese official said that, if North Korea joined the
nuclear club, there was certain to be strong pressure domestically for Japan
to do the same. 'We have to defend ourselves,' he declared.
Mr Hosokawa, on his first visit to China as prime minister, also raised the
sensitive issue of Japan's wartime past. The visiting premier, in a speech
to parliament in Tokyo last August, went further in apologising for Japanese
brutaltiy than had any of his predecessors.
Mr Li was reported to have expressed satisfaction with those remarks.
Other issues raised by Mr Hosokawa included China's defence spending, which
is to increase by more than 20 per cent, according to this year's budget.
Japan wants more 'transparency' in China's military spending, much of which
takes place through budgetary items other than those marked as for defence.
Mr Li attributed China's defence budget increase to inflation and to the
needs of a modernising a military which lagged behind other sectors.
The two sides reviewed Japan's aid programme to China, which amounts to
Dollars 7.7bn (Pounds 5.2bn)in cheap credits in the five years to 1995.
Mr Hosokawa, reflecting Japanese concern about the environmental threat
posed by China's rapid industrialisation, expressed the hope that additional
funds would be allocated to pollution-control.
The Japanese premier, who is to leave for Shanghai tomorrow, also met
Chinese President Jiang Zemin yesterday and lunched with Mr Zhu Rongji, the
vice-premier in charge of the economy.

FT  21 MAR 94 / US clears way for Asian bank's capital increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONOLULU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations on a capital increase of more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.4bn)
for the Asian Development Bank could be completed in the next few months,
after the US agreed to the injection of funds.
Finance ministers from the 18-nation Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum agreed in Honolulu this weekend on the need for the ADB to double its
capital resources - an increase which would amount to about Dollars 23bn.
'A consensus on doubling the capital is in the making,' said Mr Hirohisa
Fujii, Japan's finance minister, after the Apec meeting.
The Manila-based bank's lending for development projects in the Asia region
is limited by its statutes to the total of its callable capital and
reserves. It has already run close to that limit and, with new borrowing
members such as the former Soviet republics of central Asia on board, it is
expected to have to trim lending this year.
But the US has been in arrears on its current obligations to the ADB, and
the Clinton administration, besides facing tight budget constraints, has
only recently been convinced by the ADB's efforts to reform its operations
to agree to the capital injection.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said: 'We look forward to the
concluding negotiations for a general capital increase for the Asian
Development Bank. It will mean more than Dollars 20bn for this region,

The US and Japan are the largest shareholders in the ADB, with about 16 per
cent each. Only a small percentage of the capital increase would have to be
paid up, reducing the budgetary cost for each to an estimated Dollars 40m.
The US also faces a larger payment for a Dollars 40bn capital increase at
the Inter-American Development Bank.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Christopher hopes China heeds demands for improved human
rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday voiced his hope that
China would meet Washington's demands for improved human rights, while
appearing to move away from the Clinton administration's linkage of trade
and human rights in dealings with Beijing, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Mr Christopher said on national television that China relied on the US
market for about 40 per cent of its exports. This gave Washington
substantial leverage.
But he also held out prospects that the US might move to separate, or
'de-couple', its human rights and trade policies, particularly China's Most
Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status. 'For this year we are committed to using
MFN,' he said, adding: 'There are many other tools we can use down the road
if we get past this year.' Mr Christopher said he was not talking of 'the
linking' so much as 'broadening the relationship'.

FT  21 MAR 94 / China probes labour exploitation: Complaints and sharp rise
in disputes trigger government concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is to investigate labour conditions in state and foreign enterprises
in an attempt to counter complaints of exploitation and a sharp rise in
disputes.
Many of the complaints have been directed at foreign employers, who are
accused of disregarding minimum standards set by the state.
The move also reflects increasing government concern over labour unrest;
restless workers in loss-making state enterprises facing closure are seen as
a threat to public order.
The Labour Ministry said its inquiries would cover all urban and township
enterprises, whether Chinese or foreign-funded. The survey would run from
April 1 to June 30.
An official said inspectors would investigate whether enterprises had
violated the law by using child labour or exploiting women. They would also
check contracts, wages, working hours, insurance and welfare treatment.
Persistent criticism of foreign businessmen by representatives of the All
China Federation of Trades Unions has revived images of exploitative bosses
left over from China's colonial past. A union official said in an interview
that some foreign employers violated workers' rights 'randomly and openly'.
'They prolong workers' hours, cut or deduct their wages arbitrarily, neglect
safety and sanitary requirements and even humiliate workers,' said the
official.  'One employer even locked his worker in a dog cage.'
The Labour Ministry's investigation coincides with growing signs of
militancy among workers, including a recent call by labour activists for an
independent trade union. The activists, who said their aim was to protect
workers from exploitation in the current economic boom, were detained by the
authorities.
Since China opened to the outside world in the late 1970s, tens of thousands
of enterprises with foreign involvement have been established, many of them
benefiting from cheap labour.
The Beijing-based China Electronic News reported recently that there were
more than 10,000 labour disputes last year. Many occurred in the Shenzen
special economic zone, adjacent to Hong Kong, which has attracted a flood of
peasant labour to work in small processing concerns.
The All China Federation of Trades Unions began a drive last month to double
union membership this year in foreign-run factories and joint ventures. Less
than 30 per cent of companies in which foreigners are involved are
unionised.
China's trade union law entitles unions to a seat on a company's board of
directors.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Business offered role in schools: Dearing wants training for
vocational qualifications to start at 14
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers will be allowed unprecedented influence in compulsory schooling
under proposals for new vocational qualifications announced by Sir Ron
Dearing, the government's chief adviser on the curriculum and tests.
In the most radical overhaul of public examinations in England and Wales for
a decade, 14-year-olds will be allowed to spend one day a week studying for
qualifications in subjects such as health services, leisure and tourism, and
manufacturing.
The new qualification, as yet unnamed, would take up a fifth of school time
over two years and would be equivalent to two GCSEs. It would be voluntary,
but the aim is to encourage children who are less interested in academic
subjects to gain skills and stay in full-time education.
Employers, education-business partnerships and Training and Enterprise
Councils are being consulted about the content of exams and funding for
them.
The National Council for Vocational Qualifications, an employment department
quango, will have responsibility for vetting and administering the
qualification, giving the department greater influence over compulsory
education.
Sir Ron told the Secondary Heads Association's annual conference in
Bournemouth at the weekend that he hoped the new qualification could be
offered from 1996.
He denied claims that the scheme would mean the return of academic
selection, at 14 years rather than 11, or that the new scheme would be a
'soft option'.
To prolonged applause from head teachers at the conference, he said: 'I am
all too conscious of the common tendency to consider the academic as
first-rate and the practical applications of knowledge and understanding as
second-rate. It is a tragedy that we have the value structures we do, and I
rail against them.'
Under Sir Ron's plans, which have already been approved in principle by the
education department, five vocational subjects would initially be on offer:
manufacturing; art and design; health and social care; leisure and tourism;
and business and finance.
Those mirror the first subjects introduced for the new general national
vocational qualifications to be taken alongside A-levels by 18-year-olds.
The Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the education department
quango headed by Sir Ron, is considering allowing credits in other GCSE
courses to count towards the vocational qualifications.
Others subjects may follow, although Sir Ron emphasised that education for
14-year-olds would not embrace crafts as specific as plumbing or
bricklaying.
Mr John Sutton, SHA general secretary, welcomed the proposals but said they
must be adequately resourced. Mr John Dunford, also of the SHA, said the
qualifications would allow pupils time to take seven GCSEs at the same time,
reducing the risk that they would appear to be in a separate 'stream'.
There is widespread support among teachers and employers for allowing
14-year-olds a vocational option, but opposition is likely from conservative
educationalists who fear pupils taking the exams would be stigmatised, or
that schools specialising in them would appear 'second-rate'.
Sir Ron and the NCVQ will consult schools after he presents a report to the
education department in the next few weeks.

FT  21 MAR 94 / US to seek UN backing over North Korea inspections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is to seek United Nations support in an attempt to force North Korea
to allow international inspectors full access to its nuclear facilities, it
said yesterday.
Washington said it was also ready to act bilaterally, increasing its
military activities in the region. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, said the US was preparing to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea
and to reinstate joint military exercises with South Korea 'in the very near
future'.
'We're not seeking a confrontation with North Korea, but if they insist on
it, I'm sure we'll prevail,' Mr Christopher said on US television.
Mr Christopher said the US would be seeking a resolution at the UN Security
Council. 'I think we'll be preparing for trade sanctions,' Mr Christopher
added, but this depended on North Korea's actions.
Congressional leaders put their weight behind the administration's increased
pressure. Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, said US
aircraft carriers would be despatched to the region unless Pyongyang
complied with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. The US
may also increase its troop strength there, he added. Currently 37,000 US
troops are stationed in South Korea.
The board of governors for the IAEA is expected to decide today to refer the
North Korean nuclear issue to the Security Council.
In Beijing yesterday, Chinese leaders told Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the
visiting Japanese prime minister, they would try to persuade North Korea to
open its nuclear sites to avoid an international crisis, but Beijing
counselled patience.
China is key to any international approach. If China blocks sanctions in the
UN Security Council, the US and South Korea will have few options left,
short of military actions, to force the north to accept nuclear inspections.
Mr Christopher said China would support the US plan because it was in its
own interest to do so. 'They are much closer at hand than we are.'
However, China's ambassador to South Korea warned at the weekend that his
country would not support sanctions against the north. 'Such measures are
not only ineffective, but would also complicate matters and aggravate the
situation,' Mr Zhang Tingyan, the Chinese ambassador, told the South Korean
news agency Yonhap.
Any military response, such as an air strike on the North's nuclear
facilities, is considered unlikely, however, since it would almost certainly
provoke a North Korean attack on the South and destabilise the north-east
Asian region.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Moscow and IMF fail to reach deal on Dollars 1.5bn loan:
Russian PM makes final attempt to secure funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia and the International Monetary Fund have failed to agree on a further
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan which Russia is seeking to help economic
reform.
After three days of talks, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime
minister, will today make a last attempt to persuade top-level IMF officials
to release the funds before they return to the US.
Mr Chernomyrdin will meet Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director,
for a final round of talks.
The exercise is a vital one for the Russian government. The payment of the
loan, the second tranche of Dollars 3bn in funds to help reform, is part of
a Dollars 43bn package agreed by the Group of Seven last year in Tokyo.
The loan would:
Inject desperately needed hard currency into Russia at a time when capital
continues to be exported.
Signal the IMF's belief continued reform is possible under Mr Chernomyrdin's
leadership.
Allow Russia to service its debt obligations and thus increase its chances
of receiving further debt relief and loans.
However, the indications from both sides are that the IMF officials cannot
reconcile the budget's assumptions with what they believe will be the
out-turn at the end of the year.
According to one source, the Russian side had withheld details from the IMF
team until the last moment in order to weaken the team's position during the
talks.
The Fund is concerned that the expenditure in the budget, Rbs183,000bn, will
be exceeded long before the end of the year and that the income, of
Rbs120,000bn, will not be gathered in because of rapidly falling tax
revenues. The Fund also thinks that the Russian parliament, which has only
just been sent the draft budget, will not approve it and will demand much
higher spending.
Mr Chernomyrdin issued the invitation to Mr Camdessus to visit Moscow
earlier this month in the hope that face-to-face discussions would break the
long deadlock in talks over the loan. Previous meetings between the two men
have been frosty. But Mr Camdessus - aware that assisting Russian reform
represents the largest and most dangerous challenge to the IMF's abilities
since the war - is determined to bend every effort to secure agreement, if
one can be brought within the bounds of the IMF's criteria for lending.
The Russian prime minister has striven in the past two months to burnish his
image as a reformer, following the departure from the cabinet of Mr Yegor
Gaidar and Mr Boris Fyodorov, formerly deputy prime ministers and the most
prominent radicals.
However, it has been widely assumed outside Russia that the reforms are at
best stalled. Russian debt traded on the international markets at 55 cents
to the dollar in December but halved to 28 cents today, and it is 'still
under pressure', according to H. Rivkin and Co, a New York investment house
specialising in distressed bonds.
On Friday, Mr Mikhail Zadornov, the reformist chairman of the lower
chamber's budget committee, said he believed the budget was unrealistic. 'I
would rather have a realistic budget, maybe with a higher deficit, than a
budget which will be exceeded in two or three months,' he said.

Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN troops in Bosnia,
shakes hands with a Sarajevan football supporter, after the city's home team
yesterday beat a UN scratch side 4-0.
Around 20,000 people watched Football Club Sarajevo's tri-umph, the largest
crowd to gather in the city since war broke out nearly two years ago.
Following the game, and entertainment provided by sky-divers, Nato warplanes
and the British Coldstream Guards military band, Gen Rose cited the day's
events as proof that the peace process in Bosnia was 'irreversible'. He had
organised the match as a non-political event.
A ceasefire between Moslem troops defending the city and besieging Serbs has
been holding for nearly six weeks.

FT  21 MAR 94 / Risk grows of Tory split over EU expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospects of a damaging split in Britain's Conservative party over
enlargement of the European Union increased yesterday as opinion hardened on
both sides of the Channel ahead of a crucial meeting tomorrow in Brussels.
Senior ministers insisted that the crisis over the entry terms for Sweden,
Finland, Norway and Austria would be resolved by the Union's foreign affairs
council.
But leading members of the council, the Commission and the European
parliament said Britain would have to accept substantial changes in the
Union's system of qualified majority voting.
Backbench Conservative MPs, including some not normally regarded as
anti-European, said any retreat by the government would precipitate a crisis
in the parliamentary party.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, said he was confident
that Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, would achieve a compromise
allow-ing enlargement to go ahead.
'Britain's vital national interests have to be protected at this point. I am
pretty clear that can be made compatible with an agreement. But I think the
idea that this whole thing is going to sink on British obduracy is really an
invention,' he said.
Mr Portillo also claimed that the government's reluctance to allow changes
in the voting system would help the Conservatives in the European parliament
elections on June 9.
He said: 'I don't think British people want to be swept along by a tide.
They want to know there are certain rights protected in the EU.'
However, Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, said there
could be no compromise based on Britain's wish to retain the existing voting
system, under which 23 of 76 votes form a blocking mechanism in the Council
of Ministers.
Mr Helveg Petersen said most member states would probably accept Greek
proposals for a move to a blocking mechanism of 27 votes out of 90 in the
enlarged council, combined with a one-month cooling-off period to allow
reflection.
Mr Leo Tindemans, leader of the European People's party, the transnational
grouping to which the British Conservatives are affiliated, said no
compromise would be acceptable unless it involved a move to 27 votes.
Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for foreign affairs, said there was
'amazement' among Britain's EU partners that the government was prepared to
risk delaying enlargement.
Some MPs linked the issue to Mr John Major's leadership of the party. Mr
Bernard Jenkin, a hardline Euro-sceptic, said compromise would put in
question the credibility of Mr Major's vision of the Union as a group of
self-governing nation states.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Palestinians expected to join resumed Middle East peace
talks

The Palestine Liberation Organisation and three Arab states are expected to
resume stalled peace talks with Israel soon, Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, said in Washington last night.
He said Lebanon, Jordan and Syria had agreed to resume talks with Israel
next month and this would provide 'a strong impetus' to the PLO to return to
the bargaining table and to conclude arrangements for Palestinian self-rule
in Jericho and Gaza.
The announcement came immediately after the United Nations security council
passed a resolution condemning the Hebron massacre and urged an
international presence in the region. The PLO had linked resuming
negotiations with Israel to passage of the resolution.
The PLO abandoned Middle East peace talks last month after an Israeli
settler killed about 30 Palestinians at a mosque in the West Bank town of
Hebron, saying it wanted the ejection of rightwing settlers and protection
for Palestinians.
'There have been intensive Israel-Palestinian contacts at the highest levels
today including a telephone call between prime minister Rabin and chairman
Arafat,' Mr Christopher said.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, is expected to meet Mr Shimon Peres, the
Israeli foreign minister, in Cairo early next week in an attempt to clear
the way for a resumption of negotiations on Palestinian autonomy in the
occupied territories.
Mr Peres said yesterday he planned to discuss with Mr Arafat ways to speed
up the implementation of the 'Gaza-and-Jericho first' autonomy.
Israel's meeting with PLO representatives would focus on security measures
in the West Bank and the likely resumption of full-scale peace negotiations.
US Middle East co-ordinator Mr Dennis Ross would be travelling to the region
'in the next few days for additional consultations with the parties'.
In Israel, speculation intensified yesterday that the government was
considering evacuating some of the settler enclaves in the heart of Hebron.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Bank of England offers variable-rate gilt issue: Bond aimed
at banks and building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is launching its first UK government bond with a
variable rate coupon - rather than a fixed interest rate - in nearly 20
years.
The Bank is keen to offer investors a wider range of financial instruments,
and expects the new gilt to appeal primarily to banks and building societies
which buy floating rate paper for short-term liquidity purposes. Money
market funds are also expected to buy the paper.
However, yesterday's announcement is seen as particularly opportunistic,
given the recent bouts of nervousness in the world financial markets.
The gilt-edged, European government and US Treasury bond markets have all
seen sharp falls since February 4, when the US Federal Reserve hitched up
short-term interest rates. The markets have been especially nervous about US
inflation prospects and the possibility of further rises in US interest
rates, and have experienced heavy selling by investors, particularly the
US-based hedge funds.
A few borrowers have responded to the uncertainty over interest rate
movements this year by issuing floating rate notes, either in US dollars or
sterling. Some gilt analysts pointed out that the Bank was hoping to take
advantage of investor uncertainty about the direction of UK interest rates
and the fact that some existing floating rate issues are expected to mature
this year, creating a shortage of such notes.
'Some investors clearly think that UK interest rates may have bottomed out
or be close to their lows, and that a floating rate bond would enable them
to take advantage of a rising interest rate scenario,' said one analyst.
The fact that the new gilt issue is targeted at banks and building societies
may also help - indirectly - to iron out the sharp fluctuations in money
market interest rates.
Since the Bank changed its funding rule in March 1993, the banks have bought
substantial amounts of gilts. However, the Bank is keen to encourage them to
buy more gilts so that they build up large holdings of government paper
which can be used as collateral in certain of the Bank's money market
operations - known as repos - and which could help to smooth out the
volatility in the commercial banks' overnight interest rate.
The last time the Bank issued bonds with a variable interest rate, the
exercise was not deemed a success. It sold three issues, of Pounds 400m
each, in 1977 and 1979, which matured in 1981, 1982 and 1983. Investor
demand was poor, and was not helped by the coupon-setting mechanism which
was seen as too complicated. It was set retrospectively, based on an average
for the UK Treasury bill rate over the previous six months.
The new gilt issue will be sold at auction on March 30, and details of the
amount, maturity and coupon will be announced by the Bank on Tuesday. The
coupon is likely to be set using the London interbank rate, the common
method of setting the coupon on floating rate sterling bonds.
The Bank said earlier in the week that its auctions would be in the Pounds
2bn-Pounds 4bn range, but market participants suggested that the Bank is
likely to err on the lower end of the range.
The gilt market reacted positively to yesterday's announcement, recovering
3/4 of a point in the afternoon. However, dealers said this was partly in
relief that the Bank was not issuing conventional bonds against an
unfavourable market background.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Mirror cleared to buy Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers was yesterday given
government approval to take over Newspaper Publishing, owner of The
Independent and the Independent on Sunday.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided not to refer the
deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the grounds that the papers
'are not economic as going concerns' and there was a case for urgency.
Unless there is judged to be a serious financial threat to the existence of
a title an MMC reference is usually required when the combined circulations
of newspapers involved in takeovers is more than 500,000 a day.
Mr Heseltine did not, as many expected, accompany his permission with
conditions.
He said: 'I have concluded that the public interest does not require me to
stipulate conditions.'
Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, emphasised that guarantees of
editorial independence were 'enshrined in print in the consortium agreements
and we are bound by them.'
Mr Heseltine rejected the views of 99 MPs who signed an early day motion
arguing that as an absolute minimum conditions should be imposed to protect
the editorial independence of The Independent.
The Commons trade and industry committee is expected to consider on
Wednesday whether to seek an inquiry into the issue.
Journalists at the two loss-making newspapers asked for the reference to the
MMC and Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group of Ireland, the
largest shareholder in Newspaper Publishing at 29.9 per cent, wanted
conditions to be imposed. Mr Heseltine also cleared its stake.
The consortium, whose other members are a group of founders led by Mr
Andreas Whittam Smith and newspaper groups El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica
of Italy, will press ahead with the reorganisation of Newspaper Publishing.
MGN will become responsible for running The Independent apart from the
editorial department. The Independent will join the MGN titles in the Canary
Wharf tower in London's Docklands in the next two months.
Apart from the reorganisation as much as Pounds 20m may have to be put into
the company to improve editorial content and increase promotion.
Mr Whittam Smith will be chairman and editor-in-chief. There are no plans to
offer board representation to Mr O'Reilly's group.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin's administration chief yesterday insisted that the
Russian president was in good health and accused opposition figures of
spreading rumours about a coup plot, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Sergei Filatov, administration chief, was speaking as rumours about
impending plots to overthrow Yeltsin, saying he was too ill to rule,
circulated in parliament. They were contained in an anonymous document
passed among deputies.
Mr Yeltsin went on holiday to the south Russian coast this week, saying he
planned to be away for a fortnight but could be called back early. He was
off work for three weeks last month with what aides called first a cold and
later flu.
'Certain opposition activists are trying to push society into an explosive
state, spreading rumours either about the allegedly worsening state of
health of the president or about a coup which is allegedly being planned,'
Mr Filatov said. Interfax said Mr Filatov urged all opposition groups to
work together to try to achieve harmony.
Mr Georgy Satarov, presidential adviser acknowledged that disaffected groups
of the dispossessed Soviet-era ruling class might be planning a return to
power.
No sooner had Mr Yeltsin left Moscow than his past and present political
enemies - including former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, just released
from jail - united in an anti-presidential movement dubbed Accord For
Russia.
Conservative opponents of President Boris Yeltsin yesterday failed to force
a debate on whether to scrap the 1991 treaty which abolished the Soviet
Union and set up the Commonwealth of Independent, the Interfax news agency
reported.
The move in the lower house of parliament, proposed by former Soviet
parliamentary chairman Anatoly Lukyanov, failed because only 179 deputies
backed putting it on the agenda, well short of the 223 needed.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's government was yesterday urged to bring in drastic measures or
face social unrest, Louise Lucas writes from Hong Kong.
Mr Martin Lee, leader of the minority United Democrats Party, told a finance
committee meeting of the Legislative Council (LegCo) that people were
growing increasingly disgruntled at being unable to buy a flat in the boom
market. 'It could end up in public disturbances,' he said, proposing the
introduction of a property gains tax.
Mr Tony Eason, secretary for the planning, environment and land department,
said the answer was to speed up the supply of land. He was echoed by
property agents, who say China and Britain must thrash out agreement to
extend the supply of land. This is limited to 50 hectares a year under the
1984 Sino-British agreement.
Meanwhile Mr Lu Ping, director of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs
Office, has warned Chinese companies operating in the colony not to dabble
in property speculation.
'There are some companies who think if they lose money they won't have to
foot the bill themselves. This means they push the property prices up very
high indeed.'
Residential property prices last year rose up to 38 per cent in some luxury
developments, according to Brooke Hillier Parker, surveyors and
international property consultants. Major developments in other parts of the
colony saw prices rise by around 20 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation intensified in Jerusalem yesterday that the Israeli government
was considering the evacuation of at least some of the settler enclaves in
the heart of Hebron where at least 30 Palestinians were massacred by a
Jewish settler last month. The Palestine Liberation Organisation has
demanded a crackdown on settler radicals as a pre-condition for resuming
peace talks.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, is expected to meet Mr Shimon Peres, the
Israeli Foreign Minister, in Cairo early next week in an attempt to clear
the way for a resumption of negotiations on Palestinian autonomy in the
occupied territories. The meeting had been initially scheduled for tomorrow
but it was then realised that the host, President Hosni Mubarak, would only
return to Egypt late tomorrow night from a conference in Zimbabwe.
Mr Peres said yesterday that he planned to discuss with Mr Arafat ways to
speed up the implementation of the 'Gaza-and-Jericho first' autonomy deal.
The idea of a Peres-Arafat meeting was raised by Mr Dennis Ross, the US
peace talks co-ordinator, who is due to visit the region again next week to
mediate a resumption of the autonomy negotiations. The plan was accepted by
the PLO on condition that the UN Security Council first issued its
much-delayed resolution condemning the February 25 massacre.
The Security Council was scheduled to vote late last night on the
resolution, which includes a call for new measures to protect Palestinians
in the occupied territories, including the deployment of 'a temporary
international or foreign presence.'
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has said he would allow an
international observer force to deploy in the West Bank, and has also said
he would be delighted if about 1,000 Palestinian policemen, who resigned
their Israeli-supervised posts at the start of the uprising more than six
years ago, were to return to their duties.
Mr Rabin and Mr Peres were closeted together for several hours in Tel Aviv
yesterday. It is possible that the government could decide to bring the 400
Jewish settlers inside a single compound, instead of the present situation
where they are dispersed in small enclaves across Hebron.
Mr Peres insisted yesterday that 'no decision was yet taken' on the matter.
But Mr Yossi Sarid, the environment minister, who has been playing an
increasingly prominent role in the peace negotiations, said that, 'there
probably will not be any alternative but to evacuate certain settlement
sites inside Hebron.'
Talk of moving or evacuating Hebron settlers has brought a wave of
right-wing protest. Rabbi Moshe Levinger, the ideological leader of the
settlers, said that Mr Rabin's reference on Thursday to the 'crazy'
dispersal of Jews across Hebron was 'an insult to our forefathers and to all
settlers.' Mr David Levy, foreign minister in the former Likud government,
warned that the government was 'bowing to PLO dictates . . . capitulating to
PLO demands.'

</HEADLINE>

   ULUNDI, SOUTH AFRICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A judicial commission of inquiry in South Africa yesterday published
evidence showing that senior officers of the South African police helped
supply weapons to the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, the clearest
suggestion yet of security force involvement in political violence.
The report, released yesterday by the prestigious Goldstone Commission,
headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, appeared to support longstanding
allegations by the African National Congress that a 'third force' is
involved in political violence between Inkatha and the ANC.
The report said a special police unit was involved in the manufacture and
smuggling of weapons to Inkatha and that Lt-Gen Basie Smit, police force No
2, Maj-Gen Krappies Engelbrecht, head of police intelligence, and Maj-Gen
Johan le Roux, another senior police officer, had been aware of the unit's
existence.
President F W de Klerk said the three men had been suspended and an
international task force would investigate their case.
The commission's report alleged that senior police officers were involved in
arms supplies to Inkatha since 1990. In 1992, the so-called Inkathagate
scandal, involving government funding to Inkatha rocked the government of
President de Klerk. At that time, he claimed he was unaware of the funding
and insisted that all improper links between Pretoria and Inkatha had been
severed.
President de Klerk announced a purge of the senior ranks of the police force
in late 1992 and appointed a respected officer of the South African Defence
Force to conduct an inquiry into security force involvement in violence.
This was never published and its recommendations were never made known.
Yesterday's report said the men were involved in the manufacture of
home-made weapons in the East Rand townships near Johannesburg which have
seen some of the worst violence since political unrest increased
dramatically four years ago.
Meanwhile, in a move likely to increase the potential for further political
violence, Zulu king Goodwill Zwelethini held a public meeting at Ulundi,
capital of the Kwa Zulu black homeland to call on his supporters to boycott
April's all-race elections.
He urged them to fight to defend the sovereignty of the Zulu nation, which
he said was under threat.
'I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred duty to defend our freedom and
sovereignty,' he told a crowd of 15,000 heavily-armed Zulu warriors. The ANC
and government had hoped to persuade the king to endorse the election,
despite the opposition of Inkatha, but this hope was dashed last night by
the king's belligerent address.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Private View: The high priest of pure French
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a sportswear shop in Calais called 'Athlete's Foot'. I was thinking
of it last week in Paris on my way to the Academie Francaise, that venerable
custodian of the French language, when I passed a marine equipment shop
called 'Nauti Store'.
As I crossed the Seine in the spring sunshine, pondering the Balladur
government's announcement of a language bill with stiffer penalties to
enforce the public use of French, I was nearly run over by a breakdown van.
Painted in large letters on its side were the words 'Yellow Cad'.
The perpetual secretary of the academie, its commanding officer in the war
against linguistic corruption, is the writer and anglophile Maurice Druon.
'Je vais commencer alors par un statement,' he said as he ushered me with a
flourish of Gallic courtesies into his elegant cabinet room. 'I'm a great
admirer of the style of Gibbon and Churchill. Bon. Voila comment je vous
accueille.'
Druon does not, God forbid, speak franglais. He is a former minister of
culture, member of the French and European parliaments and a winner of the
Prix Goncourt. He was with de Gaulle's Free French in London during the
second world war.
No, he switches with virtuous ease between the two tongues, according to the
mood of the moment. In his own language he is declamatory, rolling the words
around his tongue with the relish of a wine-taster. In English he has the
upper-class drawl of the clubman (he is a member of the Garrick and the
Savile), and makes redundant apologies for the poverty of his syntax and
pronunciation.
We sat in matching armchairs with aged leather seats. The first 'Immortals',
the founder members of the academy set up by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635 as a
supreme court to decide the rules of French, looked down from the walls.
'A cup of tea, perhaps?' said the perpetual secretary.
A butler arrived and set down a silver tray. I began by asking: What,
really, is the threat? Isn't the academy's attempt to preserve the language
culturally stifling?
Druon sighed. 'I answer in another way. I much regret that you have not an
academie anglaise, a state institution to watch over your language.'
As for the academy's work, he continued: 'Did that stop the Enlightenment,
the philosophes of the 18th century? Did it stop the industrial age, the
discoveries of the 19th century? Did that stop Pasteur? Did it stop Claude
Bernard, or - closer to us - the Curies or the Duc de Broglie?'
But aren't things different now? Perhaps French is becoming fossilised . . .
'Fossilised?' Druon stared with disbelief. 'Fossilised? When in the first
volume of our dictionary we have 5,000 new words? In the former edition, of
1935, there were about 35,000 words. Our new edition (it has reached the
word 'enzyme') will have at least 50,000 words, probably more - that is,
15,000 accepted new ones.'
He got up and walked about. 'Do you play golf?' he said. I said No. 'When
people propose oiselet for 'birdie' or, I don't know, obstacle de sable for
'bunker' I raise my shoulders and I say 'Let the expression pass] Foutez-moi
la paix]' Because golf terms are English and we have adopted them.'
The academy had even accepted anglicisms such as 'tennis' which derived from
the French - as in tenez]
To recognise words for which there is no substitute is one thing, I
persisted. To legislate for the control of language seems to me quite
another, extraordinary thing.
'Sir. You have been informed by the French press, which is very badly
informed.' He gave his wheezy, smoker's laugh. 'It's not a law on the French
language, it's a law on the obligation of using French in various areas.'
Yet if it suits a firm to use English internally and that facilitates
business, why not?
'Why use a foreign language if the user is not an English speaker?' In some
cases, he added, it could even be dangerous - if, for example, technical
instruction manuals were not in French.
I agreed. But there was a time, I said, when the whole of Europe used Latin
for certain purposes. Today we clearly need a lingua franca and . . .
'But exactly] You have the French language]' He was triumphant.
Isn't English the lingua franca now?
'Listen. There we are going to have a difference of opinion. For one thing,
the English language is no longer what it was. What is sprayed all over the
world is not really English. It's American. It's not the English tongue,
it's a dollar tongue.'
But the Latin spoken all over Europe was dog Latin, not the Latin of Tacitus
or Cicero.
'Certainly. That's why it has been replaced by the French]'
If this bastard English is useful, why should we not speak it where it's
appropriate?
'Where is this notion of useful? It's useful in commerce, in advertising,
useful in money. It is not useful for the mind.'
The academy has about 40 members - usually septuagenarians - of whom Maurice
Druon, of course, is one. (There are also two women now). I stuck out my
neck.
Why should the language of the majority, I asked, be determined by the
sentiment of an old minority?
'It's not an old minority. It's an old majority.'
But why should they have this power?
'Sir. Words are a means of exchange. That's a currency, and bad currency . .
. comment dire, chasse . . . drives out, the good. We are trying to keep a
good currency. That's why we accept a lot of new words if they are in common
usage. Don't think we are the enemy of English . . .'
I read that people refuse to employ the gallicisms that have been created
for them. Why not let the market decide what is most appropriate?
'If you let in the market, you let in the jungle.'
Can you resist the market in this age?
'Bien sur. Bien sur. One can dissuade. Monsieur, we are there to give the
sense of sin. Commit it by all means, but know that you are committing a
sin.'
Isn't that bad law, like the law against smoking in bars, which I hear is
widely disregarded?
'Listen. I am smoker, but this is another matter. It goes much further. The
language of a people is its soul. If you love your country, you must love
your language. It is the fundamental intellectual patrimony. It is what
determines, to a large extent, your identity. And as perpetual secretary of
the Academie Francaise, it is I who am in the vanguard.'
But, of necessity, behind the rest of the country?
'Mais, No]'
I compared the Academie Francaise with the Vatican, and Druon talked of the
four great institutions of Europe before the first world war. The one that
had not survived, he said, was the general staff of the German army. I did
not understand the French phrase so the academicien went to the bookshelf
and plucked out Harrap's dictionary, screwing a monocle into his eye to read
the entry for me.
As a writer (he told me he had sold 11m copies of his books in Russia alone)
Druon is concerned not just with words, but with syntax. And the
Anglo-Saxons, he said, were losing control of their syntax.
Do you mean that thought itself suffers when syntax goes?
'Yes. Ah, yes.'
And political ideas will become more banal?
'The political question is the ability of the new generations to construct
and express their thought in proper sentences.' The importance of the
message impelled him back into French: 'You cannot dissociate words from
thoughts. And it's to preserve this quality of the formation of ideas that
we conserve French, a language which is analytic, precise and clear. We
don't want it to lose its clarity.
'If we get to the point of using false English words in French, that is the
height of degradation. Another idea: it is not good for the world, for
humanity, to have only one language, because that language will not keep
itself pure.'
Isn't that to overstate what's happening?
'Wait. A sole language, a uniformity, a pidgin angloricain spreading over
the planet. It's very bad. We need different languages. If there is no
difference there is no melange or confrontation of cultures. New ideas will
not be born.'
Can we not have horizontal boundaries between languages - the peasant
speaking his patois, the bourgeois his demotic, the international civil
servant speaking English? 'I'm no more in agreement with you. The human
spirit must have a language that transcends all levels and specialities.
'Look, I'm an old Anglophile. I should not want English and French to be
enemies, but allies. Because they are both carriers by nature of the values
of liberty and dignity. So we needn't deprive ourselves of either.'
Most countries, I said, manage without linguistic laws and academies. What
makes France so different?
'Ah, ca] Perhaps because we are the oldest nation in the world with the
sentiment of nationhood. Also because the instrument we have forged, the
linguistic instrument, became the lingua franca of the 18th and 19th
centuries. All the countries of Europe, Great Britain excepted, were
intellectual provinces of France. But this is because of the quality of our
language.'
I tried one last shot: it has fewer words, I believe.
'Dare I say, you have less syntax. And besides - I don't want to be
disagreeable - if English has had some success it is because it is the
easiest language to speak badly.' He gave another wheezy chuckle.
That, perhaps, is its great advantage, I said. But you say English, too,
needs preserving?
'Yes.'
What shall we lose if we don't create an academie anglaise? The power of
literary expression?
'No, your soul.'
The perpetual secretary laughed. There was no reply.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Deadly rattle of skeletons: Dominic Lawson ponders the ugly
question of wartime collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all have skeletons in our closet. In the case of the people of France,
there are 75,000 of them. That is the estimated number of French Jews
rounded up and sent by their Government to be murdered in Nazi concentration
camps. At least seven more French Jews met a different fate. They are the
people for whose execution Pierre Touvier is now on trial at Versailles.
'Crimes against humanity' is on the charge sheet, and the 78-year-old former
intelligence chief of the Milice, the Vichy regime's pro-Nazi paramilitary
force, is the first Frenchman to be so charged.
You might wonder, as I do, why Touvier is the only Frenchman against whom
such a charge could be levelled.
You might also wonder why Touvier has had to wait 50 years for his trial.
The answer is that he was sheltered throughout the intervening years by
various outposts of the Roman Catholic Church in France - a skeleton in the
cloister, if ever there was one. But the people of France do not, for
understandable reasons, like to dwell on such embarrassing memories. Instead
they prefer to carry on preparing their celebrations for the 50th
anniversary of D-Day in June, and in particular, snub the Germans by not
inviting them to the party.
Last week the mayor of Caen, who had broken ranks by inviting Helmut Kohl,
the German chancellor, to their local celebration of the great Day, was
ordered by Paris to withdraw the invitation.
The resulting spat in the Franco-German relationship fills us in England
with feelings of deep satisfaction.
We have no skeletons in our closet, unless you are going to be fussy and
dredge up the fire-bombing of Dresden. We, thanks principally to Hitler's
decision to open a second front against the Soviet Union, never had to face
outright German invasion. Doubtless, if we had, we would have fought them on
the beaches. I cannot imagine that a British Government would have handed
London over to the enemy, without a shot being fired, in the way the French
did Paris.
But if we had been overrun by the Nazis, would we then have been ruled by an
assiduously collaborationist regime, along Vichy lines? Would we, in other
words, have had our own Touviers? It is interesting how quickly you can
reduce a civilised London dinner party to shouting and walk-outs by
suggesting that this is what would have happened in Britain. I remember my
maternal grandmother, a member of a prominent Jewish family - it owned the J
Lyons food catering business - intimating to me that they would have made
their own cyanide pills to take when the knock on the door came.
I do not think that this was such a lamentable lack of confidence in the
moral strength of the British people: just the same sort of practical
realism that had enabled them to build a great business from street barrows.
Discussions - or rather, ferocious arguments - about what would have
happened to British Jews, usually disintegrate into competing hypotheses.
But, there is no need for that.
Last year, under the 50-year rule, documents were released which showed how
occupied Guernsey collaborated with the Nazi invader's solution to the
Jewish problem. The papers charted British officials' collusion in
identifying three Jewesses who were subsequently deported and perished in
Auschwitz. Last week it was the turn of the Jersey archives to be released.
Most of the papers relating to the period of occupation had been
mysteriously stolen. But those that remained paint a depressingly familiar
pattern, with officials assisting their German governors with the
identification of the Jewish population.
One document, from a British company, reports that: 'As far as the Channel
Islands are concerned, I can definitely state that no Jew, male or female,
is employed by the company, nor had any Jew been so employed since the
Jersey branch was opened.'
Perhaps the company was simply trying to protect its Jewish employees. What
would you have done?

FT  19 MAR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Back to save us
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dead Hollywood stars will return from the grave if developments in
re-animation technology bear fruit. According to a recent news story: 'Using
raw data culled from old films and the latest digital computer animation,
Hollywood scientists are perfecting (techniques) to create synthetic actors
who look, sound and move just like the real thing.'
Quite soon, celluloid legends such as Vivien Leigh and James Dean could be
starring in new films, alongside living actors. 'The era may be approaching
when old actors neither fade away nor die,' said the news story, 'but star
time and time again, long after their mortal remains have turned to dust.
Instead of appearing in person at the Oscar ceremonies, they could send
along computer images to weep and thank and celebrate. No one would know the
difference.'
One of the names by which the new technique is known is Live-Synchro.
Live-Synchro featured in Hawks &amp; Handsaws two years ago, in a column which
also anticipated the debut of 'animatronic actors - humanoids, robots - who
will play any role, from buffoon to sex siren, at a millifraction of the
(normal) fee.'
Anticipated is a bit cheeky; all I was really doing was showing that I
possessed a much-thumbed copy of July 20, 2019: Life in the 21st Century, by
Arthur C. Clarke, the famous science fiction writer.
What no one yet knows is that these techniques, Live-Synchro and
animatronics, work in reverse.
I discovered this on Wednesday when summoned to 10 Downing Street for a
late-night interview with John Major, the prime minister of Britain. I
hurried there speedily. Soon I was enjoying, together with the prime
minister, a splendid supper of bacon, eggs, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms
and baked beans.
An aide had explained that I am now the only journalist Major will see, so I
started off politely, biding my time.
'Economy recovering nicely, John, give or take a sixmonth?'
'Indeed it is, Michael. It is recovering really nicely, given that my
administration has worked jolly hard to achieve the conditions requisite to
sustainable long-term growth free of the harrowing bug-bear of rampant
inflation.'
'Trade rows under control?'
'Trade rows under control.'
'Ditto Tory sex scandals?'
'Ditto Tory sex scandals.'
It was time to raise the tempo.
'I am surprised, John,' I said, 'that you haven't gone screaming mad, or
tried to harm yourself, given the ferocity of the criticism heaped upon you.
Not this century has the leader of a democracy been vilified as you have.
Yet you just keep smiling. The latest organisation to demonise you is
Amnesty International, which excoriates you for selling 40 Hawk military
jets to Indonesia.
''For God's sake,' says Amnesty, 'what kind of morality is it where sleeping
with an actress can get a minister hounded from office, but it's OK to sell
lethal weapons without legal guarantees that they won't be used to kill
innocent people.'
'How do you handle that, John? How do you keep your sanity? It is almost as
though' - I speared a reluctant sausage - 'you were programmed, somehow . .
. as though you were an image from the middle of the next century sent to
serve as a lightning conductor for all our troubles and pain.'
'Later,' said Major.
'Pardon?'
'2082. It's called Reverse Live-Synchro, or RL-S. I am indeed a projection.
In real life, I am a low-ranking official in the fisheries ministry of the
government of Eurasia from 2082. I am Norwegian, as it happens. Married, two
children. Rather good at golf. Thanks to RL-S, I have been projected
backwards in time to act, as you put it, like a lightning conductor: to head
off the catastrophe facing Britain - invasion by Malaysia.
'That is scheduled to happen in four years' time. I am here to stop it. The
downfall of Margaret Thatcher was a technological feat engineered by our
scientists. I was sent as replacement. My supreme incompetence is a clever
Eurasian smokescreen. I am so incompetent that the Malaysians will take pity
on us and cancel the invasion. At least, that's the hope.'
'I am flabbergasted,' I said. 'Why have you never told us that you are a
synchroton sent to save us?'
'Because,' beamed the image, 'no one's ever asked.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Truth of the Matter: Fleet Street's back to basics - Good
old British hypocrisy over sex has returned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh lord,' sighed the young minister as he scanned the headlines in the
tabloids: 'I suppose one of these days I will have to confess I lost my
virginity to a married woman'.
Yes, it has been another of those weeks. Another establishment sex scandal
and another resignation.
The News of the World, a Sunday tabloid newspaper, started the moral
witchhunt with its disclosures three months ago that a middle-ranking
minister had fathered an illegitimate child. This week it claimed a bigger
scalp - that of armed forces chief of staff and marshal of the Royal Air
Force Sir Peter Harding.
In between there has been a spate of these so-called scandals. As media
lights have been shone into dark corners of the private lives of the
prominent, the results have frequently been farcical. One Tory MP was
obliged to confess publicly he had shared a French hotel bed with a male
friend - for no other reason than to save a few francs.
But there has also been a more unsettling dimension. The revelations have
not been confined to what was once seen as the grubbier end of the tabloid
press. The so-called quality papers and the electronic media have picked up
the same stories with gusto. Prurience and the public interest have often
been treated as inseparable.
For those of you who have spent the week on a saner planet, Sir Peter's
misdemeanour was straightforward. A married man, he fell for an
excitingly-dressed woman by the name of Miss Bienvenida Perez-Blanco.
She now calls herself Lady Buck, a title bestowed through her brief marriage
to the former Tory MP Sir Anthony Buck. Not much is worth saying about Lady
Buck save that she claims to be of Spanish extraction, is in her middle 30s,
dresses as if she is 20 years younger and has a penchant for influential men
30 years older.
But Sir Peter fell for her. She took her story and his intimate love letters
to the Sunday newspaper, which added a 'security' dimension to justify the
invasion into his private life. She pocketed the money. He resigned.
That, you might say, should be the end of it. But it will not be.
Newspapers, battered by recession and a secular decline in readership, will
not to let this one go.
Sex sells newspapers. Sex in high places sells even more. When there is no
alleged security angle, John Major's ill-fated back-to-basics initiative
provides sufficient cover.
Ministers insist children in the classroom are taught the difference between
right and wrong. So the media reserves a right to highlight occasions when
the politicians are not so discerning.
But there has been another big change. Previously, the broadsheet press
would have ignored most of the recent scandals. The Daily Telegraph would
have tucked the odd piece on page three alongside reports of the more lurid
cases before the courts. The Times would have remained aloof. The Guardian
would have slipped in the odd detail through an account of what the tabloids
were up to. Now the broadsheets vie with the rest.
The Telegraph, for example, began this week with colour photographs of Sir
Peter and his paramour on the front page. An editorial condemning the
revelations as 'gutter journalism at its rankest' looked misplaced.
Nor is television and radio news immune. Where once the bulletins would
report such incidents only if and when someone resigned, they now take their
lead from the tabloids. Prophecies of resignations and assertions of public
interest become self-fulfilling.
But something else is going on. This is more than a bout of mid-winter
madness fuelled by shrewd commercial judgment. Politicians and generals have
been having affairs since time immemorial. When an MP died suddenly a few
years ago in the arms of his mistress not a word of the circumstances
appeared in print.
The opinion polls tell us that the moral puritanism of 'back to basics' has
caught a popular mood. The marketing men are equally certain that the public
appetite for salacious stories, and contempt for the establishment, has
never been greater.
The two are reconciled only with one rather sad explanation. The British
penchant for hypocrisy has returned with a vengeance.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: Greedy for antiquities - Antony Thorncroft discusses
the need for the treasure trove bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some time, around 200 BC on Salisbury Plain, a local Celt buried over 400 of
his most precious objects. They consisted of shields, axes and daggers, but
probably had a religious rather than a military significance. For many of
the pieces were ancient to him, dating back to 1800 BC, and too tiny and
brittle for warfare.
In 1985 some metal detector enthusiasts came across the hoard. If they had
acted legally and gone to the local landowner, they would have become rich
and the nation would have gained access to an archaeological site of great
importance, perhaps a temple which held our ancestors in thrall for over a
millennium.
Instead they photographed the objects and went to the dealers in
antiquities. And once more the the nation's feeble attempts to conserve its
past was in jeopardy. Now some of the objects are in the US and Japan; some
have disappeared; many, fortunately, are in the British Museum; and the
police are conducting an investigation into the affair.
This find was so important that it was almost certain to attract attention.
In this case a reputable dealer, Lord McAlpine, sold some of the objects to
the British Museum for Pounds 55,000. The tiny shields aroused interest and,
as more came to light, the Museum made contact with the original finders,
saw the photographs, and realised the importance of the discovery.
There is still much to sort out, but if the standard procedures had been
followed, and the cache reported to the British Museum, the metal detector
enthusiasts - and the landowner - would have shared a substantial sum.
Instead, it was the dealers who did well out of the find.
A new treasure bill, put forward by the British Museum and the Surrey
Archaeological Society, has now started its laborious progress towards the
statute books - and about time, too. The law of treasure trove, dating back
to the Middle Ages and created to ensure that the monarch grabbed any hidden
gold and silver, bore no relation to modern reality and gave limited
incentive to finders of hidden treasures to declare them. The British Museum
reckons that hundreds of thousands of objects are discovered each year, but
no more than 20 or 30 finds are declared treasure trove and channelled
towards a museum.
Over the years the losses have been tragic. In 1990 a hoard of Iron Age
torcs, bracelets and ingots was discovered at Snettisham in Norfolk, but
because some of the objects were 50 per cent or more base metal only a few
of higher purity qualified as treasure trove and were kept together.
In 1986, the Middleham Jewel, a late 15th century reliquary, unearthed in a
field in Yorkshire, was sold at Sotheby's for Pounds 1.43m because it could
not be proved that it had been hidden by its original owner, which would
have made it treasure trove, rather than lost. Fortunately it was acquired
by the Yorkshire Museum. In law even the Sutton Hoo burial ship, the
greatest ever Anglo Saxon find, was not treasure trove, and only the
generosity of the landowner enabled it to end up in the British Museum.
It is the same with the Salisbury Plain discovery: it contains no objects of
gold and silver and is not covered by either old treasure trove - or the new
treasure bill, although this does contain a clause leaving open the
opportunity to extend its scope. This is one reason why the Department of
National Heritage was suspicious of the bill and wanted to substitute its
own measure - in time. If it became too comprehensive it would involve the
recording of every find, at considerable cost in staff and resources. But
this week the government acknowledged the importance of the issue and seemed
set to back some form of legislation.
Under the new law proposed by the BM it would no longer be necessary to
establish the original owners intentions, and objects other than gold and
silver will be be given more protection. There will also be a tightening of
the legal process in the reporting of finds. But while there are treasure
seekers, with detectors, supplying some unscrupulous dealers, the nation's
heritage will be still be pillaged.
Attention must be focused on dealers, and the auction houses, which have
been accused of offering antiquities for sale without adequately researching
their provenance. The auction houses say the problem is much exaggerated and
and that photographs in their catalogues can lead to the uncovering of
stolen antiquities.
Joe Och, of Sotheby's, sits in the treasure trove reviewing committee which
values finds legally reported, and believes that 'this is an emotional
subject, like fur coats. We operate a free system in the UK which offers
rewards rather than penalties.' Undoubtedly more finds are reported in the
UK than in most European countries. In Italy, Greece, and Turkey,
prohibitive restrictions on the ownership of recovered objects ensures that
most finds are sold illegally.
Important objects, turning up out of the blue, attract attention. When some
distinctive Roman bronzes, discovered and spirited away from a farm at
Icklingham in Suffolk, surfaced in New York, the landowner forced the new
owner to promise to leave them to the British Museum in his will,
guaranteeing some belated justice.
There is also Lord Northampton, who paid a group of dealers millions for the
Sevso treasure, the finest hoard of late classical silver ever to surface.
When he tried to sell it through Sotheby's in 1990 for at least Pounds 40m,
Croatia, Hungary and Lebanon all claimed it had been dug up on their land
and belonged to them. Lord Northampton won the legal wrangle in New York but
there has been an appeal and the silver still languishes in a bank vault.
Such examples, and the sensibly modest improvements contained in the
treasure bill, could help return antiquities to the antiquarians and the
archaeologists and remove them from the grasp of opportunists.

If you are among the 17,000 readers who applied for Pounds 10 tickets for a
night at Covent Garden in the FT's promotion last autumn - do not fret if
you still await the call. The Royal Opera House is confident that everyone
will get to see a performance this season.
Katya Kabanova, which recently opened to excellent reviews, should absorb
some of the demand, along with long runs of Carmen (although not with
Domingo) and Figaro. Readers will be pleasantly surprised if they take up
tickets to see Harrison Birtwistle's Gawain.
In dance there is the stylish Don Quixote to come, as well as a Triple Bill,
before the Royal Ballet goes on tour. Birmingham Royal Ballet comes down to
fill the gap with its romantic new production Sylvia and its Triple Bill.
Covent Garden is adding a third telephone line in the hope of giving readers
a week's notice of their proffered production.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: Reputations reassessed - William Packer admires the
work of neglected British painters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the modern emphasis on youth that we are inclined to forget that
talent is not its sole preserve. Too often, it takes a death to remind us
just what commitment, experience, gifts and achievement may lie buried in a
long and quiet career.
Patrick Symons, in Paris last autumn to see the Barnes Collection, stepped
carelessly under a bus and was killed. He was 68. Although by then RA, he
was hardly widely known. There had been no retrospective at a great public
gallery, no tours abroad and but four solo shows in dealers' galleries in
more than 30 years. Yet among his peers his reputation stood high for the
steadiness and integrity of what he did. He had taught over many years,
first at Camberwell where he had studied, and then at Chelsea. In his quiet
and modest way, he had been an influence.
To look now at his work in its slow and steady development over some 50
years - at the still-lifes, the interiors, the musicians engrossed in
present activity, above all at the densely wooded landscapes that were his
special subject - is to recognise painting of an order rare enough in his
day, and getting rarer every year. To speak of it as modest is to risk that
very English vice of understatement. The truth is that its proper modesty,
its unaffected, unselfconscious engagement with the work itself, is its
greatest strength. For here are no histrionics, no showings-off and, no less
important, no shallow sentimentality. Here, rather, is something educated,
committed and complete.
It is painting founded in the true academic disciplines of observation,
analysis and technical probity. In our wisdom we no longer pass on such
things to younger artists, yet here, safe with a surprising number of their
seniors, the tradition is not yet dead. We should celebrate it while we may,
for it is to be found nowhere else. In any other country, Symons would have
been a star.
Ruskin Spear, also RA, died in 1990 at he age of 79. His too was a painters'
painter reputation, his gifts masked by a conspicuous facility and a career
committed to the art school studio rather than his own. He taught at the
Royal College from the 1940s to the 1970s and it is now clear that his was a
formative influence upon the Kitchen Sink painters of the 1950s, and the
subsequent emergence of Pop Art in its British manifestation.
It is the fate of the great teacher to see his pupils' often lesser talents
flourish before his own, and Spear was never acknowledged as he deserved. He
was never taken seriously because he seemed never to take himself seriously.
It was all very well for a Hockney or a Blake to enjoy himself with pin ups,
post-cards, shop-fronts, but that was youthful exuberance. For Spear to work
from newspaper photographs, as Sickert had before him, was quite another
thing.
But how well they last, these extravagant, wry, funny images of daily life:
Mrs Thatcher as the bluest rinse of all; the fashion model's teetering walk
and scarlet mouth. Above all, what good paintings they are, seen now in the
broader working context of pub interiors, market stalls and Hammersmith
streets, as lovingly understood and knowingly painted as by any artist of
our time. As a painter of daily life, Spear stood alone.
Roland Collins, in his 70s, is still with us. He is a topographical artist
of a generation later than that of Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden, yet his
work at its best stands direct comparison with theirs. His large gouaches
and water-colours take us to Dieppe and Brighton, along the watering places
of the Kent and Sussex coasts, and so back to London and, in a particularly
splendid sequence of images, to the mews and backstreets of Belgravia in the
1950s.
Patrick Symons: Browse &amp; Darby, 19 Cork Street W1, until April 16. Ruskin
Spear: Crane Kalman Gallery, 178 Brompton Road SW3, until April 16. Roland
Collins: Michael Parkin Gallery, 11 Motcomb Street SW1, until April 15.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: The Pinter spell is cast again / Review of 'The
Birthday Party'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the many and haunting ambiguities of Harold Pinter's plays is this
uncertainty: how real are these characters? The dream-logic (or
nightmare-logic) with which they converse (or fail to converse) has long
been famous, but as we watch a Pinter play we start to be unsure about
whether they themselves are meant to be naturalistic or not.
Realistic figures suddenly appear surreal. Ordinary people turn, for a
while, into caricatures, and then back again. They may well undergo more
than one such change. Watching them, we never know for long where we are;
and that is part of Pinter's spell.
Watching Dora Bryan in the National Theatre's new staging of The Birthday
Party - a brilliant piece of casting - we constantly shift in our take on
Meg, the married landlady she plays, and thereby also in our take on the
whole household she runs. Bryan has been famous, for decades now, for
investing silly provincial working-class female characters with a certain
cartoon-like brightness. She brings to them her own funny energy and quavery
nervousness, and makes them as memorable as characters in Dickens. What is
marvellous in her Meg is that the play makes you sense strange and dark
causes for her customary fretfulness, fussiness, and stupidity. Even her
brightness starts to register as a kind of escapism.
And yet she is still funny. Petey, her husband, explains to her that the
show currently at the Palace has no music or dancing. 'What do they do
then?' she asks in the manner of one who is just learning that there is no
Santa Claus. 'They just talk,' he replies. Bryan, registering this
information, observes a properly Pinteresque pause. Then she just says 'Oh.'
Her eyes (downcast but wide with alarm), mouth (sinking), and voice
(tremulous) all convey the same uncomprehending distaste; and the audience
guffaws.
We laugh partly because Pinter is joking at the expense of his own kind of
theatre, of course, but also because of how the single word 'Oh' sums up
Meg's narrow mind. A show without singing or dancing belongs to that part of
the world - like the mysterious wheelbarrow of which she is terrified -
which she chooses to avoid.
Meg's little fears are just part of The Birthday Party's strange fabric of
menace and terror and evasion. She insists that it is the birthday of her
lodger Stanley, though he insists it is not. She throws a party for him,
though he spends most of it in blank non-participation. Later she says it
was a lovely party, though during it he physically threatened both her and
the play's other female character, Lulu. He in turn is threatened, and
finally abducted, by two strange visitors, Goldberg and McCann (both of whom
have their own fits of fright). Sam Mendes, directing, heightens Stanley's
occasional violence to women; and he makes Lulu the kind of cartoon bimbo
blonde we encounter in Dennis Potter's fictions, with breasts pulled up so
high by her bra that they point upwards like telescopes.
Mendes has assembled all the ingredients for a first-class staging, not all
of which had coalesced on the first night. Anton Lesser traces all the
various moods of Stanley - the play's principal victim - with convincing
skill, but makes an altogether less forceful impression than Bryan. As
Goldberg, the play's most menacing figure, Bob Peck certainly has force; he
neatly conveys the character's elements of suave deceit; and, after cuddling
the buxom Lulu on his lap a while, he adds a hilarious touch of
embarrassment, getting her to get up and crossing his legs. But his manner
is too elaborate; his is an unrelaxed performance that keeps signalling its
every effect to us.
Trevor Peacock (Petey) and Nicholas Woodeson (McCann) are both impeccable,
and Woodeson's grasp of the play's fluctuations of threat and alarm is very
fine. Emma Amos gives Lulu a nicely bizarre comic brightness to match
Bryan's Meg. (They both remind us how close Pinter can sometimes seem to Joe
Orton.) Tom Piper's designs not only create an effectively realistic 1950s
interior, but also introduce it with a drop-curtain of this town's sandy
seaside beach (where Petey works) and frames this particular house against a
background of other identical houses. This is just one house among many. Is
this house normal or abnormal? Who is to say what goes on in the others?
In repertory at the Lyttelton Theatre.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's most famous dancer / Review of Baryshnikov's
White Oak Project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN ACOCELLA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After four years and ten tours, Mikhail Baryshnikov's modern dance troupe,
the White Oak Dance Project, finally opened in New York last week. Why had
Baryshnikov avoided New York for so long? Was it - as certain New York
reviewers asked with obvious satisfaction - because of the New York
reviewers? Maybe a little. Baryshnikov's nine controversial years as
director of American Ballet Theater (1980-89) did not leave him with tender
feelings either toward large dance companies or toward the New York dance
world, with its 'politics and policies,' as he put it darkly in a recent
interview with The New York Times.
When, after leaving ABT, he founded White Oak, he said that this troupe
would be 'for fun.' He wanted to experiment, in a relaxed atmosphere. That
is why he hired older dancers. (The company's age range is 31 to 46: no
teenagers, no hysteria.) And that, no doubt, is why he did did not rush to
arrange a New York season, which, for almost any company, is a tense,
over-advertised, over-analysed, money-losing business.
About money, he need not have worried. Baryshnikov is still the world's most
famous dancer, and he performs at every White Oak show. Given that fact,
White Oak normally sells out any theatre it enters. New York State Theater
was no exception. When Baryshnikov stepped onstage on opening night, so many
flashbulbs went off that it looked as though someone had turned on a strobe
light. (Later performances began with a stern announcement forbidding
cameras.) New York may be a tough town but it still loves a star.
This very fact - that Baryshnikov alone sells tickets - has led some writers
to ask where White Oak would be without him. But such questioning implies
that all Baryshnikov does at White Oak is dance, which is not the case. It
was he who selected this largely excellent company; he also chose, and pays
for, the superb six-person musical ensemble, headed by Michael Boriskin,
that accompanies the troupe's performances. (Live music is now a rarity at
American modern dance performances.) Finally, Baryshnikov is the one who put
together White Oak's repertory, and it is stamped all over with his ideas,
his history.
Baryshnikov defected from the Soviet Union in 1974 because he wanted to
dance new roles, not just Swan Lake and Giselle. But in fact he spent most
of his early years in the West performing the 'classics', for that is what
audiences wanted to see him in. Twyla Tharp created a number of brilliant
jazz-based dances for him, and he put in guest appearances with various
modern dance companies. Still, he had a hard time breaking out of the
'prince' track, and this left him with an extreme reverence for American
modern dance. He has made White Oak's recent repertory a showcase for that
tradition, with works by Graham, Hanya Holm, Jane Dudley, Paul Taylor, David
Gordon, Meredith Monk. In the process, he has saved some lovely pieces, such
as Holm's Jocose from oblivion.
For the New York season he added a Merce Cunningham piece, the 1970 Signals.
Signals looks vaguely like a weekend party. People are lounging around in
chairs. One by one, they come forward to dance introspective solos and
duets; then they return to the group. It is as if we were seeing their
public lives upstage, their private lives down-stage.
In White Oak's hands, Signals did not have quite the same high-ozone purity
as when it is danced by its home troupe, but that is always the case when a
Cunningham piece is set on another company, and the lyric power of White
Oak's rendition is a testament to the strength of Cunningham's work.
But Baryshnikov does not just restage modern dance; he commissions it. His
success is this department is mixed. New to the repertory this season were
works by two young choreographers. Kevin O'Day, a White Oak dancer,
presented the sweet-tempered and well-made Quartet for IV, to music by Kevin
Volans; and Joachim Schlomer, director of Germany's Ulm Ballet, contributed
Behind White Lilies, an agonisingly boring work in which, to judge from
their stabbing, palsied movements, the six-person cast underwent some
extreme hardship (the decline of the West? the crisis of modern belief?) to
the accompaniment of Schonberg's String Trio.
The most important commission of the season, however, was Jerome Robbins's
Suite of Dances, a solo for Baryshnikov to four movements from Bach's Suite
for Solo Cello (played onstage by Wendy Sutter), and this was a real little
beauty. Like much of Robbins's work, it is about the relations between
'natural' movement and dance movement, but in the relations that Robbins
creates going, for example, from what looks like any old hop to a pas de
chat to a stag leap to a grand jete - we seem to see ballet flowering,
before our eyes, for the first time.
This illusion is abetted, needless to say, by the fact that the dancer is
Baryshnikov. At 46 he still has a thousand steps, and a line so beautiful
that it brings tears to your eyes. But what this dance showcased was his
musical imagination, the sheer breadth of his response to music - comic,
tragic, puckish, misterioso - and his ability, through steps in time, to
conjure those states into being.
This was not a solo; it was a duet, for Baryshnikov and JS Bach, staged by a
third master, Robbins. If Baryshnikov's fame is what sells tickets to White
Oak, the tickets are worth every penny.
The forthcoming White Oak tour includes Italy (Milan, April 13-21; Reggio
Emilia, April 23; Florence, April 28); then, from May through July, the US
and Canada (Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Chicago, Vancouver, and other
cities).

FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: Choreographer to the great - The elegance and passion
of Roland Petit's latest work show him as dazzlingly a man of the theatre as
ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roland Petit celebrated his 70th birthday in January. Impossible, of course:
the reference books lie, for this spirit of French ballet, French theatre,
remains what he has always been, a creator (and an interpreter) of
prodigious vitality, wit, and dramatic flair. And as if to prove it, Petit
last week produced three new works for the Paris Opera Ballet, their
elegance and passion showing him as dazzlingly a man of the theatre as ever.
It is the sheer craft, the mastery of means, that alone tell Petit's age and
experience: no young choreographer today could be as daring, and tread the
creative high wire with such aplomb.
It is fitting that Petit should mark this anniversary in the Palais Garnier,
in which he grew up as pupil and apprentice dancer. He was, and he remains,
the very essence of Parisian theatre. By 1945 he had fled its musty
confines, had made his first creations, and had gained the friendship and
support of some of the most significant artistic figures in Paris - Kochno,
Berard, Cocteau, Laurencin. His ballets of that period - Les Forains with
its troupe of strolling players, its insidious Sauguet score, its miraculous
design by Berard of a cart and a piece of red cloth; Le Jeune Homme et la
mort, where death comes to a youth in a garret, beneath the flash of the
Citroen sign - remain among the truest examples of French culture as the war
years gave way to a renaissance of theatre, fashion, art, which Petit's
ballets typified.
Petit has always been an admirable indicator of the newest ideas; has
joyously explored ballet, theatre, cinema, music hall, often with his wife
and muse, Zizi Jeanmaire; and has in everything been stylish, vivid, and -
rarest virtue - totally unpompous. His eye for design is unrivalled in the
history of ballet, whence the fact that Picasso and Dior, Max Ernst, David
Hockney, Paul Delvaux, Antoni Clave, Yves Saint Laurent, de Chirico,
Tinguely, Erte and the graffiti artist Keith Haring, are among those who
have decorated his productions.
His sense of occasion, his ability to frame and enhance a dancer, have led
to creations that have been worthy of Fonteyn, exquisite as the cat heroine
of Les Demoiselles de la nuit; of Baryshnikov, as Herman in Queen of Spades;
of Makarova, as The Blue Angel; of Plisetskaya in La Rose malade; of Peter
Schaufuss as the Phantom of the Opera. His stagings for Jeanmaire have taken
audiences from ballet (Zizi as the first, the only Carmen) to cinema (Zizi
and Bing Crosby in Anything Goes), and music hall (Zizi, positively
Zizissima, surrounded by ses boys, a mass of feathers, and those miraculous
legs set to conquer the world). And there has been Petit as director for the
past two decades of the fine Ballet de Marseille, for which he has made an
astonishing variety of work.
For Petit is a consummate man of the theatre. He has been, and remains, a
dance-actor of tremendous allure. He has made memorably good full-length
ballets: Cyrano dazzled by its economy and imaginative wit; Les
Intermittence du coeur was a poetically sensitive exploration of Proust's
world; Notre Dame de Paris and The Phantom of the Opera were hymns to his
native city as well as skilful adaptations of two popular novels. He has
re-made, gracefully, ballets' classics - a joyous Coppelia, an unfailingly
happy Nutcracker. He has even published a volume of memoirs, J'ai danse sur
les flots, which is a series of lightning sketches of his work and friends,
and like his choreography and his dancing, blazes with life.
The life-force is strong in the three new pieces he has made for the Opera
Ballet. The thread on which they hang is scores by composers of the second
Viennese school. The opening Passacaille uses Webern's opus 5 orchestral
suite and the opus 1 Passacaglia. The choreography is plotless, the stage
bare, the forces are a central couple - Agnes Letestu and Jose Martinez -
with an attendant group of six couples. Costuming, by Herve Leger, offers
white, exiguous tops and skirts or briefs, the women crowned with
Nefertiti-like caps. The image is of the Pharoahs on the beach at Cannes,
and is ineffably stylish. And so is the dance, which looks hieratic,
off-beat, and is stunningly done.
There follows Rythme de valses, with a chamber group at the back of the
stage playing the Strauss waltzes that Berg, Webern and Schoenberg
orchestrated for a musical evening. Three couples are each occupied with
their own number, then united for the closing Emperor Waltz. The girls
appear wearing Leger's ballooning skirts, then step out of them to dance in
striped leotards. Their partners are in vestigial Hussar outfits. We are, we
may suppose, to see the skeleton of the waltz itself. Not even that] With
what I salute as his conjuring tricks, Petit makes each couple do everything
except waltz. They make jokes, hint at mad steps, stretch, strut, embroider
movement ideas and, yes, they are inhabited by the insidious onward pulse of
the waltz itself.
The piece is a capriccio by a master, most successful, I think, in the
opening waltz which is done with adorable and youthful ease by Aurelie
Dupont and Eric Quillere. Mlle Dupont is beautiful, entrancingly cool;
Quillere is ardent, brilliant. The other couples (Carole Arbo and Lionel
Delanoe; Fanny Gaida and Wilfried Romoli) are no less feat, though the cream
of the ballet lies in its first section, where Petit states his cunning
choreographic thesis.
Petit's dramatic taste has often seemed haunted by death, and never more
violently or more frankly so than in the Camera Obscura which closes the
bill. This is a trio whose emotional situation was sparked off by Nabokov's
novel, Laughter in the dark. Petit subtitles it Love is blind, and the love
of the wealthy Albinus (Patrick Dupond) for a sluttish cinema usherette,
Margot (Marie Claude Pietragalla), is blind in its obsession, as in the fact
that he is deprived of sight after a car accident. Albinus becomes aware of
Margot's passion for the young Rex (Nicolas Le Riche). He seeks to shoot
him, but is, instead, shot by Margot.
It is not this grubby narrative that occupies Petit, but its inner world of
sexual obsession. To convey it, the choreography becomes more frank, more
greedily sensual, than anything I have seen from him before, the dramatic
scheme more allusive and more potent. The score, assembled from Schoenberg
piano works, is ideally resonant. Performances, like the feelings they
convey, are incandescent: Pietragalla, presented as irresistible flesh, is
superb. Dupond catches all Albinus' sexual hunger; Le Riche admirably shows
Rex's luscious physical allure as well as his miserable lack of courage.
Once again, Petit has illuminated the gifts of exceptional dancers. Once
again, with Bernard Michel's light-installation of a set - neon, lasers - he
has shown a way forward in stage imagery. Once again, he has demonstrated
that panache, that unerring understanding of the theatre - where ballet, let
us never forget, must live and flourish - which has always fired his art, as
creator, performer, director.
The Petit programme is at the Opera Garnier, Paris, on March 19, 21, 22.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Books: With his best Foot forward / Review of a new
biography of the man who held the Labour Party together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICHAEL FOOT by Mervyn Jones Victor Gollancz Pounds 20, 570 pages
When he retired as a Member of Parliament in 1992, Michael Foot declined to
go to the House of Lords on the entirely rational ground that he had always
said the place should be abolished. More surprising, and far more
regrettable, was his decision not to write his memoirs.
The task of producing his biography was taken on by Mervyn Jones, an old
journalist friend, author of many novels and broadly a political soul-mate.
Jones has risen manfully to the challenge. The published version of his book
runs to 570 pages; the full version has been placed with the Museum of
Labour History in Manchester.
One may ask, however, whether this is the right way to go about it. Apart
from the biography, Jones has provided a potted history of the events
leading to the second world war, a summary of the cold war, and a history of
the Labour Party seen from the left. It is as though Michael Foot was a
pivotal figure throughout.
The truth is rather different. Foot was always an engaging man, but until
relatively late in life his political influence was peripheral. He has
perhaps two big claims to fame in British politics. The first is that he was
instrumental in founding the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the late
1950s. CND, whatever was said by its detractors, led to an intellectual
concentration on the problems posed by nuclear weapons. It also contributed
to the test ban treaty, which was the first serious attempt to bring the
weapons under international control.
On the second claim to fame, the jury is still out, but the preliminary
verdict must be sympathetic. Jones puts it starkly: 'The truth about Michael
Foot's place in history is that he was the man who saved the Labour Party'.
Some people may argue that by the late 1970s the Labour Party had served its
purpose and should not have been saved. A more telling judgment will depend
on whether there is ever again a Labour government. If there is, Foot will
have done something to bring it about, for it was he who strove as much as
anyone to hold the party together.
In his early political life, Foot had always been a maverick. Initially he
was a Liberal from a liberal family. He was never short of contacts. After
Oxford, his first job was with a shipping firm in Liverpool, employed by the
right wing brother of Stafford Cripps, and it was on Merseyside that he
turned to socialism, though it was socialism of a quixotic kind.
Foot's patron was Lord Beaverbrook, for whose papers he wrote, despite
dissenting views. His hero was Aneurin Bevan, of whom he became the
biographer. Yet, as Jones points out, there was always a dilemma between
politics and literature. Foot could do either, but was never quite sure
which he preferred.
For a time he had it both ways. He entered Parliament for Plymouth Devonport
in 1945 and held the seat for 10 years. In 1960 he succeeded Bevan as the
member for Ebbw Vale. Before he died, Bevan had become a controversial
figure on the left of the party because he refused unilaterally to renounce
nuclear weapons.
Foot knew, from his Bevanite experience, how schismatic the party could be,
yet for a decade he continued on the outside left. Then in 1970, when Harold
Wilson lost the general election, Foot decided to move inside. He stood for
the shadow cabinet, was elected and for the next 13 years, whether in
government or opposition, played a crucial role in keeping the party just
about intact.
This is the seminal part of the political chapters in the Jones book. Some
of the information, drawn from personal interviews, is new. I did not know,
for instance, how far Foot was behind the Lib-Lab Pact of the late 1970s,
and I was surprised to learn that Denis Healey was utterly loyal to Foot
until the end. Healey, like Foot, had the same instincts: the only practical
course was to seek to preserve the party.
The man who was badly treated was Peter Shore, who once seemed Foot's
candidate for the succession to James Callaghan as party leader. In 1980
Foot forgot to tell Shore in time that he had decided to stand himself; the
reason was that Foot was persuaded that he himself had the best chance of
keeping the party together. Foot lost the general election of 1983
decisively, but the party survived. In the process, he had seen off the
Social Democrats and Tony Benn and begun to resist the Militant Tendency.
Perhaps we should give him the benefit of the doubt; no-one else could have
done it.
Yet Foot is a much more attractive, eccentric man than those last few
intensely political years suggest. He was prone to accidents: he suffered
seriously from eczema and asthma (hence his absence from the war), then had
a car crash, which relieved him of both, but left him lame: hence his famous
stick. He received gratuities from Beaverbrook which it is unlikely that a
politician would survive today, but one does not doubt his independence. He
wrote wonderfully about Jonathan Swift and was one of the best speakers in
the House of the Commons. His parliamentary ally was often Enoch Powell, who
has also avoided the Lords.
Some of this lively side comes out in the book; much of it is lost in the
padding. The pity is that Foot is now spending his time writing about
another hero: HG Wells. Typical Michael Foot. It would be good to have the
real memoir.

ZERO COUPON by Paul Erdman Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 350 pages
You have to admire Paul Erdman's nerve in writing a thriller based on
municipal bonds. As a character in his story says, they are 'so mundane, so
tedious, so pedestrian'. At least the author managed to find a catchier
title than Capital Appreciation Bonds, the alternative description of the
eponymous income-free securities.
To be fair, the novel does not by any means entirely revolve around zero
coupon munis. It races along at a fair lick unless you unwisely stop to
consider fault lines in the plot. Much more extravagantly it climaxes with a
late 1995 German political crisis in which the chancellor is exposed for
corruption, the Bundesbank chairman resigns and his successor shoots himself
for failing to save the D-Mark, which suffers the same fate as sterling in
September 1992. Norman Lamont, at least, would enjoy this.
After three years in jail for a junk bond scam, Willy Saxon emerges in
mid-1995 with Dollars 75m stashed away in Liechtenstein and an ambition to
get right back into the game. He does not want to end up like poor old
Bernie Cornfeld, a dead-end 46-year-old surrounded by champagne and girls.
So without even a tuxedo to his name, he moves into typical financial
thrillerland - San Francisco - where everybody can be bribed, bullied,
blackmailed or laid. He has spent most of his time in the correctional
institution in the library, picking up information technology knowhow, and
before you can say Sparcserver workstation he is corrupting cronies in the
kind of Californian restaurant where Pinot Grigio is considered the last
word in sophistication. Pausing only to explain to the occasional glamorous
billionaire widow the virtues of tax-free municipal bonds, Saxon is soon
jetsetting across the globe.
Erdman's brand name-dropping style, with regular mention of real people,
suffers from poor research, however. Saxon travels on an airline named
British Air, and for some reason thinks George Soros runs Quantum Fund out
of London rather than New York. Erdman also believes that the City of London
would be open for business on Monday January 2. Incidentally, names like
Claridge's, Barron's, Warren Buffett and (occasionally) Deutsche Bank are
wrongly spelt.
The plot revolves around Saxon's plans to buy a collapsing investment bank
called Prescott &amp; Quackenbush and turn it into an aggressive trader in
derivatives. Along the way he picks up a stake in a dodgy credit rating
agency to help him stuff a dozy investment institution with fraudulent
bonds. But his big coup is to turn a hastily-assembled collection of former
jailbirds and disgraced ex-Volkswagen currency traders into the hottest
derivatives team since the days of Liar's Poker. When Germany suffers
political and financial collapse just after Christmas they are somehow the
only people to notice and short the DM before the markets close for the New
Year holiday. Poor old George Soros is left trailing behind, although at
least by this time he has moved as far as New Jersey.
There is the required overdose of financial mumbo-jumbo, including talk of
non-linear analysis through neural networks and genetic algorithms, and
trading in a variety of semi-plausible products ranging from reverse
floaters to index currency option notes. Only occasionally, fortunately, are
there paragraphs of turgid explanation. Zero coupon bonds are, of course, by
no means a figment of the lurid novelist's imagination although the variant
described here appears to be more on the lines of the zero coupon perpetuals
occasionally touted around the bond markets on April 1.
Paul Erdman puts the nonsense over with considerable style, and the book
could help to while away a flight on British Air, whatever that may be. But
after Willy Saxon pockets his profit the grim fate of Germany is left to the
imagination, just as it arouses the reader's curiosity: better not read it
on Lufthansa.

A CHANGE OF CLIMATE by Hilary Mantel Viking Pounds 15, 342 pages
Hilary Mantel is generally agreed to be one of the most interesting and
accomplished of the younger - or perhaps the middle - generation of our
novelists. Her last book, A Place of Greater Safety, was praised for its
portrait of Revolutionary France and won the Sunday Express prize as well as
a few grumbles about its extreme length. A Change of Climate is certain to
consolidate this reputation.
It tells of Ralph and Anna Eldred who have devoted their lives to what used
to be called Good Works. He is director of a charitable trust in Norfolk and
London, and his wife assists and endorses him and runs their family of four
children. As Kit, the eldest, says, 'My father is so bloody saintly it would
make you sick, but the trouble is it's real, it's all real. My mother . . .
she's saintly too'.
The lives of the Eldreds unravel in the course of an East Anglian summer
when their 20-year secret at last escapes. In the mid-1950s the Eldreds had
been sent to South Africa to work with a mission. First they lived outside
Pretoria in a freehold black township which, like Sophiatown and Lady
Selborne at that time, was to be razed by the apartheid government.
They became politically involved, were arrested and jailed and eventually
deported across the border to Bechuanaland. There, in a wretched place on
the edge of the Kalahari, they encountered catastrophe - a horrific tragedy
the nature of which I imagine most reviewers will choose not to reveal.
Hilary Mantel's novel sets itself to describe, and to understand, the effect
of this event on the subsequent lives of the Eldred family. Ralph as a young
man had believed in 'the complex perfectibility of the human heart'. He is,
and remains, a good man: 'If we are not to be mere animals, or babies, we
must always choose and choose to do good'.
He struggles to make sense of the episode in the Bechuanaland bush and to
come to terms with any responsibility: 'I accept that I made choices and
they were wrong, but then I think, too, that our lives have been ruined by
malign chance. I do not see any pattern here, any sense, any reason why this
had to happen . . .'
Back in Norfolk, his innocence still guarded by Anna, he determines to keep
going - which, as his wise sister warns him, is typical of a man and will be
at the expense of the people around him. Because - as she also believes -
women turn inwards; they fall ill; and, in Anna's case, they are destroyed.
Don't worry, Anna says, she won't be a problem, 'We're professional
Christians, aren't we, Ralph and me?' But one day, as the children approach
adulthood and her husband falls in love with a simpler, less anguished
woman, she cracks.
This is, I hope it is clear, a serious and intelligent novel about difficult
themes - the nature of evil, of forgiveness, of suppression, of acceptance.
Not that there is anything laboured or theoretical about the depiction of
these philosophies. The Eldred family is particularly well done, the
children and their friends all vividly and sympathetically realised.
Ms Mantel evidently has an equal familiarity with both Norfolk and southern
Africa: she catches, for instance, the embarrassed ambivalence of
well-meaning foreigners when they encounter the African reality - 'The
village men were meagre, spiritless and skinny. The women were great tubes
of fat, blown out with carbohydrate . . . Their voices were harsh,
monotonous, somehow triumphal. God help me, Anna thought: but I don't like
them, perhaps I fear them. These feelings were a violation of everything she
expected from herself, of all her principles and habits of mind . . .'
My only hesitation is that, because the novelist's beam plays over so many
characters, Ralph and Anna both remain a fraction under-exposed. They remain
always at a certain distance. We recognise them, but we do not enter their
private lives, and so we are impressed where we should be moved. Many
readers will, I am sure, disagree with me.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Books: Driven to nationalism - The internal struggles of
central Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETWEEN MARX AND MUHAMMAD by Dilip Hiro HarperCollins Pounds 25, 400 pages
In central Asia, always a hotbed of intrigue, an intriguing contest has been
played out: in the red corner, socialism, which declared that the
brotherhood of man would sweep nationalism away; in the green corner, Islam,
believing that God would unite all races of the faithful; and, holding the
ring, capitalism, with its promise of a material cornucopia.
This is the subject of Dilip Hiro's book. It is a compendious political
guide to the internal struggles of central Asia and the south Caucusus, and
marks their emergence as geopolitical entities in their own right.
Hiro describes how the Bolsheviks' early policy of indulgent assimilation of
the semi-nomadic races conquered by the Czars turned to economic
exploitation and cultural and religious suppression. Gorbachev's
perestroika, aided by such revelations as the cotton scandal in Uzbekistan,
destroyed what faith was left in the Kremlin planners. Islamic nationalism
was the natural recourse.
And yet, as the author shows, the dire forecasts of western analysts have
proved wrong. Civil strife did break out - notably in Azerbaijan and
Tajikistan - but the presence of fundamentalist Islamic regimes across the
southern border in Iran and Afghanistan did not set the region alight.
The largely Sunni moslems of central Asia have little religious affinity
with Shia Iran - though many sought refuge there over the years - while the
government in Teheran has shown a pragmatic reluctance to let its religious
enthusiasm interfere with trading prospects.
Turkey gloated at the prospect of a pan-Turkic alliance stretching virtually
to the Pacific: not only was there a racial and linguistic connection and a
coincidence of Sunni belief, but Turkey could offer commercial openings to
the west. Yet when the Azeris looked to it for help against the Armenians,
they looked in vain.
Hiro says Turkey's western assets, in this case membership of NATO, proved
as much a liability. He concludes that Russia will continue to be the
dominant force in central Asia and Azerbaijan, with Iran and Turkey jostling
on the sidelines as complementary suitors. Moscow will treat its former
Soviet subjects as client states, much as the US treats the countries of
central and south America. This is the reality which the UN appears already
to have accepted.
Travellers thirsty for the colour and romance of former Soviet central Asia
will not find it in this book. Dilip Hiro is a serious, methodical and
objective historian of current affairs. But for the growing throng of
diplomats and businessmen with an interest in the region - not least in
Caspian oil - it must surely be required reading.

early sketches of London life
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DICKENS' JOURNALISM: VOL. 1 edited by Michael Slater Dent Pounds 30, 580
pages
This volume of Dickens' journalism, number one of a proposed four, starts in
the 1830s when Dickens was employed as a reporter in the press gallery at
Westminster Palace (before the present Houses of Parliament were built). His
job was to record the debates for newspaper publication the following day.
Grinding work but Dickens, who was barely 20 and who had taught himself
shorthand, was highly skilled at it. He soon became known as the king of the
gallery and he regarded the discipline he acquired during his time there as
the foundation-stone of his literary career.
When Dickens was not at Parliament he made space to do some imaginative
writing of his own, sketches of London life that were published in The
Morning Chronicle and its recently started evening counterpart. He signed
these literary pieces with the pseudonym 'Boz' - borrowed from The Vicar of
Wakefield, Goldsmith being one of his models.
Dickens was therefore two kinds of journalist simultaneously. A fully
paid-up member of the NUJ, as it were, writing anonymous reports in the
Chronicle, and under his pseudonymous Boz hat, a journalist in the sense
that Simenon and Damon Runyon were journalists. All penetrated the mean
streets of a capital city, sometimes the affluent streets too, making
authentic popular fiction out of the lives and crimes of the people they
observed there. This tradition of 'faction' still flourishes.
To read this book is to inhabit the aggressive, noisy, teeming world of a
rapidly expanding London just before the young Queen Victoria succeeded to
the throne. To boost the family budget, the boy Dickens was cooped up for
long hours in a warehouse near Hungerford Stairs sticking labels on bottles
of blacking. Once he escaped he roamed far and wide throughout the capital
and its surrounding villages, his sharp eyes ever on the alert. All he
assimilated he then re-cycled in a series of Sketches, Characters and Tales
composed by Boz.
Michael Slater, the professor of Victorian literature at Birkbeck College,
the editor of the edition, describes their complicated publishing history in
both periodical and book form. They were an instant success from the moment
they were published, a fact that has tended to be obscured by the even more
phenomenal success of Pickwick in 1836. Even after that Dickens continued to
write Boz pieces to meet the continuing demand for them.
Although a narrative element is never far below the surface, it is at
descriptive writing that Boz excels. His portraits of the convivial places
of public entertainment, Astley's Amphitheatre, Vauxhall Gardens, Greenwich
Fair contrast with his depictions of the backstreets around Seven Dials, the
sewing women earning a pittance there, and the wretched customers of the
pawnbrokers. Boz caught them all with an ironic phrase or two; he applauded
resourcefulness in adversity while he ruthlessly punctured the pomposity of
the well-off.
Even at the height of his later fame Dickens never wholly gave up
journalism. He edited periodicals - Bentley's Miscellany and Master
Humphrey's Clock - which he filled largely with his own contributions. He
helped to found a new newspaper, The Daily Chronicle, and for a while edited
it. The subsequent volumes will contain his work of this later period.
Meanwhile the edition has got off to an excellent start.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Gardening: Gaia the earth goddess makes a comeback - Bridget
Bloom picks her way through the latest crop of gardening books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIDGET BLOOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you heard of Gaia? You have, of course, if you had a classical
education. But today, classical education or not, if you believe in
gardening organically - that is without chemicals and in a manner in tune
with nature - you may be a Gaian devotee.
Gaia is the ancient Greek goddess of the earth who is, it seems, making an
important comeback according to The Natural Garden Book by Peter Harper and
others, (Gaia Books, Pounds 18.99, 287 pages). The 'nub of the Gaia
hypothesis . . .is that the biosphere is a complex system so closely
analogous to a living organism that we might as well regard it as one.'
Gaia, we learn, is three billion billion years old, probably immortal,
self-regulating like any living thing and capable of self repair even from
severe damage. It - or is it she - is also capable of recycling its own
waste while being 'powered by the sun and profoundly influenced by the
moon'.
In other words Gaia seems to be Nature itself and it is the contention of
the authors of The Natural Gardening Book that, since each of our gardens is
'a little piece of Gaia' and each of those pieces is a microcosm of the
whole, it behoves us to garden in sympathy with Gaian rules.
Mumbo jumbo? Or no more than flavour of the moment, given the high political
profile of sustainable development? You scoff at your peril, says Geoff
Hamilton, one of Britain's foremost organic gardeners, whose chemical-free
veg and flower beds are regularly seen by 5m television viewers. He writes
in his introduction: 'There are plenty of books about natural gardening, but
none, I'm sure, that so clearly and comprehensively explains not only the
techniques that will ensure chemical-free success but also the logic and the
philosophy behind the ethic of natural gardening.'
I must say I found the book fascinating. This is partly because of the
different methods of gardening it recommends - although some of these, such
as using your own urine to speed up compost making, are challenging - but
mainly because of the more respectful attitude it encourages one to take
towards the garden and its huge array of plant, animal and insect life.
A more pedestrian, although admirably clear and well-illustrated guide to
organic gardening is to be found in Gardening Naturally by Ann Reilly
(Prion, Pounds 14.95, 192 pages). An American writer, Reilly takes a
hands-on approach, beginning with ways to condition the soil and proceeding
through insect and pest control to chapters on which flowers, herbs and
vegetables to grow and how.
If you are at all serious about growing vegetables, however, you should also
know about The Vegetable Finder, a handbook analogous to the admirable The
Plant Finder in that it aims to tell you where in the UK to buy a vast
variety of vegetable seeds.
It is produced and published by the Henry Doubleday Research Association,
one of Europe's premier organic establishments (Pounds 5.99, 296 pages,
distributed by Moorland Publishing at Ashbourne, Derbyshire DA6 IHD.)
The Vegetable Finder is doing its bit for bio-diversity by listing nearly
3,000 varieties of vegetables.
Two more books with an organic flavour are David Bellamy's Blooming Bellamy
(Pounds 15.99, BBC Books) an enthusiastic, nicely-illustrated work on herbs
and herbal healing. There is also a rather curious item bearing Geoff
Hamilton's name and entitled Gardener's Challenge (Kingfisher Books, Pounds
9.99, 144 pages). The publisher's blurb describes it as a test of general
gardening knowledge with more than 1,000 gardening questions (and answers).
Designed, perhaps, to help the quiz-minded gardener while away the
non-gardening months of the year.
With similar activity in mind, I confess to having bought and given away at
Christmas several copies of another slim volume published last year.
Gardener's Latin, a lexicon by Bill Neal (Robert Hale, Pounds 6.99, 136
pages) is a book for the gardener who has most things (except perhaps a
classical education) and who likes to browse, discovering as he goes that
while cyaneus means dark blue, cyananthus means with dark blue flowers and
cyanocarpus means bearing blue fruits.
But now to something grander. Challenged to name two dozen of the major
gardens created this century, most experts would probably include Hidcote,
in Gloucestershire, designed by Lawrence Johnstone from 1907 and now managed
by The National Trust.
They might well also list Lutyens' Viceregal Garden in New Delhi and perhaps
Dumbarton Oaks in Washington and the Governor's Palace in colonial
Williamsburg, designed respectively by Beatrix Jones Farrand and Arthur A
Shurcliff.
But what about the Woodland Cemetery just outside Stockholm, designed by
Gunnar Asplund to take advantage of 'the pale Swedish light punctuated by
tall, dark pine trees' or the 125-acre site once the home of the central
abattoir for Paris, now becoming the Parc de la Villette with Bernard
Tschumi's 'glistening red surfaces of individual steel cubes' as its
centrepiece?
William Howard Adams' impressive tome, Grounds for Change: Major Gardens of
the Twentieth Century (Little, Brown and Company, 216 pages, Dollars 60) is
itself conceived on the grand scale.
'Of all the arts - painting, sculpture, music, architecture, dance, theater,
even that arriviste, photography - only landscape design has been denied an
account of its history and achievements produced in the 20th century.' Adams
plots just those achievements, from the early struggle between the Formal
and the Natural philosophies of garden and landscape design (the two are
often seen as synonymous) to the more recent post-Modern efforts to
integrate technology and its shapes into landscape design. He describes his
24 chosen gardens in often fascinating detail with some striking photographs
by Everett H Scott.
Next come two very grand books indeed. Heather Angel's Kew: A World of
Plants (Collins and Brown, Pounds 20, 160 pages) which was published last
year and Trees of Ireland - Native and Naturalised, by E Charles Nelson and
Wendy F Walsh (Lilliput Press, Dublin, 240 pages).
The first is an upmarket guide to the Royal Botanic Gardens, at Kew, Surrey,
which has one of the largest collections of living plants anywhere, from
habitats as diverse as tropical forests, deserts, coral reefs and the
temperate zones. The pictures, as one might expect from one of the UK's top
nature photographers, are very fine.
Trees of Ireland, with line drawings and watercolours, not photographs, is
an elegant reference book which could well, as its publishers say, appeal to
the gardener, ecologist, artist and dendrophile alike.
And so to gardens not included in Adams' book, which form the subject of two
other recently published books: Christopher Lloyd's In My Garden
(Bloomsbury, Pounds 16.99, 277 pages) and Mirabel Osler's The Secret Gardens
of France (Pavilion, Pounds 16.99, 158 pages).
Lloyd's famous garden, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens for his father
Nathaniel Lloyd, is at Great Dixter in Sussex. Lloyd himself is a respected
garden writer and this latest work is an anthology celebrating 30 years of
his gardening column in Country Life. The pieces are grouped month by month;
they are chatty, informative and definitely for dipping into, although
Lloyd's highly personal style may not be for everyone.
Osler's book, too, is for dipping, perhaps when travelling in or planning to
visit France. She has strong opinions, but is knowledgeable and enthusiastic
about her subject.
Finally, since spring is upon us, are three no-nonsense, hands-on guides to
gardening from the Royal Horticultural Society at Wisley. Each is priced at
Pounds 13.99 (Cassell, 256 pages) and each brings together three or four of
the RHS's earlier handbooks. The new books are entitled Making a Small
Garden, Courtyard and Terrace Gardens and Planting Your Garden - the latter
including the earlier handbook by Christopher Lloyd on The Mixed Border.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Fishing: Fine chub save the day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I was toiling at my desk
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or rather staring into mid-air with the end of my pen in my mouth - when a
thought struck me. It was not a thought conducive to completing the tedious
task on which I was engaged. But it was one of those thoughts which demands
immediate action - like the realisation that you have forgotten your
mother's birthday or left the garden hose running.
It was that if I did not go fishing immediately, I would have no further
opportunity before the coarse fishing season closed in a few days. Outside
the sun was shining, the birds were chirruping, the daffodils were just
blooming, and the river - in my mind's eye - was running clear and
sparkling.
An internal debate between duty and inclination was brief, and within the
hour I was by the water.
I had decided that I would catch perch to begin with, spinning; then one or
two of the sizeable roach which had long eluded me, on floatfished bread;
and finally a hard-fighting barbel of seven or eight pounds, on a helping of
Sainsbury's breakfast slice, which I had been assured was the barbel bait of
the moment.
At 5pm - with an hour of daylight on my last fishing day remaining - I had
caught neither perch, nor roach, nor barbel, nor anything else. What is
more, I had endured a series of trifling misfortunes. I confess that some of
these were self-inflicted. It was absurd to believe that I could
successfully flit from species to species, and method to method. I should
have identified one target, and gone for it. And I should have remembered to
bring a stool to sit on, and not relied on the ground - for a damp backside
in chill March is no laughing matter.
On the question of my wet feet, I am prepared to accept some of the blame. I
knew that my right gumboot had a leak, and was careful to keep it out of the
water. But how was I to know that the left one had developed a gash as if
attacked by a maniac with a butcher's knife? I soon found out.
All right, I should have been alert enough to prevent Bertie the spaniel
stealing half the packet of breakfast slice; and I should not have been so
careless as to cast into the upper branches of the alder opposite.
As you may have gathered by now, the idyllic quality of the day as I had
imagined it had departed. All these incidental irritations would have been
negligible, if I could have caught something. This is what most aggrieved me
 -the obstinate, unreasoning refusal of the fish to bite. As the evening
drew in, so my frown grew deeper.
Then I had another thought. I should be after fish that were permanently
hungry. That meant chub. Only the chub could save me.
I hastened to the millpool below the house. And there, on the remains of the
breakfast slice, I caught five fine, fat chub. The bites were bold, the
fights in the foaming water strong and satisfying. I applied myself intently
and intelligently, and all the fondness for the chub that I had had as a boy
 -as a fish which could be depended on - returned.
The last was the best, a good 4lb. As I slid the net beneath its gleaming,
silver flanks, I murmured my appreciation for the inspiration which had come
to me that morning - and for a day redeemed from disaster.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Gardening: English flowers in a class of their own - Trying
to impress a great foreign botanist, Robin Lane Fox finds a sight worth the
journey from St Petersburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
March is behaving madly, which makes life difficult for show-offs. Where do
you take visitors if you want to impress them with English flowers at their
best?
I have just faced this difficulty. I have been trying to impress a great
foreign botanist - not any old European dignitary but one of the senior
plant scientists from Russia, who has seen more fruit trees than you or I
would recognise and knows every botanic garden from the Caucasus to
Vladivostock. A few drifts of narcissus Cragford in long grass would not
make the right impression.
As usual, this early spring is split between towns with clouds of early
blossom and a countryside which has yet to see an anemone in flower. Acid
soil and shelter have hurried along the camellias, but where are
Cornwall-like habitats within easy reach of Oxford?
The answer, this weekend, is at the Savill gardens in Windsor Great Park,
where spring breaks early on a sheltered site. Would it have broken already,
I wondered. The person at the end of the telephone assured me she could see
daffodils the last time she managed to escape from her paperwork.
Vladimir was expecting great things: cravenly, I threw in such sweeteners as
the promise of seeing Windsor castle, royalty at prayer, and a guided tour
round Eton college - the pinnacle, I apologised, of the English class
system. If the camellias failed, we could fall back on boys in tailcoats and
guesses about Princess Margaret's bedroom.
Perhaps it was the promise of narcissi, perhaps it was the class struggle.
But, when we set off, the plan already had a Russian stamp of approval
because two passengers had become five: Vladimir brought along some extra
friends to keep up the numbers.
They had much to teach me, some of which will enliven this column in future:
a post-Stalinist exclusive for the pink FT. Meanwhile, I learnt that there
are great rose beds in the botanic gardens at Yalta; thousands of roses have
been planted down the streets of major Ukrainian towns; and there are vast
orchards of scientific collections around Vladivostock.
To seal an agreement of collaboration, I now have bushes of blackcurrants
(with names such as Delight of Lenin) which have been planted in that last
lingering ash-bed of communism, the gardens of my Oxford college.
On the road to Windsor, Vladimir wanted to tell me about great cherries
which he had visited; one friend wanted to interpret; another wished to tell
all of us (in Russian) about the latest political changes; and the fourth
harangued me on her understanding of relations between ancient Persia and
Greece. Schizophrenically, I wondered if the Savill gardens would rise to
the occasion, or if we would peter out in snapshots of Eton's school yard.
There is no knowing at the turnstile: the gardens are entered through an
extraordinarily ugly gift shop which blots out the style which the late Eric
Savill tried to achieve. The famous meadow beneath it has Britain's finest
sweep of the small Hoop Petticoat daffodils which revel in the damp. A few
dozen were visible, and so I improvised about the millions which were
waiting to emerge. What impressed my convoy most was the meadow's similarity
to the sort of steppe they see in Russia every day.
Beyond the future narcissi, the white-flowered osmanthus delavayi is
flowering freely, but it did not attract comment. The first rhododendrons
were better, including the aptly-named Redwing; the big bushes of the
Falconieri variety looked wonderful to me, but less wonderful to those in
the party who had seen them wild in Bhutan. I was beginning to think it was
time for St George's chapel and the royal dolls' house when we rounded the
path to the garden's furthest dell and my guiding anxieties all passed away.
Go and see it if your own gardens are still emerging from winter. Huge
bushes of all the various corylopsis are smothered in the yellow
bell-flowers which never appear on my soil and old, hybrid camellias are
tangled into a flowering archway where names such as Inspiration are
entwined with Salutation. The rhododendrons are not overpowering and the
trunks of the birches are beautifully white.
Out in the clearing, to the right of a pile of drainpipes, stands a sight
worth the journey from St Petersburg. The small cyclamen-flowered narcissi
are already flowering by the thousand in the wet conditions which their
tubular flowers require. Above them stands a tree of a special magnolia
sprengeri, its hundreds of white and reddish flowers opening flat in the
spring sunshine. They bear the name of Savill, who made this garden out of
unused parkland.
You and I are unlikely to have the soil, or the years of patience, to grow a
magnolia to this size. Visit it instead - and reflect on the appropriate
chance that it was open to welcome St Petersburg's leading botanist on a
visit which could never have been considered when the tree was first put in
place.
We admired the crocuses and felt at home among the Chinese azaleas. By the
time we moved on, it did not seem to matter that the state apartments were
closed and there was scope only for a snapshot of Windsor castle's towers.
The Etonian boys were viewed with wonderment and the buildings made my
visitors feel expressively pro-British.
Magnolias, it seems, are stronger than Marxism and, when we left, we all
felt we had seen something to provide a special memory - one that is greater
than any particular country and common to anyone who responds to flowers.
This weekend, those flowers should still be holding and the gardens will
have even more to show. You do not need a foreign delegation to persuade
yourself that the journey is a justified pleasure on its own terms.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Property: Setback for Heseltine - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early in the 1980s Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, started
the programme which has brought the total of listed buildings in England to
almost 500,000. Now, wearing another hat as squire of Thenford,
Northamptonshire, he has come a cropper with the listing regulations. South
Northamptonshire Council has refused him listed building consent for
alterations to a cottage he owns in the village.
The roof and the windows are what stymied him. While the cottage now has a
slate roof, it is clear that, originally, it did have thatch. Heseltine
wants to put this back - but he proposed using Norfolk reed, which is not
regarded as the right material for the vernacular architecture of the area.
The local product is long straw which makes a rather wispy, shaggy roof  -
but this is now difficult to find. A possible alternative is combed wheat,
which is neater but still not quite correct.
As for the windows, he planned to install sealed, double-glazed units. These
may conserve heat but, again, they are inappropriate.
Such decisions about details are not easy for local councils although they
are crucial for maintaining the character of an area. In any case, since the
council's decision, Heseltine has re-applied for consent and proposes to
keep the slate roof.
A glorious Queen Anne house, listed grade I, comes up for auction on Monday
afternoon at the Berkeley Hotel, London SW1.
Hinwick House, in Bedfordshire, has been in the Orlebar family since Richard
Orlebar built it between 1709 and 1713. The architect was probably James
Hunt of Northampton, who is said to have been a pupil of Grinling Gibbons,
the wood-carver and sculptor.
As with the sale of Brympton d'Evercy in Somerset in 1992, money - or rather
lack of it - is the reason for the sale. The house comes with several listed
outbuildings plus a park, a lake and woods - 35 acres in all. Also included
are five tapestries, 13 bedrooms and a four-seater lavatory.
I remember visiting Hinwick 20 years ago when it was open to the public. We
were the first group to arrive on a Sunday afternoon when the family was
sitting sleepily around the television. As we came in, they threw a cloth
over the machine - which carried on all the same - as if it were a parrot.
Joint auctioneers Savills (071-499 8644) and Allsop (071- 494 3686) suggest
a guide price of Pounds 425,000-Pounds 475,000. Bidders should have a
banker's draft or solicitor's cheque for at least Pounds 40,000.
In France only lawyers can bid in such forced sales, and they must also
arrive with a certified cheque. Chartered surveyor Armstrong McCrea, in
Monte Carlo, bought a villa at Grasse last week with two guest houses, two
tennis courts and a swimming pool. It used to be rented by 'Baby Doc'
Duvalier, son of Haiti's infamous dictator, and was on sale privately last
year for Pounds 1.5m.
French auctions receive little publicity - just three brief visits in the
company of the bailiff before bidding. The house went for Pounds 450,000,
most attractive to the buyer but probably less so to the French tax
collectors, who had foreclosed. More often, it is the bank that is the
vendor.
Armstrong McCrea (33-93 50 71 97) runs a Riviera Vulture Fund to look for
similarly unusual chances to buy on the Cote d'Azur.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Property: For lovers who can tryst the night away - Gerald
Cadogan suggests some discreet meeting places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The distinguished, silver-haired man, accompanied by a beautiful young
woman, entered the Kensington office of a well-known estate agent. It was
December 19. 'We're looking for a small flat,' he said. 'What can you show
us?'
At the fourth one, she put her arm through his and said: 'Darling, I'd love
this.' He turned to the agent and offered almost the full asking price.
Then, he took the agent into a corner. 'I'd like to give it to her for
Christmas.'
That same day, the senior partner of a smart London legal firm telephoned to
confirm the deal and contracts were exchanged on December 23 - to the
delight of agent and vendor, who had achieved an excellent sale, and
presumably to the joy of the pair ensconced in their 'love nest'.
The term appears to date from 1919 when the Oxford English Dictionary
defined it as 'a secluded retreat for (esp. illicit) lovers'. But the idea
must be as old as adultery - somewhere discreet to park the mistress or
toyboy for surreptitious visits. (Rumour had it that this once used to be a
special function of the cream-stuccoed villas in St John's Wood, London.)
Such a place is not for couples living together day by day, even if they are
not married. Either one lover lives there all the time, courtesy of the
richer (and usually older) partner. Or they meet there only for trysts. Such
people make ideal residents. They pay promptly, are generous to the cleaning
woman or housekeeper, and do not punish the place with the wear and tear of
permanent occupancy.
In the country, it is hard not to be seen conducting an illicit romance, but
London has plenty of discreet properties. And the love nests are not always
where you would expect.
At one house in Kensington, west London, the man installed his mistress next
door to himself and his wife. He then knocked a hole in the party wall and
had a door fitted - in the back of the mistress's bedroom cupboard.
So where to go? Always quiet, Mayfair is a good meeting ground, as former
government ministers can reveal. 24 Hays Mews, W1, is a pretty city cottage
with one bedroom, ideal as a pied-a-terre in town that doubles as a trysting
place. Wetherell offers a 56-year lease for Pounds 197,500.
More useful still might be 21a Brick Street, W1: Pounds 225,000 freehold
from Chestertons Residential. It is tucked away in a mews behind the Park
Lane Hotel and has a garage for a quick getaway (or to hide the car from
paparazzi who know the number).
On the other hand, Vivien Thompson, of buying agent Property Vision, points
out the advantages of buying a small flat in a grand block. Assuming a
reasonable price, such a property can have all the advantages of a central
location plus porters to keep watch when you are not there.
MPs are often on the lookout for such a place, as they cannot afford to be
too far from parliament. But the problem is finding something close enough
to reach the House in time to vote after the division bell installed in the
flat rings - especially if there is a need to dress first.
After all, there are only eight minutes from calling a division to locking
the lobby doors, and the traffic jams in central London are legendary.
Walking or bicycling seem to be the answer.
If there is nothing available in Smith Square, Lord North Street and
Strutton Ground to the south and west of parliament, go north. 71a Whitehall
Court, SW1, is a one-bedroom flat in a large block with porterage which
meets Thompson's criteria admirably. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley offers a 34-year
lease for Pounds 195,000.
Belgravia, Kensington and Chelsea are also too far for a quick dash to the
Palace of Westminster although they have plenty of small flats with one and
two bedrooms. Strutt &amp; Parker has a good selection.
The 22-year lease outstanding on 64 Pont Street, SW1 (price Pounds 138,000)
should outlast any romance. And Pounds 100,000 buys a fourth-floor flat at 4
Sloane Gardens, SW1.
But the best place of all 'to sin with Elinor Glyn/On a tiger skin - Or
would you prefer/To err with her/On some other kind of fur?' is the huge
studio/drawing room of 49 Lyall Mews, SW1 which costs Pounds 1.15m for a
44-year lease from Lassmans. Cheaper, at Pounds 179,000 from Foxtons, is a
New York-style loft flat in Cromwell Road, SW3.
If your love is on the periphery of central London, take your pick of 1
Glentham Cottages, SW13, next to the playing fields of St Paul's School
(Dixon Porter, Pounds 120,000), or Crescent Grove, SW4, a converted coach
house near Clapham Common, convenient for the Underground station and with a
walled garden for maximum privacy (Winkworth in Battersea, Pounds 159,000).
On the north side of the Thames, Rio Cottage in Grosvenor Road, SW1, could
not be in a more romantic setting and has just been sold for Pounds 275,000
from Winkworth, in Pimlico.
The original asking price was Pounds 345,000. It is the refurbished old
cottage of the gatekeeper who controlled the sluices where the Tyburn
(better known uphill at Marble Arch) ran into the Thames.
The Tyburn is now in a tunnel and the house sits on top of this, with all
the back windows looking out on to the Thames.
And you might also think of England in a flat in the main turret of the
Gothic Royal Victoria Patriotic Building, SW18 (to rent from the same agent
for Pounds 500 a week). There is a secret entrance from a self-contained
'nanny' flat to the 'study', and three exits - but now we are talking French
farce.
Further information: Chestertons Residential (071-629-4513); Dixon Porter
(081-878-2828); Foxtons (071-370-4533); Knight Frank &amp; Rutley

FT  19 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Beautiful Swiss wines to yodel about - 'Come
downstairs and I'll show you my concentrator.' / Uncovering the secrets of
some fine wines made in minute quantities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you go to the trouble of tracking down a bevy of beautiful wines made in
minute quantities with impeccable fastidiousness in a building that looks
like a Swiss cowshed, you expect an exclusive story. But the longer I spent
with Daniel Gantenbein, the more I realised I was treading in the footsteps
of wine luminaries by the score.
Paul Draper, master winemaker of California's Ridge Vineyards, had
apparently visited Daniel in this corner of eastern Switzerland last summer.
The pair communicated in Italian, familiar to Daniel from his holidays in
Piedmont (he rents a small vineyard to Elio Altare).
Gantenbein wines may be difficult to track down, even in Zurich, a few miles
to the north-west, but they can be found on the list at Piedmont's famous Da
Guido restaurant, as well as in the more notable local restaurants, and
those immediately north in Liechtenstein. They may also try to export to the
US.
When I raved about the quality of his Riesling-Sylvaner 1992, I was told
that that was the wine of which Ernst Loosen, whizzkid of the Mosel, had
ordered a case.
And in Daniel's personal wine cellar, hollowed out of the slate underpinning
his native village of Flasch, were all the names one would wish for oneself:
Bordeaux's great names, Ponsot 1990 red burgundies, a tranche of Domaine de
la Romanee-Conti, Guigal, Ridge, and a gaggle of bottles from the Mosel's
Grosse Ring aristocracy.
Daniel is the only producer of the Grosse Ring's own raw material in his
area. 'For me Riesling, with Chardonnay, is the white grape variety.'
This small wine region in eastern, German-speaking Switzerland is the vinous
heart of Graubunden canton, the Herrschaft, which produces predominantly
simple, sweetish Blauburgunder (the Pinot Noir of Burgundy, of which the
Mariafeld clone is widely revered here) together with Alsace's white grape
varieties, Muller-Thurgau and Completer, an eye-watering local curiosity.
The local market (truly local; the wines are almost unknown in
French-speaking Switzerland) sustains relatively high prices here. Vines are
planted amid pasture and all sorts of crops, but viticulture is the most
profitable agricultural activity in this dramatically beautiful corner of
Switzerland, through which thousands of skiers hurtle each weekend en route
for Klosters and Davos.
The twinkling, energetic Daniel was, until relatively recently a mechanic,
and is still a meticulous craftsman, whether in winemaking or restoring his
ancient farmhouse. After his wife, Martha, had qualified in viticulture, he
studied wine-making, both at the local wine school in Wadenswil and nosing
around producers he admires.
Since 1980 they have farmed a just-manageable total of four hectares (10
acres) of vines, on well-exposed slopes below a vertiginous cliff face that
leads the way to the Vorarlberg. The land is dissected by narrow open lanes,
a tractor wide.
Why are Gantenbein wines such a discernible cut above the rest? There is his
infatuation with, and exposure to, the fine wines of the world (last year he
and some friends had organised a wine tasting which culminated in an 1899
Montrachet).
There is also his practical determination to get things right, bottling, for
example, much later than most. The Herrschaft is currently in the grip of
barrique worship, not always to the benefit of the resulting wines.
Daniel has filled every corner of his winery with top quality French oak
casks, but he experimented before deciding that double-sized barriques give
the right wood-to-fruit ratio for his grapes.
And then there are, of course, the grapes, and, perhaps most importantly,
the low yields encouraged by Martha in the vineyard, much lower than the
Swiss norm.
Gantenbein Blauburgunder tastes like serious red wine with a future, the
product of a minimal intervention winemaking policy.
It is not surprising that it commands a 50 per cent premium on the going
rate for the region of SFr12 (Pounds 5.60) per bottle.
But the much rarer white wines are possibly even more distinguished.
Daniel's Weissburgunder 1990 was picked with a potential alcohol level of 13
per cent and was fermented cool and long - 'just long enough to make people
angry'. It is probably the best Pinot Blanc I have yet tasted.
Perhaps it is inevitable that Daniel makes a Chardonnay (SFr25 a bottle) but
so does the rest of the world.
But no one else I know makes a rich, red wine like the mystery he produced
at the end of my tasting in his house.
It was very dark and dramatically concentrated, with lovely spicy fruit.
Because we had been discussing the new concentrators that are being employed
in Bordeaux to make claret more intense, I half-seriously suggested that
this was the product of a concentrator.
His eyes lit up. 'Come downstairs and I'll show you my concentrator,' he
smiled, scampering down a dark staircase to a whitewashed chamber, windows
open to the village street.
Here were stacked wooden fruit boxes full of Pinot Noir grapes drying and
sweetening, in imitation of the Italian passito technique used to produce
Recioto and Amarone.
This extraordinary hybrid of a wine sells at auction for more than SFr200 a
half bottle, which must go some way towards subsidising the Ponsots resting
quietly next door.
