FT  19 MAR 94 / Cookery: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche

<TEXT>
No food is more fundamental in the west than bread. Those who go out to work
are breadwinners. Lose your job and you may be on the breadline. Give us
this day our daily bread, we pray.
Bread was the trencher on which other foods were served before dinner plates
were commonplace. The rich who feasted on meat may have fancied their bread
soaked in gravy but etiquette demanded that they left their trenchers
uneaten. That way the bread might be given to feed the less fortunate.
For centuries bread was a mainstay of meals for the majority. And it remains
important in the thriftier corners of Europe where traditional bread soups
and bread salads are much in evidence.
Bread soups consist basically of bread and water plus a little of whatever
local produce is plentiful and cheap. Hard rations you may say. Certainly
such fare must seem monotonous if you have no choice but to eat it week in
week out. But, for those of us who can dip into bread soups just
occasionally - like Marie Antoinette playing at milkmaids - few foods seem
more satisfying and soothing.
Bread soups are basic and highly practical. Amazingly speedy one pot dishes
 -non-cook cooking - they are just right for the tired, the busy and the
culinarily inept. Conjuring substantial comfort from very little they come
to the rescue when Mother Hubbard's cupboard is bare and the houskeeping
budget reaches rock bottom. More than that they can be utterly delicious,
the individual flavours of an area giving each soup its territorial
character, while plenty of soaked and swollen bread provides solid
sustenance.
In Tuscany I will happily eat Pappa col Pomodoro for several days on the
trot: tomatoes, garlic, basil, olive oil and water simmered fruitily and
thickened with generous chunks of bread to make a pappy pink porridge. Alas
this lovely bread soup does not travel well, rich vine-ripened tomatoes
being beyond British reach.
Much easier to reproduce here is Mourtairol from south west France. For two
people scald three ladles of pure rich chicken broth and enrich it with a
pinch of saffron. Add a few meaty chicken scraps taken from the wings if you
are feeling indulgent, or a little snipped parsley, and pour the mixture
slowly over 3oz of stale, roughly torn country bread encouraging the crumb
to sop up as much of the flavoursome liquid as it can hold.
From the same region but simpler is Tourin. This consists of onions fried in
duck or goose fat, seasoned and stewed in water, then poured over slices of
bread, usually with the addition of an egg or two. When all the solids have
been eaten and little liquid remains in the soup bowl, the spoon is laid
down, a slurp of wine or something stronger is added to the bowl, and the
remnants are drunk in one lively swig. Shades of the onion soup of porters
at Les Halles, served complete with heartwarming rafts of cheese topped
bread and petit trou.
Spain brings us Gazpacho. Today it is often tarted up with a stream of
extravagant garnishes. The original peasant dish would have consisted of
little more than cooling draughts of water made fragrant with a few crushed
tomatoes, a little cucumber, garlic and crusts of bread. Much more
refreshing.
In Portugal, where 20th century sophistication seems to have made relatively
little impact on home cooking, traditional country dishes that major on
bread still abound and a love of acordas and migas remains widespread.
Acorda Alentejana, which may or may not include eggs, is a great favourite.
To serve two people, crush 2 garlic cloves with  1/2 teaspoon salt and
soften them briefly in 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil. Season with pepper and 2
tablespoons chopped green coriander. Pour on 1pt water, bring to a brisk
boil and poach 2 eggs in it if wished. Ladle the aromatic liquid over a
scant 3 oz bread broken into rough chunks. Add the eggs and sprinkle on
another tablespoon each of olive oil and chopped green coriander.
Even the Swiss still serve a traditional bread soup: a few roots and leeks
sliced, sweated and stewed in water until soft, thickened to a porridge with
hefty chunks of bread and finished with a grating of cheese.
Only in Britain do bread soups seem to have been gentrified out of all
recognition, the bread reduced from central component to genteel garnish.
The most bready offering you are likely to get here is a modest spoonful of
tiny, neatly diced fried bread croutons scattered over a light cream of
vegetable soup. Hardly substantial enough to keep up the strength of a two
year old.
I have, though, come across East Anglian references to something called
Suffolk Kettle Sop. Consisting simply of broken bread, a knob of butter,
salt and pepper with boiling water poured over, this is said to cure a sore
throat if drunk in bed. More medicinal than pleasurable?
Elsewhere there are mentions of an ancient Cornish bread soup known
variously as Kettle or Kiddley Broth. Made with a little onion cooked in
butter or dripping or with a few rashers of streaky bacon, then stewed with
plenty of water (and sometimes a splash of vinegar), additionally flavoured
with marigold petals in one version, and poured over squares of stale bread
for serving, this sounded more promising than the Suffolk cough remedy. I
tried it but was uncharmed.
It struck me then that, given Cornwall's coastline, seafood might make an
appropriate alternative to fat bacon. So I adapted the manuscript version of
the recipe to suit my own whims. The resulting soup lacks historical
accuracy of course but it tastes pretty good.
To make My Kiddley Broth for two people, first chop a shallot or two (or
half a small onion) and sweat it for 5 minutes in 2 tablespoons butter or
olive oil. Add 1 teaspoon white wine or tarragon vinegar and let it bubble
up vigorously.
Add  1/4 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons chopped flat leaf parsley (or better
still coriander leaves) and 1 pt water. Bring to the boil and boil for 2-3
minutes.
Add  3/4 lb cleaned mussels, cover and cook briefly until opened. Lift the
cooked mussels from the broth and half-shell them, shell them completely, or
leave them as they are, as you wish. Then mix them with 3oz good quality,
roughly torn bread and spoon the broth (but not any sandy mussel sediment)
over them.
Britain is of course meat-rich dairy country and we are notoriously
sweet-toothed. So it is hardly surprising to discover that, whereas other
countries used their loaves to make substantial water-based soups, we
generally preferred to dunk our stale bread in milk to make puddings.
Our recipe books are jam-packed with examples of this kind. Think of queen
of puddings, quaking pudding, bread and butter pudding, brown bread ice
cream, charlottes and ambers, summer pudding, treacle tart, poor man's
bakewell, and the use of breadcrumbs instead of flour for superior steamed
sponges.
I can think of only one traditional savoury way with stale bread that has
survived here. Bread Sauce, made with creamy milk and butter, flavoured with
onion and cloves, thickened to a porridge with stale grated crumbs, is
probably as popular now with roasted poultry and game birds as it was in the
middle ages when crumb-thickened, rather than roux based sauces, were the
norm.
Then there is the sweet equivalent of bread sauce: bread and milk, once a
nursery favourite but largely forgotten today except for feeding pet
hedgehogs. What a shame. I loved it as a child and I love it now, a basic
inelegant version of bread and butter pudding but even more comforting by
virtue of its instant, effortless preparation. It is the cure-all I turn to
gratefully when low in spirits or poor in health, when bed, a good book and
a hot water bottle beckon. Or I will eat it for breakfast on a cold morning.
Any excuse will do.
For Bread and Milk for 1-2 people, depending on the degree of comfort
needed, break 3oz or so of chollah, brioche or other enriched white bread
into pieces. Plain white bread will do at a pinch but bread and milk should
be a treat. Butter the bread and sprinkle it with pinches of ground
cinnamon. Add smears of honey if you like and put the bread into a bowl or
bowls. Scald  3/4 -1pt Jersey milk with a shake of pure vanilla extract,
sweeten it with 2 teaspoons vanilla sugar (or slightly less if honey is
used) and add an optional teaspoon of brandy. Pour the flavoured milk over
the bread and stir until the crumb sponges up and the butter is melted.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A collector's menu - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the interest shown in the sale of the late Elizabeth David's
kitchen contents and books, a lot more people are becoming interested in the
history of food and drink.
To answer this demand Liz Seeber and her Austrian husband, Gerd, have set up
Antiquarian Cookery Books at their home in south London.
Liz Seeber had the idea for the company when she inherited a library of
7,000 books in the US. She had to auction the bulk of them and was only able
to bring back about 1,200 of the most interesting and valuable to Britain -
but the book bug had bitten.
Having spent most of her life in publishing - she is a keen book collector
and amateur cook - Seeber feels that now is the time to have some fun by
turning her hobby into an occupation.
If, for example, you are interested in buying Hannah Glasse's The Art of
Cookery, then Seeber has a couple of editions - including one printed in
London in 1796 for six shillings - at Pounds 175 each.
An early Isabella Beeton's The Book of Household Management (Ward, Lock and
Tyler), is priced at Pounds 110 and, for those who missed out on the
Elizabeth David memorabilia auction, a first edition of English Bread and
Yeast cookery, possibly David's best and most scholarly book, is available
in good condition for Pounds 35.
Do not think you have to fork out a fortune on early English cookery books -
prices start as low as Pounds 5 or Pounds 6 and cover many national
cuisines. And there are some quirky little bargains in the list - Norman
Douglas's Venus in the Kitchen (Heinemann) is a mere Pounds 15 for the 1952
first edition.
Drinkers need not feel left out - first editions ranging from Hugh Johnson's
1971 The World Atlas of Wine (Pounds 25) and Andre L Simon's The Commonsense
of Wine (Pounds 6.50) are listed.
A catalogue giving the prices, illustrators, publishers and detailed
condition of each book can be obtained free from Liz Seeber, Antiquarian
Cookery Books, 10 The Plantation, London, SE3 OAB. Tel: 081-852-7807.
Fax:081-318-4675.
Business is mainly by mail order but visitors are welcome by appointment.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Fashion: Baby dolls with a tough message - Comment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fashion, the source of much innocent pleasure, is capable of arousing an
extraordinary amount of displeasure. It has always been so. Moralists
throughout the ages have predicted the downfall of civilisation on the
grounds of an excess of sequins, five-inch heels or stressed whalebone.
But their homilies were never as disturbing as the current outpourings of
gibberish to which fashion is falling victim.
Possibly the worst example is the theory which is glibly advanced for
fashion's current preoccupation with a waif-like body and clothes which, in
their brevity and their winsomeness, remind some commentators of the
children's department at Harrods.
This style, says the new generation of style police, is paedophilic and
utterly to be deplored. Their analysis does not go beyond this catchword but
it is such a loaded word that it hardly needs to.
Headlines and hints are quite enough to communicate the horror and revulsion
readers are intended to share. Do those commentators understand the term
they are using? Or is it just a smart word with lots of syllables that gets
their story on to the front page.
Some certainly do and one can only assume that they do not understand what
they see on the catwalks of international fashion designers and, more
importantly, on the streets of our cities.
We have just emerged from one of the most stultified and stultifying periods
of fashion history, a period in which the ideal woman was trussed up in
tight, rigidly structured clothes which projected a self-conscious, mature
sexuality. Paradoxically, women did not feel they could be taken seriously
in the workplace, never mind the boudoir, if they were not displaying
well-propped cleavage and lengths of sheer-stockinged leg atop sharp
stilettoes.
The most that could be said for this swaying, hourglass-shaped parody of
what a transvestite thinks a girl should look like was that it took the most
unambiguously obvious symbols of femininity and transformed them into
aggressive weapons.
Traditionally regarded as a way of dressing which pleased men and,
therefore, placed the wearer in a dependent, eager-to-please role, it was
transformed into a way of dressing which intimidated men and put women in
control. The moth to the flame method of manipulation after Alexis Colby.
Many women hated it and refused to play. Thoughtful analysts of fashion were
torn between approving of it - because it obviously made women feel
empowered - and disapproving of it - because it made them look like
cartoon-character tarts.
But there was another style of dress running in parallel with the executive
tart and it was highly subversive. It consisted of leggings, a decency
preserving top, and big, big boots; it looked extraordinarily like the
costume for a particularly competent principal boy.
The women, usually but not always younger women, who adopted this style
swaggered rather than minced. While they sat with their legs comfortably
hitched over the arm of the chair, their micro-skirted sisters wriggled
uncomfortably, attempted to cross theirs seductively and prayed their
knickers were not showing.
As we all know, the principal boy is an innocent, virtuous, straightforward
kind of character. The baby doll look which young women are enjoying at
present is a simple development of both the look and the mood it represents.
It is about innocence rather than experience, suggestion rather than
insistence. It is tentative, approachable, youthful, instinctive and
free-spirited. Unlike the principal boy look which is gamine, androgynous
and deliberately jokey, it is incontestably feminine.
But no modern young woman wants to look like a real baby doll. This is a
baby doll with an edge. She may be an innocent, but she's nobody's fool.
While the clean simplicity of her droopy little slip of a frock may tell
some of the truth about her, the whole story is a lot more complicated.
So she wears her hair sticking up in rats' tails that have taken hours to
construct and she either parodies the executive tart's stilettoes by wearing
them with ankle socks or climbs into the biggest, butchest pair of
mountaineering boots she can afford.
The details may be different but in its rejection of knowing
ultra-femininity, the baby doll is very closely related to the 1960s mini in
a way that the 1980s mini was not. As Mary Quant said at the time, the
mini-skirted swinger was trying very hard indeed not to look like her
mother. Consequently, she time-locked herself, metaphorically, into late
adolescence.
But she did not do it to titillate paedophiles; she did it to distance
herself from preceding generations and to identify with her own. Similarly,
today's skinny-shanked baby dolls do not imagine they are giving pleasure to
anyone who is sexually attracted to children.
But she does hope she will shock and alienate the complacently middle-aged
who think they know what an attractive female should look like. And she
hopes her message of innocence and toughness, wariness and openness, will
speak to the young men of her own generation.

FT  19 MAR 94 / How to Spend it: Furniture from the formidable Fendis - The
Italian fashion house's designs for the home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until now Fendi, the Italian fashion house, has been known mainly for its
expensive-looking luggage (distinguished as is customary in these circles by
initials, in this case, a reversed double F) and its swankily extrovert fur
collection.
It is also famous, in Italy at least, for being run by five go-getting
sisters - Anna, Carla, Franca, Alda and Paola.
In 1925, the first Fendi furs and small leather purses were made by Adele
Fendi in a small workshop in the Via del Plesbiscito in Rome. Though Rome is
filled with fine creators of desirable leather goods, the Fendis nonetheless
managed to attach to theirs the kind of aura that turned a piece of Fendi
luggage from being just a handy way of carting about belongings into a
grandiose statement about wealth and taste.
Their furs, too, have always had about them a kind of Roman swagger - at a
time when other designers were turning out furs that were discreet and
classical, Fendi made them fun (the in-house catch-phrase for what they did
was to 'demystify') which is why the choice of Karl Lagerfeld in 1964 as the
designer of the fur collection was so inspired.
It is true that these days his conscience about using fur is troubling him
and he has gone a bit sober on them but through most of his years as their
designer he has kept their collection right at the cutting-edge of the pelt
trade.
From furs and leather purses Fendi went on to provide more goodies for those
with Fendi tastes - ready-to-wear clothing, scarves, ties, gloves, pens,
stationery, shoes, lighters . . . name a life-style accessory and Fendi will
have provided it.
Every proper fashion house these days seems to feel the need to market a
fragrance, and so the Fendi fragrance for women was launched shortly after
the one for men.
You might have thought the Fendi world was now complete. You would have
thought wrong. From the concept of dressing the woman, it is but a short
step to dressing the home and this is what Fendi proposes to do.
It has expanded into what, for lack of more enterprising words, I can only
call the life-style arena - Fendi fans need no longer surround themselves
with furniture of dubious lineage.
Those who relate to the Fendi label can sit in Fendi chairs, lounge on Fendi
sofas and eat off Fendi tables.
Fendi Casa, as the furniture line is called, is designed by a group of
in-house designers but, as is the tradition of the house, one of the
formidable sisters, in this case Anna, supervises it.
The best thing to be said about the range is that it looks unquestionably
Italian. But this is not the Italy of the cornetto, of Neapolitan arias,
Venetian gondolas and pizzerias, but the quiet dignified Italy that exists
behind the shutters in even the busiest cities.
It reminds one of the shaded sitting-rooms in tall Milan houses, of quiet
formal dining-rooms in Roman apartments. As the photograph of the
sitting-room shows, the simple lines of the room are never dull, the lack of
clutter generates a feeling of great strength and tranquillity.
The design lineage, which the house of Fendi openly acknowledges, is
Biedermeier, fin-de-siecle Vienna and the best of Art Deco.
Not all the pieces are to my personal taste - a few suffer from the
over-heaviness of line common in bourgeois Italian homes - I like best the
strong chair photographed here (Domiziana) and the less formal range known
as Espositore.
Here there is little that is startlingly new but much that is pleasing. The
range depends upon using very chic fabrics in a soft, draping, informal way.
Though today the idea of abandoning stiff upholstery in favour of loose
draped fabrics may seem old-hat, when Fendi first launched it in 1988 it was
quite new in its field. The notion that very expensive furniture might
borrow from the slightly Bohemian aesthetic of the Hippy seemed, at the
time, quite revolutionary.
Instead of taking the Indian bedspread or the Bedouin rug, however, Fendi
has taken severely striped fabric and used it to drape sofas, cover tables,
upholster steamer chairs, directors' chairs and folding tables. The effect
is nonchalant and offers the sort of furniture that could fit into almost
any home from the formal to the most laid-back.
Though Fendi Casa has been around for a little while in Italy, it is only
for the first time becoming available in the UK. It is on sale, exclusively
to order, through Charles Page, 61 Fairfax Road, Swiss Cottage, London NW6
4EE (tel: 071-328 9851).
In the shop there are a few examples of the range to be seen and tested as
well as samples of the whole fabric range. Every piece of furniture can be
covered in any of the fab-rics.
Prices are not low - fine leather and high-quality fabrics are used
throughout. Domiziana, for instance, the chair photographed, costs Pounds
1,435, while the Farnese range of chairs and sofas run at about Pounds 965
for a single chair, Pounds 1,930 for the two-seater sofa and Pounds 3,050
for a three-seater sofa.

FT  19 MAR 94 / How to Spend it: No match for a pair of shoes - Stand out in
a crowd with odd footwear.  A Spanish designer and producer with an original
range - from the asymmetrical, to more classic styles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone accustomed to buying shoes that are absolutely identical has probably
not stopped to consider whether there is some immutable law behind this
perfect symmetry.
Since our childhood, shoes have come in pairs and the likelihood was that
they would do so for ever more.
But Camper, a Spanish company based in Majorca, decided to look at the
matter differently. 'Why,' it asked, 'is that throughout history a pair of
shoes has always been made symmetrical, the left exactly the same as the
right?'
And it followed this up with another question: 'Why can't a pair of shoes be
disparate, asymmetrical and the left different from the right?' Twins, after
all, are not necessarily identical and sometimes even scarcely resemble each
other.
It went on to point out that the notion of asymmetry has a distinguished
architectural lineage - from Gaudi and Le Corbusier in the fields of
architecture to Vionnet, Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo in the
field of fashion.
From there it was a short step to an exercise in exploring the asymmetrical
pairs of shoes, some of which are photographed here. The kinship between the
shoes is obvious - there could be no mistaking that they belong to the same
pair and yet each left is subtly, and sometimes not so subtly, different
from the right.
For those who find this breaking of the established rules of footwear a
trifle alarming, Camper does produce other ranges which, though less
innovatory, are just as interesting.
Its Camaleon line is a self-conscious recreation of a peasant shoe, the sort
worn by country people all over Majorca. The perfect shoe for the
ecologically concerned, it is made from unusable off-cuts of leather, worn
out tyres and strips of canvas.
It also occurs to me that it is the perfect shoe for those who dislike
anything that looks too new - these shoes look as if they have already been
to some interesting places before they leave the shop. For those who do not
lead the life of a country peasant these shoes are the sort to take on
holiday, to beaches, to Majorca perhaps.
Perfect for those who spend summer holidays on beaches or in hot climates is
the Terra collection. Based on the old-fashioned espadrille it has been
updated by dyeing the canvas with colours and patterns and using new
materials (rubber and natural rope) for the sole which give it greater
strength without detracting from the original 'look'.
Camper also has a range for real traditionalists - the Cartujano which aims
to marry traditional Spanish styling with fine quality leather. There are
soft loafers, brogues, boots - the whole gamut of classic footwear.
The Camper range can be found at Paul Smith of Floral Street, Covent Garden,
London WC2; Nichols of Birmingham; Matches of Wimbledon; Limeys of
Leicester, Sheffield, Derby, Nottingham; The Natural Shoe Store, 325 Kings
Road, London SW3; and 21 Neal Street, London WC2. Prices range from Pounds
45-Pounds 80.
If your tastes are more classic still it might be worth looking at the
Paraboot which has similarly romantic origins. Camper shoes are made using
traditional methods in little workshops all over Majorca, while the Paraboot
comes from the small village of Izeaux in the Isere region of France. The
original footwear produced in Izeaux was practical and sturdy, shoes for the
tough farming life, often made in the farmers' own homes with crude tools.
However, Remy Richard-Pontvert, a local cobbler, began to visit fine Paris
boutiques and saw that quality and finish were important if he wanted to
expand and sell to more sophisticated shoppers. While in America he saw
rubber-soled shoes. He went straight home and developed and then patented
his own rubber sole from which evolved the Paraboot (the rubber came from
Para in Brazil).
In France they are as well-known as Church's are in Britain. They are made
from fine full-grain leather and all the stitching is still done by hand.
They have only fairly recently been on sale in the UK but have already
become much sought after.
Most famous shoe in the range is possibly Michael, a soft casual lace-up but
there are loafers, brogues, boots, golf shoes and boat shoes. Prices range
around Pounds 105 a pair and the shoes can be found in good men's shoe
shops, including Office Shoes, Jigsaw for Men, Woodhouse and Selfridges in
London.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Sport: Smiles in the sunshine state - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a poignant moment in the deserted stadium that bright Florida
afternoon last January. 'Here dad, you'd better hit the first ball, you've
waited long enough]' Trey Buchholz tossed the balls across the net to his
father, Butch, who caught them and swung his racket to inaugurate a new era
at The Crandon Park Tennis Centre in Key Biscayne.
If the former US No 1 was smiling with quiet satisfaction, one could
understand it. For him, this was the realisation of a 30-year dream. It was
also the end of a five-year legal struggle against the Matheson family (who
had sold the 900-acre site to Dade County in 1940) and local opponents who
were worried that the construction of a 14,000 seat stadium would bring a
host of noisy sporting events and concerts to disturb the area's
tranquillity.
The political and environmental battle has cost millions in legal fees.
Butch and his brother Cliff owe more than Dollars 2m while Dade County has
run up an even larger bill. 'But it was worth it,' Buchholz insists. 'Back
in the 1960s when I was part of (Jack) Kramer's professional group that was
outlawed by the amateur game we used to sit around and look to the day when
all the amateurs and pros would be competing together in a great tournament
managed by the players. While our stage in those days was either a hangar or
an old exhibition building, we dreamt of one day staging a fifth Grand Slam
played in a super stadium somewhere.'
It is a pleasure to report that the dream has been realised. Gone are the
makeshift tents and trailers that have housed players, media and officials
since that first Lipton Championship back in 1985 at the Laver Resort in
Delray Beach. In their place, on a site that was once a rubbish dump, has
risen a Dollars 20m state-of-the-art facility containing comfortable
quarters for everyone, including the public, who have been attending this
year's 10-day tournament in record numbers. Furthermore, for the remaining
50 weeks of the year the public will be able to book the courts at Crandon
Park for their own private battles.
The tournament, a partnership between the ATP Tour, the Women's Tennis
Association, Dade County and the Buchholz brothers, may not be the fifth
Grand Slam but it offers prize money of Dollars 3.3m. Sponsorship provides
60 per cent of the income, the sale of boxes and ordinary tickets generates
30 per cent. Television rights, retail sales, concession income, programme
advertising and sales provide the balance.
An independent Economic Impact Study, conducted by the University of Miami
and the Miami Convention Bureau, has estimated that The Lipton, with its
attendance of more than 200,000, generates Dollars 103m in annual income for
the South Florida area.
A new dimension has been added to the venue by the establishment of the
USTA's National Training Department at the site under the direction of Ron
Woods and former Wimbledon and US Open champion, Stan Smith. The director of
coaching is former Tour player Nick Saviano who I have admired for his
dedication in instilling a professional approach among the young American
players he has guided on overseas trips.
'We have a perfect setting here,' says Saviano. 'Eventually there will be
four red clay courts like the ones in Europe, four green American clay
courts, plus two grass and 17 hard courts. We shall at last be able to
prepare our players properly, wherever they are bound.' Saviano recognises
that the young Americans have fallen behind the rest of the world. 'There
was a time when the top Americans in their age groups were automatically as
good as anyone in the world. That is no longer the case.'
This week Andre Agassi has been setting the pace. His straight sets wins
over two former world No 1s, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, have confirmed
the effectiveness of the wrist surgery that he resorted to after an injury
plagued year in 1993. 'We are assessing it week by week', he said.
The on-court Agassi certainly looks sharp and fast, more like the man who so
delighted us at Wimbledon in 1992. 'It's definitely coming along much
quicker than I expected', he said. 'My fitness speaks for itself.'
The Agassi '94 should prove a very tasty vintage.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Motoring: The real thing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For my drive to Geneva this year, I chose a Mercedes C-250 diesel automatic.
It gave me 34.25 miles per gallon (8 l/100km) over almost 1,200 miles
(1,932km) of fast autoroute cruising, leisurely driving on near-deserted
roads following the canal de Bourgogne, two crossings of the Col de la
Faucille, and jostling with Geneva's traffic.
Without retracting a word of my criticism of the nasty trim materials used
in some C-Class cars in a bid to appeal to younger buyers, I have to say my
leather-trimmed C-250 looked and felt a real Mercedes. It gurgled softly at
start-up from cold, but then ran so quietly at anything between 60mph and
100mph (97-161kmh) that one forgot it was a diesel.
One of the most agreeable aspects of driving a diesel is the way they reward
roadcraft. By looking as far ahead as you can, and anticipating what is
there, you cover the miles more smoothly and far more economically than any
hot-shot driving a petrol-engined car on the accelerator and brake. And you
arrive unstressed.

FT  19 MAR 94 / As They say in Europe: A Titanic sinking on the rugby field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is reason to believe that today could be marked by extraordinary, even
catastrophic, events. If France lose their final match in the five nations'
rugby championship against Scotland this afternoon, there is fair chance the
team will be wiped out by a public driven beyond all reasonable levels of
tolerance. Even more amazing will be the sight of the French sports writers
disappearing en masse in a flash of spontaneous combustion, or flinging
themselves from the highest point of the Murrayfield stadium in Edinburgh.
There will be different motives. The commentators on the France-Inter radio
station will be enraged by the unfairness of it all. Their reporting of the
(losing) game against England in Paris a fortnight ago was enlivened, for
me, by the succession of invisible fouls committed by English players, and
by a total ignorance of rule 13 which the referee (rightly) used to stop
Thierry Lacroix having a second go at a conversion attempt when the ball had
fallen over. 'We are all Europeans and therefore impartial, but really . . .
' said Eric somebody or other into his microphone.
The game also 'appeared' entirely different because, in the mouths of the
commentary team, the distinctly unandrogynous England hooker, Brian Moore,
emerged as Brie-Anne Morre, surely an American hooker.
In the newspapers, however, there was no feeling that France were victims.
The French writers decided, unanimously, that there was just one problem:
their team was no good. This was not just a matter of losing against
moderate opposition, nor of failing to play up to expected standards. It was
a failure of cosmic proportions - a sinking of the Titanic on the rugby
field. It was the kind of failure of which the former - and much-maligned -
England soccer manager, Graham Taylor, could only dream.
There were hints of catastrophe in earlier matches. The wide but
insubstantial victory over Ireland at Paris's Parc des Princes in the first
match raised doubts. Defeat by Wales in Cardiff rang alarm bells. 'Le feu
rouge,' shouted L'Equipe on its front page. This play on words meant either
Welsh fire or a red traffic light. After that match, coach Pierre Berbizier
commented: 'I preferred today's defeat to the victory of two years ago. I
know how we were beaten, but not how we won last time here.'
That was a hostage to fortune. For, by the time England arrived in Paris,
the press wanted no more understandable defeats but a victory. Especially
against a side that always beat them, especially at home.
Disaster struck: France were beaten 18-14. On page one, L'Equipe shouted:
'Change all this for us.' Page two was headlined 'The great fiasco', while
the newspaper declared the French XV to be brain-dead on page three under a
headline that read: 'The encephelogram is flat.'
Midi-Olympique was relatively phlegmatic: 'France is passing through its
worst crisis since the second world war,' it said, before asking: 'How has
France fallen so low?' It then opened what it called 'The burning dossiers
of tricolour rugby.'
In the nation's rugby capital, Toulouse, La Depeche du dimanche began its
report: 'This new defeat by England undoubtedly marks the end of a team
which, decidedly, has nothing more to give, not the savoir-faire, nor the
indispensable success at this level.'
It concluded: 'At the end of such a mediocre, yet poignant, match, it is not
appropriate to put forward ideas; a delirium of destruction cannot be
avoided.'
The 'poignancy' of the match came in the way England played. It consisted of
everything that arouses Gallic scorn, admiration and resentment. England
were boring, disciplined, resolute, unimaginative. A former national
fullback, Pierre Villepreux, wrote in Liberation: 'The English had no
doubts, even when France were dominant. They played on a tactical base which
they fully mastered . . . a game which brought together their culture and
education.'
In a typically Marxist interpretation of rugby, Villepreux concluded that
what counted was a unity of practice and tactics - something the French
lacked entirely.
There is a new team for today which excludes Olivier Roumat, the captain
against England, Wales and Ireland. L'Equipe proclaimed: 'It is not yet the
Regency, nor is it the end of the Empire.' There has been no 'delirium of
destruction,' though. Thierry Lacroix, whose missed kicks probably cost
France victory two weeks ago, said he was prepared for anything. 'We've been
slaughtered by the press and television all week,' he said.
But the critics are keeping their powder dry. After all, if Wales beat
England, as they will, and France beat a Scottish XV missing its best
player, scrum-half Gary Armstrong, as they will, France will finish second
this afternoon. Not bad for a side 'without aggression, will or
imagination'.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Motoring: The Java - in tune with the times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The parallels are striking. The Bentley Java concept took the Geneva motor
show by storm this year; the Aston Martin DB-7 prototype was the sensation
of last year's show.
Both are the smallest models to come from makers which for years have
produced nothing but very large (and even larger-engined) sporting saloons
and coupes. They are in tune with the environmental awareness of our times.
Even though aimed at buyers rich enough not to have to worry about fuel
consumption, they are eco-friendlier than traditional Bentleys or Aston
Martins. And the DB7 costs about half as much as a V8 Aston Martin or
Lagonda.
Rolls-Royce Motors (which owns and makes Bentleys, too) set the Java concept
in motion nearly two years ago. It was a co-operative project with Design
Research associates, a small but internationally-renowned British industrial
design and styling house.
Rolls-Royce will spend the next year discovering if the Java appeals to
enough people who already own, or are likely to buy, its standard-sized cars
to make the Java's further development and eventual production worthwhile.
Then, it will have to find the money.
Here, the parallels start to diverge. Aston Martin had the good fortune to
be taken over by Ford at a critical time in its history. With Ford money and
engineering resources, plus an off-the-shelf engine from Jaguar (also a Ford
subsidiary), the DB7 moved so smoothly from prototype to small-scale
production that it will be on sale later this year. But the Bentley Java is
only at the start of the development curve.
The truly beautiful car unveiled at Geneva on press day last week looked as
if it could be driven out of the Palexpo building and on to the sun-drenched
autoroute to Lausanne. In truth, it was not even a runner. The 3.5-litre,
V8, twin-turbo engine due to power it is still being developed by
Rolls-Royce's associate company, Cosworth Engineering, of grand prix racing
fame.
If Rolls-Royce decides to go ahead, it would be 1999 before the Java could
reach the showrooms. And where would the money come from? Perhaps it is no
more than a straw in the wind, but few visitors to the Rolls Royce/Bentley
stand were taking a closer interest in the Java than Bernd Pischetsreider,
BMW's chairman.
Were Rolls-Royce to link with another car-maker, BMW is considered the
likeliest partner; the two firms have been talking informally for several
years. With Rover, the biggest British-owned manufacturer swallowed already,
BMW might well fancy the most famous one for dessert.
At the opposite end of the market was another eye-catcher; Ford's hot
pink-coloured Ka, which is not shorthand for a motor car but the name of an
ancient Egyptian spirit. The Ka, smaller than a Fiesta, has a very long
wheelbase to maximise interior space and ride comfort, curvy body panels,
and all the latest safety features. Ford claims it will be fun to drive -
something that first-time buyers and women drivers are said to look for when
choosing a car.
Spaciousness is one of the features of Audi's mould-breaking A8 luxury
saloon, which has the longest interior of any car in its class. Two versions
of this trend-setter, which is made almost entirely from light alloy, go on
sale later this year.
The 2.8-litre, 174 horsepower V6 has front-wheel drive and a five-speed
manual gearbox (four-speed automatic an optional extra); the all-wheel
driven, 4.2-litre, 300 horsepower V8 quattro comes only with Tiptronic
transmission. Tiptronic, used first by Porsche, combines the best features
of manual and automatic. You can leave the selector lever alone and drive
the car like any other automatic, or shift gears clutchlessly for yourself.
The Audi A8 promises to compete head-on with BMW's soon-to-be-unveiled
7-Series as well as the perennial best-selling luxury car, the Mercedes-Benz
S-Class, which was shown with some minor cosmetic changes to make it look a
little smaller. Big, it seems, is no longer beautiful, even among German
buyers of top management cars.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Sport: England to triumph on a mighty occasion - The Five
Nations' Championship / Rugby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something is wrong. Something is going right with English sport.
First, Terry Venables' appointment is applauded, second, Ray Illingworth
comes in from the cold to take the reins of the England cricket team and,
late yesterday, the Rugby Football Union continued this uncanny run of
common sense by appointing Jack Rowell, the Bath coach, to be the new guru
for the national side.
The announcement was expected on Monday - but its timing gives him the
chance of being fully involved with this afternoon's game.
Rowell's appointment will be widely welcomed, except perhaps by a few
die-hards within the RFU executive committee. Rowell's precise role will
need to be carefully defined over the coming months. He may want to merge
the role of manager and coach.
Dick Best is the present England coach, but the jury is out on his
contribution to the England set-up over the past three years. He is an
enlightened coach but his work for England has gone largely unnoticed. Geoff
Cooke has retained all the power in selection.
In particular, Best lost the case for Stuart Barnes, the Bath captain, as
the pivot on which to base his England team. Without Barnes, a running
outside-half, Best lost the architect of his tactics.
Instead, we have had a diet of unrelieved boredom from the England camp, the
win against the All Blacks notwithstanding.
The England team, instead of building another dimension to their game, as
the Australians did between their Grand Slam in 1984 and their winning of
the World Cup in 1991, has gone from rags to riches to rags in an identical
period of time. And, in between, France and now Wales have made great
strides to catch up.
Cooke's control of the England team was suffocating the side. He needed to
relieve Carling of the captaincy and allow Dean Richards, one of his
bete-noires, the chance to lead the side until after next year's Rugby World
Cup.
Rowell's appointment may lead to a shake-up in the England team. He will
probably replace Andrew with Barnes and ask Will Carling to stand down as
captain. He is also likely to call on all his powers to ensure a fit Jeremy
Guscott at centre. If one player has been missed this season, it has been
Guscott.
We might just have reached the same conclusion over gifted Welsh centre
Scott Gibbs who has also been absent for the tournament. Without him though,
Welsh back play has matured and developed beyond expectations.
This is not just because of Neil Jenkins' coming of age, but because of his
right-hand man in the centre, Nigel Davies. For me, Davies has been the
player of the championship. Unsung and largely unheard of, he missed the
Canadian debacle in November and, through injury, the French game four weeks
ago.
But Davies has an acute tactical brain, safe hands and is a sound kicker.
Above all, he has one exceptional gift, he makes time for himself. The
Llanelli player will have his toughest game today against Carling. It will
be one to savour.
Romantics will want a Welsh victory. After all, there were supposed to be
only two teams in this championship, England and France. My how we all got
that wrong.
Commentators are already concluding that Wales' chance of achieving the
Grand Slam has come too early for the team. This is nonsense. Nothing comes
too early in sport.
Nevertheless, this is a wounded England side and there is nothing more
dangerous. They played so abjectly against Ireland that they still have
something to prove to their loyal supporters.
The side has developed a symbiotic relationship with them and they will want
to provide a game to talk about and a game with which to thank Geoff Cooke
for his sterling work over the past seven years.
The game again hinges on the play of the respective back-rows. Dean Richards
has that uncanny knack of always being in the right place at the right time.
His presence enables Ben Clarke to play a slightly wider game, one that best
fits the likes of Victor Ubogu and Tim Rodber. It is their pace over the
ground - which the Welsh lack - where the game will be won.
I do not see England being unduly bothered about tries in spite of the media
interest. They will want a win and will steel themselves to ensure it is by
the requisite 16 points so that they can claim the championship. I believe
they will do it. Twickenham is again host to another mighty occasion.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Spring snow is a grey area - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The snow in lower Austria is melting fast: I have just enjoyed a great day's
skiing in Kitzbuhel, but it is impossible to ski all the way down the
Hahnenkamm without hitting patches of mud.
Temperatures began to rise a couple of weeks ago. Christian Berger, tourist
director for the Soll area, said: 'Until 2 weeks ago we had wonderful
conditions even though this was the warmest winter for 100 years. But last
week the temperatures were higher than in Turkey or Greece. It was 25'C in
Innsbruk and even 21'C up here in the mountains.'
Now, there is virtually no snow - slushy or otherwise in some low-lying
villages. When we drove past Hopfgarten on the other side of the mountain
from Soll, a popular haunt with British skiers, the lack of snow was plain
for all to see.
My plans to ski down from Soll have melted along with it. But then the
pistes down to Hopfgarten are traditionally the first to lose their snow.
The conditions alarmed a dozen or more members of the Allegany Ski Club from
Maryland. They arrived from the US a week ago for what they were hoping
would be 'skiing like they have in the Rockies'. They were shocked to see so
many green fields basking in so much sunshine.
Mike Fetchero, the organiser, found himself under siege from his group, most
on their first skiing trip to Europe.
'It's a long way to come for Florida-type weather,' he said. 'I admit that
most of the group was upset by the spring-like conditions, but by taking a
two-hour bus-ride up the Stubei glacier, we've had some good skiing. And
we've met so many nice people and enjoyed such good sight-seeing that it
doesn't really matter.'
But this does not mean Austria has no snow.
The ski club did not really need to bus to Stubei, one of seven Austrian
glacier areas which currently report good snow, and which manage year-round
skiing. Kitzbuhel still has plenty of good skiing between Jochberg and Pass
Thurn, and although you can no longer ski from Soll to Hopfgarten, you can
still get to Brixen, Westendorf or Scheffau. It is just that conditions are
more than a little spring-like.
'It is spring on Monday after all,' said Marion Telsnig at the Austrian
Tourist Office in London. 'The conditions are good,' she said, 'for the time
of year. The problem with British skiers is that they expect to ski from 8am
until the lifts close every day. The Austrians are a little more laid back
about it. They realise that in springtime, you ski till lunchtime and then -
when the snow gets a little sticky - you do something else.'
Whatever the official line, skiers are entitled to expect decentish skiing
in the first part of March, and this time last year they had it even here in
low-lying Kitzbuhel.
But this year, both Austria's and Italy's lower slopes are becoming bare
earlier. France, on the other hand, with higher skiing areas, is still
reporting great skiing. Austria itself still has good snow on both upper and
lower slopes in its stalwart traditional high-spots of Ischgl, Obergurgl and
St Anton.
Whether you call it slushy, spring-like, good, or excellent, the quality of
skiing in Austria's lower resorts in middle to late March is something of a
grey area. But not really a white one.
Meanwhile, out of my window I can see it is snowing again - not enough to
whiten the lower slopes, but a handy sprinkling higher up. If it carries on,
spring might have to wait after all.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Despatches: Detour to danger in Soweto - Gordon Langridge
tells how a day trip ended in robbery at gunpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON LANGRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was never our intention to go to Soweto. On the contrary we thought it
would be not only unsafe but ghoulish to visit so tragic a centre of
violence and misery.
So, on the eve of our only day in Johannesburg, we asked the hotel porter to
arrange for us a tour of the city centre. This, he said, might be difficult:
there were tours to Soweto on a Sunday but not normally of Johannesburg.
In the event a city tour was arranged and my wife and I set off in a minibus
driven by an amiable and well informed African guide.
At the Carlton hotel in the city centre the driver had arranged to pick up
two other customers, a New Zealander and his Canadian girlfriend, both
doctors. While we waited for them the tour guide explained apologetically
that the newcomers wanted to go to Soweto hospital where the girl had done
part of her training. Would we mind going there?
Was the route safe? 'Absolutely,' he replied 'We go there every day and
avoid possible trouble spots.' And he assured us that the Sowetans were glad
to see foreigners and anxious that their problems should be understood
abroad. It seemed churlish and craven to refuse.
As we headed along the dual carriageway to the west of the city our
misgivings began to seem silly. When we stopped on the hard shoulder for the
New Zealander to take photographs of the workers' hostels we were at least a
quarter of a mile away from them.
Certainly the view was interesting: we had not realised, for example, that,
almost adjacent to the extensive barrack-like hostel area, was a tidy estate
of detached family bungalows, small but clearly respectable and well cared
for. Beyond them in the distance we could see the hospital.
Resuming our journey, our uneasiness returned with a vengeance, as instead
of keeping to the highway, the driver took a rough road which divided the
hostels from the housing estate, presumably to a short cut to the hospital.
We had driven slowly almost to the T-junction at the end of this road when
it happened: a blue Toyota saloon overtook and stopped in front of us. From
it appeared three or four armed youths, one of whom aimed a pump-action
shotgun at the windscreen of the minibus.
The other youths ran to both sides of the bus and forced open the doors. The
driver was made to get out and his place was taken by a member of the gang.
A shotgun, accompanied by angry shouts, was thrust through the doorway of
the bus to within inches of the New Zealander's face. He thought he was
about to be murdered but was told to hand over his camera and valuables and
get out of the bus. We all had to do likewise.
The robbery completed, the youths got into the bus and drove off.
Relief at having escaped with our lives, and uninjured, was soon overtaken
by the realisation that we were in the middle of the township without
transport or access to a telephone.
Neither our driver nor any of the bystanders offered any help. My wife
fortunately had the presence of mind to ask a pleasant looking young woman
standing at the door of her bungalow if we might come in.
The woman hesitated, clearly aware that helping us was not without risk to
her family, but then agreed that we might wait in the house. The woman, her
husband and their neighbours proved to be kind and friendly people.
The police were called and, while we waited, we were offered beer; coffee
was served in the best china cups. The house was immaculate, furnished and
maintained with evident devotion and care. There was a gentleness and quiet
goodwill about these people which was touching.
Many of them said almost as if it had become a conventional greeting, 'All
we want is peace,' and one believed them.
The police came within 15 minutes - not a bad response time for a district
where houses seem not to be numbered sequentially and streets are not
obviously named.
They arrived in an armoured vehicle and a flying squad car. Three young
white Afrikaners with machine guns and pistols, wearing flak jackets, came
into the bungalow and took up positions by the front and back doors.
They clearly took seriously the possibility that the incident had been set
up as a trap for them - it had happened before.
They were calm, professional, extremely courteous to our hosts, and even
friendly to us, although they must have thought we had behaved
irresponsibly. They relayed at once to other squad cars the detailed
description the New Zealander was able to give of the car the gang had used,
and they patiently took statements from each of us.
None of us could describe our attackers in any detail: we were even unsure
whether there had been three, four or five of them. Shock and fear it seems,
enfeeble the power of observation.
'What about the many other witnesses?' we asked. 'There won't be any other
witnesses,' was the reply.
We asked the police about their work. We supposed that tours of duty in
Soweto were short. Not at all, they explained: it takes so long to get to
know the district that they have to stay. One of them had done seven years
there already.
The police escorted us all out of the township and drove the young doctors
to Soweto hospital which, to our amazement, they still wished to visit. We
were interested only in returning to the calm and security of our hotel.
The next morning my wife went to a department store in the hotel complex and
asked for a gift voucher to be sent to the woman who had given us sanctuary.
'It will never get there,' the girl explained, 'she will have to come here
to collect it.' We very much hope she did.
Had we been foolish, or unlucky, or had we been set up? Certainly there were
conflicting views about the wisdom of a visit to Soweto.
The hotel porter and the tour guide had assured us that there was nothing to
fear. The two young doctors had been similarly advised by the friends they
were staying with in Johannesburg. Yet the white South Africans we told of
our experience were aghast that we had gone to Soweto and that the staff of
the hotel had offered tours there. In the words of a startled young girl in
the bank: 'No one goes there; people get killed in Soweto.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / FT Round the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. This week, they moved from North America to
Europe. Arnie writes:
We arrived in up-state New York to enjoy the Catskills ski areas: Belleayre
was fun, but we had been warned that Hunter Mountain would be 'a zoo' on a
Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised - no-one mugged us or offered us
drugs. Perhaps the armed security men helped.
We wanted to ski Cortina and Davos (the US versions) in preparation for
Europe, but only Cortina was open.
Then we lingered too long at genteel Windham, skiing a few runs with the
Austrian ski school director Franz Kirkl, and completed our 25th Everest (in
terms of vertical feet skied) in North America. Things got worse when we
became lost in New York and only caught the flight to Europe by the skin of
our teeth.
There is still time to win a skiing holiday in Courmayeur, or ski equipment,
by entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on March 5 (copies

FT  19 MAR 94 / The Nature of Things: Solitons on the crest of a wave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Scott Russell, a young Scottish engineer, was riding along the towpath
of the Forth-Clyde canal one day in 1834. The horse-drawn barge he had been
watching stopped suddenly but, to his amazement, its bow wave continued
travelling down the canal.
It took the form of 'a large solitary elevation, a rounded, smooth and well
defined heap of water, which continued its course without change of form or
diminution of speed'.
Russell followed the solitary wave - about 1 1/2 ft high - for more than a
mile down the canal before it lost its shape and disappeared. He was the
first scientist to describe this extraordinary wave form, known now as a
soliton, which maintains its shape and speed without widening and dispersing
in the usual way.
The soliton is an intriguing natural phenomenon. The best known example is a
tidal bore rushing up a river estuary, though satellite pictures have
occasionally shown solitary waves travelling for hundreds of miles across
the Pacific Ocean.
Today solitons are the subject of intensive research worldwide, not by
scientists interested in the natural world but by engineers who want to send
as much information as possible down optical fibres - the hair-thin glass
strands which will make up the global communications network of the 21st
century.
For optical communications, of course, the soliton consists of light instead
of water but the mathematical requirements are the same: the forces tending
to compress the wave must balance exactly those tending to disperse it. Too
much compression destroys the soliton as surely as too much dispersion; you
can see the effect in water by looking at incoming waves 'breaking' on a
beach.
By transmitting the zeros and ones of digital data as solitons instead of
the ordinary pulses of laser light used in current optical systems,
engineers hope to squeeze 10 to 100 times more information down the line.
It is impossible without using some technical jargon - and fiercely
oversimplifying the physics - to explain how the soliton keeps its shape as
it moves down the fibre. Any pulse of light, even one created by laser, has
a slight spread of wavelengths travelling at slightly different speeds. The
effect is gradually to smear out the pulse with time.
The compensating factor, which keeps the soliton together, is
'non-linearity': the presence of the light itself produces a slight
temporary increase in the speed of light in the fibre. This enables the back
of the wave to keep pace with the front.
Opto-electronic engineers at telecoms research centres such as Bell Labs in
the US and BT Laboratories in the UK have already achieved impressive test
results.
They have made solitons carry data over the equivalent of intercontinental
distances at a rate of 15bn digital 'bits' per second down a single fibre,
without any errors. That is enough to carry more than 1m simultaneous
telephone calls. Over short distances - equivalent to a local network around
a building - engineers have achieved soliton transmission at 100bn bits per
second.
However a huge development effort is still required by telecoms companies
and the manufacturers of optical fibres, lasers and associated equipment,
before soliton systems can be put into practical service. One challenge is
to control the timing; the lasers have to generate bursts of light lasting
no more than 10 picoseconds (10 million-millionths of a second).
Another is to overcome the unwanted 'noise on the line' that will be
generated by optical amplifiers on long-distance cables carrying intense
soliton traffic. And new computerised exchanges will be required to handle
the torrents of data.
But Richard de la Rue of Glasgow University, who heads one of the leading
academic research groups in the field, believes practical applications will
be under way before the end of the century and perhaps as soon as 1997. The
next transatlantic fibre optic cable, to be installed next year, will not
use solitons but the one after it might.
The introduction of soliton-based systems depends not only on technical
progress but also on continued rapid growth in demand for global
communications capacity. If the multimedia revolution lives up to its
advance billing, we will need not only solitons but also other
capacity-expanding innovations such as 'wavelength division multiplexing'
(adding new channels by sending solitons of different wavelengths
simultaneously down the same fibre).
If so, the transition from an inquisitive engineer observing the sedate
progress of a solitary wave along a Scottish canal to billions of solitons a
second streaming at the speed of light down an optical fibre will provide a
perfect image of scientific progress from the 19th to the 21st century.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Travel: An image of rural England set in stone - From the
south coast to Bath / Tracing the English stone belt, enjoy distinctive
landscapes at close quarters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The English stone belt - the seam of limestone that is the source of
England's finest building stone - runs from Dorset on the south coast to
Bath and then up through the middle of England to Lincoln and on to
Humberside. It cuts a green and rural swathe between the brick-built
industrial areas on the coasts. On the downs and wolds of the stone belt you
will find some of England's prettiest villages.
The limestones were laid by sedimentation millions of years ago, by the
rivers of a long-disappeared Jurassic continent. Minerals and tiny crustacea
were compacted into beds of stone, layer upon layer. As England slowly
formed, they were buried and then buckled and crumpled by continental shift,
emerging in places on the surface, ready to be quarried.
'If you really want to get to grips with limestone, James, you'll have to
climb on it', said a friend, kindly offering to help me do so. This is a man
whose idea of fun is technical climbing at 8,000m (26,000ft). I had done
only two days' climbing in my life, so I set off apprehensively.
We headed for the south coast, where the stone belt emerges in cliffs
between Swanage and Portland, in places 150m high. Cormorant, the climbers'
name for the outcrop we climbed, looked like a sheer face of limestone to
me.
It dropped to a graveyard of massive broken slabs, played over by the waves.
We abseiled off - a point of no return, I realised soon enough - and set
about climbing. On the way back up, Cormorant seemed an appropriate name,
even if the birds have been frightened off by men in fluorescent lycra.
In quieter moments, standing on a tiny ledge 100m up, I looked around. The
limestone strata were clearly visible in the cliff-face. There was no
quarrying here, but further down the coast I could see gaps like missing
teeth where the quarrymen had used a natural ledge to tunnel into the cliff.
From there the blocks were loaded straight on to boats for shipment.
Certainly I had an appreciation of limestone by the end of the day. I had
been hugging it, alternately wedged into crevices and clinging,
spreadeagled, on to exposed buttresses, wondering what on earth I was
supposed to do next. There was a certain intimacy in carefully picking tiny
hand-holds out of folds in the rock.
Afterwards, we took time out at the Square and Compass, a garden pub at
Worth Matravers where many a climber has sat with a pint of ale and verbally
picked his way back over the cliff-face. Like so many buildings in the area,
the pub (which takes its name from stone-masons' tools), is built of local
stone.
It was mid-summer, and the sun was gradually sinking, following its longest
path over the downs. Mid-June is a fine time of year and a pub garden a fine
place to witness it. With the first, absurdly green blooms of spring growth
just past, the trees were filling out and the hedgerows beginning to billow.
Purbeck marble is another distinctive stone that originates in this area. It
is a grey stone which overlies the limestone beds in thin seams and is
visible in places, protruding from the cliff-face. Purbeck marble is not a
marble at all, but is so called because it is one of the only British stones
to take a polish.
It was very popular in ecclesiastical buildings in the 13th century, and was
shipped all over the country alongside Portland and Purbeck limestones, to
be used for interior decoration. In Salisbury cathedral you will see slender
columns of Purbeck marble decorating the massive columns of the nave. Tiny
kidney-shaped crustacea - ooliths - are still visible in the stone.
Salisbury Cathedral, which is visible from the downs for miles around, is
built entirely of local Chilmark limestone - not far from the south coast
the stone belt disappears under the chalk downs of Hardy country,
re-emerging in the Vale of Wardour in northern Dorset and southern
Wiltshire.
In the 60 years from 1220, 60,000 tons of stone were carted from quarries 12
miles from Salisbury. Sadly, limestone steadily dissolves in water, and this
has left the cathedral sorely in need of repair, although the spire has been
restored. The Chilmark quarry was reopened to provide exactly the right
stone for the work.
The country around Chilmark and Tisbury, and on down to Sherborne, is
rolling, rounded hills. The villages hide in the small, tree-lined valleys,
and most of the houses are built of local stone from any of the many
quarries in the area. Here the roofs are thatched or laid with slate.
Tisbury has one of the country's largest tithe barns, with an enormous
thatched roof.
In the tiny lanes, the hedgerows were filled with wild roses and
elderflower. I was out walking when I came on some familiar-looking women
chattering and rootling around in the hedgerow. It was my mother and
godmother, gathering the year's crop of elderflower heads. Using elderflower
heads, water, sugar and some citric acid, you end up with a fine, and very
English, summer drink.
Limestone has many colours (resulting from the amount of iron oxide) and the
different quarries are known for their colour. Where Portland stone is very
white, the Cotswold stones are famed for their honey colour. Others have
tinges of ochre and even pink. Chilmark stone is light beige, with some
touches of green, best visible after rain. Add to this the yellow, white and
red lichens and the stone has an amazing variety.
The stone belt disappears below ground soon after Chilmark and appears again
in north Wiltshire, on the slopes of the Avon valley. Here, villages such as
Westwood and Freshford lie in wooded hollows, linked by tiny sunken lanes
where the greenery threatens to bar your way. The stone is light yellow and
golden and the antique, moss-covered roofing slates reappear.
I arrived in the local market town, Bradford-on-Avon, where pretty stone
buildings cluster on the hillsides in lines. Bradford is a friendly town,
its heart still at the medieval bridge, where the medieval stone buildings
of the Shambles, the old market, look on today's trade of bakeries and
bookshops.
Even the factory buildings are made of stone in Bradford. There was a big
trade in wool (sheep have traditionally been farmed in limestone areas) and
the factories stand in the centre of town on the river; the water from the
weirs was used for washing and for felting into cloth.
From Bradford I made my way along the Avon valley to Bath, cycling along the
towpath of the Kennet and Avon canal. Woollen cloth and Bath stone were
shipped along the canal early last century, but nowadays the barges carry
families on summer holidays. In two places the canal is diverted across the
river Avon on stone aqueducts.
Bath is known for its crescents, all built of local stone. Arranged in
uniform lines, they seem grand after the rural abandon of the nearby
villages, but they show off light honey-coloured Bath stone ('so soft and
creamy', according to one mason I met) strikingly when it shines in the
summer sun.
At school I was told that a man's nature is defined by the landscape around
him. I suppose I know a few Scotsmen with the demeanour of granite, but it
would be stretching the point to suggest that the soft contours of the stone
belt - or even the dependability of limestone - have done much to shape
Wiltshire's modern-day inhabitants. Still, travelling along the stone belt
gives you a glimpse of people living a very English existence, rural and
tranquil.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Travel: Life with the lions - Practical Traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You know what they say: if you come face to face with a north American
mountain lion, don't run away. Attack. They are as powerful as jaguars and
have teeth as long as your little finger, but mountain lions are basically
deferential.
They are also highly persecuted - or have been. For years, they have been
shot at by ranchers and hunters. Lion numbers are reckoned to have levelled
off recently. But US state game agencies still know too little about them to
ensure their survival in the face of expanding human numbers.
The most direct way to find out about the lions is to join one of the many
expeditions organised by Earthwatch. Since 1972 Earthwatch has supported
1,850 field projects in 104 countries by providing scientists with 40,000
volunteers, plus funds and equipment. It says its aim is to 'improve
understanding of the planet, the diversity of its inhabitants, and the
processes that affect the quality of life on earth'.
This is the sharp end of eco-tourism - a logical step forward for anyone
tired of the familiar itineraries and (sometimes) shop-worn package deals
strung together by commercial tour companies.
The mountain lion trips organised by Earthwatch take you to the Albion
mountains of Idaho. Five expeditions are scheduled this year: July 6-17,
July 27-August 7, August 17-28, September 7-18 and September 28-October 9.
The cost is Pounds 880 (Dollars 1,300) each, which covers food and
accommodation, plus a contribution to the project's overheads (staff, field
camp, vehicles, etc). Before leaving you get an expedition briefing (25-75
pages) outlining the history, aims and logistics of the project. Not
covered: transportation to and from the meeting point. In the case of the
mountain lions, this is Pocatello, Idaho.
Says Earthwatch: 'These are real scientific expeditions, not tours.
Earthwatch makes every effort to describe accurately field conditions in its
publications, but field work in remote locations is a delicate business and
prone to last-minute change. Certain details of your expedition may be
different from published descriptions.'
The Idaho lion project is trying to answer various questions. Example: what
costs does inbreeding impose on small, isolated lion populations? Depending
on season, Earthwatch teams help capture, radio-collar and monitor mountain
lions, and locate kill sites. All teams share cooking duties.
There is a huge range of Earthwatch expeditions on offer. You can look for
dinosaur remains in Argentina; study human origins in Uganda; visit the
mammoth graveyard at Hot Springs, South Dakota; ponder the rise and fall of
the Himalaya; track jaguars and other species in Peru; join a Bahamian reef
survey; photograph humpback whales off Hawaii; and observe the behaviour of
golden eagles on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. Almost all expeditions last 12,
13 or 14 days, with the cost generally falling between Pounds 800 and Pounds
1,200 each (plus travel to the pick-up point, visas, insurance and
side-trips). Under some circumstances, part of the cost may be
tax-deductible, even for UK tax-payers.
You have to be a member of Earthwatch to join these expeditions: Pounds 25
annually (family membership: Pounds 30). Details: Earthwatch Europe, Belsyre
Court, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HU. Tel: 0865-516366, fax:

FT  19 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Mummy's boy to businessman - The
25-year-old boss of a leather company with 18 employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People called him boring, a workaholic, a mummy's boy. But they have grown
to respect him. For at the age of 25 Ranu Miah is employing 18 people in a
successful London business.
His company makes leather coats, jackets, trousers and skirts for 10 shops
in London, south-east England, Ireland and Manchester. The shops pay on
delivery because they know they can quickly sell what he supplies.
'A lot of businesses go down because they give a lot of credit. And I don't
want to be a finance company,' he says.
Ranu is successful in a trade which for most of the Bangladeshi leather
workers around Brick Lane in East London, has offered only a poor living -
making jackets as rapidly as possible for wholesalers out of leather which
the wholesalers provide.
Today, many have lost even this living, because wholesalers buy garments
from Pakistan or India.
Ranu's success, however, is based on a thorough knowledge of leather
manufacture and sharp fashion sense. 'Because I am young,' he says, 'I know
what will sell. I read the fashion magazines. On Mondays I get feedback from
the shops.
'Other people are now doing the styles we had two years ago. When they copy
something, we get rid of it.'
Ranu was born in Bangladesh, where leatherwork is not regarded as a good
job. But Bangladeshis settling in East London found work with Jewish leather
businesses.
He was brought to Britain in 1979 by his father, the first Bangladeshi to
run a restaurant in Brick Lane. The restaurant became a haven for new
Bangladeshi arrivals: 'He was like the Salvation Army,' says Ranu.
'My father wanted me to study,' Ranu recalls, 'and I got a job in a bank. I
didn't find it very pleasant. My supervisor said I didn't do the work right.
I knew she had more power than I had, so I left.'
He had been out of work six months when a relative offered to teach him the
leather trade. He learned quickly and started working for another leather
business as well. To widen his experience he began working for a company
called Gap.
Then, aged 19, he used savings to take a room and start his own business, R
&amp; S Fashions. His sewing machines came from a partner in a firm that was
splitting up, and a novel method of payment was agreed: 'I knew he was
looking for a job, so I said: 'I will give you a job in our place and we
will slowly pay you what we owe.''
Ranu's old boss at Gap promised to provide him with business, but first he
needed an alarm to protect the leather supplies. With advice from the East
London Small Business Centre, he received a Home Office grant for Pounds
750, three-quarters of the cost.
The centre also made him a Pounds 3,000 loan. A local bank, however, would
not let him open an account, even after the accountant handling his VAT
recommended him. 'Finally the manager heard me shouting and gave me an
account.'
The deal with Gap did not last long. 'Their quality was high and we couldn't
manage it,' says Ranu.
For the first 18 months, Ranu did not pay himself any wages. 'My parents
couldn't give me any money for the business but they looked after me.'
He found work with other wholesalers but decided it would be better if he
handled his own wholesaling. Armed with a reference from a customer, he
reached an agreement to buy leather from an Irish merchant.
Then he visited the manager of a shop selling clothes provided by a
wholesaler who had made them. He told the manager: 'I can supply you at a
better price but I can't give you credit.'
He realised that quality of service gave him an advantage: Ranu could meet
almost any request from customers. A rival wholesaler could have 100
customers, but might not be able to provide the required the sizes and
colours instantly.
Ranu spent the slack part of the year recruiting customers.
There followed two significant steps: he hired larger premises, with an
office, from a Bangladeshi millionaire: 'Customers like to talk to you and
have a cup of tea,' he says.
And he switched his bank account to a branch in Liverpool Street. His old
branch 'didn't like the leather business. They thought we were going to go
bust. They wouldn't give me an overdraft.'
The Liverpool Street branch understood the problems caused if the cheques he
wrote to pay for leather supplies were cleared more quickly than those he
received from shops. He buys leather on 30-day credit and saves money by
paying early.
In the year to last August he recorded turnover of Pounds 113,000 with a
profit of Pounds 10,000. In the current year he reached Pounds 113,000
turnover in four months.
Young Bangladeshis, he says, are no longer going into the leather trade but
into higher education. 'They no longer just want money. My younger brother
who is 20 isn't talking of working. He's talking of studying. But this is my
hobby as well as my work.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Care in a coffee cup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MIDDLETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Campaigning on third world issues has not traditionally interested the
retail giants.
Which makes it surprising that a small Edinburgh-based company with no
full-time employees has persuaded six supermarket chains to stock a brand of
coffee from which the proceeds go to improving the lot of Latin American
hill farmers.
Cafedirect was formed as a profit-making venture by Oxfam Trading, Equal
Exchange, Traidcraft and Twin Trading, all of which use trade rather than
aid to stimulate economic growth in developing countries, and are
non-profit-making.
Their strategy was to buy coffee direct from Latin American hill farmers, at
a price that would give the farmers a more secure economic footing than in
the past. Pauline Tiffen, a journalist who has become Cafedirect's Latin
American liaison officer, explained: 'We wanted to pay a price that would do
more than just cover their costs.
'The aim was that they should be paid enough to introduce mechanisation, to
cover any unforeseen contingencies, like frost, and to have a little bit of
profit left over at the end.'
The going rate for the raw crop has been depressed since the collapse of the
International Coffee Agreement in 1969, which caused a glut of cheap coffee.
Cafedirect decided to pay roughly twice the going rate.
But in spite of this, Cafedirect charges Pounds 1.55 for an 8oz pack of
ground coffee, only slightly more than the average supermarket price.
The company is reticent about how it manages it, refusing to reveal the
extent of its initial capitalisation or volume of sales.
However, it will confirm that it does not employ anyone. Its four board
directors have full-time jobs with the founding organisations, while all
other Cafedirect workers operate on a consultancy basis, charging an hourly
rate.
Thus Lorna Young, Cafedirect's marketing director, works about three days a
week for Equal Exchange, her employer, and two days a week for Cafedirect.
She sits at the same desk in the same Edinburgh office all week, but she
logs the hours spent on Cafedirect work, and submits an invoice accordingly.
It was Young, a former publishing executive, who first began knocking on
supermarket doors in 1992. Within six months she had persuaded Waitrose to
stock Cafedirect nationwide. Safeway followed last spring, and Gateway (in
200 stores), Tesco (120), Asda (70) and Sainsbury's (60) have followed
since.
'I think we've surprised a lot of people by how well we've done in how short
a time,' says Young. 'I know our rivals would be very interested to know how
much we're selling, and although I'm not prepared to put a figure on it, I
can say that orders have tripled in the last 18 months.'
The number of suppliers has also increased. Tiffen estimates that by the
middle of this year, farmers growing coffee for Cafedirect will total
214,000, from 13,000 in 1992. All of them are based in Costa Rica, Mexico or
Peru, most are part of some form of collective organisation, and all have to
move the coffee to a port for shipment to the UK.
Cafedirect has only a small share of the UK ground coffee market, which in
turn accounts for only 10 per cent of the total UK coffee market (instant
coffee has 90 per cent).
And its advertising makes much of the fact that the collectives they buy
from frequently put profits to communal use, building schools and hospitals,
employing teachers and doctors.
The advertisements also claim that farmers paid only the going rate for
their coffee are frequently forced to abandon their land and move to the
city - or move into a more sinister branch of agriculture.
'Coca grows like a weed and is altogether much less hard work than growing
coffee,' says Tiffen, who has seen drug cartels exert pressure during her
visits to Cafedirect growers in remote mountain and jungle regions.
The implication of these claims is that Cafedirect's rivals are exploiting
the farmers, a suggestion strongly resisted by Allan Allbeury, spokesman for
food group Nestle, which makes Nescafe.
'We are as keen as anyone to ensure the well-being of our primary
producers,' he says. 'But because we need to buy in such volume, we have no
option but to buy on the open world market.
'We feel that the best interests of the largest number of farmers will be
best served not by localised agreements, but by a price rise on the open
market.'
Lorna Young agrees: 'We would be delighted if the price of world coffee were
to go up to a fair level. Although we are a profit-making company, and we
are definitely a trading organisation rather than a campaigning
organisation, I think we would all be very pleased if world coffee prices
went up and we went out of business because there was no longer any need for
us.'

cent respectively
Commission paid: Not disclosed
Nil commission terms available? Yes, through any adviser or salesman. Actual
terms are standard and not negotiable
Recurring single premium? Yes Expense ratio (net expenses plus commissions
paid divided by net premiums received): 19.4 per cent in 1991, 24.5 per
cent** in 1992, 18.2 per cent in 1993 (industry average last calculated in
1991 at 19.3 per cent)
Reduction in yield* (equivalent annual percent charge over the life of the
contract): 1.5 per cent on 25 year unit-linked personal pension (industry
average 1.6 per cent). Below average on most contracts and terms
Penalties on early retirement or termination: No actual exit charge but 40
per cent of premiums paid for first two years on long-term regular premium
contracts is deducted in charges
Performance*: Managed unit-linked excellent over 5 years, slightly below
average over 10; UK equity, excellent over 5 years, above average over 10;
international, good but decline since 1991; deposit and fixed interest,
long-term below average but short-term excellent; with-profits excellent for
all terms except five years which is average
*Source: FT Personal Pensions 1994 handbook, Pensions Management, Money
Management (March 1994 survey)
**Increase in 1991/2 largely due to significant drop in total single premium
business following decision to come out of with-profits bond market to
balance the society's mix between single and regular premium business.
Charges: At present life office illustrations of what your investment may
produce, use a standard basis for charges set by Lautro (the Life Assurance
and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). To reveal the impact of real
charges on the final fund of Norwich Union's managed unit-linked plan, we
asked for illustrations using actual charges for a man age 45 who expects to
retire at age 65 (ie, a 20-year contract), paying (a) Pounds 200 per month
and (b) a stand alone single premium of Pounds 10,000. Illustrations using
Lautro standard charges, which in fact are lower than those used by most
life offices, are shown in brackets. The last illustration gives a
theoretical value if no charges were deducted.

Where basic commission is paid, NU's charges are
significantly higher than the Lautro basis, yielding a
lower projected return. When the commission cost
stripped out, the reverse is true on the monthly premium

contracts.  The first set of figures assume only the
Lautro basic rate of commission, whereas actual rates
are likely to be in line with the industry average,
which is 30 per cent higher.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When relief is lost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have recently received a tax refund on account of my losses with Lloyd's
of London. In addition to losing my personal allowance for the relevant
years, I have also lost the business expansion scheme tax benefits on the
ground that the BES is an allowance and not a relief.
Is this right? And is there any way of recovering the allowance?
Your BES relief is lost irretrievably, unfortunately.
It is a pity that you did not (apparently) read the free Inland Revenue
pamphlet on the BES, IR51, before deciding to make the investment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am aged 79 and have about Pounds 10,000 of my Pounds 28,000 after-tax
income unspent each year. Can I give this surplus to my daughter without an
inheritance tax liability? If the answer is yes, do I have to ask or inform
the tax inspector?
If you wish to give the Pounds 10,000 annual excess to your daughter, we
suggest you document clearly, by letter or deed, your intention to make a
regular annual gift. You might also wish to set it up by way of a standing
order to your daughter so that it is clear the payment is to be made
regularly. In any case, it would appear that no IHT would be payable as the
gift would be paid out of net income and does not affect adversely your
usual standard of living. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy
Hayward).

I seem to recollect that when the Queen agreed voluntarily to pay capital
gains tax on her investments, the base values were to be calculated from
April 6 1993. Is this correct and, if so, why was a different date chosen
from that which applies to her subjects: viz, March 31 1982, plus
indexation.
April 6 1993 is simply the date from which the voluntary income tax and CGT
payments are to be made under the Queen's offer.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Beating the risks / A look at
Norwich Union's record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Thomas Bignold undertook the perilous journey from Kent to Norwich in
1783, no insurance company was prepared to cover him against highway
robbers. His indignation led him to found the Norwich Union Association,
initially for fire and theft insurance. Later, in 1808, Bignold launched the
society's life and pensions business.
Today, Norwich Union is the UK's third-largest insurance group and one of
the leading providers of personal pensions. Its financial strength is rated
as 'adequate' by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, although
the society has improved its position since this analysis was made.
Norwich Union's solvency margin stands at over Pounds 3.4bn, more than three
times the level required by the Department of Trade and Industry, while its
free asset ratio - broadly, the ratio between surplus assets and total
assets - doubled from 5.95 per cent in 1991 to 10.5 per cent at the end of
1993.
The society holds a strong position in the pensions market, where it offers
a range of individual plans and group schemes. In a recent survey of
personal pensions by Money Management*, Norwich Union was one of only four
providers to qualify as a 'best buy' for single premium investments, based
on above-average performance and below-average charges.
While the society's charges are lower than average for most contracts and
investment periods, there is still a front-end loading. This means there is
a 40 per cent reduction on each premium paid during the 'initial' period -
which can last up to two years on longer-term contracts.
These charges cover the society's own costs and payments of commission to
the adviser or salesman. Other charges on the unit-linked personal pension
plans include the bid/offer spread (the difference in cost between buying
and selling units) of 5 per cent; an annual management charge of 0.875 per
cent; and a Pounds 3 monthly policy fee.
Norwich Union shows greater consistency than many competitors on overall
performance. According to Money Management, 70 per cent of the society's
results on all funds were above average, with only 10 per cent in the fourth
quartile (bottom 25 per cent).
The managed unit-linked fund, which invests in the society's range of
unit-linked funds, has performed well over the past five years although, for
the year to the end of February, returns dropped rather suddenly to the
fourth quartile.
Philip Scott, Norwich Union's general manager (UK Life), explains: 'The
managed fund slipped in the competitor rankings as a result of the less
aggressive policy followed in the underlying funds, principally the UK
equity fund. This was modestly underweight in the smaller companies' and
mid-250 companies' index stocks at the beginning of the year when they
experienced strong performance.
'In common with many other funds, the equity fund was underweight in the
UK-quoted Hong Kong and Shanghai bank, which performed exceptionally well in
the final quarter of 1993.'
Several other funds, including international and North American, performed
well during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but performance has tailed off
since 1992. The international fund, retains an above-average ranking over
five years but the North American fund is well below average for this
period, particularly on the regular premium contract.
Scott says: 'The North American fund performance was adversely impacted in
1993 by the holdings in branded stocks in a year when brand names took
something of abattering.' This underperformance also affected the
international fund.
Elsewhere, Norwich Union's money fund has an excellent short and long term
track record, while its with-profits contract is a top performer over all
investment periods except five years, where it is slightly below average due
to recent cuts in the annual bonus rates. Traditionally, about 90 per cent
of the society's individual pensions business has been on the with-profits
side but, recently, the split between with-profits and unit-linked has been
more even.
Transfers of company pension benefits into personal pension plans account
for 40,000 out of the society's total sales of more than 500,000 personal
pensions. In 1992, Norwich Union - along with two other major providers,
Scottish Widows and Standard Life - decided to suspend transfer business
from tied agents and direct sales.
Scott explains: 'Since July 1992, we have had a team looking at every
transfer proposal submitted by our direct sales force or appointed
representative channel. The proposal proceeds only when it is clear that
good advice has been given.'

<TEXT>
The Royal Bank of Scotland has featured before in this column when Peter
Wood, who founded the Direct Line motor and household insurance subsidiary,
bought almost 2m shares in December 1993. The share price was around 400p
then and rose to a peak of 528p before coming back to the present 430p. Wood
has been buying again. His most recent purchase of 562,000 shares brings his
total holding to more than 3m.
Directors of Rodime were last noted when three of them sold almost 2m shares
at 44.75p. The outcome of several negotiations pending at that time are
still anticipated. Nevertheless, director selling has continued. The same
three directors, including chairman Malcolm McIver and managing director
Peter Bailey, have sold more stock at the lower price of 30.75p. Each
director still retains a sizeable holding. PizzaExpress announced
much-improved final results in September 1993. MD David Page then sold
380,000 shares at 102p to meet obligations following the sale of G&amp;F
Holdings to PizzaExpress. The most recent sales fall just before the
beginning of the closed period and were carried out by three directors,
including finance supremo Glen Tomlinson, at 132p a share.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Stags find it tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial adviser Johnson Fry has put lots of noses out of joint with its
French privatisation service, writes Gillian O'Connor. The original scheme
was to operate a rolling stagging fund: clients would put in Pounds 1,000,
which would be used to apply for shares in one privatisation. These shares
would then be sold as soon as dealings started and the money would go into
the next privatisation offer - and so on.
The first problem was that the French Treasury took umbrage at the idea of a
stagging fund, particularly one where the beneficiaries were perfidious
Englishmen. A few eyebrows were raised before the offer of shares in Elf
Aquitaine, the oil company, the first privatisation in which Johnson Fry
tried to participate.
Johnson Fry ignored the eyebrows and bought its clients some Elf shares. But
rival Killik &amp; Co., a stockbroker which had been running both a French
privatisation share-dealing service and a stagging service for some time,
got caught up in the slipstream and was not able to get its clients into
Elf.
Johnson Fry then decided it might be prudent to play down the emphasis on
stagging. So, it offered clients the choice of holding on to their Elf
shares and topping up the rolling stagging fund, or sticking with the
formula for which they had signed up. Result: some thoroughly confused
clients.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Voice of reason - Shepherd
Associates / 8th in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few independent financial advisers have been more outspoken in their views
on the commission system than Tony Shepherd, founder of Kent-based Shepherd
Associates. Indeed, his criticisms became headline news four years ago. He
marked his election as chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning with
a speech that spelt out his vision of a fee-based financial planning
profession that was independent of the need to sell anything except advice.
The tied agents in his audience walked out and the lFP lost half its
members. But many who are active in it today cite the speech as a watershed.
It was after this, they say, that the lFP began to put down roots as the
recognised professional body for qualified financial planners.
Shepherd has been in the financial services industry since he left the navy
more than 20 years ago and, 'in desperation,' accepted a job from Abbey
Life. 'I was so naive I didn't even understand that they weren't going to
pay me,' he says.
A turbulent five years later, he had established his own insurance broking
firm on the Isle of Skye, and was already vocal about the need for the life
assurance industry to adopt a system of level commissions to combat the
problem of mis-selling.
In 1986, Shepherd was approached by accountant Ernst &amp; Whinney. A number of
his clients were chartered accountants and E&amp;W wanted to use Shepherd
Associates as a fulcrum for a new financial planning department, under his
control. For Shepherd, the offer was a turning point. 'The big attraction
was that I could get away from commissions overnight,' he says.
But the move taught Shepherd that by no means all consumers of financial
services shared his enthusiasm for a fee-based lFA business. He lost 90 per
cent of his existing clients, and believes this was largely because of the
change in business terms.
By the time Ernst &amp; Whinney merged with Arthur Young in 1989, Shepherd had
established a pensions consultancy and a multi-disciplined financial
planning team. But the merger produced a clash of cultures and Shepherd
decided to resurrect his own firm, this time basing himself in a village
high on the Kentish downs. He was joined by Andrew Teasdale, a colleague
from Ernst &amp; Whinney who had developed an investment planning system that
concentrated on risk analysis.
'The primary thing is to get the asset allocation right,' says Teasdale. 'No
client is exposed to short-term stock market risk. The most dangerous thing
anyone can say is that equities are a long-term investment and that you will
get your money back eventually.'
Shepherd explains: 'What our clients get is not portfolio management: it is
a financial plan concentrating on investment, usually for people who need to
live off their capital. And we apply exactly the same principles to
pensions. Everything is driven by clients' objectives.'
Clients appear to like the approach. 'We haven't had to look for business,'
says Shepherd. 'The problem has been coping with it. We specialise in
retirement planning. It wasn't our intention; it just worked out that way. I
don't say we wouldn't take on a 30-year old, but the people we are
interested in are people approaching and at retirement age. So, we are
rather different among financial planners. We concentrate on pensions and
investment. We look at clients' estate planning and their insurance needs,
but our new business on life policies averages about one a month.'
Shepherd sees all new clients. 'I ask what their objectives are on
retirement - for some reason, all solicitors tend to want to spend Pounds
20,000 on a camper van - and what assets they have to meet these objectives.
Looking at that is the big exercise. It is usually four days' work on
average, at a cost of around Pounds 2,000. But retirement is the major
change we make in our life and it is worth doing properly.'
Shepherd charges clients Pounds 95 an hour for time-based work (an estimate
will be agreed in advance), while the annual management fee for asset
management is percentage-based. There is no fee for initial consultations.
The core of any financial plan produced by the firm will be the investment
dispositions. Shepherd says: 'Andrew looks at the risk planning, the estate
planning and making available money when it is needed. The same principle is
involved with a 30-year-old looking for school fees.'
Many clients will need to dip into capital. Teasdale says the firm's Plato
portfolio planning system, which it has developed and which covers more than
2,500 funds, has a definition of risk 'that concerns itself with the effect
of inflation, stock markets, and on the ability of the clients' assets to
support their needs over their lifetime.' At present, 25 per cent of the UK
exposure is in index-linked gilts.
Shepherd Associates does not touch execution-only work and the investment
emphasis is on unit trusts and investment trusts, never on a direct exposure
to equities. Turnover on portfolios is low. Shepherd says: 'It costs money
to move investments and that eats into performance. We have yet to be
convinced that active management is effective.'
Shepherd spent time polishing his French when he left Ernst &amp; Young, and he
foresees an expansion of his business among UK residents who have retired
across the Channel. But he is sceptical about the benefits of runaway
growth. 'I am suspicious of any fee-based practice that is making money
quickly,' he says. 'I think financial planning is a boutique business. And
one lesson I have learnt is that it is done far better by small firms than
by big ones.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT - what to do about / In this,
the third of four articles on capital gains tax, Richard Chant and Alan
Sugden deal with the rules for securities acquired before April 6 1982, and
how capital changes in a company affect shareholders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As well as the 'new holding pool' for a company's shares acquired on or
after April 6 1982, there is also a second pool, known as the '1982 holding
pool,' for those acquired between April 7 1965 and April 5 1982.
Shares acquired on or before April 6 1965 are kept separately unless the
investor makes an election to include any quoted shares acquired on or
before that date in a 1982 holding.
This election, called the '1965 election,' must be made to your local
inspector of taxes within two years of the end of the tax year in which the
first disposal was made after April 5 1985. Once made, it cannot be
withdrawn.
If you dispose of shares which you acquired before April 1 1982, their cost
is taken at their market value at March 31 1982 and is indexed for the
increase in the retail price index (RPI) between March 1982 and the date of
disposal.
Special rules
There are special rules to ensure:
1. That the RPI adjustment is calculated on the actual cost, if this is to
your advantage.
2. That the gain or loss since 1982 is not greater than the gain or loss
over the whole period you have owned the asset. (See Table 1 for examples of
calculations under the special rules).
You can elect for these special rules not to apply; but, if you do make this
election, called the '1982 election,' there is no need to calculate the gain
or loss over the whole period of ownership.
The 1982 election should be made within two years of the end of the tax year
in which the first relevant disposal of an asset acquired before April 1
1982 is made on, or after, April 6 1988. (1988/89 was the first tax year for
which this election could be made). Once made, the election cannot be
withdrawn. Normally, too, it will apply to all assets which you owned on
March 31 1982.
Where to find March 31
1982 market values
Helpful companies like Boots, BP, ICI and RTZ give the March 31 1982 market
value of each class of share issued in their annual report and accounts.
Usually, this can be found towards the back of the report under the heading
'Information for Shareholders.'
Where this information is not included, you can write to the company
secretary - which might encourage it to include the data in future years -
or ask your stockbroker or tax inspector.
Make sure you get an up-to-date market value as it can change (eg, the March
31 1982 market value per share will be halved by a one-for-one scrip issue.
Matching disposals with
the acquisition of securities
Matching applies where you are considering securities of the same class in
the same company. Disposals are matched to the investor's holding in a
company in the following sequence:
1. With shares acquired on the same day as the disposal.
2. With shares acquired within the previous nine days.
3. With shares in the new holding (the pool acquired from April 6 1982
onwards).
4. With shares in the 1982 holding (those acquired between April 7 1965 and
April 51982; and quoted shares acquired on or before April 6 1965 if the
1965 election has been made).
5. With shares acquired on or before April 6 1965, if the 1965 election has
not been made. The matching is done on a last in, first out basis.
Indexation
In the sequence above:
1 and 2. No indexation.
3. For shares in the new holding, indexation runs from the month in which
they were acquired.
4 and 5. Indexation will be based on the market value of the shares at March
31 1982. Or, if you have not made the 1982 election, the special rules
described above (and illustrated in Table 1) will apply to shares acquired
on or before March 31 1982.
See Table 2 (on page VII) for an example of matching from the portfolio of
an elderly widow who obviously believed in the slogan 'You can be sure of
Shell.' But then, with a weak oil price early in the 1990s, she decided to
dispose of her holding.
She spread the disposal over three tax years so that, together with her
other transactions, her gain in each of those years did not exceed the
annual CGT exemption.
Capital changes
In last week's article, Table 4 showed an example involving Stakis, the
Scottish-based hotel group.
This included the treatment of a scrip issue, and a rights issue where the
shareholder took up his entitlement.
To recap: Stakis's two-for-one scrip issue simply trebled the number of
shares held and, of course, did not alter the overall cost of the holding.
In the rights issue, the shares taken up were simply treated as a purchase
of additional shares because all the shares had been acquired on or after
April 6 1982.
Where some of the holding was acquired before that date, the treatment is
slightly more complicated.
Rights issue on shares
acquired before April 6 1982
Where a rights issue made after April 5 1982 concerns a holding, part or all
of which was acquired before April 61,982, any shares received in respect of
the 1982 holding are treated as an increase in that holding.
Similarly, if the 1965 election (to include shares acquired on or before 6
April 1965 in the 1982 holding) was not made, any shares received in respect
of shares acquired on or before April 6 1965 are treated as an increase in
those earlier holdings.
Rights issue - shares
not taken up
Shareholders who do not want to take up their entitlement in a rights issue
can do one of two things. These are:
1. Sell the new shares 'nil paid,' renouncing their entitlement to them by
completing the relevant section on the back of the provisional allotment
letter (PAL, in back office jargon).
2. Let their entitlement lapse. In this case, the issuing house will sell
all the shares of the entitlements that have lapsed 'for the benefit of
entitled shareholders' - providing they can be sold at a premium.
The shares are sold fully paid and the net proceeds (the premium obtained
over the subscription price, net of selling costs) are distributed to the
entitled shareholders pro rata.
Whichever the shareholder does, the treatment for CGT purposes is the same;
it depends on whether the proceeds of the sale of the shareholder's rights
are 5 per cent or less of the value of the underlying shareholding (the
shares originally held), or more than 5 per cent
If the former, the proceeds of the sale are deducted from the cost of the
underlying holding, indexed to the month of sale. If the latter, the sale is
deemed to be a disposal and a taxable gain arises from it.
Table 3 shows how the gain and the value of the underlying shareholding is
calculated when the proceeds of the sale of rights exceeds 5 per cent of the
value of the underlying holding ex-rights.
Takeovers and mergers
The shareholder of the acquired company can either accept new shares in the
acquiring company in exchange for his holding in the acquired company
(accepting 'paper,' in City jargon), or can accept the cash alternative if
one is offered.
If new shares are accepted, the cost of them is taken as the cost of the
investor's holding in the acquired company. If the cash alternative is
accepted, it is deemed to be a disposal, and normal rules apply.
Demergers
Where a company hives off a subsidiary (eg. BAT hiving off Argos and then
Wiggins Teape, or the demerger of Zeneca from ICI), the cost of a holding in
the original company is apportioned between the resulting holdings. Table 4
illustrates the case of a shareholder in ICI when it demerged Zeneca.
Scrip dividends
If you elect to receive a scrip rather than a cash dividend, the deemed cost
of the shares received is the cash dividend you have foregone (ie, the
dividend before the addition of the tax credit).
Indexation on the deemed cost of the shares received will run from the month
in which the dividend is paid.
Enhanced scrip dividends
These are a recent innovation, designed for companies with a surplus of
advance corporation tax (ACT) - that is, those paying more ACT than they can
offset against their UK corporation tax liability.
These are, typically, companies with a high proportion of their profits
earned and taxed overseas, such as RTZ. But they may also include companies
paying uncovered dividends in difficult times, such as Ladbroke.
ACT is paid on all cash dividends but does not have to be paid on scrip
dividends. Thus, some companies with an ACT problem have been offering
shareholders the choice between a normal cash dividend and an enhanced scrip
dividend (usually around 50 per cent higher).
For CGT purposes, the cost of an enhanced scrip dividend is taken as the
market value on the first day of dealing, and is indexed from the month in
which the cash dividend is paid.

     TABLE 1. SPECIAL RULES FOR SHARES ACQUIRED BEFORE APRIL 1 1982
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Where the investor has not made the 1982 election (for the special
rules not to apply), the calculation of a chargeable gain or loss on
the disposal of shares acquired before April 1 1982 has to be done
twice, once with March 31 1982 market value and once with original cost:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example A - Chargeable gain
                                             March 1982       Original
                                               value            cost
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Net proceeds of sale - Nov 93              Pounds 29,000  Pounds 29,000
Less: Cost Apr 1972                                             (10,000)
Market value Mar 31 1982                          (8,000)
                                                 ---------      --------
                                                  21,000         19,000
Less indexation on higher of cost
or Mar 31 82 value: Pounds 10,000 x 0.782         (7,820)        (7,820)
                                                 ---------      --------
                                                  13,180         11,180
                                                 ---------      --------
The lower gain of Pounds 11,180 is chargeable.
Example B - Allowable loss
                                             March 1982       Original
                                               value            cost
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Net proceeds of sale - Nov 93                      5,000          5,000
Less: Cost Apr 1972                                             (10,000)
Market value Mar 31 1982                          (8,000)
                                                 ---------      --------
                                                  (3,000)        (5,000)
Less indexation on higher of cost
or Mar 31 82 value: Pounds 10,000 x 0.782         (7,820)        (7,820)
                                                 ---------      --------
                                                 (10,820)       (12,820)
                                                 ---------      --------
The lower loss of Pounds 10,820 would be allowable.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: In his November 1993 Budget, the chancellor proposed to restrict
indexation to prevent it creating or increasing a loss on disposals made
on or after Nov 30 1993. Legislation on this is included in the Finance
Bill now going through parliament.  The effect on Example B, if disposal
had taken place on or after November 30 1993, would be to restrict the
loss to Pounds 3,000.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
               TABLE 3. RIGHTS ISSUE, SHARES NOT TAKEN UP
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
A company makes a 1 for 3 rights issue at 80p.
Before the rights issue an investor held 3,000 shares, which were
standing at 102p each on the last day of dealings cum rights. He is,
therefore, entitled to subscribe for 1,000 shares.
He decides to sell his rights 'nil paid' - ie. before the date on
which payment for new shares falls due. (In practice he has to sell two
or three working days before the subscription date, to give the
purchaser of his nil paid shares time to make the subscription payment:
the 'last day of dealings nil paid' is given in the rights issue
circular to shareholders).  The investor sells his rights on the first
day of dealing nil paid for 20p each, realising Pounds 196 net of
selling expenses. The price of the old shares has eased to 99p
ex-rights.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the sale deemed to be a disposal ?
Let the proceeds of the sale of his rights = A
and the value of his holding of old shares, ex-rights = B
                                A           Pounds 196
The proportion sold =     -------------  = -------------  =    6.60%
                                B           Pounds 2,970
So, as this is greater than 5%, the sale is deemed to be a disposal.
Calculating the capital gain
The cost of the original holding, indexed to the month in which the nil
paid shares were sold, was Pounds 2,200.
                                A           Pounds 196
The proportion sold =     -------------  = -------------  =    6.19%
                                B           Pounds 2,970
A = 6.19% of Pounds 2,200 = Pounds 136
Capital gain = Pounds 196 - Pounds 136 = Pounds 60
The indexed cost of the residual holding, 3,000 shares xr, is
B = 93.81% of Pounds 2,200 = Pounds 2,064.

For CGT indexation purposes, the new shareholding (Zeneca) is treated
as having been acquired at the same time as the original holding (ICI).
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
For cost apportionment, the A/(A + B) formula is used to determine the
proportion of the cost of the original holding of ICI which is
attributed to the new holding in Zeneca.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   A = First Market Value of new shareholding
   B = First Market Value of old shareholding
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
where First Market Value on the first day on which ICI and Zeneca were
dealt in separately is the lower of:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.the bid price of the security plus one quarter of the spread (the
difference between the bid price and the offer price). Known
colloquially as 'quarter up'.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.the figure half way between the highest and the lowest prices of
bargains recorded that day in the Stock Exchange's Daily Official List.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
These prices were ICI 631.75p; Zeneca 625.75p
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         625.75p
So cost apportioned to Zeneca =       ------------       = 49.76%
                                     625.75p +
                                         631.75p

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Dodge that VAT - But move fast to
pre-pay your fuel bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you do not want to pay value added tax on fuel for the next year or two,
you need to move quickly. By now, most people know that if they have spare
cash, they can use it to pay in advance for gas, electricity, oil or coal
supplies, so avoiding VAT of 8 per cent from next month and 17.5 per cent
from April 1995.
This is because VAT is charged at the rate which applies on the date of
invoicing or the date of payment, whichever is the earlier. If you pay
before April 1, the rate is zero, so no VAT need be paid. But the utility
and fuel companies need time to process cheques, so do not leave it until
the afternoon of Thursday, March 31. To be safe, your payment should reach
the relevant company within the next week.
Some electricity companies have been sending out blank bills to make it easy
for customers to pre-pay as much as they like. If yours is not one of them,
all you need to do is send a cheque with a covering note giving your name,
address and electricity or gas account number. You should make clear that
the money is to be treated as a pre-payment for future supplies.
If there is a chance you could move house before the pre-payment has run
out, check that the power company would be willing to refund the balance.
A few eager customers are reported to have paid for more than 10 years'
worth of fuel in advance. But have they thought through the implications?
The two questions you should ask are:
How much money will I save by paying in advance?
How much will I lose by not keeping the money in, say, a building society
and earning interest on it?
The further in advance you pay, the longer the money could have been earning
interest and the smaller the savings become. But current interest rates are
low. Many building society accounts pay only 3 or 4 per cent. The better
ones pay perhaps 6 or 7 per cent on larger amounts. Since this is taxable
for most people, the actual interest received is 25 or 40 per cent less.
In simple terms, this means that a saving of 8 per cent VAT on a year's
worth of fuel is bound to be worth more in cash terms than the interest from
keeping the same amount on deposit at present interest rates.
When VAT at 17.5 per cent arrives from April 1995, the potential savings
will be much greater but, to avoid the tax altogether, pre-payment would
have to be made before April 1 1994. Thus, more than a year's interest would
be lost. This makes it more complicated to work out the advantages of paying
in advance.
Accountant Stoy Hayward has taken the example of a family with fuel bills of
Pounds 1,300 a year, and calculated what rate of interest it would need to
be earning on its savings, tax-free, to outweigh the advantages of paying in
advance for the next eight quarters.
The firm has taken into account the likely seasonal fluctuations in fuel
bills - higher accounts can be expected in February and May than August and
November.
The results show that the family would need to be earning 19.2 per cent
tax-free on its savings for it not to be worth paying the second quarterly
bill in advance. But by the eighth quarter, in February 1996, this has
dropped to 8.8 per cent and the figure would continue to decline after that.
This is only an example, of course, and the equivalent figures in your case
will vary, depending on such factors as your fuel consumption and timing of
bills. But the general conclusion is that, although 1996 interest rates are
an unknown factor, it is unlikely to be worth paying bills much more than
two years in advance.
If you cannot afford to pay more than one year's bills in advance this
month, you will have a second chance to make savings in March 1995, before
the higher VAT rate comes into force. The difference between 8 and 17.5 per
cent means that it should still be worth making advance payments at the
lower rate - unless interest levels have shot up by then.
Meanwhile, there is good news for council tenants whose homes are in a
district heating scheme where fuel is included as part of the rent and there
are no separate meters. The government has decided it cannot apply VAT to
such schemes as councils are VAT-exempt and it is not possible to work out
the liabilities of individual tenants. So, members of such schemes will be
able to avoid the tax without even trying.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Revenue ban casts doubt on annuit -
Investors face problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of last year's most innovative annuity products was taken off the market
in a hurry this week because of an Inland Revenue ban. 'Managed' or
'flexible' annuities were designed with relatively affluent customers in
mind and allowed them to do two things.
First, they could exercise considerably more control over the investments on
which their pension depended, and on the amount of income they drew each
year. Second, if they wanted to buy a conventional annuity, providing a
pre-determined annual income, they could do so at a time of their own
choosing when they thought they would get favourable terms.
The latter point is particularly pertinent. Falling interest rates have
meant that many new pensioners taking out a conventional annuity are getting
a considerably lower annual income than they would have a couple of years
ago. The only company to have launched a managed annuity scheme is Equitable
Life. But Provident Life had a similar annuity ready to go and several other
life insurance companies planned to join the fray. It is not yet clear if
the insurance industry will be able to adjust the scheme in a way that gets
Revenue approval.
Equitable Life is determined to try. It stopped selling new flexible
annuities this week but has written to the hundreds of people who have
bought one. In the letter, it says it does not agree with the Revenue and
will contest its decision. It will continue to pay out the annuity
instalments due for the time being.
These customers obviously are going to have a fraught period ahead as they
wait to discover if their contracts are valid. Other people with a problem
to sort out in a hurry are those due to retire in the very near future and
planning to take out a flexible annuity.
Everyone with a personal pension, and all members of company pension schemes
based on money purchase (rather than final salary), have to use most of the
lump sum produced by their pension plan to buy an annuity promptly when they
actually retire. So, even if the insurance companies and the Revenue do
eventually compromise on a modified version of the flexible annuity scheme,
some would-be customers may be unable to wait.
So, what are the options for people needing to choose a retirement plan now?
Until the fate of managed annuities is resolved, their basic choice lies
between a conventional annuity and a phased annuity.
The standard conventional annuity involves a once-and-for-all swap of your
lump sum for an agreed annual income for the rest of your life. Usually,
this is fixed in money terms. Some degree of inflation-proofing might be
built in, but only at the cost of a lower income to start with.
The level of income is fixed by reference to gilt yields at the time you buy
the annuity, your sex, and how long you are likely to live. A variant on
this prototype allows you to take on some stock market risk by linking the
income to a stock market-based product such as a with-profits or unit-linked
fund. But most people are suited better by annuities which provide a
guaranteed income.
Phased annuities and schemes offering 'staggered vesting' (even more complex
and costly) work by dividing your pension fund into several discrete chunks
and allowing you to cash these in for an annuity when you choose. This goes
a long way towards dealing with the timing problem. But it is a realistic
option only for people wealthy enough to be able to afford to wait, or those
who can retire gradually from paid employment.
Other conditions, such as whether and when you can take part of your pension
in a tax-free cash sum, and what the benefits for partners are, also vary
considerably. Pension planning is an area where specialist advice is
probably essential.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Fraser floats - New Issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY, ANDREW TAYLOR and SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House of Fraser, the department store chain which stretches from Inverness
to Plymouth, is being floated off by its owners the Fayed brothers, valued
at Pounds 413.3m, writes Neil Buckley. They will keep the chain's former
flagship, Harrods, leaving House of Fraser with 56 stores trading under 17
names such as Binns, Rackhams, Dickins &amp; Jones and Army &amp; Navy.
The share price announced on Thursday of 180p was at the bottom end of
expectations. After the group unveiled pre-tax profits of Pounds 34.5m on
sales of Pounds 721.7m for the year to January 31, most analysts had been
forecasting 190p to 200p, valuing the group at between Pounds 436m and
Pounds 460m.
SG Warburg, broker to the offer, is thought to have been persuaded by the
recent volatility of the stock market to go for the lower price. It equates
to 16.2 times historic earnings and, on a notional dividend of 5p, gives a
gross yield of 3.5 per cent. But, by setting the price at this level, the
group has largely neutralised investors' concerns over the legacy of several
years of directionless management, and over growth prospects. The shares
look attractive and could well go to a small premium.
Three-quarters of the 229.6m shares are being placed with institutions, with
the rest offered to the public. Deadline for applications is March 25 and
dealings start on April 6.
Wainhomes this week became the latest housebuilder to announce terms of its
flotation, writes Andrew Taylor. It is seeking to raise Pounds 30.5m from a
placing and offer for sale priced at 170p a share and valuing the company at
Pounds 106m. The issue follows Beazer Homes which, the previous week,
announced details of its flotation plans. These valued the company at Pounds
463.4m, with shares at 165p.
Compared with Beazer, Wainhomes would seem a little expensive on a notional
yield of 3.1 per cent and p/e of 18.3 times on forecast earnings of 9.3p in
the year to March 1994. The companies, however, are very different animals.
Beazer is a proven national house-builder, producing nearly 5,000 homes a
year. Wainhomes remains a small regional builder constructing fewer than
under 1,000 homes a year, although this is expected to rise to 1,800 by
1995/96. The upside potential, therefore, is claimed by Wainhomes to be
greater than Beazer.
It has had a solid record during the recession and operating margins are at
the top end of the sector. On that, basis it is probably worth supporting.
The broker is NatWest Wood Mackenzie.
Investors get the chance of taking part in the increasing sales of
educational equipment in the UK following Nottingham Group's announcement
this week of details of its Pounds 13m intermediaries offer, writes Simon
Davies. The company is being valued at Pounds 81.4m and brokers say
applications had to be scaled back for the Pounds 25m pre-placement to
institutions.
The pricing is attractive. At 155p, the shares are on a 1993 p/e (before
exceptional write-offs) of 14.2 and a notional yield of 4.45 per cent.
Goldman Sachs and James Capel are brokers to the offer, which closes on
March 24.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Lucas finds the going tough - The
Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas, the motor and aerospace components group, is expected on Monday to
report interim profits of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 19m, compared with
Pounds 5.2m last time. Analysts still hope the Midlands-based group will
make more than Pounds 80m in the year to July, and the skewing of profits to
the second half reflects continuing tough trading conditions - particularly
in continental Europe.
Also on Monday, Argos is forecast to announce full-year pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 82m, up from Pounds 65.6m last year before the Pounds 12.7m
provision to cover closure of the group's Chesterman furniture chain. The
total dividend is expected to be raised from 7p to 7.6p.
On Tuesday Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group, is
expected to unveil another strong performance, with full-year pre-tax
profits up about one-third from Pounds 147.2m to about Pounds 196m. The
total dividend is forecast to rise from 11.5p to 12.5p.
Changes in the US weather and the prospects for the regulatory climate in
the UK will both have their impacts on Tuesday's results from Prudential,
the financial services and life insurance company. The range of analysts'
forecasts is Pounds 510m-Pounds 567m in pre-tax profits, compared with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 406m in 1992 - more than double the 1991 figure.
The consensus on the final dividend is 13.1p.
Final results on Wednesday from retail group Kingfisher, which includes
Woolworth, Superdrug, Comet and B&amp;Q, as well as Darty of France, will be
watched very closely after the group made a disappointing trading statement
for the 24 weeks to January 15. Analysts downgraded their pre-tax profit
forecasts then from between Pounds 300m and Pounds 320m to about Pounds 295m
 -up from Pounds 234m, reflecting the impact of the Darty acquisition last
year. Total dividend is forecast at 14.3p, after an adjusted 13.3p last
year.
Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company is expected on Thursday to
reveal pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 500m for 1993, compared with
Pounds 270.4m last year. The figures will be inflated by around Pounds 250m
of exceptional profits and brokers are forecasting a more modest Pounds 250m
pre-tax profit from underlying business. Dividend is likely to remain at
31.5p.
The City is expecting only modest growth in profits at United Newspapers,
publisher of the Daily Express, which declares its full-year results on
Thursday. The recovery in advertising has been fragmentary and United's
national titles have come under severe competitive pressures. Derek
Terrington, of Kleinwort Benson, is looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds
115m compared with Pounds 109.9m in 1992.
Wellcome, which has interim results on Thursday, has the dubious distinction
of having been the worst-performing FT-SE 100 stock of 1993. How well it
does in 1994 will be influenced by the fortunes of Zovirax, its biggest
selling drug. Zovirax is now facing its first genuine competition, in the
shape of SmithKline Beecham's Famvir. Goldman Sachs, the stockbroker, is
looking for at least Pounds 400m of Zovirax sales in the first half and
group pre-tax profits of Pounds 360m.
Reckitt &amp; Colman's range of household brands is expected to make full-year
profits - to be reported on Thursday - of around Pounds 280m pre-tax,
compared with Pounds 181.7m in 1992 - a figure depressed substantially by
Pounds 56.9m of losses on the sale of the US spice business and a Pounds
9.6m restructuring charge. A rise in the dividend of around 8 or 9 per cent
is expected, after the interim was increased by 8.4 per cent.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: What the experts say . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER SMITH, of financial adviser Hill Martin, believes the total return
theory is suitable only for those with a large portfolio. Others could
easily run the risk of simply eroding their capital, especially in a falling
market.
His favourite recommendations for income-seekers are the income shares of
split-capital investment trusts. Exeter High Income is a unit trust which
invests in these and has a yield of about 8.5 per cent gross. 'You can still
take 5-6 per cent net from insurance bonds if you are a nervous equity
investor and European bonds are paying 6.5-7 per cent gross,' Smith says.
Smith advises those who still keep a large amount of money in the bank to
transfer it into a building society postal account, at least. 'There is not
much wrong with cash at the moment. If inflation was high, it would be a
different matter.'
To those approaching retirement, he says: 'People tell you not to buy an
annuity at the moment on the basis that interest rates are supposed to shoot
up again. I just don't believe this will happen. You can choose an
escalating annuity which will guarantee your income and pay an increasing
amount each year.'
ROBERT NOBLE WARREN, of financial adviser Murray Noble, believes that since
most funds cannot beat the average stock market indices, an index fund,
which aims simply to track the indices is a good idea, particularly since
charges are lower than on other funds.
His advice to income-seekers? 'Buy index funds with low annual charges, such
as Morgan Grenfell's UK Tracker; pay attention to tax-favoured investments
and tax-saving arrangements so as to use all personal allowances (you can
save 1 per cent a year by doing so); and consider spreading the income risk
into other European countries such as French Eurobonds, yielding 6 per cent
or more, and Spanish deposits. Fidelity Money Funds (Bermuda) Spanish Peseta
has a yield of over 7.5 per cent.'
He adds: 'We still favour split-level investment trusts if you really have
to seek out a high income, at the risk of capital. The M&amp;G Dual yields 28.8
per cent with capital depreciation, while New Throgmorton is on 10.4 per
cent.
'We don't expect dividends to increase much, so we don't think there is any
way round taking the gains from the portfolio to make up income. So, if you
have to get over 5 per cent income, you are going to have to take some of it
from capital.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors who need income / A look
at the snags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many investors, a decent income is a priority - but getting one has
become increasingly difficult since the steep fall in interest rates over
the past 18 months. Providers are finding the going tough, too. This week,
Hypo F&amp;C's High Income unit trust, which has pulled in more than Pounds 500m
since its launch on the back of an offer to pay an annual 10 per cent, said
it would cut the payout to 9 per cent from June (see Serious Money on page
II).
Since the launch of the trust in February 1993, there have been two cuts in
base rates, taking them from 6 per cent to 5.25 per cent. British interest
rates are bottoming out, but many experts believe there will be another rate
cut this year. This would make it even harder for income-seekers to live off
their savings.
There are any number of products designed to meet the need for income, but
they can be divided into three types of investment: cash, bonds and
equities.
Deposits
We list the highest bank and building society rates weekly in our highest
rates table (page VIII). The highest returns are on the larger deposits.
Norwich &amp; Peterborough's postal account is paying 7 per cent gross on Pounds
60,000, while some notice accounts will pay similar rates on smaller
amounts.
Rates are low for those with savings under Pounds 5,000: Halifax, the
largest building society, is paying just 3.5 per cent gross on Pounds 1,000
and 3.75 per cent gross on Pounds 2,500.
Postal accounts tend to pay the higher rates - but although they are
described as instant access, it will usually take a week before you can get
your hands on the cash.
The trouble with chasing rates is that they can change rapidly. And they
will fall again if base rates are cut once more. Moreover, although most
people think of a society as 'safe', because the nominal value of its
capital remains the same, they tend to ignore the effect of inflation on
that capital.
This is not as great a problem today, with the retail price index rising at
2.5 per cent in the year to January, but even at 4 per cent - the top of the
government's target range - the value of money halves in 18 years. The chart
(right) shows how significant the effect of inflation can be in determining
the real rate of return.
Bonds
These are the traditional investment for income-seekers in most countries.
At Thursday's close, the redemption yield on UK government bonds, also known
as gilts, was 6.67 per cent over five years and 7.33 per cent over 10 years.
Riskier bonds, such as those issued by companies and some foreign
governments, will pay higher yields. The drawback with bonds is that you run
the risk of capital loss if their price falls. And, if you buy a gilt for
more than face value, you are certain of a loss if you hold it until
maturity.
Equities
Over the long term, equities give protection against inflation and offer the
potential for much higher capital gains than from cash or bonds. But the
volatility of the markets means you cannot regard equities as a
straightforward alternative to a building society. The present yield on the
FT-SE-A All-Share index is only around 3.5 per cent; but by choosing
companies which pay higher dividends, such as utilities, you can achieve
higher rates.
Income shares of split-capital investment trusts are aimed specifically at
income-seekers. Instead of issuing just one type of ordinary share,
split-capital trusts issue two or more types; these lay claim to different
parts of each trust's assets and dividends. Income shares receive the
majority of the trust's dividends but are at the back of the queue for
capital gains. At present, they have an average yield of about 11.6 per
cent. But they carry the risk - in some cases, the certainty - of capital
loss.
The total return theory
The most common way to seek an income is to look for investments with the
highest interest rates; the snag is that, usually, the highest returns are
found on the riskiest investments. But those people with large portfolios
and a firm grip on their finances can afford to think about income in a
different way. By investing for total return - both income and capital
growth - they can take some of the annual growth as income, with the
advantage that it will be taxed as capital gain. If the amount taken falls
within their capital gains tax allowance of Pounds 5,800 (Pounds 11,600 for
a married couple), there is no CGT to pay.
Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, says: 'Assume that someone has
invested Pounds 10,000 in 10 Pounds 1,000 shares and, after one year, the
value has increased to Pounds 15,000. Now let us assume that he has not used
his CGT allowance but wishes to enjoy 'income' of Pounds 1,500. He sells one
share for Pounds 1,500, of which Pounds 1,000 is the original capital and
Pounds 500 is gain. The Pounds 500 would not be subject to tax (since it
falls within his CGT allowance) and so the whole Pounds 1,500 would be
tax-free in his hands.'
Robin Angus, director of equities at NatWest Securities, is another
enthusiast about the total return theory. In the company's latest Investment
Trust Annual Review, he writes: 'I simply cannot understand why people chase
income through buying investment products offering fancy yields when,
through investing for total return and realising some of their capital
gains, they could satisfy their financial needs while getting a higher total
return and paying less tax into the bargain.'
The danger with turning capital into income is that you can overdo it. You
could simply be returning capital to yourself in the form of income. For the
system to work, the investment needs to grow at least as much as the amount
being taken out annually. Furthermore, dealing costs will reduce the return.
There are packaged products making use of the idea. Ivory &amp; Sime has an
investment trust which makes use of the annual CGT exemption. The trust
sells a proportion of an investor's holding automatically each year in order
to generate monthly income. The first Pounds 5,800 of income from these
sales is tax-free. The net asset value of the trust increased by 16.9 per
cent in the six months to its year-end on December 31, and the board has
decided it can afford to increase the annual return from 7 to 7.15 per cent
from April.
James Capel's Generator personal equity plan, and Newton's Distributor fund,
are unit trusts which allow the investor to choose the annual level of
income they withdraw up to a maximum of 9 per cent (Newton) and 7.5 per cent
(Capel).
Both aim to replace the capital withdrawn but cannot guarantee to do. By
investing through a Pep, the investor does not need to worry about CGT or
income tax but faces initial and annual charges of 5.25 per cent and 1 per
cent (Capel) and 6 per cent and 1.5 per cent (Newton).
The advantage of these Peps is that, theoretically, the investor is in
control so that, if the stock market falls, he can stop taking income in
order to minimise capital erosion. The danger is that he becomes dependent
on the income stream.
The total return theory works in a rising market or if capital gain has
built up untouched over the years. But great care is needed not to withdraw
too much capital, undermining the scope for future growth.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Markets: If only he'd gone to Dallas - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For some in British business, this was a week for moving on. Shareholders of
British Aerospace met on Tuesday to vote on the sale of Rover to BMW. Some
protested outside the meeting with a 23-year-old Land Rover and a 'Sale of
Rover: Industrial Dunkirk' banner. Others protested with equal passion
inside, voting 111 to 42 against the sale. But the proxies, mostly from
institutions, swung it for a final count of 119.6m for the sale and 2.9m
against.
Of the board members who took the flak from shareholders, John Cahill,
chairman, is retiring to Florida with Pounds 3.5m remuneration and George
Simpson, Rover's chairman, is off to be chief executive of Lucas Industries
in Solihull.
If only Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, had gone
to Dallas yesterday as planned, markets in the US and abroad could have
ended the week on a quieter note and faced next week with less trepidation.
The last time he cancelled a speech there to attend to pressing business in
Washington was Black Monday, October 19 1987.
His summons to the White House yesterday sent rumours coursing through
global markets. Was President Bill Clinton trying to dissuade the Fed from
raising interest rates? Or was the Fed trying to prepare the politicians for
a big rate increase?
The answer will not be known until after next week's meeting of the Fed's
policy-making open markets committee. But the prospect of tighter US
monetary policy, following reports this week of very strong US economic
growth but subdued price pressures, knocked markets in London more than in
New York.
All week in London, gilts performed worse than bonds abroad, ending down
about 1.5 points on the week. The main domestic economic news that harmed
gilts was an unexpected pick up in the growth rate of average earnings in
January, a factor that could delay UK interest rate cuts.
For the first time in many weeks, however, equities managed to hold their
own against a falling bond market. In spite of being badly unsettled
yesterday by Greenspan and the expiration of derivatives contracts, the
FT-SE 100 index finished the week up a net 26.2 points at 3,218.1
The other key UK economic statistic of the week was the 0.5 per cent fall in
retail sales in February. This weakness could be taken, however, as a
positive and rational action by consumers ahead of April's tax increases.
Rather than suddenly curb their spending when their pay packets shrink, they
are already adjusting their budgets, argue David Walton and Martin Brookes,
economists at Goldman Sachs.
Moreover, many people appear to be over-estimating the impact of the tax
increases. Once they realise the true hit is smaller, they will feel more
inclined to spend. As the chart shows, Goldman Sachs is forecasting that
retail sales volume has been shrinking before the tax cut but will recover
quickly afterwards. Concern over spending has dragged down the retailers
sector in the FT-SE-A All-Share index.
The improvement in finances of those people in work and with a mortgage will
continue, the economists believe. They are forecasting 3 per cent real
annual growth in post-tax, post-mortgage income in the four years 1991-94.
Thus consumer spending will rise by about 2.5 per cent this year, the same
rate as last year. Partly because of this strength in consumer spending, the
main driver to the current recovery, GDP will rise 3 per cent this year and
next.
It remains to be seen whether the government and the Bank of England are as
convinced as Goldman Sachs about the durability of consumer spending and
economic growth. If they are, they might refrain from cutting interest rates
soon.
Rising demand was a theme running through many results results reported this
week, most notably in the construction and building material sectors. Wimpey
doubled its trading profits last year to Pounds 41m thanks in part to
building 25 per cent more houses than a year before. The general
construction sector's recovery is accelerating. Orders rose 30 per cent in
the three months to the end of January from the same period a year earlier,
to the best level since 1989.
In the materials sector, Wolseley, Travis Perkins, Heywood Williams and
Marley all reported this week sharp upturns in operating profits although
some of them were hit by restructuring costs. For others, notably Wolseley,
a little pick up in demand is going a long way.
'If you have a formula that seems to work, then it seems advisable to press
on,' said Jeremy Lancaster, its chairman. By his standards that was a vague
and subdued comment but he said he felt constrained by the Stock Exchange's
new rules on disclosure.
Restructuring - underway and complete - was a theme among other results in
the busiest reporting week so far this season. United Biscuits faces the
biggest task, taking a Pounds 121m charge mostly to sort out its Keebler
subsidiary in the US. This left pre-tax profits down 28 per cent at Pounds
116.7m and the dividend unchanged at 15.3p. On a more modest scale, Simon
Engineering reported a Pounds 160m loss for the year and said it would
launch a Pounds 50m rights issue once it had renegotiated its bank debt.
Sometimes, though, surgery alone fails to restore financial health. Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi is now a lean global advertising group, reporting a return to
pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.2m. But flat revenues indicate it is having
difficulty winning new clients. In an business where up-beat morale is a
crucial ingredient, one drag on performance appears to be tensions between
some senior management and Maurice Saatchi, the chairman. He appears to have
adapted less well than his colleagues to the Spartan regime.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Market: Good news on inflation fails to lift spirits - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was plenty of promising news on inflation this week, continued signs
of strength in the economy, and an encouraging earnings forecast from a big
manufacturer, yet it was not enough to lift spirits on Wall Street.
If any more evidence of financial markets' jittery mood was needed, it came
yesterday morning, when bond and stock prices dropped sharply after it was
reported that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had been
called to to see President Clinton.
Although the Fed said the meeting was routine, it was unplanned - Greenspan
had to cancel an appointment in Texas to make it back to Washington DC in
time. This prompted speculation among traders and investors that the meeting
was somehow a signal that the Fed was about to raise interest rates again.
Perhaps, the rumours went, the White House had got wind of plans for another
monetary policy tightening, and wanted to call in the Fed chief to explain
himself.
The speculation was way off the mark. The president and the Fed chairman
meet fairly regularly, and the White House said it had called Greenspan to
Washington on Friday because Clinton was going to be difficult to contact
over the following weeks due to a hectic travel schedule. Also, it would be
extremely unlikely that if the president wanted to dissuade the Fed from
raising interest rates, he would choose to do it at so public a meeting.
Yet, the speculation surrounding the Clinton-Greenspan parley was enough to
take 17 points off the Dow Jones industrial average in the first few minutes
of trading, and send the benchmark 30-year government bond down almost a
point, pushing the yield back above 6.9 per cent.
Fortunately, once everyone had calmed down, the stock market came to its
senses, and the Dow recovered its early losses. Bonds, however, remained
anchored in negative territory, perfectly illustrating the mess the Treasury
market is in. For bond yields to have jumped back to 6.9 per cent in a week
when all the news on inflation was positive defied logic.
First, the February producer prices index was released on Tuesday, and it
showed an increase of just 0.1 per cent in 'core' producer price inflation
(excluding the volatile food and energy components). Then, a day later the
consumer prices index was reported to have risen by only 0.3 per cent last
month, a figure that was in line with expectations and one that put the
annualised rate of consumer price inflation 0.3 percentage points below the
1993 - which was itself the lowest inflation rate recorded in years.
Finally, on Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia issued its
monthly report of local economic conditions. It noted that prices of goods
sold in the region had moderated during the month. This was especially
welcome news, because it was the Philadelphia's Fed's warning about rising
inflation in its local markets that had triggered a February sell-off of
bonds.
Yet none of this was enough to lift bond market investors' spirits, and the
gains Treasuries had earned midweek were quickly wiped out on Thursday and
Friday. Admittedly, stocks fared better, especially in the latter half of
the week, but it was clear that both markets are not going to calm down in a
hurry, whatever the inflation facts say.
This week, thankfully, was not all about inflation. Secondary stocks, as
measured by the Nasdaq composite index, put in a good showing. The Nasdaq
composite reached an all-time high of 803.85 on Thursday, powered by strong
demand for technology stocks. Traders said Nasdaq stocks had become oversold
earlier this month, and with cyclicals and larger-capitalisation issues
languishing, investors jumped into technology company and other
growth-oriented stocks in search of bargains and quick gains.
There was also some heartening news from a leading manufacturer.
Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving and construction
equipment, predicted healthier first quarter earnings than it had originally
estimated, and announced plans to hire additional workers to cover a surge
in demand. It was the third time since November that Caterpillar has had to
add to its workforce.
Ignoring inflation jitters, and the bearish bond market, this is the kind of
news investors want to hear - a strengthening economy, growing demand for
goods and services, an expanding labour force, and improving corporate
earnings. Not surprisingly, all of this has done wonders for Caterpillar's
share price. From a low Dollars 57 3/4 last year, Caterpillar's stock has
soared more than 100 per cent.
Monday    3862.98 + 00.28
Tuesday   3849.59 - 13.39
Wednesday 3848.15 - 01.44
Thursday  3865.14 + 16.99
Friday    3895.65 + 30.51

FT  19 MAR 94 / Markets: Is UB a crumbling cookie? - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those with a pessimistic turn of mind, Thursday's results from United
Biscuits raised a familiar question: Is the company big enough to survive in
the changing world of food manufacture?
The thesis is straightforward. Food processing is being dominated more and
more by a handful of giants such as Nestle or Unilever. They can link their
operations across whole continents, and have international brands.
They can afford to drive down the cost of production and force up their
marketing spending. They can afford to invest across the developing world,
where the real growth lies in the next century. In that light, UB's position
looks rather shaky.
Historically, much its most important market outside Britain has been the
US. On Thursday it announced restructuring charges there of more than Pounds
90m. Its US profits are past the worst - but its margins are still half what
they were two years ago, and its market share is down.
The position is not much brighter at home. UB has a dominant 44 per cent of
the UK biscuit market but its profits there fell 10 per cent last year. In
snacks, where it is also market leader, profits fell 4 per cent last year.
Retreating to the home market, plainly, is not an option.
Eric Nicoli, UB's forthright chief executive, will have none of this. First,
he argues, the fall in UK profits is not primarily the result of
competition.
Second, the US subsidiary, Keebler, clearly is recovering. Third, UB's
situation outside the UK and US has been transformed in the past four years.
These points are worth taking separately. Last year, Nicoli says, UK raw
material prices increases were in double figures. The new crop of nuts - in
which UB is market leader - was up 50 per cent. With inflation running at
around 2 per cent, passing on that kind of increase was not feasible.
In any case, he says, the competition is not so much international giants as
small domestic operators trying to get bigger. Around Europe, UB is not
dominated by big companies. In biscuits, it is number one in the UK,
Holland, Denmark, Finland, Hungary and Poland. Europe's biggest biscuit
maker, BSN, of France, is No 1 in France and Belgium and, says UB, almost
nowhere else. 'Biscuits are BSN's least profitable part and are a low
priority for them,' Nicoli says. 'They'll be reluctant to divert funds to
duff us up.'
As for recovery in the US, it remains to be seen how sustainable it will
prove. The restructuring plan has been produced by a new management
installed last year. The old team, Nicoli says, had a volume-driven strategy
which, although ideal in the 1980s, was quite wrong for the 1990s.
Certainly, a recovery in the US is of central importance to the group. It
must expand internationally; but, given the pressures in the UK, the
domestic business cannot fund such expansion on its own.
It is in the international field, though, that Nicoli makes his strongest
case. Four years ago, UB had no significant presence outside the UK and US.
Last year, continental Europe and the Asia/Pacific region produced 22 per
cent of group profits.
Since UB cannot afford to match the likes of Nestle in the breadth of its
investments, it is focusing on Asia and central Europe. It has 5 per cent of
the biscuit market in the Shanghai area. It manufactures in Japan, the
Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. As for eastern Europe, its dominance in
Hungary and Poland speaks for itself.
Nevertheless, it remains worrying that, in all its chief markets, UB is up
against companies which, as corporate entities, are several times its size.
This could help to explain why UB's shares rose on Thursday in response to a
headline fall in profits of 28 per cent.
If the company cannot succeed on its own, the assets which it has assembled
so painstakingly will be worth a good deal to someone else.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Hoare Govett sterling bonds - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoare Govett is planning an issue of sterling bonds, with additional income
generated by Waldner Financial Corporation, a Chicago based money manager
which boasts annual returns of 47.6 per cent over the last 10 years.
Eighty per cent of the money invested is used to buy triple-A rated sterling
bonds for collateral, while the remaining 20 per cent is managed by Waldner,
which has a technical 'quantitative' management approach.
According to Hoare Govett, the worst case is that the investor gets half the
interest normally paid on a triple-A rated sterling bond, but based on past
performance returns would be close to 20 per cent.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Fall in world's emerging stock
markets - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's emerging stock markets continued the fall that began last month.
The setback affected even Latin American markets, which had taken over from
south east Asia as investors' favourites - though some individual markets
bucked the declining trend. Michael Hughes, of BZW, said that although the
emerging markets bubble has not burst, there has been a clear change in
attitude by investors.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Markets: Pilot error brings F&amp;C to earth - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savings schemes that look too good to be true usually are. When F&amp;C launched
its High Income unit trust, with a 10 per cent yield, just over a year ago,
it seemed outstandingly attractive.
True, the company itself pointed out that the yield was not guaranteed. And
it said, openly, that investors were sacrificing most of their hopes of
capital growth in order to enjoy this yield. But investors loved it.
Many were despairing refugees from banks and building societies - and they
had good reason to despair. For as the chart on page III shows, their income
was being squeezed, not just in nominal terms but also in real
(inflation-adjusted) terms.
The trust was structured cleverly so that it could be tucked inside a
general personal equity plan. So, investors could enjoy the income free of
tax. Quite how the fund managers achieved all this was a bit harder to work
out.
Just over half of the money went into blue chip UK shares - which gave the
fund its general Pep credentials. The bulk of the rest went into 'designer
debentures' - short-term loans to blue chip borrowers which came with a
bunch of premiums from selling options 'embedded' in them. The option
element performed the miracle of getting the yield on the debentures up to
25 - 30 per cent. Repeat, 25 - 30 per cent.
The snag was that capital losses were also effectively 'embedded' in the
debentures: that is, they were likely to produce a capital loss on
redemption. The rump of the fund was kept in cash, with part going to buy
FT-SE 100 put options which would act as a safety net if the market fell out
of bed.
If some of this leaves you boggling, you are not alone. Few people
understood even the broad principles of the fund. And it was impossible for
even a knowledgeable outsider to make any sensible judgment on the detail.
The broad idea seemed to be that the debentures were a way of turning
capital into income, but the management hoped the share portfolio would
produce compensatory capital growth.
F&amp;C was, however, pretty clear about what the effect of any future changes
in interest rates would be: 'The fund's deposit income will be lower when
interest rates are low. But Foreign &amp; Colonial's calculations show that the
projected 10 per cent income return will be achievable with base rates in
the range of 4 per cent to 14 per cent. The income generated by the fund
will not be affected by base rate cuts within this range.'
Not an actual promise, but it is hardly surprising that this statement acted
as a clarion call to the financial advisers who made so much money selling
the High Income fund. In just over a year, the F&amp;C fund pulled in Pounds
500m, a remarkable amount for any new trust.
Another fund management house, Morgan Grenfell, produced a copycat product
which has attracted Pounds 40m. But a third group, Save &amp; Prosper, which had
been planning to enter the market, pulled out suddenly in December. It
explained that it was worried that a fund yielding as much as 10 per cent
would devour its capital in order to meet its income target. It reckoned
there was a 50/50 chance of investors losing half their capital in seven
years; the rest would then evaporate even faster.
This week, even though base rates are 5 1/4 per cent, F&amp;C announced plans to
cut the High Income fund's yield from 10 to 9 per cent at the end of June.
Its main explanation was that the reduction in money market rates had
reduced the level of option premiums, and that it was expecting rates to
fall further.
Well, yes. But what really leapt to the eye was the capital performance of
the units. Anyone who had paid the full 25p to buy the shares on their
initial launch would, after costs, this week have got back only 22.6p. So, a
near-10 per cent fall in capital value neatly cancels out the 10 per cent
income received over the year.
Roughly half the fall can be put down to the initial charge on the fund. But
the rest is genuine capital loss resulting from the managers' chosen
strategy. The Morgan Grenfell units have also shrunk in value since their
launch in September. The stock market as a whole has risen over the period:
the FT-SE 100 index, which includes the major companies in which the F&amp;C
fund invests, is around 15 per cent higher than when the fund was launched.
To be brutal, it has been a very disappointing investment.
That, though, is history. What investors want to know now is whether they
should cut their losses, or whether F&amp;C has just been going through a sticky
patch.
Some brokers have started suggesting investors should switch into equity
income funds, which have produced far better total returns recently. But
switching is always costly. And it is by no means certain that stock markets
will provide such a favourable background for other funds over the next
year.
Does the F&amp;C fund warrant a cold shoulder in its own right? Here are two
points to ponder.
First, the fact that some capital has been lost already makes it even harder
for F&amp;C to produce the goods in future. It will have to run ever faster to
stand still. Getting a 9 per cent yield this year could prove as costly in
capital terms as getting a 10 per cent yield last year. Second, it is hard
to feel comfortable relying on a black box formula that has produced a crash
landing on its maiden flight.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Beware the sickly Russian bear: Should the west spoon-feed
its old adversary; should it 'cuddle up to Yeltsin'? Or should it treat
Russia as a serious country with its own serious national interests?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surprising question confronts the western powers. Should they fear Russia?
The west, it seems, has come to believe that Russia is no longer a menace -
after Mikhail Gorbachev opened it up and Boris Yeltsin introduced democracy.
Rocky, volatile, impoverished, it may be, but not dangerous; no longer an
adversary.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, western politicians have been asking
how to use aid to encourage Russia to be friendly, democratic and
market-orientated. However, in the US the debate has moved to an older
question: whether the Russian bear, reborn after communism, should be feared
as much as tamed.
The elections in December did most to re-open the question. The party which
achieved by far the largest number of votes in the State Duma was Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, who believe that Russia should at least
re-conquer the space formerly occupied by the Soviet Union.
Alexei Mitrofanov, 'shadow foreign minister' for the LDP, says that 'we
consider the ex-Soviet republics as integral parts of Russia, and our idea
is to restore them to the previous (Russian imperial) status. Not separate
countries - and not even something like the Soviet republics. There will be
for example no Ukraine - but provinces, as Kiev province, Donetsk province
and so on - only local administration, all connected to Moscow.'
The oddly named Liberal Democrats are not the only Russians to hold such
view. The powerful Russian Communist party and many other groups inside and
outside the parliament have also founded their popular appeal on the
aggressive reassertion of Russian power in the 'near abroad' - the revealing
appellation for the former Soviet states.
They are the inheritors of a massive wave of popular revulsion against the
arrogance of the west, the impoverishment of Russia and, most of all, the
sudden estrangement of more than 25m Russians living in the 'near abroad'
from a shrunken motherland.
They are prey to theories of conspiratorial domination and control whose
defining points can appear to be plausibly anchored in reality.
Alexander Prokhanov, whose weekly 'DEN' was the bible of the nationalist
movements and which has appeared again in a new guise after being banned, is
the most talented of these theorists.
He says: 'It's quite simple. The US is exercising its dictatorship over the
domestic and foreign policies of Russia, over her cultural and ideological
policies. So Russia's foreign policy in all regions of the world must match
the national interests of the US in these regions.
'America's policy towards the geopolitical space known as the Soviet Union
amounted to seeking its dismemberment and undermining Russia's potential,
then keeping this potential at a safe level for America. In these aims
(President Boris) Yeltsin and (Foreign Minister Andrei) Kozyrev have been
accomplices.'
These are not the voices of executive power in Moscow, but they are the
voices of influence and of a powerful strand of popular protest. Both before
the December elections and more obviously after, the executive power has
shifted to accommodate the nationalist revival.
Kozyrev has moved furthest: from the too-uncritical westerniser he was when
he came to office at the end of 1991, he has become a nationalist statesman.
He is not afraid of out-flanking Zhirinovsky on the need to keep the
Kaliningrad enclave Russian. He has been threatening on Ukraine and has
allowed it to be thought he wanted Russian troops to remain in the Baltics
indefinitely.
In more considered public voice, an article he wrote a week ago in the daily
Izvestiya underscored that 'Russia is doomed to be a great power' with
interests which conflicted with those of the west - but that these conflicts
could be managed peacefully as conflicts between friendly states everywhere.
The devils lie in the details of what it means to be a great power.
For Andrannik Migranyan, one of President Yeltsin's most publicly visible
advisors, Russia 'is a big power, economically stronger than any of its
former republics'. In relation to the 'near abroad', he points out that
Russia has a very serious interest: the Russians living outside the
Federation; it needs accesses and routes to the Baltic and other seas
through former republics; it needs to ensure security.
'All of these factors demand that Russia become a core for the reintegration
of this space. Without this (reintegration) we can get many clashes, fights
and wars - and we already have them.'
Thus Migranyan suggests at the pressure Russia can bring to bear on the
surrounding countries now struggling to establish viable statehoods.
Economically, Russia dominates all but the lucky few which have substantial
resources, such as Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. It has proposed
a rouble zone to bind together again states whose links remain strong: but
as the squeeze upon economies gets tighter, the criteria for entry also
become tighter.
Last week, the governor of the Central Bank of Belarus - the Slav state
which has sued for an economic union with Russia once more - said that
Russia wanted complete submission to central economic and financial policy.
Belarus is so prostrate and so politically inert that Russia may get it. If
so, it will be a template for other economies - and the prize would be
Ukraine, whose economy is in full collapse.
Militarily, Russia has bases in every one of the former Soviet states except
Lithuania and Azerbaijan (and it is likely to get its bases back in the
latter before long). Armies have 'kept the peace' in Georgia, Armenia,
Moldova and Tajikistan - sometimes using, as Sergei Karaganov, a
presidential advisor on foreign policy, wrily admits, 'nineteenth century
methods'.
In Georgia, the Russian army was decisive in first destabilising, then (when
he had come to heel) underpinning, the position of Eduard Shevardnadze, the
head of state; in Tajikistan, the regime would fall without it; in Moldova,
the 14th army's presence protects the interests of the majority Russian
speakers on the left bank of the River Dnestr and effectively divides the
country into two. Especially in Moldova and Georgia, where Yeltsin gave
assurances which the army later ignored, it seems as though the army is
conducting its own foreign policy.
Politically, the great wave of nationalism which swept through the Soviet
Union between 1989 and 1992 has all but exhausted itself - except in Russia.
Non-Russian nationalism in the other republics was also anti-Russian
nationalism. So the Russian democrats were unable to cement alliances with
nationalists in those other republics.
Nationalism is now replaced with exhaustion in many states (the Baltics are
an exception: they remain strongly independent and in the case of Latvia and
Estonia, strongly anti-Russian). The support for nationalist politicians has
declined everywhere, including in Ukraine.
The new state elites have been unable, some unwilling, to develop the
attributes of statehood. There is some force to the comment of Sergei
Stankevich, one of the leaders of the centrist Party of Reconciliation and
Accord, that 'it is their choice to come to us, not ours. We simply open our
doors to our neighbours: you cannot interpret this as imperial behaviour'.
But that is precisely how an increasingly influential swathe of western
elite opinion is interpreting it. Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary
of State in articles and speeches; former National Security Adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski in a widely quoted article published in Foreign Affairs; the
influential columnist William Safire; the former head of the US National
Security Agency General William Odom - all of these are actively
propagandising against (as they represent it) a US-led, western policy of
putting Russia first, cuddling up to Yeltsin, letting down the East
Europeans and other former Soviets, and pretending there is a partnership.
In New York, Dr Kissinger says: 'We are dealing with Russia not as though it
were a serious country with its own serious national interests, but as some
kind of mental basket case that we have to massage, that we have to be very
careful to manoeuvre step by step into some vague relationship of
'friendship' with the west.
'Russia is acting in the traditional Russian manner, which has always had
the element of dominating the erstwhile republics of the former Soviet
Union. From that point of view, it is imperialist.'
The cause around which those who oppose the policy of the west have gathered
is that of the expansion of Nato. Under the 'Partnership for Peace' proposal
put forward by President Bill Clinton in Brussels in January, all the former
Communist states would be eligible to participate in the Partnership at
whatever level suited them. For the Poles, the Balts, the Czechs and the
Hungarians, it was a slap in the face - a clear indication that the west
favoured Russian interests over theirs.
They have powerful allies in the west, among them Mr Brzezinski. In
Washington, he said: 'I think that if we were to expand Nato eastwards and
Nato were to offer Russia a treaty of alliance; if we were to balance aid to
Russia with more aid for the non-Russian states, we might succeed in
creating a geo-political context that would be relatively stable and would
mitigate some of the dangers (of Russian expansionism). This would help the
Russian democrats by bringing the west closer to Russia; if we don't do it
now, when would we do it? Is a political vaccuum in the heart of Europe in
the interests of Russia?'
This potentially damaging attack has drawn blood, and a response. On Monday,
the US Defence Secretary William Perry took on Kissinger, Brzezinski and
others when he said the current policy included views of Russia both as a
rival and a partner. This was 'lost on our critics of constructive
engagement. They say we have chosen to make Russia a partner when we should
be making them a rival. And I say that is a false dichotomy.'
The debate can only be inconclusive: for it depends on factors which are
unknowable. Migranyan, the presidential advisor, believes Russia is 'in no
sense a democracy: it is passing through a time of authoritarianism from
which it might emerge into a democracy'. Professor Peter Reddaway of the US
Institute for Peace, one of the most consistently pessimistic of the
prominent commentators on Russia, points to the criminalisation of the
economy and warns of a turning away from reform.
It is certain that we are facing a country which will remain an enigma - if
no longer enclosed in a dogma. It is undergoing a loss of empire of the kind
Britain and France sustained in the 20th century, with an adoption of
democracy which took most of the western states centuries to achieve, plus
an opening to markets for which the culture was wholly unprepared. It should
not be forgotten how intense this process is.
BBC Radio 4 will broadcast two programmes by John Lloyd: 'Russia: the Bear
Awakes' tomorrow (Sunday) at 4.15pm; and 'Russia, the Bear Contained?' on
Thursday at 8pm (repeated next Sunday, 4.15pm)

FT  19 MAR 94 / The Long View: Debatable dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase of 50 per cent in the dividend of the UK merchant bank Schroders
this week, though scarcely typical, has provided a reminder that dividends
are showing unexpected buoyancy this year. Although earnings cover has
become thin, by historical standards, British companies are ready to be
generous.
At present the income on the All-Share Index is showing growth of 4.6 per
cent on a year ago, adjusting for the negative effect of last year's
dividend tax changes, and the growth rate could expand by a percentage point
or two as the results season progresses. This is not bad when, for
comparison, pay is rising at only 3 1/4 per cent in the UK and underlying
retail price inflation is a little less than that.
Elsewhere in Europe shareholders are not so fortunate. In Germany, for
instance, the big companies are displaying their traditional readiness to
cut dividends in bad times: the big chemical groups BASF and Hoechst have
both trimmed by 20 per cent or so.
During the past five years, since shortly before the recession began to
bite, UK dividends have grown by a cumulative 7 per cent in real terms,
while capital investment in real terms in the UK has fallen by 14 per cent.
Profits are heading this year towards 16 or 17 per cent of GDP, close to a
post-war peak, and yet output is no higher than four years ago and imports
are rising rapidly. Has British short-termism come to dominate once again,
with companies trying to keep shareholders happy rather than invest in the
future?
There is no simple trade-off here, because companies are becoming quite
flush with funds. Indeed, many forecasters expect that the corporate sector
will begin to expand its investment again quite markedly this year. But will
companies find opportunities that are profitable enough? Once more there are
signs that the British economy is looking less vigorous than are British
plcs. Too many chief executives, it seems, are looking for a 20 per cent
return on equity, even though inflation is much lower than it used to be.
Consider the puzzle of the so-called output gap, which economists now
attempt to measure rather as the old theologians calculated the number of
angels on a pinhead. It is the gap between current output and underlying
productive capacity, and allegedly explains the downwards pressure on prices
(with factory gate wholesale prices rising by only 3.3 per cent in the year
ended February, down from 4 per cent-plus reached at one stage last year).
But this output gap co-exists rather oddly with the Pounds 13.4bn trade gap
in visible goods last year. You would think that if there was surplus
capacity there would tend to be production in excess of domestic
requirements. Soon the government may start to become restless as it
realises that import volumes are rising (at more than 3 per cent a year) and
that the balance of payments deficit may threaten sterling. It will become
agitated if capital investment fails to recover and 'restructuring', not to
mention 'downsizing', continue to be the buzz words in British boardrooms.
If capacity is being sidelined it must be that it is not regarded as
profitable enough to be operated at current or immediately prospective price
levels. For a time, British industry may continue its conjuring trick of
generating more profit out of scarcely rising output. But an attempt to
achieve much higher rates of return than are required by competitors in
countries such as Germany will inevitably lead to a loss of market share in
both the home and export markets - unless there is a further substantial
sterling devaluation, which still seems unlikely.
International economists do a lot of work on the competitiveness of labour
forces, and how expensive workers in Germany, costing Dollars 25 an hour,
will tend to lose out to Chinese workers costing Dollars 3 an hour or less.
Perhaps more investigation could be done on how shareholders making
ambitious demands can price their companies out of more competitive market
sectors.
We are coming up to a tricky period of transition for the British economy.
Consumer spending has been driving the recovery so far but domestic
consumption is already very high and if the next stage is to be healthy
there must be an emphasis on capital investment and exports. But if domestic
companies have excessive expectations of profits, because they seek to
satisfy the ambitions of pension fund investors, who have enjoyed dividend
growth of 10 per cent and a total rate of return of 22 per cent on UK
equities annually on average over the past 15 years, they may be scratching
around for opportunities. There is a limit to the availability of
newly-privatised monopoly utilities with huge cost-cutting potential.
In an open economy, of course, greedy domestic investors will be outbid by
foreigners. We have seen key industries such as motors (Rover, for instance)
and semiconductors drift into overseas control. Perhaps we can afford to
leave the duds and the marginal cases to overseas' owners. With luck, they
will continue to run the operations in the UK, at least for a while. But the
persistence of a substantial trade gap through a deep recession indicates a
chronic shortage of available capacity.
There is a mirror image contrast with Japan, where in the late 1980s vast
amounts of capital became available to industry at almost zero cost. The
result was an explosion of investment in low return productive capacity and
today Japan runs a trade surplus of Dollars 140bn a year. This is not an
example to follow either, because economic logic requires that the yen must
be squeezed up to ruinous levels so as to force the closure of capacity and
restore some sort of equilibrium. Investors, meantime, have lost heavily.
In the UK, in spite of recent setbacks, stock market investors are sitting
pretty by comparison. Managers of UK companies are making the assets sweat.
But soon the government could be sweating too.

FT  19 MAR 94 / US urges Serbs to join Bosnia peace process: Bosnian Croats
and Moslems sign deal - Major pledges Pounds 12m for Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton of the US urged Serbia yesterday to join the Balkan
peace process as Bosnia's Croat and Moslem leaders signed an agreement
creating a federation in that part of the republic not held by the Bosnian
Serbs.
He specifically urged the Bosnian Serbs to 'join in this effort for a wider
peace. We invite and urge them to do so.'
Mr John Major, the British prime minister who visited Sarajevo yesterday,
also appealed to the Serbs to join the peace process. He said: 'I think we
just have to continually put pressure on the Serbs to realise that it's
going to be necessary to reach a political settlement, that there are no
gains to be made by continuing fighting.'
While in Sarajevo, Mr Major announced that Britain would provide Pounds 12m
to help rebuild the city's infrastructure, of which Pounds 5m would be
allotted to a joint Anglo-American civil mission to provide health care,
restore the power generation system and rebuild the city's railway line. The
rest would go to the UN organisations providing aid.
Mr Clinton said yesterday's measures were 'only first steps but they are
steps in the right direction . . . they offer one of the first clear signals
that parties to this conflict are willing to end the violence and begin a
process of reconstruction.'
The US is pinning considerable hopes that next week Mr Vitaly Churkin,
Russia's special envoy to former Yugoslavia, will be able to forge an
agreement between Croatia and Serbia on the status of the Serb-held Krajina
region in south-eastern Croatia.
In Washington, both President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Franjo Tudjman
of Croatia asked for help to rebuild their nations. Mr Clinton promised that
the US would contribute and said it stood ready to act, through Nato, to
help sustain any broader and enforceable peace agreement involving all three
parties.
But Mr Izetbegovic, considered the most reluctant party to the agreement,
also said he wanted a 'fair peace', which would include the retention of
Bosnia's old borders, resettlement of those expelled from their homes, and a
war crimes tribunal.
The agreement also laid out the principles of a confederation between the
Croat parts of Bosnia and Croatia itself. This blueprint could be extended
to allow the Bosnian Serbs a comparable relationship with Serbia.
Serb leaders yesterday appeared in disarray over the Washington agreement,
uncertain whether it heralded a pact against the Serbs, or formally
sanctioned Greater Serbia and Croatia.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Bank plans first gilt with variable rate since 1979
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is to launch its first government bond with a
variable-rate coupon - rather than a fixed interest rate - for 15 years.
The variable-rate issue will enable the Bank to proceed with its gilt sales
even in the present volatile bond market.
Although the Bank is well ahead with the government's funding programme, it
appeared keen to avoid delaying the next auction, as that might have
unsettled a jittery gilts market.
With a sale of conventional gilts, however, the Bank could have been locked
into yields many economists believe are higher than justified by Britain's
inflation and economic outlook. By contrast, the coupons on the
variable-rate gilts are likely to be adjusted at regular intervals.
Timing aside, the Bank had already been exploring variable-rate gilts as a
means of attracting more money from banks and building societies, which
regularly invest in floating-rate notes.
The new issue will be sold at auction on March 30, and details of the
amount, maturity and coupon will be announced by the Bank next Tuesday. The
coupon is likely to be set using the London interbank rate, the common
method of setting the coupon on floating-rate sterling bonds.
The Bank issued three variable-rate gilts in the late 1970s, but investor
demand was poor. Yesterday's announcement, however, gave a boost to gilt
prices.

FT  19 MAR 94 / S African police armed Zulus, says inquiry head: Three
leading officers are suspended by de Klerk

Senior South African police officers helped supply weapons to the Zulu-based
Inkatha Freedom party, according to evidence published yesterday by a
judicial commission of inquiry.
The report by the prestigious Goldstone Commission is the clearest
suggestion yet of security force involvement in political violence and
appears to support longstanding allegations by the African National Congress
that a 'third force' is involved in the bloodshed between itself and
Inkatha.
The report said a special police unit was involved in the manufacture and
smuggling of weapons to Inkatha and that Lt-Gen Basie Smit, police force No
2, Maj-Gen Krappies Engelbrecht, head of police intelligence, and Maj-Gen
Johan le Roux, another senior police officer, had been aware of the unit's
existence.
President F W de Klerk said the three men had been suspended and an
international task force would investigate their case.
The report by the commission, headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, alleged
that senior police officers had been involved in arms supplies to Inkatha
since 1990. In 1992, the so-called Inkathagate scandal, involving government
funding to Inkatha, rocked the government of President de Klerk. At that
time, he claimed he was unaware of the funding and insisted all improper
links between Pretoria and Inkatha had been severed.
President de Klerk announced a purge of the senior ranks of the police force
in late 1992 and appointed a respected officer of the South African Defence
Force to conduct an inquiry into security force involvement in violence. The
results of that inquiry were never published and its recommendations were
never made known.
Yesterday's report said the men were involved in the manufacture of homemade
weapons in the East Rand townships near Johannesburg which have seen some of
the worst violence since political unrest increased dramatically four years
ago.
Meanwhile, in a move likely to increase the potential for further political
violence, Zulu king Goodwill Zwelethini held a public meeting at Ulundi,
capital of the Kwa Zulu black homeland, to call on his supporters to boycott
April's all-race elections.
He urged them to fight to defend the sovereignty of the Zulu nation, which
he said was under threat. 'I call on all Zulus to fulfil their sacred duty
to defend our freedom,' he said.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Mirror cleared to buy Independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consortium backed by Mirror Group Newspapers was yesterday given
government approval to take over Newspaper Publishing, owner of The
Independent and the Independent on Sunday.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided not to refer the
deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the grounds that the papers
'are not economic as going concerns' and there was a case for urgency.
Unless there is judged to be a serious financial threat to the existence of
a title, an MMC reference is usually required when the combined circulations
of newspapers involved in takeovers is more than 500,000 a day.
Mr Heseltine did not, as many expected, accompany his permission with
conditions.
He rejected the views of 99 MPs who signed an early day motion arguing that,
as an absolute minimum, conditions should be imposed to protect the
editorial independence of The Independent.
Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, emphasised that guarantees of
editorial independence were 'enshrined in print in the consortium agreements
and we are bound by them'.
The Commons trade and industry committee is expected to consider on
Wednesday whether to seek an inquiry into the issue.
Journalists at the two loss-making newspapers asked for the reference to the
MMC. Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers group of Ireland, the largest
shareholder in Newspaper Publishing at 29.9 per cent, wanted conditions to
be imposed. Mr Heseltine also cleared the Irish group's stake.
The consortium, whose other members are a group of founders led by Mr
Andreas Whittam Smith and newspaper groups El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica
of Italy, will press ahead with the reorganisation of Newspaper Publishing.
MGN will run The Independent - apart from the editorial department. The
Independent will join the MGN titles in the Canary Wharf tower in London's
Docklands in the next two months.
Apart from the reorganisation, as much as Pounds 20m may have to be put into
the company to improve content and increase promotion.

FT  19 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Scottish Amicable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Amicable is not the first UK life insurer to see continental Europe
as a land of opportunity. Changes in European law mean that its new
Dublin-based company will be able to sell the same products in Naples as in
Nether Wallop. The flowering of independent financial advisers in countries
such as Germany is especially to its liking. Others such as Commercial Union
and J. Rothschild Assurance, in which Scottish Amicable has an equity
interest, favour building ties with overseas banks.
Whichever approach proves more successful, the reasoning behind overseas
expansion is not difficult to fathom. With around 250 life insurance
companies operating in the UK, the domestic market looks hopelessly
overcrowded. The emergence of banc - assurance - and the steady erosion of
ties with banks and building societies that comes with it - is making
matters worse.
Since only a quarter of the Pounds 100m raised from the bond market in
December has been sunk into the European venture, Scottish Amicable can
afford an initiative closer to home. The company has set its face against
building a sales force of its own, on the grounds that such investment is
rarely profitable. Buying an unquoted competitor, slashing overheads and
running off its existing business - the approach being explored by Sir Mark
Weinberg - might yield a decent profit. Unless the move really strengthened
Scottish Amicable's competitive position, though, such opportunism holds
little appeal.

FT  19 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa and British Airways will be delighted by the US government's
approval of their code-sharing agreements with US carriers. The potential
benefits are perhaps best gauged by the vehemence of the opposition of rival
US airlines. By effectively tapping into the US domestic market, the two
European airlines can help secure lucrative business traffic which is so
critical to profitability. Although BA carries some 25m passengers a year,
it makes two-thirds of its revenue from 75,000 customers who regularly
travel at the front of the cabin.
BA's link with USAir is under a cloud, given the latter's severe financial
strains. But Lufthansa's code-sharing arrangements with United should help
it return to profitability. Lufthansa could gain up to DM100m a year in
extra revenue through code-sharing. That should ease the way for the
government to reduce its majority shareholding as part of its privatisation
programme. Lufthansa's closer links with United will be especially painful
for Delta, which has a big presence at Frankfurt. The few big US carriers
without a European partner must be growing ever more desperate to get
hitched.
Despite recent accords, there remain big uncertainties about the regulation
of some transatlantic routes. While passengers would appreciate the virtues
of further liberalisation, it is not clear that shareholders should be so
enamoured. As the domestic US airline market graphically illustrates, too
much competition can be an uncomfortable thing.

FT  19 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: House of Fraser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Fayed brothers will not be the only ones to be slightly disappointed by
the 180p price tag which was eventually hung on the House of Fraser group.
Earlier soundings suggested that the group might go for more than Pounds
2.00 a share, and the lead manager, SG Warburg, limited the public offer to
25 per cent of the shares. If the bank believed that pre-marketing to
institutions would control the float better and encourage a higher price, it
has been proved wrong.
Institutions could see House of Fraser coming. The Fayeds were known to have
explored other options and the market thus seemed disinclined to pay up for
a property which had not been placed elsewhere. Even the 25 per cent
publicly offered could have been clawed back by institutions, so there was
little incentive to chase the shares.
Arguably a better tactic would have been to market the issue more heavily at
private investors, who are keen on businesses they know and can understand.
More limited allocations to institutions might have caused a little hunger
and, potentially, a higher price. It may be argued that in volatile
conditions the issue had to be priced cautiously, but the 26.2 point rise in
the FT-SE 100 this week hardly constitutes a bear market. Still, the silver
lining is that at 180p House of Fraser should be a lot more attractive to
individuals. Both Warburg and the Stock Exchange may be embarrassed if the
issue is now heavily oversubscribed.

FT  19 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Floating in rough water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The lady may be old but she certainly has a fertile imagination. Until
3.30pm yesterday it looked as though the Bank of England was in an appalling
quandary over the gilt market. It had to decide whether to have an auction
this month. To duck out might have seemed an admission of inability to fund
at all in such difficult markets. A long-dated issue could have easily
flopped. A very short-dated one would have appeared like a commitment to a
prompt cut in interest rates. By opting for a floating rate issue instead,
the Bank seems to have uncovered a rich new seam of demand.
The issue will almost certainly appeal strongly to banks which are facing
shortage of loan demand, especially since it requires minimal capital
backing under Basle risk ratio rules. Of course, targeting bank investors is
only possible because the Treasury is nowadays prepared to count sales of
gilts to banks as part of official PSBR funding. Abuse of this relatively
new freedom could be seen as a wanton disregard of inflationary risk. Some
will doubtless also construe yesterday's move as an admission that
fixed-rate yields have troughed.
The other interpretation is that a readiness to issue floating rate debt is
an indication of the Bank's faith in its ability to curb inflation, for much
the same reason that it likes to sell index-linked gilts. This argument only
holds good if the authorities are cautious about their recourse to the
banks. They need to sell enough floating rate debt to ensure the issue is
liquid and to allay fears of over-supply in the fixed-rate market. But
funding at floating rates is so easy that it could become a habit. Then
discipline over economic policy would disappear.

FT  19 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises as blue chips stage
late rally

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks staged a late rally yesterday as 'triple witching'
expiration activity finally overpowered nagging concerns over monetary
policy, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 30.51 higher at 3,895.65. By
contrast, the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a scant 0.16
ahead at 471.06. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite gained
2.33 to 472.96, as the Nasdaq composite, up 0.05 at 803.90, eked out a
second consecutive record high.
On the NYSE, activity was spirited, with the expiration of stock futures and
options on individual stocks and indices lifting volume to 446m, compared
with 303m a day earlier.
Investors began on a shaky note, amid speculation over the purpose of an
unusual meeting between President Clinton and the Federal Reserve chairman,
Mr Alan Greenspan. Although the White House later insisted that monetary
policy had not been discussed, the briefing served to intensify the focus on
the likelihood of the Fed nudging up short-term rates for a second time next
week.
With rate worries eating into bond prices, stock indices languished during
most of the session. But a final burst of program buying, concentrated on
blue-chip cyclical issues, brought the week to a satisfying conclusion.
Beneficiaries of the late push included such economically sensitive issues
as 3M, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 103 1/4 , General Electric, Dollars 1 7/8
ahead to Dollars 104 7/8 , and Alcoa, Dollars 1 5/8 better at Dollars 77 1/8
.
Among the other Dow components, McDonald's appreciated Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 61 1/4 , Disney gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47, and Chevron
closed Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 92 3/4 .
In banking, Citicorp dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 , even though
Moody's upgraded the group's debt. The rating service said the move
reflected 'the company's improving profitability'.
Transportation stocks were among the weakest. UAL, parent of United
Airlines, shed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 127 5/8 while AMR, parent of
American, lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 7/8 . Conrail was marked down
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 59 3/4.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei average lost ground in spite of buying by overseas investors, as
dealers adjusted their positions and companies took profits ahead of the
long weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The lead index fell 122.71 to 20,469.45 after a high of 20,655.67 and a low
of 20,440.14, a week's gain of 1.7 per cent.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.29 to 1,647.24 and the
Nikkei 300 lost 0.43 to 302.69.
Volume fell to 450m shares from 571m, the moderation of the market's
enthusiasm reflecting Monday's national holiday. Losers led gainers by 561
to 471 with 154 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 1.94 to
1,360.72.
Participants awaited the outcome of the branch managers' meetings at the Big
Four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and their strategies for
the next business year starting next month.
The brokers themselves were lower on the spate of downward earnings
revisions for the year ending March 31, announced on Thursday. Sanyo
Securities, which said that it would post a pre-tax loss of Y8bn, fell Y4 to
Y675.
Nomura Securities, which also revised down its earning projection due to
lower-than-expected equity commissions, lost Y10 to Y2,380.
Steel companies, which have been higher on active foreign buying recently,
met profit-taking by corporations. Nippon Steel lost Y6 to Y354 and Kawasaki
Steel declined Y3 to Y375.
In contrast, speculative issues were higher on buying by individuals. Honshu
Paper shot up Y55 to Y825 and Nippon Carbon rose Y37 to Y486.
Foreign investors sought shipbuilders, with Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries up Y8 to Y468 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries rising Y16 to Y419.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 0.88 to 22,546.04 in volume of 110.2m shares.
Roundup
A sharp fall in Hong Kong depressed much of the remainder of the region.
HONG KONG tumbled 4.1 per cent as institutions continued to sell blue chips
and small investors joined in, taking the week's fall to 7.8 per cent.
The Hang Seng index fell 380.82 to 9,132.31, having pulled up from a day's
low of 8,996.
One London analyst described the week's decline as the continued 'flip-side'
to the euphoria which saw the market surge during November and December last
year, as reality continues to return to the market.
Many UK funds had managed to make their exit near the top of the market, but
US investors were still selling as worries grew over the outlook for the
Chinese economy. The analyst added that many investors were awaiting more
realistic valuations as a trigger to start buying in the region again and
that at current lower levels, Hong Kong was beginning to look more
attractive.
All sectors have been hit by the bear-run with finance and property among
the heaviest losers. HSBC Holdings slid HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 92.50,
while its Hang Seng Bank unit fell HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 52.50. Cheung
Kong lost HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 37.50 and its associate, Hutchison
Whampoa, lost 75 cents to HKDollars 30.25.
SINGAPORE encountered widespread foreign and local selling, sparked by the
fall in Hong Kong, but a little bargain-hunting helped the market recoup
some losses at the close. The Straits Times Industrials index fell 49.63 or
2.3 per cent to 2,104.02, for a 3.9 per cent fall over the week.
TAIWAN sustained a 2.3 per cent fall in the weighted index as pressure told
on the financial sector in particular. The index fell 122.25 to 5,274.81, a
decline across the week of 1 per cent, with turnover at TDollars 45.6bn, up
from Thursday's TDollars 39bn, but still moderate.
The financial sector dipped 2.9 per cent with Chinatrust, the day's most
active issue, falling TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 63.
SEOUL closed easier in moderate trading after brief gains were wiped out by
late selling pressure, brokers said.
The suspension of trading in Namhan Paper, after the company sought court
protection from creditors, dampened sentiment and the composite index fell
5.49 to 893.07, for a 1.2 per cent fall on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR ended weaker but off the day's lows as a spate of
bargain-hunting boosted prices late in the day.
The composite index finished 20.14 lower at 1,007.60, for a 3.7 per cent
fall on the week.
MANILA also felt the shock waves from Hong Kong and the composite index lost
55.33 to 2,657.98, but remained up 4 per cent on the week.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone weighed on sentiment following an
overnight fall in New York, closing off 25 pesos at 1,875 pesos.
Turnover rose to 1.23bn pesos with some 3.3bn shares changing hands.
AUSTRALIA was only slightly affected by events elsewhere, the All Ordinaries
index shedding just 0.9 to 2,163.5, barely changed on the week.
Turnover was ADollars 444.3m.
Lend Lease gained 2 cents to ADollars 17.92 after announcing that it was to
develop a joint venture with Indonesia's second largest company and its
subsidiary, Bank International Indonesia.
BANGKOK came off 1.6 per cent with pressure seen in blue chips overall,
although there was some bargain-hunting evident in several sectors. The SET
index fell 19.80 to 1,246.84, off 5.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was
thin at Bt4bn.

Paris in the springtime, at least as far as the bourse is concerned, is
showing few signs of life. The chill of February's sharp falls lingers, and
the principal indices remain below their start of year levels, in spite of
occasional spurts of activity over the past few weeks.
After Friday's 1 per cent fall, brought on mainly by worries of a further
tightening of US monetary policy, the CAC-40 index of leading shares closed
at 2,221.34, some 2 per cent below its level at the beginning of January,
and well adrift of the year's high of 2,355.93 set at the start of February.
The SBF120 index, a broader indicator launched last December and which
incorporates the CAC-40, has followed a similar trail.
For investors and the government, which is in the midst of an ambitious
privatisation programme, such uncertain progress presents a series of
questions. In particular, can the market regain last year's energy - in
which the CAC-40 gained 22 per cent - or does it face a protracted period of
fragility?
Most market analysts say prospects remain positive, although little progress
is expected in the short term. 'The market will probably move sideways for
some months and we may not have tested the lows,' says Mr Didier Cherpitel,
managing director of J. P. Morgan in Paris. But he believes the CAC-40 will
revive and attain a level of about 2,600 by the year end.
The current drift is the result of several factors. As elsewhere the bourse
is suffering from the rise in yields in international bond markets and
dampened hopes about the pace of interest rate cuts.
In France, such sentiments have been compounded by the cautious stance of
the newly independent Bank of France which, anxious to establish its
anti-inflationary credentials, has moved gingerly in cutting borrowing
costs. The intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, stands at
6.1 per cent, just 0.1 percentage points below its level at the beginning of
the year. 'Six months ago we were forecasting short-term rates of 4 per cent
by the end of the year, but that seems rather optimistic now,' said one
merchant banker.
A second, equally important factor is to be found in the burden of demands
on the bourse. Issues of shares and convertible bonds have totalled
FFr23.7bn so far this year, as a procession of companies from Paribas to
Peugeot have tapped the market. The figure, which compares with FFr50.2bn
for the whole of last year, is more than doubled if one includes the
privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, the country's largest industrial company.
'We expected a large number of share issues this year,' says Mr David
Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris, 'but the volume
in the first few months has been surprising.'
The privatisation programme and private capital raising is set to continue.
Unions des Assurances de Paris and AGF, a rival insurance group, are next to
step up to the privatisation auction block within the next few months. But
with the sale of Elf out of the way, the biggest single share issue ever
launched on the market, the flood of equity is likely to ease.
'We are not going to see the level of issues sustained through the rest of
the year,' says one analyst. 'The government is well on its way to its
target of privatisation receipts and is likely to call a halt after UAP and
AGF.'
If that provides one reason to predict the emergence of a more buoyant
market, a second is given by the revival of the economy and a shift of
investor's focus to earnings performance. 'We are in a transition period at
the moment,' says Mr Harrington. 'The markets have been driven essentially
by interest rates over the past 18 months, but now attention is shifting to
growth and earnings.'
With respect to growth, most forecasts are heading upwards. Insee, the
national statistics office, last week raised its forecast for first half GDP
growth from 0.5 per cent to 0.7 per cent. Many private sector economists
have upgraded annual growth forecasts from below 1 per cent to nearer the
government's estimate of 1.4 per cent. Although most economists believe the
official target is optimistic, they point to encouraging signs in economic
activity, particularly in the consumer sector.
The brighter macroeconomic picture is dispersing some of the shadows at the
corporate level. A string of companies, ranging from Lafarge Coppee, the
building materials group, to LVMH, the luxury goods company and Carrefour,
the food retailer, have announced improved profits and prospects over the
past few weeks.
Those companies with strong overseas sales or exposure to the consumer
sector are painting the most optimistic scenarios. Mr Bernard Arnault, LVMH
chairman, last week forecast profits growth in excess of 20 per cent this
year. The shares jumped correspondingly, gaining just under 5 per cent.
In many cases, however, there remains a strong sense of caution. 'Our
optimism is very relative,' says Mr Rene-Yves Nanot, chairman of Ciments
Francais, announcing halved losses for 1993 of FFr685m last week. 'Things
are clearly better,' says the finance director of one manufacturing group,
'but I do not think we will see a powerful rebound just yet.' Neither it
seems, will the Paris bourse.

FT  19 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Options expiries leave bourses
marked lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's fall in the Eurotrack 100 accelerated in midsession. News that
the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr Alan Greenspan, had been called to
the White House exacerbated the derivatives expiry effect, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fielded the expiry of stock and Dax future options. This inflated
turnover from DM8bn to DM24.3bn but, in share price terms, it seemed to
create little fuss during the official session which saw the Dax index ease
just 4.84 to 2,155.61 from Thursday's post bourse close, still 2.5 per cent
higher on the week.
However, the afternoon was more volatile. It saw an instant reaction to Mr
Greenspan's White House call; there was nervous anticipation of the German
February M3 figure next week; bunds took a deep dive and the Ibis indicated
Dax dropped nearly 26 points more to 2,129.66 before recovering to close at
2,140.39.
Mr Detlev Klug, head of sales at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that options
which had been left overhanging the market, with a view to taking profits on
Monday, were exercised at a known loss yesterday afternoon.
In London, derivatives traders said that investors were selling baskets of
equities and buying the Dax June future; the latter closed 27 1/2 points
lower at 2,154 which, on a fair value basis (net of carrying costs), meant
that the future was trading at a 12-point discount to the cash market.
AMSTERDAM weakened on options expiry as well as being unsettled by the bond
market. The AEX index lost 6.18 or 1.5 per cent to 418.32, barely changed on
the week.
Hoogovens fell Fl 4.60 to Fl 60.20 on reports of gloomy forecasts for its
steel division. Elsewhere DSM lost Fl 2.20 to Fl 124.20, Akzo Nobel a more
modest 70 cents to Fl 221.30, Unilever Fl 4.00 to Fl 205.50 and Elsevier,
which reported results on Thursday that slightly disappointed some analysts,
Fl 1.80 to Fl 175.60.
ZURICH wilted under pressure from the expiry of Soffex futures and options
and the market fell 1.5 per cent. The SMI index lost 44.2 to 2,843.5, 0.4
per cent up on the week.
Mr Mirko Sangiorgio at Bank Julius Baer commented that the market had tried
to move higher early in the week, after its recent consolidation, but turned
back in the absence of foreign support. Domestic investors, who had recently
taken profits, were unwilling to resume buying at current levels, and he
expected that the market could ease further next week.
Financials bore the brunt of the day's losses: SBC fell SFr13 or 3 per cent
to SFr423 and CS Holding SFr16 or 2.5 per cent to SFr632.
MILAN saw profit-taking which left the Comit index 6.08 lower at 674.52, but
1.4 per cent higher on the week.
Mr Nicolo Braendli at Akros Sim in Milan commented that the market met
resistance when the Comit index reached 680 on Thursday. Domestic investors,
increasingly turning their attention to next weekend's election, were seen
taking profits although foreign investors were ignoring short term political
developments and were continuing to focus on the longer term economic and
corporate outlook.
Industrials were in retreat after their strong recent gains. Montedison fell
L45 or 3.3 per cent to L1,224, Olivetti was L80 or 3.1 per cent lower at
L2,525 and Fiat was down L75 to L5,034.
BCI was L94 or 1.6 per cent lower at L5,804 as small investors who picked up
privatisation stock at L5,400 continued to take profits.
STOCKHOLM subsided, although the fall of 18.0, or 1.2 per cent to 1,500 in
the Affarsvarlden General index left it a mere fraction lower on the week.
Banks and forestry both had a bad day. The interest rate-sensitive SE-Banken
reacted to weakness in bonds with the A down SKr1.50 at SKr59; and SCA's
proposed SKr1bn international equity issue left the B SKr3 lower at SKr134
although the offer will only fund part of a French transport packaging
acquisition.

<TEXT>
Shock news that Allied Leisure had made heavy interim losses, passed its
dividend and lost its chief executive had a predictably shattering effect on
the shares. At the day's worst they had slumped 53 per cent, before firming
slightly to close a net 16 off at 27p. As well as posting interim losses of
Pounds 16.12m, the group also took a Pounds 14.23m restructuring charge. It
was announced after the market had closed that the resigning chief executive
Mr Richard Carr had sold 1.5m shares.
The decline in Allied's two main areas of business, ten-pin bowling and
nightclubs, gave rise to worries over First Leisure, although analysts were
quick to point out that while sharing the same markets the company differed
in management and style. First Leisure slid 15 before recovering to end 8
off at 313p.
A rumour early in the session that the George Michael versus Sony case had
been settled out of court - later denied by all parties concerned -
unsettled music and rental group Thorn EMI. The shares retreated 22 to
1122p.
Hotel concern Forte continued strong with sentiment again underpinned by its
potential purchase of a French hotel chain, stronger links with the Savoy
Group and an improving UK hotel market. The shares added 3 to 260p. Savoy
'A' gained 35 to 1115p.
Continued crude price weakness and the forthcoming OPEC meeting kept the
pressure on oil stocks, although Enterprise - down 2 to 411p - and BP - off
1 1/2 at 367 1/2 - were resilient. A successful drilling report lifted
Exploration Company of Louisiana 13 to 79p, while Goal Petroleum rose 2 to
67p after boosting its year-end dividend from 1.4p to 1.45p. Ms Irene Himona
at SGST said: 'I think people are treating the oil price as a temporary
aberration which will recover.'
Lasmo, expected to report reduced losses next Wednesday, fell 2 to 130p.
Standard Chartered rose 22 to 1160p. Swiss Bank is said to have been a keen
buyer over the past few days and other brokers have focused on the
forthcoming share split which is expected to attract further support. The
bank, which is heavily exposed to the Hong Kong market, rose in spite of a
380-point fall in the Hang Seng index, which helped drive HSBC down 37 to
787p and Cable &amp; Wireless 11 to 441p.
Barclays held up well, with the market regarding it as a strong recovery
stock. The shares fell a penny to 552p.
SG Warburg fell 19 to 765, hit by the weakness in bond prices and some
profit-taking.
A profits warning from double-glazing group Anglian for the year to April
pushed the shares down 28 to 287p. Mr Malcolm Brown at agency broker James
Capel downgraded his profit forecast by Pounds 1m to Pounds 25.5m. However,
Caradon, the second biggest player in the area held steady at 396p.
Milk group Unigate was lifted by a buy recommendation from SG Warburg. With
the shares currently yielding some 6 per cent, the broker said the stock
looked attractive for income funds, The shares bounced 7 to 360p. Unilever
was said to be undone by a large line of unplaced stock, the shares trailing
23 to 1058p.
McCarthy &amp; Stone put on a penny at 73p after announcing a Pounds 5.5m rights
issue. RMC improved 10 to 980p on thin trading: a handful of buyers found
the market short.
Amersham International added 29 at 1090p. There was vague talk of a share
split but it transpired that the price was squeezed up because dealers were
short of stock.
Mirror Group Newspapers added a penny at 194p as the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission gave the go-ahead for the joint takeover of the Independent
newspaper.
Public relations group Shandwick rose 3 1/2 p to 59 1/2 p, in spite of
asking shareholders for Pounds 18.9m via a one-for-two rights issue. SG
Warburg believes that while the ex-rights price of the stock is 54.5p, the
shares deserve a market rating which would put them 10p higher.
Engineering group Lucas Industries closed 4 ahead at 219p, after announcing
that Mr George Simpson, formerly chairman of Rover, was to begin his new
role as chief executive at the begining of April, a month earlier than
anticipated. The group reports interim figures on Monday, and a broker's
recommendation boosted the stock earlier this week.
Machinery group Molins gained 9 to 558p, after reporting an increase in
profits and an improved dividend. Profits improved by Pounds 7.8m to Pounds
49.7m and the dividend was raised by 1.4p to 15.4p.
Motor dealer Lex Service ran into profit-takers and the shares eased 4 to
535p. Bargain hunters helped engineering and aerospace company TI resist the
poor market trend. The shares closed a penny ahead at 386p.
Environmental company Rentokil was in the doldrums following disappointing
full-year figures and profit downgradings by several brokers. The shares
relinquished 7 1/2 to 241p.
Eastern Electricity held steady with a slide of 2 to 630p. After the market
had closed, the company announced that it had purchased 250,000 of its
shares at 629p each.
The recent series of successful flotations continued yesterday with the
market debut of Partco, the independent auto-products distributor, whose
shares, offered at 200p, closed at 224p.
New Footsie entrant De La Rue gained 22 to 1021p on the inclusion.

FT  19 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recovery hopes lift Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, experienced a sharp turnround
in late trading as dealers said forecasts were being moved higher on
expectations of a pick up in the company's fortunes.
The optimism focused on sales of Wellcome's headline product Zovirax, which
is sold as a treatment for shingles and herpes. Sales growth for the drug
had dwindled to 7 per cent last year, but the latest prescription data from
the US has suggested it has recovered to around 13 per cent. This led the
more pessimistic analysts to adjust their figures - one broker apparently
raised its full-year forecast by Pounds 20m to Pounds 720m ahead of
first-half results on Thursday. The figure is at the higher end of a wide
range from Pounds 680m to Pounds 750m. First-half figures are predicted to
come in at between Pounds 340m and Pounds 367m.
The share price had languished by 14p in early trading, but recovered to
close only 3 1/2 lower at 627 1/2 p.

FT  19 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bond weakness sparks equity
sell-off - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A trading session fraught with tension and surrounded by speculation of an
imminent further tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve saw
London's equity market, under the lead of a struggling gilt-edged market,
fall sharply before staging a good rally towards the close of trading. The
situation was further confused by stories of a potential military
confrontation in Korea.
Adding to the general unease surrounding the UK market was the 'double
witching hour' or expiry of index option futures and the FT-SE index future
in mid-morning, traditionally an event which triggers exaggerated movements
in underlying stock prices.
When the dust settled, however, and helped by a resilient showing by US
bonds and equities, the FT-SE 100 index had recovered to close a net 37.6
lower on the session at 3,218.1.
The Mid 250 index fell 21.0 to 3,865.6.
And, as senior traders were quick to point out, the 100 index finished a
volatile week a remarkable 26.2 higher, thanks mainly to the 75 points jump
in the index on Monday and Tuesday when bond markets were indulging in a
strong recovery process and the UK market was being driven higher by a
flurry of excellent corporate results.
The early scene in equities was one of unmitigated gloom, with gilts sharply
lower, ahead of expected news of another gilts auction. Long gilts fell
further as the morning wore on, dragging equities down with them, as the
market picked up the stories of potential trouble in Korea and began to
react to a series of rumours about Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US
Federal Reserve.
The most extreme of these was that Mr Greenspan was about to resign and
another was that he had cancelled a trip to Dallas, Texas, where he was
about to address a conference, and had been called to the White House to
brief President Clinton on another increase in the Federal Discount Rate
next week. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Council Meeting, to discuss
monetary policy, is scheduled for Tuesday.
These rumours, which drove long gilts down by 1 3/4 at worst, and were
accompanied by the expiry of the March index options and the FT-SE future,
sent the equity market into a tailspin, which saw the 100 index dip below
3,200 and reach a session low of 3,197.7.
Thereafter markets embarked on a good recovery, as the Korean stories
foundered and US bonds and German bunds began to stabilise. News of the
innovative auction of a floating rate gilt, with details on price and size
expected next week, took the edge off losses in UK gilts.
Senior marketmakers said the equity market had taken fright at the prospect
of another rise in US interest rates but that there had been little in the
way of heavy selling pressure as the stories circulated in the market. 'It
has to be said that there was little in the way of genuine customer business
either way today,' said one trader.
Turnover yesterday reached 609.4m shares, below levels seen earlier this
week and well down on the 1bn-plus levels seen previously this year.
Next week brings more crucial economic numbers from both sides of the
Atlantic. UK economists will focus on Wednesday's retail price index details
for February, while in the US the FOMC meeting and auctions of two-year and
five-year bonds will capture the headlines.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges were dominated yesterday by rumours surrounding the
unscheduled meeting of President Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the US Federal Reserve, writes Philip Gawith.
The meeting immediately prompted talk of an early tightening of US policy,
causing the dollar to strengthen. The US currency finished in London at
DM1.6961, more than one-and-a-half pfennigs up on Thursday's close of
DM1.68.
It was also stronger against sterling closing at Dollars 1.4888 from Dollars
1.4975. It closed marginally higher against the yen, at Y106.035 from
Y105.695.
Markets were otherwise fairly quiet in the absence of any fresh data to
trade off. In Europe the D-Mark finished little changed. Against the French
franc it closed in London at FFr3.407 from FFr3.408 on Thursday. It was
slightly stronger against the Italian lira closing at L989.3 from L987.7.
A White House spokesman said there had been no discussion at the meeting
about next week's gathering of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market
Committee. He also said there had been 'no messages given, and no messages
delivered.'
Markets, however, were convinced the meeting must have had monetary policy
import. Some speculated that Mr Clinton had called the Fed chairman in to
emphasise that the Administration does not want higher interest rates.
More popular was the view that instead of tightening the Federal Funds rate
by 25 basis points, the Fed might lift the discount rate by 50 points. Mr
Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said this would be a
'much more aggressive signal' about policy intentions than a smaller rise in
the repo rate.
He said the speculation now was that the Fed had got itself into a lose-lose
situation. If it does not tighten policy, Mr Greenspan's credibility will be
damaged as he will be seen to have bowed to White House pressure.
But if he makes a substantial move, this will unsettle markets because it
will require a revision about the likely pace of Fed tightening.
Rumours about the White House meeting resonated quite strongly in the UK and
German interest rate futures markets. The June short sterling future lost
four basis points to trade at 94.81 yesterday evening, while the December
future was 10 points lower at 94.40.
In Germany the moves were slightly less pronounced with the June euromark
contract losing a point to 94.51 and the December contract eight points off
at 94.91.
In both cases the fall in futures prices reflects a market perception that
higher US rates will make it more difficult for European countries to cut
rates.
German call money moved in the opposite direction to the futures, falling to
5.70/5.80 per cent from 5.80/5.85 per cent. Call money is now well below the
5.89/5.90 per cent at which the Bundesbank allocated the bulk of repo's this
week.
Analysts believe the Bundesbank might now let its repo rate fall as low as
5.80 per cent from the current level of 5.88 per cent.
Conditions in the UK discount market were easier yesterday with the Bank of
England speedily dispatching a Pounds 1.55bn shortage.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium and copper hit peaks
 -Week in the markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange aluminium and copper markets fed off each other's
strength this week as they surged respectively to 20-month and 8 1/2 -month
peaks.
Helped by constructive technical factors the three months delivery aluminium
price broke resistance at Dollars 1,320 a tonne in mid-week, triggering
heavy stop-loss buying. The price moved on to Dollars 1,353 yesterday
morning on speculative and physical buying, but then ran into profit-taking
and European trade house sales, which took it down to Dollars 1,346.50 at
the close, up Dollars 9.50 on the day and Dollars 47 on the week.
Traders thought the market's bull trend remained intact, however. 'It will
take a brave man to go short ahead of the weekend,' one dealer told the
Reuter news agency.
Copper's peak came on Thursday, when the three months position touched
Dollars 1,985 a tonne. Traders attributed the rise to bullish charts, an
improving supply/demand balance, a shortage of good quality metal and
expectations of another big fall in LME warehouse stocks. The anticipated
stocks fall was duely announced yesterday morning and the price, which had
retreated to Dollars 1,965.50 by Thursday's close, rose to Dollars 1,970.
The heavy selling that had hit the market late on Thursday then reappeared,
however, and by the close the price had edged back to Dollars 1,968.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 3 on the day and Dollars 38.75 up on the week.
Precious metals were on the retreat for most of the week before gold led a
late rally yesterday.
The yellow metal regained Dollars 3.05 of the Dollars 3.85 it had lost over
the preceding four days to end at Dollars 386.20 a troy ounce. 'Yesterday
everybody was bearish at Dollars 382, now everybody is bullish at Dollars
386,' one dealer said. 'We may be seeing people taking out a bit of
insurance against incidents in South Africa over the weekend,' suggested
another.
The platinum price, which had been lifted in response to the unrest in the
homeland of Bophuthatswana, which accounts for 30 per cent of South Africa's
production of the metal, weakened on the easing of tension before rallying
with gold. It was fixed yesterday afternoon at Dollars 400.40 an ounce, up
Dollars 1.55 on the day but still Dollars 3.35 down on the week.
At the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures climbed to the highest
levels since the launch of the dollar contract three years ago.
Monday's news that the US Department of Agriculture had cut its forecast for
the 1994-95 Brazilian crop from 24.3m bags (60kg each) to 23.5m helped the
May contract to break through the Dollars 1,300-a-tonne barrier on Monday
and investors were encouraged by the market's ability to hold comfortably
above that level over the next few days in spite of bouts of profit taking.
Investment fund and trade buyers returned in force on Thursday, lifting the
May price to Dollars 1,340 a tonne at one stage. It dipped to Dollars 1,315
yesterday morning but by the close was trading at Dollars 1,331, up Dollars
56 on the week.
Cocoa futures also chalked up good gains before producer selling was
attracted late in the week. The May price climbed to Pounds 985 a tonne on
Thursday morning but ended yesterday at Pounds 953, up Pounds 27 on balance.
Traders said that the market was continuing to attract selling from West
African producers and, in the absence of buying interest from the investment
funds, this was weighing down prices. They noted, however, that good support
was likely in the Dollars 948-950 range.

FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T hits impasse in Energis
negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations between AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, and Energis, the UK's
third long-distance telecoms carrier, have reached a stalemate. The impasse
puts AT&amp;T's ambitions to enter the UK market on hold.
AT&amp;T, which has a UK licence application pending, was in talks to take a
one-third stake in Energis, a subsidiary of the UK's National Grid Company,
which is erecting a long-distance network across Britain using the NGC's
electricity pylons.
Energis offered AT&amp;T the chance of by-passing a long regulatory process to
gain access to the UK. Energis looked to AT&amp;T for a powerful brand name and
additional funding to complete its network.
However, the talks appear to have foundered on the valuation of Energis.
According to a consultant, Energis was holding out for a valuation AT&amp;T
regarded as 'wholly unrealistic'.
National Grid is owned jointly by the 12 privatised regional electricity
companies in England and Wales. The chairman of one company said: 'There was
a big price difference and we have separated, but are keeping in touch.'
Energis argued that the low cost of its infrastructure compared to that of
rival operators, British Telecommunications and Mercury, gave it a
structural cost advantage. However, AT&amp;T took a more conservative view,
believing the established UK operators had significant room to cut their
existing cost base.
The breakdown underlines AT&amp;T's problems in gaining access to the European
telecoms market ahead of the EU's liberalisation of voice services in 1998.
Its talks with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom for a strategic alliance
are also stalled, and the European Commission has yet to agree the terms
under which new operators can enter the EU.

FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft plans action
against sacked chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By David Waller
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The supervisory board of Metallgesellschaft said yesterday it would take
legal steps to seek damages against Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the sacked chief
executive of the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial group. It
will also take action against Mr Meinhard Forster, the former finance
director.
The supervisory board said the move followed an independent report into the
events leading to the near collapse of the group - Germany's 14th largest
industrial company - commissioned in December and conducted by Wollert-
Elmendorff Deutsche Industrie Treuhand, an accountancy firm.
Mr Schimmelbusch is being investigated by the Frankfurt prosecutor's office
for failing to keep the supervisory board informed as required under German
law. He has twice publicly denied responsibility for the debacle, and said
he will take all steps to defend his reputation.
The report, examined by Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board on March 11,
focused mainly on the oil futures trading activities of MG Corp,
Metallgesellschaft's New York-based trading subsidiary, which gave rise to
losses of DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.4bn) and drove the group to the brink of
bankruptcy.
MG Corp's oils futures commitments increased eightfold to 160m barrels
during the 1992-93 financial year. The report, an abridged version of which
was published yesterday, concluded that:
Mr Forster, the former finance director, was aware of the growing risks
associated with the oil futures business from the summer of last year. Other
members of the group's management board - including Mr Schimmelbusch -
regularly received documents showing the rising scale of unrealised gains
and realised losses.
The information given to the board as a whole, however, was deficient in
relation to the seriousness of the business risks. MG Corp's accounts,
prepared according to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP),
provided a flattering picture of business development at the company. Had
they been prepared according to German rules, profits from MG Corp would
have been considerably lower than reported.
The supervisory board was not correctly informed of developments at MG Corp.
Dealings between MG Corp and Castle Corporation, an oil refining company
with which MG Corp had a tangled business relationship, were skewed to the
benefit of Castle. In November 1993, MG Corp's investment in Castle, a
former shell company, totalled Dollars 500m. Three senior MG Corp executives
were directors of Castle; MG Corp executives owned 3.9 per cent of the
shares in Castle in November last year.
The supervisory board said the report supported its argument that it was
misled by Mr Schimmelbusch and Mr Forster.

FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank reveals 3% holding
in floated BCI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   David Waller in Frankfurt and John Simkins in Milan
Commerzbank, the smallest of Germany's big three private-sector commercial
banks, said yesterday it had bought a 3 per cent stake in Banca Commerciale
Italiana, the newly-privatised Italian bank.
The German institution said it had recently been asked by BCI to take a
shareholding, which it bought on the stock market at an undisclosed price.
The move comes amid growing belief that institutions close to Mediobanca,
the Milan-based merchant bank, have accumulated a combined holding of up to
20 per cent in BCI, which ranks among the top six Italian banks in terms of
assets. Such a stake would give the group a powerful argument for a seat on
the board.
Commerzbank, which recently formed commercial links with another privatised
bank, Credito Italiano, said the BCI stake was a strategic move to intensify
operations in Italy. Besides Commerzbank, the other two institutions with
declared holdings close to 3 per cent, the maximum voting power of any one
shareholder, are Paribas, and Generali, Italy's largest insurance company.
BCI, which is a Paribas shareholder, has 8 per cent of Mediobanca, which is
a major shareholder in Generali.
The pattern of ownership will not become apparent, however, until the bank
holds its first shareholders' meeting as a public company. This is expected
by the end of April.
The jockeying for position within the bank has pitted the Mediobanca allies
against Mr Romano Prodi, chairman of the state holding company IRI, which
disposed of its entire 54 per cent stake in BCI through a public offer and a
private placement.
Mr Prodi's wishes for a wide spread of ownership resulted in a clawback in
favour of private investors. There were also complaints from Italian unit
trusts that the allocation had not favoured them, suggesting a considerable
placement with foreign investors, out of Mediobanca's reach.

FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Upbeat Bayer forecasts 20%
profits advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayer, the chemicals and drugs group, yesterday brightened the German
results season with a confident forecast of profits up to 20 per cent higher
in the current year.
Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, said the board had been surprised by the
strength of the recent recovery. Sales and earnings had been rising since
October, he said.
Turnover had increased 6.5 per cent to almost DM7bn (Dollars 4.2bn) in the
first two months of the current year, and operating earnings had improved
considerably. This followed a 6 per cent rise in sales and an 18 per cent
surge in pre-tax earnings in the final quarter of 1993, he said.
Mr Schneider credited the group's restructuring and cost-cutting measures
with most of the advance, although better exchange rates and the North
American recovery had helped.
On the debit side, business had continued shrinking in Germany, although
sales were down only 1 per cent after two months, compared with a slump of
more than 10 per cent in the same period of 1993. A domestic recovery was
not expected before the second half of the year, he added.
Prices remained 'absolutely unsatisfactory', and he saw little prospect of
increases this year.
Forecasting a pre-tax earnings increase of between 15 and 20 per cent after
last year's record low of DM1.14bn, Mr Schneider said most of the gains
would be achieved 'mainly by our own strength'.
Further strengthening measures were to follow restructuring and
rationalisation, which had reduced fixed costs by DM1.5bn in the past three
years.
More marketing power and other synergies were expected from the impending
merger of the consumer and self-medication products divisions.
Bayer had set itself the goal of ending losses in its textile dyes business
this year. All manufacturers were faced with the question of whether Europe
was the right place to make such products, he said.
Plant protection, another problem sector, was also on the list for
treatment. The recent merger of Hoechst and Schering's activities in this
field was a 'first step', Mr Schneider noted.
He gave the spin-off of the fibres businesses into Bayer Faser, with reduced
payroll costs and manufacturing capacity, as one example of action designed
to foster a lasting turnround in a business which had been losing money 'for
years and years'.
The group had reduced its payroll by 4,500 last year, and a further 2,100
jobs were to be lost in the current period - all in Germany.

<TEXT>
Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utilities and industrial group, said
yesterday it has agreed to raise its stake in Air &amp; Water Technology of the
US from 23 per cent to 40 per cent.
As a result, it will hold 48 per cent of the voting rights of the US
company, which specialises in the treatment of water and the reduction of
air pollution, and has annual sales of about Dollars 630m.
The French group described the move as 'an important step in its strategy of
expanding in the US in areas of strong growth'. It already achieves annual
sales of about FFr5.5bn (Dollars 954m) in the US market.
Under the terms of the agreement, Generale des Eaux will exchange its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Professional Services Group, for 6.5m new Air &amp;
Water shares. The French group will also subscribe to a private placement
share issue with a priority dividend, and an issue of ordinary shares in the
US group.

FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air clears around Bugatti - Cash
call plans are forcing the carmaker into the open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bugatti International, which last year took over Group Lotus, the UK sports
car maker and automotive engineering consultancy from General Motors, is
seeking outside finance to fund the next stage of its ambitious expansion
plan.
Ownership of the Luxembourg-registered company has been a mystery since it
was formed in the late-1980s to revive the famous pre-war racing marque. The
veil of secrecy is being lifted, however, as it prepares to bring in outside
investors.
The company claims it is 100 per cent-owned by the Artioli family led by Mr
Romano Artioli, a 61-year-old Italian entrepreneur, who for a decade held
the distribution franchise for Ferrari in the lucrative regions of
north-east Italy and southern Germany. This relationship ended in 1988.
Mr Artioli holds the importer/distributorship for Suzuki vehicles in Italy,
and controls a separate holding company, Fisico, with interests in vehicle
retailing, import/distribution and components.
Mr Mario Barbieri, vice-chairman of Bugatti Automobili, said the Artioli
family had a combined annual turnover of more than L300bn (Dollars 179m).
Fisico also held a 20 per cent stake in the Monfalcone car terminal, a port
development near Trieste, which opened last autumn to develop car transport
between southern Europe and east Asia.
When Bugatti International emerged last summer as the buyer of Group Lotus
it admitted only that Mr Artioli held an 18 per cent stake in Bugatti
Automobili, the car division, which has built a factory at Campogalliano,
near Modena, to assemble the Pounds 200,000 Bugatti EB110 supercar. The
balance in the car operation was owned by Bugatti International.
Some big French corporations - including Michelin, Elf Aquitaine and
Aerospatiale - collaborated in the development of the 212mph EB110, and
there was some indication they might have backed the venture financially.
Officially, however, the shareholders remained anonymous.
The company said this week Mr Artioli had been the majority shareholder in
Bugatti International, the master company, from the outset in 1987. Artioli
family holdings now had 100 per cent of the equity.
Wild rumours have swirled around the European auto industry about the
ownership of Bugatti since late-1991, when the EB110 was first unveiled.
Reality was lost in talk about the sums of money being pumped into the
development of the 550bhp supercar, built to outperform rivals from Ferrari,
Jaguar and Lamborghini.
The company is now trying to clear the air ahead of a partial public
flotation or a private placement of shares. CS First Boston has been taken
on board as financial adviser, and Price Waterhouse has been appointed
auditor for both the Italian and UK businesses.
Lotus, which was forced to stop production of its Elan sports car in 1992
because of heavy losses, is now working on an ambitious product development
programme.
Engineering contracts were being won from leading vehicle makers that had
previously been unwilling to use Lotus under GM ownership because of fears
over confidentiality, said Mr Barbieri.
According to Bugatti, Group Lotus had a turnover of Dollars 53m last year.
It suffered a loss of Dollars 6.4m in the first eight months under GM
ownership.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Demand in developing markets assists Molins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good demand for cigarette making machinery from China and other developing
markets helped Molins, the tobacco and packaging group, to increase profits
for 1993.
Pre-tax profits were 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 20.4m, compared with Pounds
18.3m on turnover 12 per cent higher at Pounds 203.5m (Pounds 181m).
Tobacco machinery turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds 127.8m (Pounds 111m)
for operating profits of Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 18.6m), up 10 per cent.
Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director, said the division's operating margins
were down by 1 point to 16 per cent, reflecting lower demand for spares from
Brazil and the US, where sales were hit by a cigarette price war. However,
the volume of new machines sold and margins improved. Mr Greenwood cited the
good progress of the group's Passim machinery side.
The packaging machinery division, based in the US, improved turnover by 18
per cent to Pounds 75.1m (Pounds 63.8m), but operating profits were down
from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 2.7m. Mr Greenwood said margins had been hit by
heavy discounting in both the US and Europe.
In addition to packaging, Molins is seeking to diversify into food
processing and packaging machinery, and has won its first order, worth
Pounds 5m. This was 'tangible evidence that the group is taking its
knowledge and applying it to a wider customer base,' said Mr Greenwood.
The group ended the year ungeared, with net cash of Pounds 3.5m, compared
with gearing of 10.3 per cent and net debt of Pounds 14.7m at the end of
1992.
The pre-tax profits were also helped by a Pounds 3.3m net pension credit
(Pounds 3.4m) and a fall in interest payments from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2m.
Earnings per share were up from 41.9p to 49.7p. A final dividend of 10.5p
(9.5p) is proposed, taking the total for the year to 15.4p (14p).
COMMENT
Tobacco machinery remains the driving force behind Molins, which might
account for the modest rating of the stock. The group is looking for
sensible ways to spread its expertise in handling delicate materials at high
speed. It is being very secretive about its first order for food processing
machinery, but it looks like a step in the right direction. With a strong
balance sheet, the group is well-placed to take advantage of any acquisition
opportunities. If it grows earnings by a further 10 per cent this year, the
prospective p/e is an attractive 10. But given the group's exposure to
China, it is worth keeping an eye on the Hong Kong political situation.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: McCarthy &amp; Stone calls for Pounds 15.5m and
forecasts reduced interim losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McCarthy &amp; Stone, Britain's biggest builder of retirement homes, yesterday
announced a Pounds 15.5m rights issue to reduce borrowings and buy land.
The company also is proposing to cancel Pounds 2.63m of dividend arrears
owed to cumulative preference shareholders who are being offered a scrip
issue of one new preference share for every 5.509 preference shares already
held.
McCarthy said that in the present circumstances it would be unlikely 'to pay
off these arrears for some considerable time'.
The rights issue of 28m shares is on the basis of 2-for-5 at 58p. The shares
rose 1p to 73p following the announcement.
McCarthy, which is experiencing an upturn in demand, expects losses before
tax and exceptionals for the six months to end-February to fall from Pounds
5.7m to no more than Pounds 1.3m. The average price for its homes has risen
from Pounds 56,600 to Pounds 64,500 during the past 12 months.
McCarthy said it intended to resume payments of preference dividends
following publication of results for the year to August 31, depending on a
further revision of banking facilities.
The issue is underwritten by NatWest Markets Corporate Finance.
COMMENT
This looks like a further refinancing given the admission that the company
would be unable to pay off arrears without a scrip issue. An early
resumption of preference dividends, moreover, looks dependent on a
successful rights. On the other hand, most of the group's competitors have
disappeared from a market which will command higher margins than general
housebuilding as it recovers. At the rights issue price the group remains on
a p/e of 25 on 1994-95 pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.8m, which may not be
announced for 18 months. Shareholders probably have little choice other than
to take up their rights but should not buy in the market.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Goal Petroleum falls 27%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower production and higher tax provisions hit net profits at Goal
Petroleum, the North Sea oil and gas explorer which yesterday announced a 27
per cent drop to Pounds 5.1m for the year to December 31.
Turnover fell by 4 per cent to Pounds 42.4m, due to maintenance work on two
fields - Buchan and Wytch Farm. Tax rose 40 per cent to Pounds 2.8m because
of changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax.
Mr David Boyd, managing director, said Goal was confident of a recovery in
production. He was particularly optimistic given the 5 per cent rise in
proven and probable reserves to 41.6m barrels of oil equivalent, following
recent acquisitions.
The group was keeping an eye on opportunities abroad, Mr Boyd said. Although
Goal remained committed to the North Sea, eventually it would 'have to go
further afield'. Areas of particular interest were Venezuela and Australia.
Goal spent some Pounds 15m on exploration, largely to appraise previous
discoveries.
The group expected to spend about half that this year, with more investment
in developing assets. 'We are reflecting industry pressures,' said Mr Boyd.
'Money is being spent on investments that are likely to make earlier
returns.' Such trends become more common at times of weak oil prices.
Goal finished the year with net debt of Pounds 13m, or 14 per cent of
shareholders' funds. This compared with net debt of Pounds 18.7m and gearing
of 21 per cent.
The dividend was increased from 1.4p to 1.45p. Earnings fell from 5.23p to
3.79p.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Jonathan Agnew gets Pounds 600,000
handshake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Agnew, former chief executive of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant
bank, received a Pounds 600,000 ex-gratia payment 'following the termination
of his employment', according to the company's annual report.
Mr Agnew announced last May that he intended to resign in the summer and
Lord Rockley, KB chairman, said the company would look to replace him
externally.
In explaining the payment to Mr Agnew - which exceeds the total salary and
performance-related pay earned by KB's chairmen in 1993 - Mr Peter
Churchill-Coleman, company secretary, said the sum was agreed by a
compensation committee consisting of non-executive directors. It does not
represent a sum due under a long-term employment contract.
'None of our directors is on a long-term contract,' Mr Churchill-Coleman
said. Contracts for directors at KB are typically three months long.
Meanwhile, a Pounds 25,000 payment was made to the bank's pension plan to
enhance the pension of Mr David Peake, the former chairman who retired from
full-time executive duties in April 1993. He remains a non-executive
director.
The annual report also discloses that Lord Rockley earned Pounds 303,000 in
performance-related pay in addition to his salary. The chairmen's salary,
which for the first four months of 1993 was paid to Mr Peake, was Pounds
255,000.
However, Lord Rockley was a director during that period and shared in a
total of Pounds 2.6m in base salaries paid to 13 executive directors. In
addition, the 13 directors shared in a pot of Pounds 2.9m in
performance-related pay. The annual report says that performance-related pay
to directors includes discretionary bonuses which are 'not based on any
fixed or formulated arrangements especially related to profits'.
Shareholder groups have called for companies to set firm criteria by which
directors will earn performance-related pay.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sirdar ahead in spite of yarns' losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sirdar, the textile group, lifted interim pre-tax profits in spite of
operating losses of Pounds 541,000 in its hand-knitting and machine yarns
division.
Profits for the six months to end December were Pounds 2.81m, up from a
previous Pounds 2.67m. Total turnover edged ahead from Pounds 27.1m to
Pounds 27.6m.
The losses on yarns were incurred on turnover down from Pounds 11.2m to
Pounds 10.1m and compares with previous profits of Pounds 86,000.
Mr Gerry Lumb, chairman and managing director, said the company was
responding to a lack of volume in the hand-knitting market by switching its
emphasis to machine yarns.
Other textile products improved operating profits from Pounds 2.81m to
Pounds 3.37m. This division, comprising Eversure ready-made curtains and
Burmatex floor coverings, had achieved good results in difficult markets,
said Mr Lumb.
The group's share of profits from its 50 per cent stake in Acropolis Hotels
fell from Pounds 158,000 to Pounds 128,000.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 156,000, and the tax
charge eased to Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 1m).
Earnings per share were ahead at 3.41p (3.12p), while the interim dividend
is increased from 1.65p to 1.72p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sherwood Group, the Nottingham-based lace, lingerie and socks
maker, fell 19p to 151p yesterday after the directors warned that 1993
profits would be hit by tough trading conditions in Europe.
The group, which relies on overseas sales for about half its turnover, said
the adverse effect would not exceed Pounds 1.3m.
Pre-tax profits for the year, to be announced on March 28, are not likely to
be below Pounds 18.4m.
The directors expect to increase the final dividend to 1.9p, giving 2.9p
(2.6p) for the full year.
In 1992, pre-tax profits were Pounds 16.9m on turnover of Pounds 143.5m.
Sherwood said conditions in Europe had continued to deteriorate in the last
quarter, particularly hitting the Dutch and German lace operations of
Dentex. The managing director of Dentex had resigned, and a restructuring
plan was being put in place.
In addition, greater than expected losses were incurred on the closure of
its German curtain operation.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Anglian Grp shares slip 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A warning yesterday from Anglian Group that full year profits were unlikely
to meet market expectations prompted a 10 per cent fall in the double
glazing company's share price to 287p.
The Norwich-based group has been hit by a fall-off in orders following the
privatisation of the Property Services Agency, which represented 75 per cent
of its commercial business, and increased research and development
expenditure.
Mr David Herman, group finance director, said: 'Trading in the commercial
division has been disappointing. Both turnover and margins have suffered.'
He claimed, however, that the 28p fall in the share price was 'totally
unjustified'.
Although Anglian admitted that orders placed by the PSA's successors were
negligible, it said that its retail business had picked up and it had won
new commercial business from local authorities.
'Business is now being placed solely on price rather than quality,' said Mr
Herman.
Following his statement, analysts downgraded full year profit forecasts by 6
per cent to Pounds 25m.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Davenport Vernon sees decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Davenport Vernon, the multi-franchise motor group, plunged 20p to
132p yesterday, after Mr Ralph Denne, the chairman warned yesterday that
profits for the six months to March 31 would be significantly below those
for the same period last year.
Mr Denne told the annual meeting that despite an overall rise in group sales
of both new and used vehicles, there had been a falling profit contribution
from the Japanese and Volkswagen Audi franchises. This followed
manufacturers' changes in trading margins and bonus arrangements.
In addition, the five new dealerships which began trading in 1993 had
produced losses during their start up periods.
The chairman said that the group was re-aligning costs to meet current
conditions and, with a good performance from its volume franchises, he
anticipated 'a return to normal levels of profitability in the second half'.
Pre-tax profits in the year ended September 30 1993 were up 29 per cent to
Pounds 2.11m.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional boosts Perry to Pounds 5.16m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional profits on a property sale of Pounds 1.85m, against
restructuring costs of Pounds 3.28m, enabled Perry Group, the motor dealer
and repairer, to report 1993 profits of Pounds 5.16m pre-tax compared with
losses of Pounds 3.22m.
Mr Richard Allan, chairman, said the year saw a recovery in profits on the
sale of new and used cars resulting in their share of group profits rising
from 13 per cent to 27 per cent.
He added that the first two months of the present year had shown a
significant improvement on the comparable period. 'Despite the continuing
uncertainty over the strength of the economic recovery I believe that 1994
will prove a year of good progress.'
Turnover improved to Pounds 311.3m (Pounds 289.3m). Interest charges fell to
Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 3.04m). Year-end cash balances were Pounds 2m. The
company raised a net Pounds 9.6m by a rights issue in September.
Earnings per share were 18.2p (losses 14.7p). A final dividend of 4.25p is
recommended for a total of 7p (6p).

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 16m loss for Allied Leisure
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Allied Leisure fell 16p to 27p yesterday after the nightclub and
ten-pin bowling company announced interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 16.1m and
a board shake-out.
The company blamed the deficit, struck against a Pounds 1.2m profit last
time, on restructuring provisions of Pounds 14.2m and large asset
write-downs.
As part of the upheaval Mr Richard Carr, chief executive, has agreed to
resign and two other directors are leaving the main board to concentrate on
operational affairs.
Their departure follows a 72 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds
592,000 in the 24 weeks to January 2.
The operating figure, achieved on flat turnover of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds
11.5m), was also depleted by Pounds 300,000 in one-off payments to out-going
directors, including Pounds 180,000 payable to Mr Carr.
Mr Damien Harte, appointed finance director last November, said: 'We had to
take action. The company was suffering from a combination of problems which
threatened its ultimate survival.'
Determined to safeguard Allied's future, he initiated the restructuring,
which included Pounds 9.7m in asset write-downs, Pounds 3m to cover the
disposal of lossmaking operations and a further Pounds 1.5m for further
reorganisation. The company has also decided to sell its Liverpool bowling
alley and close four clubs and bars in Dundee and Bedford, which reported a
combined trading loss of Pounds 941,000.
Market uncertainty increased after the company admitted it was in breach of
its banking covenants over the write-downs and provisions.
Mr Harte, however, said the group's bankers remained supportive and had
agreed to a three-month moratorium on capital repayments of its Pounds 14.9m
debt. 'We expect to be able to present some structural solutions to our
lenders and shareholders by the middle of the year.'
Losses per share emerged at 25.2p (2.92p earnings) and the interim dividend
is passed - 1p was paid previously.
The company also said Mr Carr had sold 1.5m shares yesterday - reducing his
stake to 5.06 per cent - but retained full confidence in the board.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Vinten hit by exceptional costs - Pounds 6m
fall after losses on disposal of electro-optics operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vinten, the restructured camera mountings and surveillance systems group,
yesterday reported a decline in pre-tax profits in 1993 to Pounds 4.21m
after exceptional charges totalling Pounds 10.4m - mostly related to the
disposal of the lossmaking electro-optics operations.
The fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.2m in 1992 came despite operating
profits up 38 per cent to Pounds 15.6m. This reflected strong growth in the
core broadcast systems and photographic businesses, acquisitions and
exchange rate movements, which added about Pounds 2m to profits.
Turnover grew by 21 per cent to Pounds 93.4m (Pounds 77.3m), including a
Pounds 18.1m contribution from acquisitions and Pounds 3.58m from
discontinued operations. Earnings per share fell to 6.1p (21.7p).
Nevertheless, a 5.7p final dividend is recommended making a total of 7.8p
(7p).
The broadcast systems division, strengthened by the acquisitions of Internet
Videocommunications in the UK and Total Spectrum Manufacturing in the US,
reported trading profits up 42 per cent to Pounds 4.49m on turnover which
grew by 39 per cent to Pounds 33.8m.
In the photographic business, which now accounts for more than 50 per cent
of group profits, Gruppo Manfrotto based in Italy had another strong year.
Trading profits increased by 40 per cent to Pounds 8.53m on turnover up 53
per cent to Pounds 35.9m.
W Vinten also performed well lifting the surveillance systems profits by 28
per cent to Pounds 21.89m despite a 4 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds
20.1m.
Despite spending Pounds 14.2m on acquisitions - excluding the TSM
acquisition which was funded with shares - year end net debt increased by
just Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 11.4m, equivalent to gearing of 44.9 per cent.
COMMENT
Yesterday's 6p rise in Vinten's shares to 520p was well deserved and
reflected market satisfaction with the group's underlying performance. The
exit from the lossmaking defence-related electro-optical businesses in
September was welcome. Meanwhile Vinten has made astute acquisitions in
areas it knows well and which should have good growth prospects. The UK and
Italian manufacturing operations should continue to benefit from soft
currencies helping the group further expand its US and east Asia sales which
already account for 62 per cent of the total. Pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 16.5m look possible this year generating earnings of 33.4p. The
shares are trading on a forward multiple of 15.6 and look moderately cheap.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: 73% public take up of MDIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in McDonnell Information Systems, the Hemel Hempstead-based computing
services company, have proved harder to sell to the public than to
institutions.
The group said yesterday that all the shares had been placed with
institutions at 260p a share.
Some 25.6m of the 73.1m total had been available under clawback arrangements
to satisfy public applications and priority applications from eligible
employees. However, only 8,585 valid applications, for 18.7m shares or 73
per cent, had been received.
The flotation, valuing the group at about Pounds 250m, is the largest in the
information technology sector this year but analysts said they were not
surprised by the public under-subscription.
MDIS, a company which specialises in applications software and software
tools, was hard to sell to a general audience. There was also a perception
that the market was changing and the window of opportunity for new
flotations closing.
Mr Anthony McGrath, of Baring Brothers, sponsor to the issue, said the
public offering had been made in deference to Stock Exchange demands. It had
always been considered a challenge for a company like MDIS.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Amicable in European link with J
Rothschild
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Amicable, one of the UK's largest mutual life offices, is to set up
an international life company to provide financial services in Europe, in a
deal which sees its relationship with J Rothschild Assurance becoming even
closer.
Scottish Amicable European will be based in Dublin, and will take on the
existing 60 staff, premises and business assets of J Rothschild
International Assurance.
JRIA will in effect, start again, under Mr David Beynon, who will build up a
new marketing team. Mr Beynon is a former colleague of Sir Mark Weinberg,
now JRA chairman, at Allied Dunbar, who joined the J Rothschild Group late
last year.
The administration and some product development for JRIA will be carried out
by Scottish Amicable European, in an arrangement that mirrors the
relationship between Scottish Amicable and JRA in the UK.
J Rothschild Assurance Holdings will have a 10 per cent stake in Scottish
Amicable International Holdings, Scottish Amicable will have an 80 per cent
stake, and the remaining 10 per cent will be owned by the management and
salesforce.
Mr Roy Nicolson, ScotAm managing director, said the new venture was intended
to become operational in June.
Of the total Pounds 28m initial cost ScotAm was investing Pounds 25m in
development capital, of which some Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m is going towards
start-up costs. In December, ScotAm raised a Pounds 100m 'war chest' for
acquisitions and expansion via a bond issue.
Sir Mark said the arrangement announced yesterday was 'an opportunity to
create two life companies for the price of one'. The two companies would
share a computer system but would be able to tailor products to their own
markets. Although be in competition, each company will focus on its own area
of expertise.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Shandwick in Pounds 18.9m rights issue to
cut borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shandwick, the public relations company, is to raise Pounds 18.9m from a
rights issue to reduce bank borrowings.
The cash call had been long-expected, and the share price reacted favourably
to the news, rising 3 1/2 p to close at 59 1/2 p.
Mr Dermot McNulty, chief operating officer, said that 'people will now be
able to focus on our business, and not our financials'.
The company is proposing the issue on a 1-for-2 basis, pitched at 45p, which
is a 20 per cent discount to Thursday's closing share price. Shandwick will
use Pounds 16.9m of the proceeds to reduce its Pounds 71m bank debt,
directors stated.
Lending margins on Shandwick's debt were cut when it renegotiated banking
facilities in January, and the banks have agreed a further reduction, upon
repayment of Pounds 15m.
These lending margins will have been reduced by about 0.75 percentage points
in three months, and brokers estimate that debt servicing will be reduced by
about Pounds 1.5m per annum, following the rights issue. Net debt will
remain at about Pounds 48m following the rights issue.
Shandwick is not considering acquisitions, according to Mr McNulty, but he
added: 'We are now beginning to see encouraging signs, in terms of trading
in the US and UK, and we would like to be in a position to look at business
opportunities.'
Shandwick is paying a 0.43p interim dividend in September and a final of
0.87p, the first pay-out since 1991.
COMMENT
It was only a question of time before Shandwick came back to the market, and
while the rights issue will dilute earnings per share over the next two
years, it puts the company back on a firm financial footing. Given the
pricing of the rights shares, a high take-up is certain. Brokers expect
pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.75m in 1993-94, putting the shares on a p/e of
13.6, allowing for the rights. Given the company's operational gearing and
improving business environment, there should be longer-term upside in the
share price.

FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Christmas sales lift Fortnum &amp; Mason
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fortnum &amp; Mason food fans helped the London department store to an increase
in sales and pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks ended January 22 1994.
A better-than-expected rise in Christmas catalogue sales - the wishbook of
the famous Fortnum's hamper - helped boost operating profits by 21 per cent
to Pounds 1.4m, on sales 10 per cent ahead to Pounds 17.2m. A drop in
interest receivable, however, held back the advance at the pre-tax level and
left the figure at Pounds 1.6m, compared with Pounds 1.5m.
Earnings per share rose from 235p to 249p, while the the net interim
dividend was maintained at 86p.
Fortnum's, which is 89 per cent owned by George Weston Holdings, had net
cash of Pounds 7m. This would fall after the purchase of a long leasehold
for Pounds 1.75m.
The company warned that the outlook for the second half remained uncertain.
Trading continued to be buoyant, but the vast majority of Fortnum's profits
were traditionally made in the first half.

FT  19 MAR 94 / A world of difference in a grain of rice: Japan thinks its
rice is nicest, even when scarce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Don't worry, it's Japanese rice.' The sushi chef behind the white cedar
counter gave a reassuring smile as he placed a slice of tuna on a small ball
of rice. 'We've stocked up so we won't have to use foreign rice for a
while,' he said.
Japan is in the middle of a rice crisis. Last year's unusually cold summer
and a spate of typhoons resulted in the worst harvest in postwar history.
Japan is not due officially to open its rice market to imports, as agreed
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, until next year. But the
government estimates 2.2m tonnes will have to be imported this year.
Bureaucratic delays have meant stores have yet to receive such emergency
supplies. But although bags of grain have gone from the supermarket shelves,
many restaurateurs and retailers have managed to squirrel away rice
supplies.
The sushi chef looked affronted at the suggestion that the balls of rice he
put on an assorted raw fish platter were made from a blend of emergency
imports and home grown rice. 'Some sushi shops without domestic supply
routes like mine have closed,' he said. It would be impossible to make sushi
with a blend of Californian and Thai rice, he said, because rice accounts
for 70 per cent of the dish's taste.
Such is Japan's sensitivity about rice that Mr Eijiro Hata, the agricultural
minister, had to apologise to the public this month for the breakdown in the
state-controlled rice market. He announced the government would speed up the
sale of an additional 30,000 tonnes of domestic rice to wholesalers. But he
risked exacerbating the ire of the Japanese by trying to force retailers and
wholesalers to blend all rice with at least some foreign imports.
In parliament, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has been blamed by
the opposition Liberal Democratic party for failing to avert the shortage.
The political row has highlighted the sanctity of home-grown rice, the
cultivation and harvesting of which remain at the roots of Japanese
traditions and rituals. Whereas aircraft have long been used to sow rice
seeds in the US, until recently rice seedlings in Japan were hand planted.
Rice-planting festivals are still held in June, including at the imperial
palace in Tokyo, where a barefooted Emperor Akihito plants seedlings in his
private rice paddy.
In autumn, harvested rice is offered to the gods, and sushi chefs refer to
their rice as 'shari', a shortened version of Sanskrit sarira, meaning, 'the
bones of Buddha'.
But the attachment to home-grown rice is not just spiritual. Consumers
prefer Japanese rice because it is regarded as better tasting and stickier
than foreign imports. The Japanese like a sweeter and heavier grain that
can, for instance, be moulded into balls.
Some are put off by the sight of long foreign grains. 'I know I shouldn't be
prejudiced and at least I should try it, but I feel more comfortable buying
and eating domestic rice,' said Mrs Mieko Ichikawa, a 40-year-old housewife.
Among the old, with wartime memories, the latest shortages have revived a
hoarding instinct: 'Everyone who has experienced the war keeps extra bags of
rice just in case,' said 78-year-old Mrs Kyoko Kimura. At the same time,
some consumer groups have claimed foreign rice may be unsafe because of the
use of post-harvest fungicides and pesticides. Press reports of dead mice,
cockroaches, or cigarette butts found in foreign rice have added to such
fears.
The high demand for home-grown rice together with the restricted supply have
opened opportunities for retailers - as well as racketeers - to increase
profit margins. Of the 7.8m tonnes of rice harvested last autumn, some 2m to
3m tonnes are estimated to have flowed in to the black market's complicated
distribution web and to have been hoarded by wholesalers and retailers. A
black market in rice is not new, but this year it has been particularly
buoyant.
A 10 kilogramme bag of prime grade rice which cost Y6,000 on the black
market last year, has nearly doubled in price while some retailers are only
selling to favoured customers.
The government is belatedly trying to calm the market. Leading cabinet
members, many of whom had belonged to the lobby that opposed the opening of
the Japanese rice market during the Uruguay Round of trade talks, recently
tucked into foreign rice in front of television cameras to try to persuade
the country that it was at least edible.
But emergency imports of blended rice have been hard to obtain in recent
weeks. Much has been delayed in the ports due to vigorous and time-consuming
customs inspections by officials unused to rice being imported. Consumers
may have to wait another month for a steady flow of blended rice to hit the
shops.
Even then it is far from clear if many will eat it. Domestic farmers have
tried to take advantage of the public debate over rice imports to stress the
superiority of the home grown product and re-emphasise their role as keepers
of Japanese culture.
However, such attempts to instil in the younger generation the rice culture
revered by their forebears may have fallen on deaf ears. Tastes are changing
and for many modern Japanese, rice has become just another commodity amid
the diversity of foods available. Sitting along the sushi counter, a mother
tried to urge her sulking son to eat the morsels of raw prawns and rice in
front of him. 'I want McDonald's,' he wailed.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Endgame at the beginning: Why hopes are rising for peace in
Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never before in the war in the former Yugoslavia has the combination of
carrots and sticks been so finely balanced. Never before have military
strategists and diplomats believed that the combination could help tip the
balance in favour of peace.
'For the first time, I am hopeful. But it's not yet the time to put out the
flags yet. We still have a lot to do,' said Mr Charles Dick, head of the
Conflict Studies Research Centre based at Sandhurst Military Academy in the
UK.
Some of the building blocks for peace were put in place yesterday in
Washington when President Bill Clinton presided over the signing of an
agreement between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Moslems.
The accord, forged by Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to the former
Yugoslavia, involves the Bosnian Croats and Moslems creating a power-sharing
federation in about a third of Bosnia's territory.
Observers believe it is only a matter of time before the federation will
form a loose union with Croatia.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia decided to sign up to this deal for
several reasons: Germany and the US had threatened to impose sanctions on
Croatia; Croatian-backed forces in western Hercegovina, eastern Bosnia, had
lost ground to Bosnian Moslem forces; a growing opposition to the war was
emerging within Croatia. Finally, in return for peace, the US and Germany
had held out prospects of financial assistance for rebuilding Croatia's
economy. Mr Tudjman would have found it difficult to resist such an even
division of carrots and sticks.
The predominantly Moslem Bosnian government signed on as well. Mr Haris
Silajdzic, prime minister, believes Washington will supply funds to underpin
the economic viability of the federation, as well as preserving its
territorial integrity.
'This federation is a kind of marriage of convenience. Neither side has won
the war. They believe peace is in their interests,' said Mr Dick.
Implementation of the deal will require three things: substantial extra
numbers of United Nations peacekeepers, above the 7,000 in place; consensus
on the federation's boundaries by the Croats and Moslems; and, crucially,
agreement to any redefined boundaries by the third participants in the war,
the Bosnian Serbs.
This latter requirement could undermine the deal fatally, because the
Bosnian Serbs and their patron, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia,
control 70 per cent of Bosnia's territory and can consolidate their grip
over the gains. A Pentagon official said: 'The administration is giving the
semblance of preserving Bosnia. But we know we are witnessing a
sophisticated division of the Bosnian republic between Croatia and Serbia.'
Mr Redman, together with Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the
region, now have to turn their attention to wooing Serbia, again with a
combination of carrots and sticks.
The threat of air strikes, which forced Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their
heavy weapons from around the besieged city of Sarajevo, remains a powerful
stick.
But increasingly, US and Russian officials are beginning to talk about
turning the stick of sanctions against the Serbian state - in place since
June 1992 - into a carrot by promising gradually to lift them. Mr Stephen
Oxman, the assistant US secretary of state, this week said any moves to ease
sanctions would be linked to 'positive steps by the Serbs in the negotiating
process'. The ball is now in Serbia's court.
After waging a two-year war in the former Yugoslavia to defend Serbs living
outside Serbia, Mr Milosevic must decide if now is the time to sue for peace
even if it means turning his back on some of the Serbs outside Serbia.
Yesterday's Washington agreement helps him. He could argue that, since the
Bosnian Croat/Moslem agreement paves the way for an eventual creation of a
Greater Croatia, the Bosnian Serbs in eastern Bosnia should be allowed to
form a similar loose union with Serbia proper.
Such a union would require the Bosnian Serbs to give up some of the
territory they hold in Bosnia, as well as to reach agreement on the status
of the Moslem-held enclaves of Gorazde, Srebrenica and Zepa in eastern
Bosnia. Mr Milosevic might be able to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to cede
some land to the Moslems and thereby convince the US to accept a closer
relationship between eastern Bosnia and Serbia. The price for any
concessions would be the removal of sanctions.
But compromises in eastern Bosnia constitute only one element of a potential
overall settlement in the region. The linchpin is a peace treaty between
Croatia and Serbia. This, in turn, would be possible if Belgrade and Zagreb
could agree on the status of Krajina, in southwestern Croatia.
Nearly 350,000 Serbs live in Krajina on rugged limestone land which has no
economic worth. But its strategic location is vital: it splits Croatia in
half. Reasserting control over the territory is crucial for Mr Tudjman.
Without it, Croatia remains divided. The question is whether Mr Milosevic is
prepared to turn his back on the Krajina Serbs whom he used in 1991 to
foment war in Croatia.
'At one point, both Croatia and Serbia will have to trade land for peace,'
said a UN official involved in the Geneva peace talks on the former
Yugoslavia.
A deal would involve Mr Tudjman granting extensive autonomy to the
nationalist Krajina Serbs to persuade them to stay in Croatia. In return, he
might have to give up a swathe of Serb-held territory in Slavonia, eastern
Croatia, which forms a natural link to Serbia proper.
Mr Tudjman might be able to justify this compromise to the Croats on the
grounds that he would have won control of Krajina, and a potentially
enlarged republic through an alliance with the new federation of Bosnian
Croats and Moslems. Such an arrangement could be rewarded with the carrot of
economic aid from the west.
Similarly, by turning his back on Krajina, Mr Milosevic could turn
concession into victory because sanctions would gradually be lifted and his
fellow Serbs in eastern Croatia and eastern Bosnia would be placed under the
protection of Serbia.
'You can see the shape of this compromise,' a UN official said, adding that
there were many imponderables, including the question of whether the people
of Bosnia could ever live together again after such brutality.
'What we are seeing is the emergence of the endgame in which Croatia and
Serbia, in a strange and tragic twist of history, will get what they
originally set out to attain: a Greater Croatia and a Greater Serbia, with
the Moslems destined to live with Croatia, the lesser of the two devils.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Weary, wiser, but the fight goes on / Testing the depth of
the IRA's commitment to its campaign of violence and asks when it might end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL

<TEXT>
As former IRA volunteers, Shane O'Doherty and Tommy McKearney were ready to
kill for their cause and were incarcerated for their crimes. Now, they are
united in wanting an end to armed struggle but ada mant that the British and
Irish governments' Christmas peace initiative will not deliver it.
Both men, each leavened by long spells in jail, are thoughtful, articulate
and confound the caricature of block-headed warmongers painted by their
opponents. Though they have left the IRA, their republican sympathies and
some of their contacts survive. They dismiss as fanciful suggestions that
200 years of physical force against British 'occupation' is about to end.
Neither believes the political initiative launched by London and Dublin  -
in spite of high expectations of a historic breakthrough and the peace
overtures of republican party Sinn Fein - has shifted the mindset of a
paramilitary organisation hell-bent on a united Ireland.
Mr O'Doherty was the IRA's chief bomb maker in Londonderry in the early
1970s before mounting a letter bomb campaign in 1973. His one-man war maimed
and injured 12 people - Mr Reginald Maudling, then home secretary among
them. Though he killed nobody he knew he might.
He received 30 life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1976 and was freed in
1989. He is now, at 39, a pacifist, and has accused the IRA of dishonour and
cowardice. Last year, he completed an English degree at Dublin University
and lives in the city, regularly returning to the north to see his mother.
He deeply regrets a past which provides him with a special insight into the
present state of mind of hard-line republicans and into what might lie
ahead. 'It was clear from the day it was published that the Downing Street
declaration was going nowhere.'
The declaration, signed by Mr John Major and Irish prime minister Mr Albert
Reynolds, tried to square the aspirations of Northern Ireland's two main
communities by offering rights of self-determination but guaranteeing
Unionists that Northern Ireland would remain part ot the UK as long as they
wished.
'We've put sticking plasters over Irish politics for centuries and once
again the fundamental issues are being ducked. You cannot have two
governments without proper constituencies in the north dictating solutions
to a hardened, embittered double minority,' says Mr O'Doherty.
So why should the IRA be able to? He concedes some IRA men have now
reluctantly concluded - heresy until recently - that there will eventually
have to be talks with the enemy. 'But many others still don't see the
British deserving talks, they see them deserving bombs, no-warning bombs.'
The impact of recent attacks on the mainland suggests, 'the probability is
that a greater part of the campaign will move to Britain'.
Mr McKearney, whose three brothers have died in terrorist violence, is no
more optimistic about an end to IRA violence. He came out of jail in 1993
after serving 15 years for the murder of a part-time soldier in the Ulster
Defence Regiment, part of the UK army.
Now he is home again, living with his welcoming, elderly parents in a neat
bungalow on a hillside in South Tyrone. He says the Downing Street
declaration - the very title calculated, he says, to make republicans wince
 -has altered nothing. 'This is not a sea-change. This is exactly where we
were before. It is the status quo and I resent both governments suggesting
anyone who rejects it must be some form of lunatic.'
He adds: 'The Downing Street document was a fait accompli guaranteeing the
union for ever and a day. Forty per cent of those in the north are annexed
into a state against their will and don't want a UK connection while 50 per
cent reject Dublin. We need new thinking to produce a mutually acceptable
compromise.'
But if new thinking is what is needed, more violence may be all that is on
offer: 'The question the IRA asks itself is how does it keep the issue in
front of the British until proper negotiations take place? Bombs and bullets
will not resolve the conflict but have kept the organisation in the
picture.'
Both men quickly expose the yawning gap in understanding between republicans
and British governments of all persuasions which has fuelled the fight and
in 25 years prematurely terminated 3,000 lives.
London and Dublin win almost universal domestic and international support
for insisting upon a permanent cessation of violence before talks. 'The IRA
is expected to trust perfidious Albion? It is, in any case, arrogant to
suggest the violence and terrorism is one-sided, that the IRA is the
offender and the British are peacemakers,' says Mr O'Doherty, who joined the
IRA in protest at the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings, when 13 civilians were
shot dead by British troops.
'Britain tries to hijack the moral high ground as though it has nothing to
answer for. It has injured people on the streets, immunised its own
murderers from prosecution and committed terrible injustices.
'There are three armed struggles in Northern Ireland involving the IRA, the
loyalist paramilitaries and the British. We are all covered in blood and all
carry the responsibility for the mess and for clearing it up. The IRA will
not lay down its weaponry and put a question-mark over the moral value of
its struggle and the sacrifices of its volunteers on the basis of the deal
on offer.'
Both men believe the British government will swing on the hook of hypocrisy
in its refusal to talk. 'They talked to the IRA during two ceasefires in
1972 and 1974, they have been talking again in the last three years and they
talked during and after the Warrington bombs,' says Mr O'Doherty.
'We all know lines of communication have been open since the hunger strikes.
Which is the principle at stake that has not already been breached?' asks Mr
McKearney.
So what must happen, in the eyes of hardline republicans, if the anguish is
ever to end? The British government will first, says Mr O'Doherty, be
expected to show some humility in a declaration repenting for 'centuries of
injustice'. At the same time, he believes, the IRA will not countenance an
end to armed struggle without the repatriation and eventual release of
prisoners to whom it is unswervingly loyal.
The British government has insisted there can be no amnesty for people who
are not political prisoners but simply guilty of vicious crimes. According
to Mr O'Doherty: 'The IRA will not have the British talk about a peace which
entails the continuing retention of IRA prisoners. If the provisionals held
hostages in return, would the British claim the conditions existed for a
settlement?'
Both men agree that the big failure in republican thinking is to see the
British government as the only key to peace. A million unionists,
acknowledges Mr O'Doherty, will not be suppressed, and they will have to be
courted in the same way the British government must deal with the IRA.
Unionists have to be reassured that, in any new arrangement, their
constitutional rights are guaranteed, says Mr McKearney. He suggests
'something like a confederation or a unitary state or a canton which breaks
the connection with the UK but does not necessarily involve parting'. Mr
O'Doherty has in mind Britain and Ireland sharing sovereignty and
responsibility for the north.
Such language renders unionists apoplectic and London and Dublin unmoved.
The governments insist on a ceasefire, underwrite the democratic will of the
majority and restate their commitment to a peace initiative which, in trying
to be all things to all people, threatens to satisfy none.
The history of Northern Ireland, however, is replete with surprising ironies
as well as tragedy. Both Mr McKearney and Mr O'Doherty spent several years
in the same jail as the loyalist paramilitaries they were pledged to kill.
They talked and mixed and came to see other side's point of view. They even
struck up friendships.
The trick is to repeat it in the world outside.

Sir, Judging by the rather cloudy letter from the Malaysian prime minister
it would seem that Dr Mahathir Mohamad is suffering under the somewhat
undesirable burden that is commonly referred to as an inferiority complex.
In line with the times, perhaps we could offer an even softer loan for a
course of psychotherapy?

<TEXT>
Sir, Aside from his personal attacks on Andrew Neil and his cri-de-coeur of
a 'northern' bias against non-whites, Dr Mahathir's now famous letter does
point out that Britain's soft loans and aid-trade provisions are only
marginally more attractive than others available to Third World rulers. How
useful.
The implication is clear. Regardless of the innate appropriateness of
projects, on financial, environmental or social grounds, the north continues
to sell emerging economies a bill of goods, which are primarily in the
north's financial self-interest.
Should the soft financing be particularly attractive and possibly allow
leeway for front-end overrides, payable to recipient country
decision-makers, even totally inappropriate projects have a greater chance
of acceptance.
Through Gatt, the OECD, the EU and the multilateral agencies, greater
monitoring and disciplines are needed, to ensure that a level playing field
is created for only truly viable projects to proceed. Should dams silt up
before debt servicing is complete, it is generally from the hide of a
nation's poorest citizens that final debt servicing is provided.
In such an environment, world business leaders must know that follow-up
contracts become less likely.

<TEXT>
Sir, The continuing furore about the Pergau Dam still comes from the
original misunderstanding of where the money for the project came from. The
Malaysians do not know that the UK has specific guidelines and rules which
govern our Overseas Development Administration budget, and that the question
of whether these monies should have been used for Pergau is what has caused
so much upset.
If Sir Tim Lankester, as head of the ODA, advised Baroness Chalker, minister
for overseas development, not to fund a dam which he said would not be of
benefit to the poor and would be an abuse of ODA funds, then it was , in my
opinion, time to refer the project to the Department of Trade and Industry
and allow the tiny, frozen Pounds 1.8bn aid budget to be used more for the
use of uplifting the poorest people in the poorest countries.
If we untie aid and trade, then there will be no more Pergau dams from a
small department which can then get on more effectively with its genuine
raison d'etre.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Malaysian moves' (March 18), accuses that country's
government of attempting to rein in the freedom of the British press.
There is a mistaken belief nurtured by the western media that any reporting
against the government of the day of former colonies goes down well with the
natives.
Alas, were it so simple.
While welcoming any freedom of expression, the public of such countries also
recalls the disdain which was shown by the same western media during their
freedom struggle and their cynicism is only heightened by actions such as
Star TV's desire to abandon the BBC World Service television news to China
in its higher commercial interest ('Murdoch plans to axe BBC news from China
satellite service', March 18).
On top of the British media tolerating such double standards, your
suggestion to invoke an appeal to the EU and General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade to teach Malaysia a lesson belittles the traditions of a once
great trading nation. For it is about trade is it not?

<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad's letter (March 17) clearly puts the record
straight on the Pergau Dam project. A soft loan granted by the British
government to Malaysia has been misinterpreted by some sections of the press
as an outright grant at the expense of the British public. The failure of
the British government to intervene and to tell the truth has aggravated the
situation.
Malaysia may be harsh in its action on the trade embargo. But what
alternative course is there for a small nation like Malaysia whose views are
not heard and published in the so-called free press? The press in Britain
should also learn to tell the truth.

<TEXT>
Sir, As managing and marketing director of a small UK consulting company
which exports technology and services around the world (including south-east
Asia), I have followed the UK press coverage of the Malaysian Pergau Dam
affair with a passionate interest.
I never cease to be amazed at our (the West's) ability to report and, in
effect, pass judgment on the rest of the world's social and business
cultures. In SE Asia, these demand a high degree of sensitivity and
consideration and go hand-in-hand in all walks of life, but this is
especially so in any international business negotiations. Clumsy comment,
whether true or false can (as proven with the press revelations of the
Pergau Dam affair) result in significant and long lasting damage to
international business for UK plc.
Sir Edward Heath, appearing on a recent 'Frost on Sunday' interview,
succinctly summed up the situation: 'With freedom comes responsibility'  - a
profound and accurate comment which applies equally to our valued free press
as it does to society as a whole.
Mr Andrew Neil's Sunday Times coverage of the Pergau Dam affair has
certainly increased the reader's awareness and has opened up a wound in the
side of British politicians.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world is rubbing its hands in eager anticipation
of securing business which could have come to UK plc.
If UK companies are to compete for and secure international business,
helping exports, increasing employment opportunities and generating profits
(the tax on which helps to support our national operating overheads -
irrespective of the ruling political party), UK plc needs constructive not
destructive support from all quarters - including the press.
The effects resulting from the handling of this affair have not been
restricted to Malaysia; already other business associates of ours in SE Asia
are concerned that Britain's free press can say what it likes without being
concerned about trade repercussions.
The point is that our sensitive existing and potential business customers
perceive it this way and this introduces yet another obstacle in securing
new export business.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Bosses find it's a snip at the top: FT writers examine the
management shake-up transforming western companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON, CHRISTOPHER LORENZ and LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior British Telecom executive earning more than Pounds 100,000 a year
might not appear to have much in common with a deputy store manager at WH
Smith earning perhaps a fifth that amount. This week, though, both looked
like being swept aside by the same management revolution that is brutally
transforming companies in the western world.
Job cut announcements have followed a dismally regular pattern over the past
few years. Arguably the significance of the latest developments - redundancy
for 600 staff at WH Smith and perhaps three dozen big earners at BT - is
stark evidence that both ends of the corporate hierarchy are now being
squeezed.
What BT is doing so noisily is not unheard of at the top of other
organisations. Since its demerger last year, ICI has reduced the number of
its senior managers below board level from 112 to 90 and expects that figure
to be lower by the end of the year; BP now has only 600 managers senior
enough to be entitled to share options, against 1,000 three years ago; while
BET and BAT were cited this week by one management expert as businesses
which have become 'lean and mean at most levels'.
This said, the impression remains that in the same way that some boards in
the UK have avoided pay restraint by the award of big salary increases, many
senior managers have so far been protected from the new realities of the
executive employment market.
'When pain is inflicted, it is only natural that the people taking the
decisions will leave themselves until last,' observes Rupert Eales-White,
principal consultant at Sundridge Park, the Kent-based management training
centre.
Judging by a Mori poll published recently in the FT, more top managers fear
that the day of reckoning may be at hand. Despite the fall in unemployment
and signs of economic recovery, 39 per cent of those interviewed said they
were 'more anxious' about losing their jobs, against 28 per cent a year ago.
The revolution which may catch up with them has been under way for almost a
decade, especially in the US, where radical change tends to be resisted less
fiercely than in Europe. Its nature is far-reaching - transforming the way
organisations do business, the way they are structured, and the
relationships between managers and employees - and it is far from over.
Throughout the 20th century, large organisations have been structured on the
time-hallowed military principle of 'command and control'. So has most
management language. Top managers at 'headquarters' set the 'strategy', and
tell their senior 'subordinates' how to implement it. Strategy is then
translated into 'operations' by senior managers, who tell their 'direct
reports' in various specialist departments - or 'functions' - what to do.
The cascade process continues down the corporate hierarchy until the message
reaches the 'front line': factory workers, shop assistants and other sales
staff.
The hierarchy's role in the reverse direction has been to pass intelligence
back up, level by level, from the bottom and from the outside world. As the
management writer Peter Drucker has said, many middle management jobs are
really about filtering information.
The command and control model has been modified in various ways over the
decades, as organisations became too large and complex to manage entirely
from the top. But since the early 1980s the system has broken down under a
string of pressures.
Cost. Management has become unacceptably bloated, not just at head office,
but also at every level between it and the front line. In some companies
this still means more than 10 tiers.
Competition/shorter product cycles. Hierarchies have slowed down companies'
speed of response. This did not matter in the 1960s, when growth was sure
and predictable, and competition mainly limited to other companies from the
same country, or at most the same region. Since the late 1970s, competition
in one industry after another has gone rapidly international.
Information technology. This has been a crucial influence, rendering many
management jobs obsolete especially since the late 1980s. IT has cut the
cost of automated information transfer and processing, making it possible
for top management to communicate cheaply direct with the front line. It has
also improved immeasurably the ability of people at every level and in every
specialist department within an organisation to communicate across it,
without going through department heads.
Horizontal structures. The pressure for faster results has forced companies
to cut the amount of vertical communication. Whole tiers of high-level
committees have been replaced, usually at much lower level, by task forces
and project teams spanning departmental boundaries. This 'cross-functional'
drive has been reinforced over the past 18 months by the fashion for
're-engineering' the processes by which organisations do their work - at
least in the front line. It has also encouraged 'empowerment', the word
consultants and academics use to describe how companies have been trying to
give more authority to employees lower down the ladder who are closer to
customers and markets. In so doing, of course, they effectively by-pass
tiers of middle managers and, increasingly, senior ones as well.
Economic recession. All the above pressures have been reinforced by the
slowdown which has gripped western economies in the early 1990s.
Many of these factors lie behind WH Smith's announcement this week that it
is reducing the number of management layers in its shops from four to two
(thereby requiring the 600 job cuts). 'Our electronic point of sale
technology has meant many functions traditionally performed by staff can now
be carried out by a computer system,' explained a Smith spokesman. The
market was demanding better customer service from all retailers, while there
had been a fundamental change in the workforce. 'People want more
responsibility,' he claimed.
Long before the WH Smith and BT announcements were even twinkles in their
chief executives' eyes, however, America's GE was demonstrating the stark
reality of managerial change. Led - some would say frogmarched - by a
bombastic new chief executive, Jack Welch, the company tore up its
structure, shape and ways of doing business. Between his arrival in 1981 and
the end of the decade, GE cut the average number of management layers
between Welch and the very front line from nine to four. Its headquarters
was slashed from 2,100 people to fewer than 1,000. The number of senior
executives across the company was cut, first from 700 to 500, and since 1990
by another 100. The overall workforce has been almost halved, from 404,000
to 220,000. Yet GE's revenues have more than doubled since Welch arrived,
from Dollars 27bn to Dollars 60bn.
For managers still inside GE, though, the real 'story' is the revolution
which has occurred in relationships across and down the organisation.
Here, the most important concept is what used to be described - in true
military manner - as 'the span of control': the number of people who
reported to each manager. When Welch arrived, GE was running at a
conventional five or six per manager. By the late 1980s its average had
doubled, and is now at about 14 - with some units pushing 25 or more.
With that change has come a transformation in the way employees relate to
'their' managers, and in the nature of the management process itself. Since
the only way for a single person to 'manage' two dozen people is to allow
them more independence, management at GE has changed from being a 'command
and control' function to one of mainly 'coaching' people, and - providing
their type of task allows it - unleashing their initiative as fully as
possible.
Several GE factories now have only one level of management, and a few claim
to have none at all - just a collection of self-managing work teams which,
within prescribed limits, make all their own decisions, from recruitment to
purchasing and production levels.
The white collar revolution in the UK and the rest of Europe has yet to have
such far-reaching consequences in most organisations, notably at the top.
But more companies besides BT - Roger Young of the Institute of Management
cites British Gas and Unilever - are starting to look at what he calls 'the
big numbers'.
Cost is often the most visible pressure, and those who run 'command and
control' organisations, where middle management culling is almost complete,
appear most vulnerable.
Over the past five years, for example, BT has shed 95,000 people, in one
year alone losing almost 6,000 middle managers. It has reduced the number of
levels in the company from 12 to six.
Its message is that the old guard, who grew up in the Civil Service
jobs-for-life days are no longer wanted. 'Many of them have been in the
company for the whole of their career. They are about ready to move on or
out,' says Peter Archer, director of employment relations at BT.
The effect of this new slimming-down at the top is evident at the
outplacement agencies, which help find jobs for the cast-aside managers. 'We
are getting a great many more senior executives than two to three years
ago,' says Raymond Hudson of Drake Beam Morin. You notice the difference, he
says, just by walking through the door: now the DBM offices are filled with
senior clients each occupying their own private rooms, whereas a few years
ago, middle managers were in the majority, all looking for jobs in a big
open-plan space.
The ones who can adapt to newly streamlined, process-driven structures may
survive; those stuck in the vertical past will almost certainly not. The
grim truth for many is that economic recovery - however strong - will not
provide a solution. Part-time employment may be growing and many small
businesses expanding, but senior executives do not necessarily have the
right skills to take advantage of such opportunities.
As one redundant senior executive from the electronics industry observed
this week: 'The market is going to get much more aggressive. People are no
longer just relying on headhunters and the appointments columns of
newspapers. They are very deliberately targeting companies and positions
where they think their skills can be useful, taking a pro-active approach.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Ten days ago Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of Germany's opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD), dragged himself from his sick-bed to return, still
visibly shivering and pale, to the hustings.
It was the last week of electioneering for a new state parliament in Lower
Saxony, the first poll of no fewer than 19 in Germany this year, and he was
clearly not going to miss it for a bad dose of gastric flu.
This dogged determination provided a graphic illustration of the way this
serious, rather didactic career politician is tackling the election marathon
ahead. He looked dreadful, but his audiences were delighted that he was
there at all, and he managed to tell a few jokes.
His reward was a good victory for the SPD, which gained an absolute majority
in the state - if only by one seat - and saw the rival Christian Democratic
Union of Chancellor Helmut Kohl slump to its worst result since 1959.
It was not really a victory for Rudolf Scharping. The success was due more
to the wily campaigning of Mr Gerhard Schroder, his arch-rival within the
SPD, the state premier in Lower Saxony, and the man he defeated for the
party leadership last year. But by turning out to give him support, Mr
Scharping made sure that some of the glory rubbed off on himself.
More importantly, perhaps, he managed to underline his success in forging a
common front in the SPD, whose internal divisions and open arguments have
undermined each previous attempt to recapture power in Bonn.
As far as public opinion is concerned, the election result was an essential
first step for the SPD on the long march towards its ultimate ambition:
victory for Scharping against Kohl in the general election on October 16,
and a return to power for the party after 12 years in the wilderness. For
the first time, the polls are suggesting that a clear majority - more than
70 per cent - expects a change in power.
Yesterday, Mr Scharping took a second big step towards that goal, with the
publication of the party's draft government programme. The document
represents a clear victory for his middle-of-the-road agenda: it is
deliberately cautious, low-key and unrevolutionary, a studied attempt to
reconcile the party's traditional commitment to social justice, full
employment and strict environmental standards, with a balanced budget and
strict fiscal responsibility. It is above all an attempt to prove that the
party is 'fit for government'.
'It is not a list of pious wishes, but a practical government programme,'
said Mr Gunter Verheugen, Mr Scharping's right-hand man as party
secretary-general.
When Mr Scharping, then simply the state premier in the
Rhineland-Palatinate, was elected party leader, one senior SPD official was
asked why he was chosen. 'Because we Germans like someone who is worthy and
safe,' he replied.
'He looks just like a typical scout master: trustworthy and sympathetic,'
according to one business observer. 'The question now is: do we think a good
scout master would make a good chancellor?'
He is not the sort of person who sets his audiences alight, or has them
rolling in the aisles. But he has abandoned written texts for his speeches,
and makes them from a handful of notes. He has a remarkable memory,
according to close advisers, and can keep a whole mass of figures in his
head.
That may be part of his problem, for he still tends to blind his audiences
with science. But he is also starting to enjoy his role of the modern,
youthful challenger - he is 46 - taunting the old warhorse, 63-year-old Mr
Kohl.
His favourite story of the moment tells of a broadcast he had time to watch
two weeks ago, lying on his sick-bed, when the chancellor was answering
callers' questions.
'This man rang in to ask him what he was doing to promote investment in the
new multi-media super-highways, the leading edge of new technology. But the
chancellor thought he was talking about the autobahn system, and started
banging on about traffic jams and investment in the roads,' Mr Scharping
told a delighted audience in Lower Saxony. 'How on earth can you trust a man
who doesn't know the difference?'
The SPD leader's greatest success so far has been in stopping the squabbling
inside his own party. 'For the first time in 12 years, the SPD has got a
proper party leader,' according to one rival CDU official. From the moment
he was formally elected last June, after a grass-roots ballot of the party
membership, he moved swiftly and methodically to spike potentially divisive
issues.
He rapidly co-opted his other potential rival, Mr Oskar Lafontaine, by
giving him responsibility for the whole field of economic and financial
policy. Between the two of them, they have forged a policy which combines
tax reform, to shift the burden from the lower-paid to the higher income
groups, with strict fiscal discipline. Mr Lafontaine has been forced to
postpone his plans for a headline-catching environmental tax reform, to
concentrate instead on the absolute priority of job creation. Mr Scharping
does not want to scare off the business lobby.
By shifting the party to the right, he has set his face against a possible
coalition with the Green party after the October election - although the
latest opinion polls suggest they could have a clear majority between them.
'The SPD will not be a partner in a policy which suggests petrol prices
should be raised to DM5 (a fourfold increase), or the Bundeswehr should be
pulled out of Nato,' he said yesterday, in a firm rejection of Green party
policies.
The challenge he now faces is keeping his party in line, with Mr Kohl ready
to exploit the slightest sign of dissent. The CDU last month launched a big
poster campaign, featuring a huge grainy close-up of the chancellor's
grinning, clean-shaven face, and the slogan: 'For a policy without
whiskers.'
It was intended to show that the neatly bearded Scharping is merely peddling
the same old policies of a tired opposition. It could yet backfire. It
certainly shows that the chancellor's advisers are taking their challenger
seriously.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Difficult decisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Through the fog that obscures economic statistics, global economic recovery
can now be discerned. The US recovery is already bathed in brightest
daylight. That in the UK is little more obscure. Even the German and French
recoveries are visible to the naked eye. In the case of Japan alone does the
optimist need a telescope.
In the US, the question now is how swiftly monetary policy will have to be
tightened. The usual mistake is to tighten too late. Mr Alan Greenspan's
slow-moving Federal Reserve is more likely to err in that direction than in
the opposite one.
Last month, the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates of interest from 3
to just 3 1/4 per cent. It could hardly have done less, although even that
was enough to create an earthquake in the bond markets. In recent weeks,
however, revised figures have shown the economy grew at an annual rate of
7.5 per cent in the last quarter of 1993, rather than the 5.9 per cent first
reported.
Data since January have also been uniformly stronger than expected. Retail
spending is robust, despite a temporary dip in construction activity.
Industrial production appears to be growing at an annual rate of 7-8 per
cent this quarter. The jobless rate, at 6.5 per cent, is already low.
All these statistics have fed Wall Street's rumour mill, as did Mr
Greenspan's surprise meeting with President Clinton yesterday. It is widely
supposed that another rise in short-term interest rates will come, maybe as
soon as next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee.
So, indeed, it should. What Mr Greenspan meant by his talk of pursuing a
more 'neutral' monetary policy is obscure. But since short-term real
interest rates are barely positive even now, US monetary policy clearly
remains expansionary, which can hardly be justified.
Opposite position
If the US needs to tighten, France, Germany and Japan are in the opposite
position. Japan's economy remains in recession, but its promised fiscal
boost has fallen hostage to political strife. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank
failed to take further action on Thursday, though in Germany, too, lower
short-term interest rates would seem fully justified.
This is true even though evidence is emerging that France and Germany are
recovering more strongly than expected. Retail sales in western Germany were
2 per cent higher in January than in the same month last year, while sales
in the whole of Germany were up 3 per cent, 2 per cent higher than in
December.
The French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE)
predicted growth of 0.7 per cent in the French economy in the first half of
1994, up from December's forecast of 0.5 per cent. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the
French economics minister, was buoyant. 'Everything is going in the right
direction,' he exulted. 'All our forecasts are being confirmed and, day
after day, statistics prove the government's scenario is realistic.' No less
realistic, unfortunately, is INSEE's forecast that unemployment will rise to
12.7 per cent.
On the turn
These economies are on the turn, but not fast enough to prevent further
increases in unemployment. It is easy to sympathise with complaints about
European monetary policy from American officials at the jobs summit of the
group of seven leading industrial countries in Detroit.
Just why the European recession has been so prolonged was explained by the
Bundesbank's president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer. He noted this week that west
German inflation was set to fall below 2 per cent. But while 2 per cent is
the Bundesbank's frequently stated target, it is also lower than it has
achieved over the past 35 years, except in the late 1960s and again between
1986 and 1988.
In the US, monetary policy should be tightened. In Europe and Japan, it
should be loosened. UK policymakers, by contrast, face genuinely difficult
dilemmas, for interest rates are approaching the floor.
Unemployment has fallen to 2 3/4 m, but remains 9.8 per cent of the labour
force. Producer prices are up only 2.4 per cent over the year, excluding
food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum, but the underlying annual increase
in average earnings has risen slightly, from 3 per cent last December to 3
1/4 per cent in January. Retail sales fell 0.5 per cent in February, but are
still 2.5 per cent up over the year. UK monetary policy may be eased
further, but the policymakers do have to be cautious.
In deciding what to do, all the monetary authorities must take account of
the global fall in bond prices, which continued this week in most markets.
Only a brave central bank will lower short rates when long rates are rising.
For all that, the rise in long rates does not seem driven by worrying
fundamentals. With luck, the world's monetary authorities will do what is
needed and the G7, as a whole, will quite soon enjoy good strong growth,
with low inflation.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Doubt cast on book-pricing pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Booksellers will be warned next month by a leading publisher that the net
book agreement, which governs the price of most books, may be unsustainable.
Mr Eddie Bell, executive chairman of HarperCollins, the publishing arm of
the Murdoch media empire, will issue the warning at the annual conference of
the Booksellers Association in Jersey. The NBA is a voluntary agreement by
publishers to sell books at the recommended price.
Opponents say the lack of discounts cuts the number of books sold.
Supporters stress the association's role in sustaining a wide range of
titles and independent bookshops.
Mr Bell, who published Lady Thatcher's autobiography, The Downing Street
Years, emphasised yesterday that he supported the agreement and that
HarperCollins would not abandon it unilaterally.
But he feared it was becoming unsustainable because of 'the massive
pressure' from the growing influence of book and warehouse clubs, which are
not bound by the NBA. In November, the Office of Fair Trading launched a
review of the NBA to see whether it still acted in the public interest.
Reed Elsevier is the only publisher to have published all its books outside
the NBA.

FT  19 MAR 94 / School tests still in danger, say heads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Secondary school heads yesterday stepped up pressure over the national
curriculum with a statement that industrial action by only one teacher could
be enough to halt all tests in a school.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, immediately attempted to persuade
heads to take a stronger line against the action.
He said at the Secondary Heads Association's annual conference in
Bournemouth: 'Any industrial action in schools puts heads squarely in the
crossfire. That is bound to be uncomfortable. But head teachers, as managers
and chief executives of their schools, know that big issues are at risk.'
Head teachers are in an awkward position because the UK's largest teaching
union, the NUT, apparently intends to boycott all the tests.
Mr Patten said such action was 'damaging and pointless' and added that both
Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief adviser on the tests, and Ofsted,
the education watchdog, had found the tests valuable.
The pressure on Mr Patten seemed to have lifted after the Association of
Teachers and Lecturers and the NASUWT - - the two other teachers' unions
that boycotted the tests last year, advised their members to abandon the
boycott this year.
But Mr John Sutton, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association,
which includes 80 per cent of secondary schools, made it clear that the NUT
could still cause serious disruption.
Mr Sutton told the conference: 'Our members will not ask teachers to
undertake tasks which members of the NUT have refused to do. If you have a
head of department who is boycotting, you've probably blocked all tests for
that department.'
He added that NUT members responsible for a school's over-all timetabling
would be able to force abandonment of the tests altogether.
Mr Patten made a strenuous attempt to shake heads away from this position,
saying that both the law and the Dearing proposals were at stake. 'If, as
head teachers, you believe in the consensus which Sir Ron has fashioned, I
hope you'll stand up for that consensus and make it work,' he said.
In another speech to Tories in Andover last night Mr Patten expressed deep
concern at the decline in the teaching of British history in schools and
called for it to take pride of place in schoolchildren's historical studies.
'We must not allow our children to be robbed of their birthright of
knowledge about our country's history,' he said.
Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, yesterday announced that 41 local education
authorities would share a total of Pounds 5.517m to improve school
buildings.

FT  19 MAR 94 / MPs to probe committee system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful committee of MPs is preparing to review how Westminster's select
committee system can be made to function more effectively.
The cross-party Commons liaison committee - comprising all select committee
chairmen - wants to conduct the review partly in response to a campaign of
procedural non-co-operation with the government that Labour has been waging
since December.
Some of the chairmen are pressing for the liaison committee to cast its net
wider.
They would like to see the review examine whether the select committees,
parliament's most powerful tool for scrutinising the executive, need greater
powers to do their job.
In particular, they want the review to consider whether there should be an
automatic right for committee recommendations to be put to a Commons vote.
Since many of the chairmen believe that the committees' powers are already
extensive and adequate, the scope of the review is generally expected to
fall short of these demands.
It is expected to consider, however, whether more debating time needs to be
set aside in the Commons to evaluate select committee reports, and whether
steps need to be taken to limit the influence of party whips.
The most bad feeling in the procedural battle has been caused by Labour's
decision to refuse to allow its MPs to 'pair' - that is, to agree with a
Tory counterpart to miss a non-crucial vote.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Opencast guidance sparks fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government draft guidance on opencast coal mining is likely to perpetuate
the practice in areas where it is unacceptable to local communities, the
Coalfield Communities Campaign pressure group said yesterday.
According to a campaign report, the government draft Mineral Planning
Guidance 3 fails to give local councils adequate powers to deal with the
'flood' of opencast proposals likely to follow privatisation of the coal
industry.
It describes as unworkable the proposal that local councils should identify
in advance potential opencast sites.
The campaign says the guidance gives no encouragement to local authorities
to negotiate community benefits as compensation to residents who are
affected by opencast sites.
The campaign also says that the new guidance 'still introduces 'national
interest' considerations in favour of opencasting'. This, it says, should be
deleted to avoid bias in considering opencast proposals.
The Department of the Environment said the new guidance would introduce a
more environmentally conscious regime than its predecessor. It welcomed the
campaign's contribution to the consultation. Under the previous version of
the guidance, issued in 1988, local councils have found it difficult to
resist opencast proposals that cause what they consider to be unacceptable
environmental damage.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Pressure for move on Tube deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 75-strong group of London companies yesterday launched a campaign to
persuade the Treasury to approve a Pounds 740m leasing deal for new trains
on London Underground's Northern Line.
As they did so Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury and the
Conservative party's local election campaign co-ordinator for London, tried
to pass blame for uncertainty about the plans to London Underground's
management.
He was speaking after reports that spending ministers and the Treasury were
in disagreement over the proposals and that ministers believed Mr John Major
might have to intervene.
Mr Portilllo said the government had not taken a view on the proposal being
promoted by ABB Transportation, a rolling stock manufacturer. Mr Steven
Norris, transport minister, has told MPs that a decision could come within
days.
Derby-based ABB Transportation has been negotiating with London Underground
for the past five months to secure a deal to build, maintain and operate the
rolling stock. The trains would cost Pounds 440m with a 20-year maintenance
deal worth another Pounds 300m.
The Northern Line Coalition, co-ordinated by London First, a business
initiative to promote the capital, put its weight behind that of Tory MPs
whose constituencies border the line.
The coalition includes groups in banking, law, accountancy, surveying,
catering, health and construction.
Mr Tim Daniels, managing director of Selfridges and president of the Oxford
Street Association, said: 'This decision is vital for the heart of London's
shopping district.'
Pressure for more flexibility from the government on the terms of its
private finance initiative have also come from the leasing industry.
Mr Tony Jukes, managing director of Hill Samuel Asset Finance, said one way
to break the log-jam would be for the Treasury to ease the terms of leasing
deals progressively to allow the financial groups involved to gain
experience of the rolling stock market.
'At the moment they are asking us to make too much of a leap,' he said.
The issue has assumed a high profile in the approach to local elections in
May - with the government bracing itself for heavy losses in outer London
boroughs.
Mr Portillo said that London Underground was free to spend some of the
Pounds 1.5bn it was due to receive from the government in the next three
years on Northern Line trains but did not consider the investment enough of
a priority to do so.
He said that for the proposed deal to qualify for the government's private
finance initiative there had to be a transfer of risk to the private sector
'otherwise the government's commitment to public spending control would be
brought into doubt'. If the scheme did not qualify 'then obviously I would
oppose it'.
He said he had not seen a detailed proposition of the scheme.

This 1940s advertisement from the archives of the Proprietary Association of
Great Britain would now be illegal because of a ban on absolute statements
such as 'best and safest' or suggestions that any remedy could restore
'health and vigour'.
The association today launches its revised rules on how members are allowed
to advertise products. A ban on the use of celebrities to endorse medicines
is one of the changes. Advertisements will also have to carry the words
'always read the label' and the name of the medicine's active ingredient.
The association scrutinises 4,000 advertisements a year to ensure they
comply with the product licence, the Medicines Act and advertising codes of
practice.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Counter sales of medicines jump 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of over-the-counter medicines increased nearly 14 per cent in value
terms last year to Pounds 1.2bn, according to figures today from the
Proprietary Association of Great Britain, the non-prescription medicines
trade association.
A significant part of the growth, which was nearly 5 per cent in volume
terms, was accounted for by the introduction of nicotine patches and the flu
epidemic at the end of 1993, said the association.
The market for anti-smoking products was worth Pounds 63m last year - an
increase of nearly 200 per cent in value terms.
Skin treatments were worth Pounds 128m, up 18 per cent in value. Other
growth categories included treatments for thrush and cold sores - new to the
over-the-counter market.
One significant growth area this year is likely to be indigestion remedies.
Earlier this month, the decision was taken to licence Tagamet and Pepcid,
two powerful indigestion remedies, for OTC sale. They represent the most
important extension of the OTC market for more than a decade.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Mr Mole wants to bury TV diggers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Terry Cohn is trying to become a mole in the multi-million pound cable
television industry.
His aim is to penetrate the cable companies and persuade them to stop
digging up the streets when they lay their cable networks, often leaving
unsightly 'scars' behind.
His interest however is more to do with business than the urban environment.
Mr Cohn is managing director of Powermole International, a company that
manages to lay cables and pipes without having to dig up the streets.
'The need for trenching is a thing of the past. The alternative is not only
quicker but significantly cheaper,' Mr Cohn said yesterday.
The moles, already at work for British Gas, are pneumatically powered. A
piston strikes an anvil in front of the casing and propels the mole through
the ground, compacting the earth as it goes.
The mole, Mr Cohn says, can construct a 100-metre hole in a single stretch
travelling at the rate of one metre a minute.
A cable can then either be inserted in the hole or the mole can pull the
cable through as it goes.
'I am not sure why the cable industry has been hesitant to use moles rather
than trenching,' said Mr Cohn, pointing out that moles were used to build
cable networks in both France and Germany. He hopes to be able to
demonstrate his British-made machines - which cost between Pounds 5,000 and
Pounds 10,000 - to the cable industry.
Yesterday, Mr Cohn staged a demonstration for senior British Gas engineers
at Sittingborne, Kent.
The mole went into an old cast iron gas pipe, smashing it as it went while
at the same time pulling a new pipe behind it.
Powermole International hopes it will finally make a similar impact on the
cable industry.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Mersey port decision attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, has rejected Pounds
20m plans by Mersey Docks and Harbour Company to build a floating roll-on,
roll-off stage and a 27-acre freight terminal at Birkenhead to exploit
growing Irish Sea trade.
The corporation has instead named London &amp; General Property as the preferred
developer of 50 acres of riverside land. It proposes a Pounds 74m scheme,
including a floating stage and a 15-acre freight terminal, to be run by an
unnamed port operator. Its centrepiece is 27 acres of speculative long-term
property development.
Mr Trevor Furlong, chief executive of Mersey Docks, said: 'It is absolutely
crazy handing over workable waterfront sites for this sort of development.
It will constrict expansion of the Mersey as a port. We are growing rapidly
and successfully. Who knows what might be needed in 10 years' time?'
A clash is likely, with each side mobilising cross-party political support.
The dock company can stall the development as it owns part of the land
London &amp; General wants for its freight terminal - which also depends on
filling in part of Wallasey Dock, over which the dock company has total
control.
Mersey Docks' legal rights over part of the waterfront involved will enable
it to charge another operator whatever it likes for its use. Mersey Docks
had rejected a plan similar to London &amp; General's as impractical.
The crucial piece of land is called Twelve Quays and is opposite Liverpool
Pier Head and the Albert Dock, the development corporation's flagship
waterfront tourist project in Liverpool.
The dock company wants Twelve Quays as its freight terminal. London &amp;
General wants to make it into a science park for emergent technology
companies.
London &amp; General has three months to finalise plans. Its consortium will
include Capital and Regional Properties. Mr Furlong said Mersey Docks would
welcome discussions.

Mersey Docks' legal rights over part of the waterfront involved will enable
it to charge another operator whatever it likes for its use.
Mersey Docks had rejected a master plan similar to London &amp; General's as
impracticable, both on its own judgment and after taking soundings with the
ports of Dublin and Belfast, the other principal Irish Sea trading
terminals.
The crucial piece of land involved is called Twelve Quays and is opposite
Liverpool Pier Head and the Albert Dock, the development corporation's
flagship waterfront tourist project in Liverpool.
The corporation has wanted a visually attractive development there and once
rejected a proposal for a power station at the adjacent Morpeth Dock as
unsuitable, causing the resignation from its board of Professor Patrick
Minford, the economist. Two previous attempts at property development there
have failed.
The dock company wants Twelve Quays as its freight terminal. London &amp;
General wants to make it into a science park for emergent technology
companies, with a student village at the adjoining Morpeth Dock and a
'festival or market style' retail activity.
London &amp; General has three months to finalise plans. Mr Furlong said Mersey
Docks would welcome discussions.
Mr Peter Kilfoyle, Labour MP for Liverpool Walton, said: 'Merseyside
Development Corporation is irrational. The dock company has revived the
Mersey as a working river and to invite a London property company to develop
a port facility on a promise of jam tomorrow is beyond belief. I shall be
questioning the conduct of this quango in the House of Commons.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Turmoil on bond markets hits M4 lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turmoil on the bond markets in February fed through to the money supply
figures last month.
A Pounds 1.95bn repayment of debt by securities dealers meant that sterling
lending to the M4 private sector was just Pounds 600m on a seasonally
adjusted basis, compared with market forecasts of Pounds 1.8bn. It was the
second consecutive month that M4 lending was much weaker than expected and
followed a lending figure of Pounds 141m in January.
The main factor behind February's weakness appears to have been the need for
securities dealers to repay debt and reduce their vulnerability to further
price falls in the bond market.
According to the British Bankers Association, dealers borrowed Pounds 2bn in
October and November, money which probably helped finance the end-of-year
surge in bond prices. But prices fell sharply in February.
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe), said:
'The inference (from the lending figures) is that securities houses have
reduced their positions in the bond market.'
The BBA reported that total sterling lending by the main British banking
groups to the UK private sector fell Pounds 244m in February, following a
rise of Pounds 652m in January. Consumer borrowing was a weak Pounds 38m,
down from a revised Pounds 82m in January.
Lord Inchyra, director general of the BBA, said: 'Overall, despite the
recent cut in interest rates, there is little demand for funds from the
corporate sector, which seems to be obtaining any necessary funding from a
combination of improved profitability and continued use of the capital
markets.'
The weakness of the lending figures was offset by other money supply figures
yesterday.
The annual growth in the whole of M4, the broadest measure of the money
supply, was 5.9 per cent, up from 5.6 per cent in January. The monthly rise
between January and February was 0.9 per cent, which was above analysts'
expectations.
M4 has been accelerating in recent months and the annualised growth rate
over the three months to February was 6.8 per cent. The government's
monitoring range is 3 per cent to 9 per cent.
Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, said that January's strong
growth in M4 was due to special factors, particularly a large public sector
borrowing requirement which was not fully funded by gilts issues.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Upturn has some downside for societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upturn in building societies' mortgage lending is more of a mixed
blessing than it might appear.
First, the good news. Net new commitments in February totalled Pounds
2.93bn, compared with Pounds 1.83bn the previous month and Pounds 2.72bn in
February last year. The figure was the highest monthly total since July.
But the bad news for them is the difficulty in funding the increase in
lending if they are unable to attract enough retail savings.
Last month gross mortgage lending increased to Pounds 2.24bn compared with
Pounds 2.06bn in January and was 17 per cent more than the corresponding
month last year.
Mortgage applications traditionally pick up at this time of year as the peak
spring buying season approaches. Nonetheless the figures confirm the recent
upsurge in demand reported by housebuilders and estate agents.
House sales, according to Inland Revenue conveyancing records, rose by more
than a third in January compared with January last year.
Prices have also started to rise again. According to Halifax, the UK's
largest building society, the average price of a home rose by 3.8 per cent
to Pounds 62,498 during the 12 months to the end of January.
The society forecasts that prices on average will rise by 5 per cent this
year while the number of sales could rise by up to 15 per cent.
According to seasonally adjusted figures published by the Bank of England,
there is further good news for societies, in that they seem to be regaining
some of the market share they lost to banks last year.
Building societies' difficulties in attracting retail savings increases the
pressure on the government to move quickly in relaxing the amount of funds
that societies can raise on the wholesale markets, where funding is cheaper
at the moment.
A rise in the statutory limit from 40 per cent of funds to 50 per cent is in
prospect, but a change in the law is dependent on the passage of the
de-regulation bill, which is still some months away.
In the meantime, Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS, says that in order to
allow societies to compete, the Building Societies Commission, the statutory
regulator, should raise the regulatory limit on wholesale funding which it
sets for each society within the overall 40 per cent ceiling.
'The commission would be well advised to relax individual ratios ahead of
the impending general relaxation arising from the legislation on
de-regulation,' he says.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Insolvency priorities to include sick pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holiday and sickness pay will rank as preferential creditors in the
government's emergency insolvency bill amendment to be discussed in the
Commons on Monday.
According to a draft circulated yesterday they will be included as
liabilities with wages, salaries and pension contributions, to be paid first
from the proceeds of companies that enter receivership or administration.
The legislation, which applies retrospectively from March 15, clarifies the
difficulties raised following the Appeal Court ruling on Paramount Airways,
the insolvent charter airline in administration. The judgment said that
receivers and administrators would be deemed to have adopted the obligations
of existing employment contracts after 14 days if they did not issue new
contracts.
After two weeks of lobbying, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, announced the changes on Monday and officials have been working
since to introduce the legislation.
A private member's bill to amend sections of the 1986 insolvency act dealing
with the valuation of assets of liquidated companies completed its passage
through the Commons without debate yesterday.
The bill, sponsored by Mr John Butterfill, Conservative MP for Bournemouth
West, now goes to the House of Lords.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Revenue presses on with quest for greater power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue yesterday pledged to lobby for additional powers to carry
out its tax investigations after its attempt to introduce amendments in the
finance bill failed on Thursday night.
It plans to issue a consultative document in the next few months with the
aim of introducing clauses into the next finance bill to enhance its right
to gain access to accountants' papers.
The decision came after the government decided on Thursday night to withdraw
section 241 of the finance bill, which would have increased the powers of
the Revenue to seize books and records. The Revenue said that it had no
plans to reintroduce the proposals.
The withdrawal was triggered by substantial opposition to the draft
legislation, including protests from Conservative politicians and from
professional tax and accounting bodies.
The idea of granting the Revenue additional powers for its inspectors was
mooted by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his Budget speech last
November. Details were provided in January's finance bill.
The Revenue said that it needed additional powers because co-operation
between it and tax practitioners had declined since the 1970s.
The draft section 241 would have permitted the Revenue to gain permission
for a raid from someone authorised by one of its board members. There would
have been no automatic right for the accountant to appeal against this
power.
It specified that a belief that a tax accountant knew a tax return of a
client was incorrect would be sufficient to justify a raid to gain access to
papers. This substantially enhanced the Revenue's ability to gain access to
accountants' records.
The position was modified in guidance notes issued by the Revenue last week,
which said that a board member would have to approve the raid, and that the
accountant would be able to appeal.
Mr Peter Wyman, tax partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'If the Revenue
needs additional powers they should have them, but there must be a way to
provide adequate safeguards.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Scott says Customs probe of Matrix was inadequate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customs officials were yesterday criticised by Lord Justice Scott for
failing to ask the right questions during their probe into the Matrix
Churchill arms-to-Iraq case.
The judge, heading an inquiry into the affair, said investigators had not
properly followed up allegations that officials 'did not care' whether
machine tools sold to the Iraqis were used to make weapons.
Miss Annabelle Bolt, a Customs &amp; Excise lawyer, told the inquiry that the
Department of Trade and Industry appeared reluctant to see the affair
investigated because shortcomings in its operations might be revealed.
Earlier the inquiry heard how Customs continued with its prosecution of
three directors of the machine-tool company in spite of concern that it
might turn into another 'supergun' fiasco.
Then, charges brought over the exporting of pipes for the Iraqi supergun
project were dropped after the attorney general warned Customs that the
prosecutions would probably be unsuccessful.
Sir Brian Unwin, then chairman of the Customs Commissioners, wrote in a
memorandum about the Matrix Churchill case: 'To put it crudely, I don't want
a repeat of the gun affair.'
His note was written in December 1990, two days after he attended a meeting
of civil servants to discuss newspaper allegations that Mr Alan Clark, the
former trade minister, gave Matrix Churchill 'a nod and a wink' to carry on
selling to Iraqi munitions factories.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Hurd restresses stance on EU votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday sought to reassure
Conservatives that he would not strike an agreement on a new European Union
voting system that would dilute British interests.
Addressing Conservatives in Poole last night, Mr Hurd said there was no
guarantee that Britain would reach agreement with its EU partners on a new
voting system when foreign ministers resumed talks on the issue next week.
'If we are to move forward as a Union of 16, it should be on the basis of as
widespread consent as possible,' he said. 'That is the best way to avoid
conflict and bickering on a permanent basis.'
He said that the British public wanted the government to exercise judgment
in the interests both of Britain and Europe.
EU member states propose that the threshold for the 'blocking minority'
should rise from 23 to 27 votes when four new countries enter the union next
year. Britain and Spain are opposing this, although both are being offered a
compromise that would allow a minority of states to see a two-month delay in
decisions.
Meanwhile, pressure intensified on the government yesterday to accept that
its citizens should have a continuing right to initiate individual cases in
the European Court of Human Rights.
Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, in a Commons debate on the
Council of Europe, warned that Britain's reputation would be damaged if the
government tried to insist that it should remain a conditional right,
subject to review at five-yearly intervals.
He said that Turkey, whose record on human rights would not commend itself
to the British people, was the only country to have adopted a similar
attitude.
Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, Foreign Office junior minister, said the UK government
was still considering a suggestion that the right should be made mandatory.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Floating gilt targets investor uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's decision to launch a floating rate government bond -
its first such issue in 15 years - may be seen as an opportunistic move,
given the difficult conditions in financial markets.
The gilt-edged, European government and US Treasury bond markets have all
experienced sharp price falls since February 4, when the US Federal Reserve
hitched up short-term interest rates.
The bond markets have been especially nervous about US inflation prospects
and the possibility of further rises in US interest rates, and there has
been heavy selling of bonds by investors, particularly the US-based hedge
funds.
A few borrowers have responded to the uncertainty over interest rate
movements this year by issuing floating-rate notes, either in US dollars or
in sterling, in order to attract investors.
Some gilt analysts pointed out that the Bank is probably hoping to take
advantage of investor uncertainty about the direction of UK interest rates,
adding that as some of the existing floating-rate sterling issues mature
this year, there will be a shortage of such notes.
One analyst said: 'Some investors clearly think that UK interest rates may
have bottomed out or be close to their lows, and that a floating-rate bond
would enable them to take advantage of a rising interest rate scenario.'
The Bank has been looking at ways of encouraging banks and building
societies to increase the size of their gilt holdings, and it expects its
new floating-rate gilt to appeal to this particular class of investor. The
fact that the new gilt issue is targeted at banks and building societies may
also help - indirectly - to iron out the sharp fluctuations in money market
interest rates.
As part of its regular money market operations, the Bank holds fortnightly
sale and repurchase operations - known as repos - whereby the banks borrow
money from the Bank at a specified rate using their gilt holdings as
security. In theory, by boosting the financial institutions' holdings of
gilts, there should be more government bonds available for use in the repo
operations.
The last time the Bank issued bonds with a variable interest rate, the
exercise was not deemed a success. It sold three issues, of Pounds 400m
each, in 1977 and 1979, which matured in 1981, 1982 and 1983. Demand was
poor and was not helped by the coupon-setting mechanism which was seen as
too complicated. It was set retrospectively, based on an average for the UK
Treasury bill rate over the previous six months.

and closing older coating lines. It said about 155 jobs would go at its Ebbw
Vale works in Gwent and about 190 jobs at the Trostre works near Llanelli.
A &amp; P Appledore, the UK's largest commercial ship repairer, announced 150
shop floor redundancies at its Tyneside yards, more than halving the present
hourly paid workforce.
Bridon is seeking up to 250 redundancies, initially on a voluntary basis.
The move is part of a restructuring programme.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Mayhew to slam Adams position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British ministers are preparing to exploit the St Patrick's Day call from
President Bill Clinton for Sinn Fein and the IRA to accept the Downing
Street declaration.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, is today expected to
drive home the political advantage created by the US administration's
decision to offer unequivocal support for the Anglo-Irish peace initiative.
In his first full-length speech since the IRA mortar attacks on Heathrow
Airport, Sir Patrick will directly attack Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president, saying that he has delivered only death and threats of death. The
Northern Ireland secretary will tell Conservative activists in south-east
England that the attacks at Heathrow Airport have enabled people to make up
their minds about the republican leader's true intentions.
Mr Clinton made it clear at a dinner in Washington on Thursday night that he
would not authorise a repeat visa for Mr Adams to visit America until the
IRA ended violence.
In another policy turnaround, he has dropped earlier controversial plans to
send a 'peace envoy' to Northern Ireland.
The president called on 'all those who practice violence for political aims
to lay down their arms'. He urged Sinn Fein and the IRA to endorse the joint
declaration as 'the only way forward'.
His remarks were backed up yesterday by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, who was in Washington to join Mr Clinton for St Patrick's Day
celebrations.
He said the message of US support would have an important influence on the
outcome of the initiative.
Mr Reynolds said political leaders would have to 'show daring as never
before, fortitude as never before, in bringing about the goal of peace'.
Mr Adams, who on Thursday said the US administration could play an important
role in the search for peace, yesterday attacked the British government for
blocking progress. He said Downing Street's inflexible and unimaginative
attitude was the major obstacle to ending the current impasse.
The fight goes on, Page 9

FT  19 MAR 94 / Up to eight BZW directors break Pounds 1m earnings barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to eight directors of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking arm
of Barclays, received remuneration of at least Pounds 1m last year, it
emerged yesterday.
The highest paid was Mr David Band, chief executive, who received about
Pounds 1.4m, including pension contribution, salary and substantial bonuses.
Bonus payments to directors and staff were partly routed through techniques
designed to reduce and delay tax charges, which triggered discussions last
year between the company and inspectors from the Inland Revenue.
About Pounds 500,000 of Mr Band's own payments are believed to have been
deferred over the next three to five years.
The revelations come in the wake of substantial bonuses paid to a number of
City executives including the partners of Goldman Sachs, the private US
investment bank, which is believed to have generated pre-tax profits of
Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.84bn) last year.
BZW's substantial payments reflect the company's success in generating
profits of Pounds 501m last year, which has led to more than 6,000 employees
in the company sharing bonuses totalling Pounds 100m.
Some of the details of the remuneration are revealed in the 20-F form which
has just been filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However,
BZW refused to comment on the figures or methods of payment.
Leading tax experts said yesterday that a number of merchant banks and other
companies have used tax avoidance and deferral techniques in spite of
efforts by the Revenue to clamp down since the last Budget.
Ms Moira Elms, a tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said that employers are
still able to pay bonuses in ways which avoid National Insurance
Contributions, while income tax owed by their staff must always be paid but
can be substantially delayed.
One approach is to pay the bonuses to an insurance company, which issues
life insurance policies with very short-term maturities.
She said she had heard of other techniques including the use of schemes
operated by specialist consultancies which provided bonuses through fine
wines, diamonds and 'bonus bonds', or vouchers redeemable at retail outlets.
These come outside the definition of earnings as defined for the purpose of
National Insurance Contributions. She said that the way in which bonuses are
received by staff can defer their income tax liability for up to 18 months.
'There are still some loopholes which we will tell our clients about,' she
said. 'But we warn that they will be closely scrutinised by the Revenue and
are only worth doing if they are very carefully structured and there are
significant numbers of employees or sizes of bonuses at stake.'

<TEXT>
Government and opposition business managers are thought to be trying to
resolve a continuing dispute over membership of the Northern Ireland select
committee ahead of next week's meeting of the cross-party committee of
selection which will decide the MPs to sit on the new body, David Owen
writes.
Labour is understood to be continuing to object to Conservative proposals
which would restrict the party's membership on the 13-seat body to two MPs.
The Liberal Democrats are also thought to be objecting to the proposals,
under which they would have no representation on the committee at all.
MPs voted to set up the committee earlier this month. It is expected to
start work shortly after Easter.

FT  19 MAR 94 / SPD calls for tax shift to pay for unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German tax reforms, which would shift the burden of spending on unification
from the low-paid to the wealthy, were outlined yesterday by the opposition
Social Democrats as the main plank of their federal electoral campaign.
The aim is also to boost demand and promote job-creation by cutting taxes
for ordinary wage-earners and reducing their social security contributions.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, SPD leader, says the net effect will be no increase in
the combined burden of taxation and insurance contributions, and no increase
in the government's net borrowing requirement. The proposal was published as
a draft programme for a future SPD government if the party wins power in
October.
It was immediately denounced by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, as 'hot
air'. Far from relieving the burden on ordinary wage-earners, it would hit
the vast majority on average incomes, he said.
The tax reforms amount to a calculated risk by the opposition leader, who is
seeking to present his party as a reliable alternative to Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's ruling coalition. They are intended to demonstrate greater social
justice, maintain strict fiscal discipline and create more jobs.
The growth rate of public spending would be kept 'appreciably below' the
nominal growth rate of gross national product to cut soaring public debt,
the programme states. 'Unnecessary' tax allowances would be abolished.
At the heart of the package is a 10 per cent tax surcharge on higher
incomes. The suggested threshold is an annual income of DM50,000 (Pounds
19,455) for the single taxpayer and DM100,000 for married couples. The Kohl
government has decided on a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge to pay for
unification to take effect from January 1995.
The SPD proposal also includes an increase in the wealth tax on individuals
and measures to close tax loopholes for the higher-paid.
In return, an SPD government would remove the surcharge on unemployment
insurance contributions which finances retraining programmes and
job-creation schemes in east Germany. Mr Scharping said this surcharge was
socially unjust because it was only paid by regular wage-earners, not by
civil servants and the self-employed.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Top bankers held in Dollars 430m scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia said yesterday it had arrested two senior bankers in connection
with a scandal over a Dollars 430m (Pounds 294.50m) letter of credit
extended by a state bank. The loan was supposed to finance petrochemical
projects but was allegedly diverted to Hong Kong.
The case involving PT Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo) is arousing
intense interest among Indonesians and their trading partners because of
concerns about the bad debts of the state banks, which account for about 60
per cent of bank business in the country.
The two men arrested were Mr Towil Heryoto, who headed Bapindo until he was
replaced by the government this week, and Mr Subekti Ismaun, chief of the
bank when the unsecured letter of credit was issued in 1992, according to
the Attorney General's office.
Another former Bapindo executive and Mr Eddy Tansil, director of the Golden
Key group which received the credit, were arrested earlier.
With accrued interest, the loan is now supposed to be worth more than
Dollars 620m, but is apparently not being repaid and is not clear where the
money went.
Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the Indonesian finance minister, announced recently that
latest figures showed 21.2 per cent or around Dollars 7bn of outstanding
loans extended by the seven big state banks were classified as bad or
doubtful, compared with 17.4 per cent at the end of 1992 and 6 per cent in
1990.
Bankers in the private sector believe some state banks, which have a
reputation for lending money to businessmen with good political connections,
have bad or doubtful loans amounting to as much as 60 per cent of their
portfolios. Appalled by the extent of the problem, they are happy to see the
finance ministry trying to tackle the issue in public.
'In the past this would never have come up; it would have been swept under
the carpet,' said one banker. 'It has been taken very seriously by the
minister of finance.'
The Attorney General's office said it wanted to bring the four men in jail
to trial as soon as possible.

FT  19 MAR 94 / US fears Pyongyang missiles
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has expressed concern that North Korea is in the process of
developing two new types of long-range ballistic missile with the potential
to threaten most of Asia.
Mr James Woolsey, director of the CIA, told a symposium at the agency's
headquarters on Thursday night that if the new North Korean missiles were
bought by unnamed countries in the Middle East, Europe could also
potentially be at risk.
'These new missiles have yet to be flown,' Mr Woolsey said, 'and we will
monitor their development, including any attempts to export them.'
Earlier this month Jane's Defence Weekly reported that satellite
reconnaissance had detected what appeared to be full scale mock-ups of two
new missiles at a site of North Korea's north east coast.
He drew a distinction between the threats posed by the North's nuclear and
missile programmes. On the former, the US, according to congressional
testimony this week by Mr Winston Lord, the undersecretary of state for
Asian affairs, still hopes Pyongyang will agree to full inspection of its
facilities.
But planned bilateral talks due next week have been postponed and the US is
again considering re-activating the Team Spirit military exercises held
jointly with South Korea. These were put on hold, as were prospective
deployment of US Patriot anti-missile missiles in South Korea, so as to
induce the North to co-operate with inspectors from the International Atomic
Energy Agency.
Yesterday, Congressman Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs
committee, urged further pressure on North Korea, including deployment of
the Patriots and going ahead with the Team Spirit exercises.
'The pattern has been that North Korea does eventually accede if enough
pressure is brought on them,' he said on TV.
'All we can do is to ratchet that pressure up and at the same time keep open
the opportunity for a negotiated solution.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Japan seeks better links with China / Preview of Mr
Hosokawa's visit to Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will be less direct than
the Americans and yet more frank than his own predecessors when he starts
his first official visit to China today.
Chinese leaders will welcome Mr Hosokawa's low-key demeanour, a contrast to
Washington's recent bluntness towards China. So he can expect a warm
reception, in contrast to the chill that greeted Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, last week, when he was strongly criticised for
Washington's decision to link renewal of China's trade privileges under its
most favoured nation (MFN) status to an improvement in human rights.
Mr Hosokawa's visit, the first by a Japanese prime minister for three years,
marks an increase in Sino-Japanese official contacts. This reflects a sharp
rise in two-way trade and Japanese investment in China, and Beijing's
eagerness to sound out Japan's first non-Liberal Democratic Party government
for 38 years.
Only last month, Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice-premier in charge of the
economy, met Mr Hosokawa and members of his government in Tokyo, while Mr
Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, visited Beijing in January.
Yet Mr Hosokawa will also show on his three-day visit that Japan's attitude
to China has changed, if only in tone, from the emollient stance shown by
Liberal Democratic Party governments during its 38 years in power.
Japanese officials say they want relations with China to mature, in the
sense that both sides should speak more freely.
Mr Hosokawa shares strong views on human rights with his foreign minister,
who told Chinese leaders in January that Tokyo would be more frank in
discussing sensitive issues. 'We expect China to take a more positive
attitude,' said a Foreign Ministry official yesterday.
Mr Hosokawa is also expected to suggest to Beijing that it could make its
allies less nervous by giving more information about its planned 22.4 per
cent rise in military spending this year. He is likely to register Japan's
worries over China's resumption of nuclear weapons tests last October and
call for more help from Beijing in enticing North Korea away from nuclear
weapons.
The environment is also on Japan's agenda. One side effect of China's
economic growth has been concern over acid rain from its coal-fired power
stations reaching Japan. Mr Hosokawa is due to sign an environmental
protection agreement, which should go some way to assuaging Japanese
worries.
Japan is also moving for the first time towards using its weight as
Beijing's largest provider of bilateral aid to try to influence policy.
Officials have indicated future cheap loans could be used to encourage
Beijing to be more open about defence spending and to come up with
environmental projects, a change from Tokyo's previous policy of disbursing
Chinese aid without conditions.
Japan's five-year Y810bn loan programme for China, the only country to get
long-term loans from Tokyo, runs out at the end of next year, so the subject
could come up. Beijing wants another long-term programme, fixed in yen, but
Tokyo is understood to lean towards tougher conditions: shorter loans at a
floating exchange rate.
At the same time, neither side wants to let sensitive topics spoil their
very good relations.
Japan, for one, needs to protect its fast-growing economic interests in
China. Until three years ago, Japanese companies were cautious. But the
rapid growth of China's economy - 13 per cent last year - has sucked in a
sharp increase in Japanese investment and trade. Two-way trade rose by 31
per cent to a record Dollars 37.84bn last year, when a 45 per cent rise in
exports to China made it Japan's second-largest foreign market.
Corporate Japan has turned increasingly to China as a cheap production site
to escape the blow to its own competitiveness inflicted by the rising yen.
Japanese companies signed Dollars 2.2bn-worth of investment contracts in
China in the first nine months of last year, slightly more than in the whole
of 1992, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation. China is now
Japan's biggest new investment location, according to a survey by the
Export-Import Bank of Japan.
Yet Japan's caution has made it relatively late in the race for the Chinese
market. By the middle of last year, it had completed Dollars 5.2bn of
investment in China, set to rise to Dollars 6bn this year, making it only
the third foreign investor after Hong Kong and Taiwan.
China, too, wants to develop the relationship. A recent commentary in
People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, shows high hopes of Japan as
a source of investment and advanced technology.
China's long-term growth rate of 8-9 per cent had created conditions for
prosperity in both China and Japan, and this was now accepted by the
Japanese political and business leadership, it said. Japan is funnelling
about Dollars 200m into China annually to help train Chinese managers and
enhance Chinese expertise in various areas, including environmental
protection.
There is a chance that Mr Hosokawa might confront another sensitive subject:
Japan's wartime atrocities in Asia. This appears to be the minds of the
Chinese public, judging by yesterday's demonstrations for compensation
outside Japan's Beijing embassy.
Mr Hosokawa won respect from some of his Asian partners when he first issued
an apology, on becoming prime minister last August, for Japan's wartime
behaviour.
Whether he chooses to repeat the gesture, that episode in history is a
brooding factor in the general background of Sino-Japanese relations. The
Chinese themselves are not averse to manipulating Japanese guilt to their
own advantage.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Banks back Brazil on restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's bank creditors yesterday appeared ready to go ahead with a Dollars
52bn (Pounds 35.60bn) debt restructuring even though the country failed on
Wednesday to win a standby loan accord from the International Monetary Fund.
Creditors holding at least 66 per cent of the debt need to drop their
original requirement for IMF support if the deal is to go ahead. Mr William
Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank and chairman of the bank advisory
committee, said he was 'confident we will get the waivers by the end of next
week'. Banks on the advisory committee, which account for about a third of
the debt, have already backed the waiver and asked other creditors to agree
by March 24.
Bankers were rushing to complete various technical details in time for a
notification deadline due to expire last night. The restructuring is due to
go ahead on April 15 and would make Brazil the last large Latin American
country to complete a Brady-type debt deal.
Brazil, the developing world's largest debtor nation, is also thought to
have made arrangements to secure up to Dollars 2.8bn in US Treasury zero
coupon bonds as a guarantee for the first part of the restructuring.
The guarantee was originally to have been provided by the US Treasury, but
only if the IMF had provided a standby facility. Brazil says it has
'executed arrangements' to have the collateral in place when it is needed.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Washington's ticket avoids showdown / Plotting a route
through challenging turbulence between American and foreign air carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US government has averted a showdown with two of its main European
allies on aviation policy by renewing British Airways' ticket code-sharing
rights with USAir and approving a similar agreement between Lufthansa of
Germany and United Airlines,
But the decisions, taken after a week of hectic meetings in Washington, have
failed to resolve the underlying tensions in aviation relations between the
US and other industrialised countries.
As a reminder of the continuing difficulties and tensions in international
aviation, Japan yesterday said it would shorten the licence period for US
airlines on trans-Pacific routes to Japan from one year to six months, in
retaliation for a US decision to postpone approval for a Japan Airlines
service to Honolulu.
The US is also in dispute with Australia over airline services and continues
to have no bilateral air service agreement with France, following the French
government's earlier decision to renounce its aviation pact with the US.
South-east Asian carriers have also warned the US they are considering
formation of their own airline bloc to protect their aviation interests,
unless they can secure similar rights to US airlines both in the
Asia-Pacific regional market and the US domestic market.
'It seems to be the US against the rest', one US airline executive said.
The heightened tensions between the US and other industrialised countries
are in large part the result of a new breed of big US carriers seeking to
exploit far more vigorously the historical aviation rights which the US had
secured, in both the European and Asian markets, after the second world war.
These traditional rights had been held by the now defunct Pan American
Airlines and TWA. These airlines have now been superseded by American
Airlines, United and Delta Airlines, which have been aggressively seeking to
expand their international reach, using existing US international aviation
traffic rights as well as pressing their government to negotiate even
greater access to foreign markets.
In an increasingly global and liberalised airline market, both European and
Asian flag carriers have in return asked for more access to the US market.
The most significant dispute, however, has involved the bilateral aviation
relations between the US and the UK, whose trans-Atlantic routes are the
busiest in the world.
The ultimate outcome of the protracted negotiations between Washington and
London is seen as likely to set a pattern for other aviation agreements with
the US, which now accounts for about 40 per cent of the western air travel
market.
Both the US and the UK are committed to airline liberalisation. But, while
advocating 'open skies' and open trade relations, the governments of both
countries have had to contend with the conflicting interests of their
respective airlines and have been reluctant to make any significant
concessions to break the current deadlock.
The issue has been further complicated by the two countries' different
interpretations of what 'open skies' entails. Simply put, the US has offered
the UK 'open skies' across the Atlantic but not in its domestic market. The
UK, in turn, has offered the US more access into the UK market but not at
Heathrow in London, the world's busiest international airport.
In return for allowing United Airlines and American Airlines to replace Pan
American and TWA at Heathrow in 1991, the UK secured code-sharing rights for
British carriers in the US. BA subsequently exercised these rights after
forging a partnership with USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier, in which it
invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) via a 24 per cent stake.
The US airlines claimed that this was, in the words of American, 'a lousy
deal' for them in that it gave BA access to their market without similar
benefits for US carriers at Heathrow.
The UK has insisted, though, that any additional access for US carriers to
Heathrow would depend on the US granting more opportunities for UK airlines
in the US market, either by allowing them to acquire bigger stakes in US
carriers or by possibilities to serve additional US domestic destinations.
At the end of the day, the US administration decided to avoid an all-out
confrontation by renewing, on Thursday night, BA's existing code-sharing
rights for a full year, while expressing extreme disappointment with the
lack of progress in the negotiations.
The two countries last year had hoped to reach a broad agreement on
liberalisation by the end of April 1994. It seems highly unlikely that they
will meet this target. Both sides yesterday said they had no plans to resume
talks.

FT  19 MAR 94 / US Senate to hold Whitewater hearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate has voted unanimously to hold hearings on the Whitewater
affair, but has left to future negotiation their date and the ground they
will cover.
The compromise, agreed on Thursday night, represents qualified victories for
Republicans who have been demanding hearings and Democrats who have resisted
them.
No grants of immunity from prosecution will be given to those summoned to be
questioned.
President Bill Clinton seemed resigned to the fact that there would be a
congressional forum but again said it would be found not to be worth the
expense.
The general White House mood is more upbeat than it was 10 days ago, with
the president and Mr Hillary Clinton embarked on a heavy round of public
appearances to push the administration's domestic agenda. One senior
official said of Whitewater: 'We've moved from crisis management to problem
management.'
The Senate resolution also gives Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel,
time to conduct his inquiry into whether government officials have conspired
to obstruct federal investigations of the failed Arkansas savings and loan
entity at the centre of the first family's land and financial dealings, in
their home state in the 1980s.
Still unresolved by the Senate action are possible hearings by the House
banking committee, tentatively scheduled for sometime late next week.
Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, senior Republican on the committee, continues
to insist that they be held, but Mr Fiske is unhappy with them and the
Democratic leaders in the House are pressing for a delay.
Mr Fiske's federal grand jury took testimony on Thursday from two senior
White House members, Mr Bernard Nussbaum, former legal counsel, and Mr
Harold Ickes, the presidential counsellor mainly involved with healthcare.
An additional subpoena has been served on Mr George Stephanopoulos, a close
adviser to the president. This brings to 11 the number of White House and
Treasury officials called to testify before the grand jury.
Meanwhile, the New York Times yesterday said that Mrs Clinton had made as
much as Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 66,934) on the commodities market in
1978-1979, thus transforming the Clinton family finances.
She was advised in her investments, according to the article, by Mr James
Blair, a prominent Arkansas lawyer and an investor long close to the
Clintons. Mr Blair's principal legal client was Tyson's Food, the chicken
producer and big Arkansas company.
The president said yesterday that his wife's investment was 'perfectly
independent and perfectly legal', and that taxes had been paid on the money
made. The rest of the article, he added, was 'innuendo, unsupported
allegation.'
Mr Blair responded by saying it was ridiculous for the Clintons to have to
'weed their friends out and say they can only have friends who are sweeping
the streets.'

FT  19 MAR 94 / Jump in foreign chip sales to Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market jumped to 20.7 per
cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, the highest figure since the US began
monitoring the share in 1986.
The increase has averted a further rise in trade friction between the US and
Japan.
The closely-watched data are the primary measure used by the US to determine
Japan's compliance with a bilateral trade agreement, in which Japan
'recognised the expectations of the US semiconductor industry that foreign
market share should rise to at least 20 per cent by the end of 1992.'
The fourth-quarter figure represents an increase of 1.6 per cent over the
previous quarter, the largest jump since the governments began compiling
market share data.
'We are pleased to see an increase in foreign market share for the fourth
quarter,' said Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. 'However, we
remain concerned that US and other foreign semiconductor suppliers are not
achieving improved access to the Japanese market on a sustained basis.'
In 1992, US officials noted, the fourth-quarter figure hit a similar high
point of 20.2 per cent, only to decline sharply over the next three
quarters.
'This year, we sincerely hope that Japan will not become complacent with the
fourth quarter's positive results, only to have the market access figure
slide backwards in subsequent quarters,' said Mr Andrew Procassini,
president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group
representing US chipmakers.
'It is essential that effective steps be taken now by the Japanese
government and industry to ensure that gradual and steady improvements in
foreign market share continue throughout the duration of the arrangement,'
which ends in 1996, said Mr Kantor.
Sales of foreign-made semiconductors to Japan rose to Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds
3bn) in 1993, up from Dollars 3.3bn in 1992, according to the Electronic
Industries Association of Japan. The trade group noted that this represents
the seventh year that foreign sales have increased.
Almost 90 per cent of foreign sales to Japan come from the US.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Six airlines agree not to use 'price-fixing' system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Six US airlines have agreed not to use a computerised fare information
system to communicate proposed fare changes, following federal government
allegations that the system amounted to a price-fixing ring.
The US Justice Department had accused the carriers - American Airlines,
Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Trans World
Airlines and Alaska Airlines - of using the system to exchange coded
messages about planned fare changes.
The department said the system, run by the industry-owned Airline Tariff
Pulishing Company, amounted to an 'electronic smoke-filled room' used by
airlines to float fare changes, receive counter-proposals, and reach
consensus on the amount and timing of price cuts or increases.
The department's anti-trust suit alleged that one airline might signal its
intention to reduce fares on one of its competitor's most lucrative routes,
only to receive a threat from the competitor to cut fares on the first
airline's most profitable routes. Often, the result was a decision to
abandon the fare cuts or reach an accommodation, the department said.
The airlines said the continuing fare war in the US domestic market showed
the allegations were baseless, and travel agents said the absence of
information on planned fare changes would make it more difficult for people
to plan travel.
The airlines stopped the practice when the suit was filed more than a year
ago, and agreed not to re-start.

FT  19 MAR 94 / US, Germany clinch air deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany and the US signed an agreement on air transport yesterday, paving
the way for closer co-operation by Lufthansa, the German national carrier,
and United Airlines.
The negotiations, which involved Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Bill
Clinton, will lead to ticket code-sharing by the two airlines and give their
clients reciprocal rights to incentive packages, such as frequent-flyer
programmes.
The deal came after a separate US decision on Thursday night to extend for a
year a similar agreement between British Airways and USAir.
A memorandum of understanding, signed by Mr Matthias Wissmann, German
transport minister, and Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary, also
leaves the possibility of other US airlines gaining limited access to the
code-sharing arrangements.
Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chief executive, said the deal, allowing the
two airlines to market each other's flights under the same ticketing code,
would come into effect on May 1. It will last four years before leading to a
broader agreement between the two countries.
The deal gives Lufthansa better access to Caribbean and South American
routes, while United can increase flights to eastern Europe and beyond.
Under the code-sharing provisions, passengers will be able to make
connecting flights on both sides of the Atlantic with only one check-in and
will benefit by better connections between the two airlines.
Lufthansa will also have more access to destinations in the US, the west's
largest aviation market. German officials said the deal would correct the
imbalance between US and German carriers which was created by a 1955
post-war agreement. Under that, US carriers captured 76 per cent of traffic
between the two countries.
The officials said the talks had faced 'incredible pressure' from other US
carriers seeking greater access to Germany and trying to block the
United-Lufthansa partnership.
The number of US flights to Germany will be frozen for the next two years
and increase modestly in the next two. The code-sharing is expected to
increase Lufthansa's trans-Atlantic revenues as the carrier prepares for
privatisation.
On Thursday, the company announced lower losses of DM50m (Pounds 19.4m) for
1993, through progress in its restructuring. That is compared with DM297m
for the previous year.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Brussels agitates against American regulatory charges on
foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is to step up pressure on the US to reverse plans to
introduce charges for the regulatory supervision of non-US banks operating
in the US.
A meeting of European finance ministers on Monday will authorise a strongly
worded protest to the US Federal Reserve and the Senate banking committee,
insisting that the new regulations contravene the Gatt agreement, European
Commission officials said yesterday.
The issue is likely to make further difficulty in trade relations as the EU
and US wrangle over their final offers for market access before a Gatt
meeting next month.
Commission officials in Brussels said the proposed audit charges were
'grossly discriminatory' because they would only affect non-US banks. 'The
fact that this is going to the economics ministers' council shows how
seriously we take this,' a commission official said.
The Federal Reserve has so far refrained from indicating how high the
charges would be. However, the development has prompted anger among European
banks and governments, which say that the charges would impose an unfair
burden on European and other banks operating in the US and contravene the
principle of national treatment.
One European diplomat yesterday said: 'In money terms, this might not
necessarily be very much but the principle is extremely important. This is
blatant discrimination against the non-US banks.'
However, one of the three US federal regulatory authorities, the Comptroller
of the Currency, does levy charges on domestic banks.
The proposed new charges emerged as part of the foreign banking supervision
act, which was passed by the US Congress during the Bush administration but
is not yet implemented. The relevant provision states that foreign banks
shall meet the 'cost of any examination' required under the regulatory
framework.
The requirement, aimed at strengthening supervision of foreign banks in the
US, was prompted by the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
This has provoked much unease within the Federal Reserve, already in a
tussle with the Treasury and the Senate banking committee over proposals to
reform the US banking regulatory framework.
With the Senate pressing for the relevant provision to be implemented, the
Federal Reserve has called for public consulation before the new charges are
introduced.

FT  19 MAR 94 / EU biotech market may be worth Dollars 94bn in 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL and DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
The European biotechnology market is expected to grow 15 times, to exceed
Dollars 94bn (Pounds 63bn) by the year 2000 and create up to 2m new jobs,
the management consultancy Ernst &amp; Young said in a survey of the industry,
released at a seminar in Amsterdam.
'This industry has emerged from academic science to become one of Europe's
most promising industries,' the study said, quoting a European Union
advisory group's estimates.
The group, formed in 1989, puts the current European market for
biotechnology-derived products at Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.8bn), rising to Ecu83bn
by the end of the century.
Biotechnology companies are expected to raise around Pounds 1bn through
initial public offerings on the London Stock Exchange over the next couple
of years. This would allow early investors, such as venture capital
companies, to cash in their investments and plough them back into the
industry to fund new starts.
While US companies have found it increasingly difficult in recent months to
raise money in stock market flotations, the London Stock Exchange has
already attracted more than Pounds 200m in initial public offerings from
biotechnology companies since June 1993, when it altered its 'profits track
record' rules on profitability for young, emerging pharmaceutical and
diagnostic companies.
The changes have made London - the first exchange in Europe to adapt its
rules to the special needs of fledgling biotechnology companies - an
alternative to the US Nasdaq exchange used by some European biotechnology
companies.
So far, 11 biotechnology companies have found their way to the London
exchange, and brokers expect about 20 such companies to be listed within the
next 12 months, according to Ernst &amp; Young.
The survey also found that the pace of alliances in the European
biotechnology sector is set to pick up sharply, partly reflecting a new
interest among large pharmaceutical companies in harnessing the technologies
developed by smaller, younger companies.
The survey findings were presented this week at a conference in Amsterdam
organised by Ernst &amp; Young and Atlas Ventures, the venture capital group, to
promote partnerships within European biotechnology.
At the event, 35 biotechnology companies presented themselves to an audience
of 150 potential partners, including not only investors but also
representatives from pharmaceutical companies.
Mr Steven Burrill, an adviser to Ernst &amp; Young, said that, although European
biotechnology companies still lagged behind their US counterparts in finding
finance, they enjoy some advantages, one being the quicker product approval
by European regulators.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Ron and Ollie's big falling-out: Jurek Martin tells how two
American heroes found feet of clay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once they were inseparable, two conservatives locked together in a common
cause. The young man would walk through walls and around the law for his
boss, who returned the compliment by describing his acolyte as 'a hero.'
This relationship is now in tatters.
Inserting himself with vigour into the Virginia contest for a US senate
seat, the most widely watched political race of the year, former President
Ronald Reagan has rounded on former Lt-Col Oliver North and, in effect,
called him a liar.
Mr Reagan's intervention came as a letter solicited by an old friend, former
Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada, and was promptly released by the campaign of
Mr North's rival for the Republican nomination, Mr James Miller, budget
director in the Reagan White House.
'I do have to admit,' Mr Reagan wrote, 'that I am getting pretty steamed
about statements coming from Oliver North. I never instructed him or anyone
in my administration to mislead Congress on Iran-Contra matters or anything
else. And I certainly didn't know anything about the Iran-Contra diversion
 . and the private meetings he said he'd had with me just didn't happen.'
Mr North, whose own conspiracies, freelance or not, consumed the US in Mr
Reagan's second term, immediately saw another conspiracy. Citing threats to
his life by Abu Nidal, the terrorist, as evidence of his loyalty, Mr North's
faxed reply said the former president had been 'seriously and intentionally
misinformed' about his service on the national security council, and
meetings of the two did take place.
Mr North's candidacy in Virginia is ferociously controversial and has been
stoutly opposed by Senator John Warner, a Republican not up for re-election
this year. If Mr North beats Mr Miller, as he has been favoured to do, he
will face Senator Chuck Robb, the incumbent Democrat.
Mr Robb is no stranger to recent controversy. He is a former Marine whose
wife is the daughter of the late President Lyndon Johnson. The senator
recently admitted, in a pastoral constituency letter, to conduct unbecoming
in a married man, namely extra-marital affairs.
Mr North, a self-appointed symbol of rectitude, loved this confession. His
fondness for Mr Reagan's intervention is much less apparent.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Jump in foreign chip sales to Japan
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market jumped to 20.7 per
cent in the fourth quarter of 1993, the highest figure since the US began
monitoring the share in 1986.
The increase has averted a further rise in trade friction between the US and
Japan.
The closely-watched data are the primary measure used by the US to determine
Japan's compliance with a bilateral trade agreement, in which Japan
'recognised the expectations of the US semiconductor industry that foreign
market share should rise to at least 20 per cent by the end of 1992.'
The fourth-quarter figure represents an increase of 1.6 per cent over the

market share data.
'We are pleased to see an increase in foreign market share for the fourth
quarter,' said Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. 'However, we
remain concerned that US and other foreign semiconductor suppliers are not
achieving improved access to the Japanese market on a sustained basis.'
In 1992, US officials noted, the fourth-quarter figure hit a similar high
point of 20.2 per cent, only to decline sharply over the next three
quarters.
'This year, we sincerely hope that Japan will not become complacent with the
fourth quarter's positive results, only to have the market access figure
slide backwards in subsequent quarters,' said Mr Andrew Procassini,
president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group
representing US chipmakers.
'It is essential that effective steps be taken now by the Japanese
government and industry to ensure that gradual and steady improvements in
foreign market share continue throughout the duration of the arrangement,'
which ends in 1996, said Mr Kantor.
Japanese industry officials, said the fourth-quarter market share increase
and the large increase in foreign semiconductor sales in Japan over the past
year 'are among the many indicators of the wider access enjoyed by foreign
suppliers'.
Sales of foreign-made semiconductors to Japan rose to Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds
3bn) in 1993, up from Dollars 3.3bn in 1992, according to the Electronic
Industries Association of Japan. The trade group noted that this represents
the seventh year that foreign sales have increased. Almost 90 per cent of
foreign sales to Japan come from the US.
The EIAJ also noted that foreign market share stands at 22.1 per cent when
the sales of 'captive manufacturers', who make chips for their own use, were
included. The US does not recognise this figure.
Government and industry officials from the US and Japan are expected to
consider, in Hawaii next week, whether Japan is doing enough to comply with
the semiconductor agreement.
Emergency consultations in January, following the announcement of a decline
in market share in the third quarter, ended without agreement on any
additional actions by Japan.
'Japanese government and industry should come forward, beginning (at) next
week's trade consultations, with a plan to prevent a repeat of the foreign
share declines that characterised most of 1993, and to assure the 'steady
progress' required by the 1991 US-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement,' said
Mr Procassini.
'We believe the focus should be on the mutual reliance and complementary
relationships that have grown between Japanese semiconductor users and
foreign suppliers,' said Mr Hidekiko Yoshida, senior executive
vice-president of Toshiba and chairman of the EIAJ's committee to promote
purchase of foreign semiconductors.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Washington's new ticket avoids showdown / Plotting a route
through what is still challenging turbulence between American and foreign
air carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US government has averted a showdown with two of its main European
allies on aviation policy by renewing British Airways' ticket code-sharing
rights with USAir and approving a similar agreement between Lufthansa of
Germany and United Airlines,
But the decisions, taken after a week of hectic meetings in Washington, have
failed to resolve the underlying tensions in aviation relations between the
US and other industrialised countries.
As a reminder of the continuing difficulties and tensions in international
aviation, Japan yesterday said it would shorten the licence period for US
airlines on trans-Pacific routes to Japan from one year to six months, in
retaliation for a US decision to postpone approval for a Japan Airlines
service to Honolulu.
The US is also in dispute with Australia over airline services and continues
to have no bilateral air service agreement with France, following the French
government's earlier decision to renounce its aviation pact with the US.
South-east Asian carriers have also warned the US they are considering
formation of their own airline bloc to protect their aviation interests,
unless they can secure similar rights to US airlines both in the
Asia-Pacific regional market and the US domestic market.
Mr Cheong Choong Kong, chairman of the Orient Airlines Association and
managing director of Singapore Airlines, recently called for fairer
conditions in US aviation relations with Asia, especially since the Asian
market was expected to overtake the domestic US market in size by the end of
the century.
'It seems to be the US against the rest', one US airline executive said.
The heightened tensions between the US and other industrialised countries
are in large part the result of a new breed of big US carriers seeking to
exploit far more vigorously the historical aviation rights which the US had
secured, in both the European and Asian markets, after the second world war.
These traditional rights had been held by the now defunct Pan American
Airlines and TWA. These airlines have now been superseded by American
Airlines, United and Delta Airlines, which have been aggressively seeking to
expand their international reach, using existing US international aviation
traffic rights as well as pressing their government to negotiate even
greater access to foreign markets.
In an increasingly global and liberalised airline market, both European and
Asian flag carriers have in return asked for more access to the US market.
The most significant dispute, however, has involved the bilateral aviation
relations between the US and the UK, whose trans-Atlantic routes are the
busiest in the world.
The ultimate outcome of the protracted negotiations between Washington and
London is seen as likely to set a pattern for other aviation agreements with
the US, which now accounts for about 40 per cent of the western air travel
market.
Both the US and the UK are committed to airline liberalisation. But, while
advocating 'open skies' and open trade relations, the governments of both
countries have had to contend with the conflicting interests of their
respective airlines and have been reluctant to make any significant
concessions to break the current deadlock.
The issue has been further complicated by the two countries' different
interpretations of what 'open skies' entails. Simply put, the US has offered
the UK 'open skies' across the Atlantic but not in its domestic market. The
UK, in turn, has offered the US more access into the UK market but not at
Heathrow in London, the world's busiest international airport.
In return for allowing United Airlines and American Airlines to replace Pan
American and TWA at Heathrow in 1991, the UK secured code-sharing rights for
British carriers in the US. BA subsequently exercised these rights after
forging a partnership with USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier, in which it
invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) via a 24 per cent stake.
The US airlines claimed that this was, in the words of American, 'a lousy
deal' for them in that it gave BA access to their market without similar
benefits for US carriers at Heathrow.
The UK has insisted, though, that any additional access for US carriers to
Heathrow would depend on the US granting more opportunities for UK airlines
in the US market, either by allowing them to acquire bigger stakes in US
carriers or by possibilities to serve additional US domestic destinations.
Some US airlines then pressed Washington to renounce the existing aviation
agreement with the UK and withdraw BA's code-sharing rights with USAir.
At the end of the day, the US administration decided to avoid an all-out
confrontation by renewing, on Thursday night, BA's existing code-sharing
rights for a full year, while expressing extreme disappointment with the
lack of progress in the negotiations.
The two countries last year had hoped to reach a broad agreement on
liberalisation by the end of April 1994. It seems highly unlikely that they
will meet this target. Both sides yesterday said they had no plans to resume
talks.
In their absence, the stand-off continues, with the rest of the air
transport industry anxiously watching.
The ultimate stakes are significant. An agreement would pave the way for
even broader liberalisation in international air transport.
Failure would fuel all the old protectionist instincts of the airline
industry.

Denmark, western Europe's third-biggest oil and gas producer, said yesterday
it had known reserves to sustain current oil production levels for 20 years
and gas production for 45 years. The Danish Energy Board said it expected
Denmark to achieve balance in its energy trade in 1997, meaning that exports
of oil and gas would be worth as much as imports of coal. 'The continued
high oil and gas production will mean that Denmark's net energy expenditure
will fall from DKr2.5bn in 1993 to a balance or a small surplus in 1997,'
the board said. The overall self-sufficiency level for both oil and gas was
expected to reach more than 140 per cent in 1997, it said, up from 120 per
cent in 1993. The surplus, mostly of gas, has been exported to Sweden and
Germany.

Mr Marian Rajczyk, head of Poland's Bank Slaski, has resigned in the wake of
the bank's controversial privatisation earlier this year. His departure
means the bank has a better chance of recovering its valuable broking
licence. The Securities Commission revoked the licence last month after the
bank had been found to have mismanaged the public offer. It failed to
speedily register investors' share certificates except those held by
management and employees. The bank staff were thus able to take advantage of
a price 13.5 higher than the 500,000 zlotys public offer price when the
shares were first listed in January while the 800,000 people who bought
shares were unable to trade them. The commission has indicated to the
finance ministry which holds 30 per cent of the equity and the Dutch ING
bank which bought a 25.9 per cent stake that a change at the top of the bank
and thorough reform of the broking operation could see the decision
reversed. The Bank Slaski has already sacked a deputy chairman and the head
of the broking operation and the Bank's supervisory board meets next week to
consider Mr Rajczyk's resignation.

Protests against 'clear-cut' logging in British Columbia have led two big UK
paper companies to cancel pulp contracts with MacMillan Bloedel, the
Canadian forest products group. Kimberly-Clark's UK subsidiary has pulled
out of a Dollars 2m deal with MacMillan, while Scott Paper earlier cancelled
a Dollars 5m contract. Both companies have faced threats by Greenpeace to
organise a consumer boycott in protest against MacMillan's logging practices
in the picturesque Clayoquot Sound area of Vancouver Island. Clayoquot Sound
contains one of the biggest remaining old-growth forests in North America.
The British Columbia government has tried to steer a compromise between
environmentalists calling for a total ban on logging in the area, and the
forestry companies which maintain that the trees are essential to the
survival of nearby mills. The unsightly bare patches left by clear-cutting
have given the environmental movement a powerful publicity weapon. MacMillan
maintains however, that Greenpeace has misrepresented its forestry
practices. The company has launched an aggressive advertising campaign in
Canada and Europe to defend itself against the environmentalists' charges.

<TEXT>
French union leaders yesterday dismissed a further bid by the Balladur
government to blunt opposition to its youth wage legislation, as students
demonstrated against the law in the university cities of Toulouse, Nancy,
Lyons, Nantes and Rennes. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, sent union
leaders a draft of a new decree on the wage and training measures, but the
unions said it did little more than dress up in legal language inadequate
concessions that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur had made earlier. Mr
Balladur promised that young people holding diplomas would be paid no less
than the country's FFr5,866 (Pounds 672) a month minimum wage, and no less
than 80 per cent of sectoral wage agreements. But the unions are still angry
that unqualified workers could be paid only 80 per cent of the minimum wage,
despite Mr Giraud's claim that such workers would only be working 80 per
cent of the time with the remaining hours devoted to their training. The
youth wage row comes at an awkward time for Mr Balladur who faces the first
test of his popularity in Sunday's first round of voting to elect more than
2,000 local councillors around the country.

<TEXT>
The UN Security Council agreed yesterday that sanctions against Iraq must
stay despite Baghdad's improved co-operation on eliminating weapons of mass
destruction. But the accord obscured sharp divisions within the council,
which spent three days in intense discussions on what has hitherto been a
brief and routine 60-day review of the embargo. France, which holds the
council presidency this month, sought agreement on a formal statement
praising Iraq for its greater co-operation. Russia and China supported this
but both the US and Britain objected saying Iraq was still far short of full
compliance with the cease-fire terms. Diplomats said the French initiative
was prompted by fears that even if the Iraqis met these terms, Washington
would block lifting sanctions by raising new issues, such as human rights
violations. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN commission charged with destroying
Iraq's nuclear, chemical and heavy weapons capability, must report full
compliance before sanctions can be lifted. He expects to do so before the
end of the year.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Reluctant challenger runs Berlusconi close: The Forza Italia
leader may come to an unexpected halt in central Rome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One constituency above all others has come under the spotlight in the
Italian election campaign.
This is a seat in the historic centre of Rome where media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi is staking his prestige as an aspiring politician. It is a three
cornered fight between the left, right and centre and could produce a
surprise upset.
The Milanese owner of the Fininvest media empire is not on home territory;
and he would have been far safer in one of the middle class suburbs where
his Forza Italia movement has a sympathetic audience.
In central Rome his electorate mainly consists of small traders and
shopkeepers profoundly mistrustful of political promises. The voters also
include the wealthier members of the professions and the Roman aristocracy:
the former mistrust Mr Berlusconi, the latter feel more at home with the
neo-fascist MSI.
Mr Berlusconi's two main opponents are Prof Luigi Spaventa, the budget
minister, who is backed by the Progressive Alliance of eight left parties,
and Mr Alberto Michelini, a former Christian Democrat deputy, standing for
the centrist alliance, Italian Pact.
'I didn't want to run for parliament but as a Roman I felt I had to meet
this challenge from Berlusconi standing in the heart of Rome,' says Prof
Spaventa. For a reluctant candidate with little to lose, he has proved
something of star, deploying a mordant wit peppered with anglicisms. Even
Forza Italia supporters reckon he is running Mr Berlusconi close.
Both candidates could not be more different. Prof Spaventa, a fellow of All
Soul's, Oxford, is part of Italy's academic elite and an unashamed
intellectual. He is urbane and self-deprecating. Long sympathetic to the old
Italian Communist Party, he nevertheless kept his distance and entered the
Ciampi government as a technocrat minister. Now he is standing as a
candidate for the small left-wing Democratic Alliance, one of the eight
groupings in the Progressive Alliance led by the former communist Party of
the Democratic Left (PDS).
In contrast, Mr Berlusconi is the epitome of a confident self-made man. He
has no intellectual pretensions but is proud of having brought popular
entertainment to the public through his television empire. Despite his
success, he retains the air of a northern provincial and sticks to
long-standing friends. His ideology is avowedly anti-communist - a liberal
democrat embracing the free market.
Mr Michelini finds himself the man in the middle. He was a Christian
Democrat deputy in the last legislature but left the party last year with
his close friend, Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader. To stand a chance,
he needs the catholic vote which has been split by the break-up of the
Christian Democrats. Though a well-known journalist, Mr Michelini is closely
linked to the conservative catholic movement, Opus Dei, and this may well
limit his appeal to the broad catholic vote.
With a flagging campaign, he was forced to deny this week rumours of a deal
agreeing to stand down in favour of Mr Berlusconi. But he was heard to
complain: 'Berlusconi's got his TV and Spaventa's got the backing of the
communist cadres and their militants.'
Mr Berlusconi is hampered by having to campaign nationally - he has only
devoted three days to Rome so far. Through his carefully orchestrated
television appearances he has made a strong impact; but in Rome he has been
made to look vulnerable by declining a TV debate with Prof Spaventa. Ask any
Rome shopkeeper who would win such a debate and the reply is immediate: 'Il
professore'.
The seat is being fought under the new first-past-the-post system that will
elect 75 per cent of the deputies. The remaining 25 per cent are elected by
proportional representation and majority vote candidates can also stand in
up to three other places.
This is a typically Italian way of offering consolation prizes, and Mr
Berlusconi is standing for a sure proportional seat in the Lazio region.
Nevertheless if he fails in Rome, it would be a damaging blow. On the other
hand if Prof Spaventa wins, he is talked of as a potential prime minister.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Setback for Bildt over EU referendum date
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden is to hold its referendum on joining the European Union on November
13 - assuming the EU resolves its row over voting rights in the enlarged
Union.
Although Finland and Norway have yet to set dates for their referendums, the
Swedish decision almost certainly ensures that the order of voting in the
three Nordic neighbours will be Finland in September, followed by Sweden,
and then Norway, in late November or December. Austria is to vote in June.
With support for EU membership among the Nordic countries strongest in
Finland and weakest in Norway, the east to west sequence has long been
regarded as the best way to win a 'yes' vote in the three nations. Polls in
Sweden and Norway show the yes vote rising if their neighbours decide to
join.
But yesterday's decision was a blow to Mr Carl Bildt, the conservative prime
minister, who wanted to hold the referendum in June, or at the latest on
general election day in September.
He was forced to postpone the date by the opposition Social Democrats, the
country's biggest political party, which it is widely acknowledged holds the
key to winning a 'yes' vote.
The dilemma for Mr Bildt is that if he wins the general election, the Social
Democrats are unlikely to campaign enthusiastically for joining the EU,
which many of its members oppose.
In Norway yesterday, opinion polls taken after agreement on accession terms
this week showed conflicting results. A Gallup poll showed opposition rising
to 49 per cent, with support slipping to 28 per cent.
But a poll in the newspaper Dagbladet showed support moving up sharply to 41
per cent, with opposition falling three percentage points to 49 per cent.

<TEXT>
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, yesterday confirmed that
Russia would join the US-inspired 'Partnership for Peace' programme designed
to draw former Communist states into a closer relationship with Nato.
Russia would no longer insist on special conditions for membership, he said.
Under the programme, states are invited to sign an identical framework
agreement, but they can then write their own menu for co-operation
programmes with Nato. Russia said it would draw up its menu this month.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary in Moscow for talks with his opposite
number General Pavel Grachev, said: 'This would be a major event for Nato
 .Russia is a great power, a nuclear power. They will play a special role in
the Partnership.'
The Russian decision - if fulfilled - represents an important move by the
Chernomyrdin government towards the west, in the face of strong criticism of
the Partnership by several influential figures.
Mr Andranik Migranyan, an adviser to President Yeltsin, this week said the
Partnership was designed to 'isolate' Russia.
The defence and foreign ministries believe Russia would be better in than
out, partly because its former allies in central and eastern Europe are
enthusiastically joining and Russia still wishes to exert some regional
influence. Officials also believe that Russia will gain access to a wider
arms markets within the Nato sphere of influence.
But there remain strong areas of doubt among even those politicians who
favour joining the Partnership. Mr Andrei Kokoshin, the deputy defence
minister and the top civilian in the defence establishment, wrote in the New
York Times yesterday that Russia would never be a 'younger brother'.
Mr Perry insisted that the rules had fundamentally changed, and that
agreements between Russia and the west were not a 'zero sum game' in which
one side lost where the other won. He said he favoured increased contact
with other states including Ukraine, but said 'this would not be as a buffer
to Russia'.
A vigorous lobby in the US, led by Dr Henry Kissinger and Mr Zbigniew
Brzezinski, has begun criticising the Clinton administration's policy
towards Russia as over-accommodating - especially in withholding Nato
membership from the central European states which want it.
The US administration has been forced to defend its position on Russia in
the face of these attacks, stressing that the Partnership is a flexible one,
which could open its doors to full membership for central European countries
if Russia was felt to be a threat to their security. In a speech made before
his trip, Mr Perry dwelt on the possible threat of a nationalist Russia -
something US administration officials have not done until the last month or
two.
Mr Perry said yesterday that the Partnership 'gave no guarantee to anyone
that they would become members of Nato' and that, even if states were to
become members, it would not be 'in the near term'. However, the policy
remains one of seeking to engage Russia in a range of co-operative
activities in the defence field - with joint manoeuvres between Russian and
US infantry units in Russia scheduled for this summer.
Mr Perry said western-Russian co-operation on Bosnia had produced
significant successes, both in stopping the shelling of Sarajevo and in
opening Tuzla airport. However, he added: 'Now we are getting into a more
complex process - we have a framework agreement between the Croats and the
Moslems, but we must get Serb participation as well.' He said that Mr Vitaly
Churkin, the Russian special envoy to Bosnia and Mr Charles Redman, his US
counterpart, were working on getting a 'co-operative agreement' between all
parties.
A range of agreements were signed, including Dollars 30m of US aid for the
safe destruction of chemical weapons; Dollars 20m seed capital for
US-Russian joint ventures in the field of military conversion; and Dollars
20m to build homes for demobilised officers.

<TEXT>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has signed an order to start up
Chernobyl reactor number 2, widely regarded as unsafe and closed since a
devastating fire in 1991, according to environmental activists.
Ukraine is under enormous pressure to find new energy sources to reduce
reliance on its main energy supplier, Russia. Relations with its neighbour
have been difficult since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
The republic has a Dollars 3.2bn oil and gas debt to Russia. It must settle
Dollars 900m of this debt by April 10 or Russian gas supplies will be cut
off. A partial cut-off this month has led to factories being ordered to
halve energy consumption. There are fears there will not be enough energy
for spring planting this year.
According to Greenpeace, in Kiev, reactor number 2 will be restarted in 1995
under a decree signed on February 23. Two other reactors at Chernobyl remain
in operation, although reactor number 4, where the infamous Chernobyl
explosion took place in 1986, remains shut down, encased in a concrete
shell.
Last October, the Ukrainian parliament passed a controversial resolution to
continue energy production at the power plant, reversing its 1991 decision
to shut it down by the end of last year. Administration officials refused to
confirm or deny the existence of the February 23 order, but did say that its
existence was 'possible'.
Western experts and Ukrainian scientists have criticised the Soviet design
of the Chernobyl-style RBMK reactors and have urged that they be scrapped
immediately. The notorious graphite-core RBMKs are liable to speed up
nuclear reaction and get hotter as water intended for cooling turns to
steam.
In addition, Ukraine's nuclear industry, which supplies 40 per cent of the
country's electricity, has suffered recurring technical problems and safety
violations. Automatic safety systems are periodically switched off to boost
power production. Just yesterday, a fire broke out at Ukraine's Khmeltnisky
nuclear power station and last week, there was a fire at the Zaporizha
station.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Race is on to beat deadline for VAT on domestic fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British householders are paying electricity and gas bills in advance - in
one case, for 21 years - as they race to beat the deadline to avoid paying
value added tax on domestic fuel.
By last night, the UK's 15 suppliers of electricity to households had
received more than 240,000 payments and British Gas had taken in 66,000.
Numbers paying in advance of April 1, when VAT is imposed, have more than
doubled in the past week and by last night total receipts had reached Pounds
150m. That figure is expected to be dwarfed by next Friday - the day by
which most companies say they need to receive cheques in order to clear them
in time.
The VAT rate on domestic fuel will be 8 per cent for the first year, before
rising to 17.5 per cent in April 1995.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will next week ask Offer and Ofgas, the
electricity and gas industry watchdogs, what they intend to do about the
'windfall cash' being built up by domestic fuel suppliers.
The companies, many of which are cash-rich after a better than expected
performance since privatisation, will earn considerable amounts of interest
on the pre-payments.
They say they have not encouraged pre-payment and that they have had to
spend money to cover costs of customers paying in advance. Eastern
Electricity, based in Ipswich, says it will need to take in between Pounds
25m and Pounds 30m to generate enough interest to cover extra staffing,
telephone and computer costs. It has already received close to that amount.
Most power and gas consumers, who have elected to pay in advance, have
forwarded the equivalent of between one and two years' bills.
But Manweb, based in Chester, says one customer has paid the equivalent of
21 years' bills and Seeboard, in Hove, says another has paid a sum equal to
18 years' usage. East Midlands says it has received a cheque for Pounds
7,500, although it does not specify how long this may cover.
The average annual household electricity power bill is about Pounds 300. The
gas bill of an average three-bedroomed house with gas central heating is
about Pounds 380.
British Gas has seen a north-south divide. In the North Thames region, which
takes in central London, 14,000 customers have made some form of
pre-payment. This compares with just over 3,500 customers pre-paying in
British Gas's north west region, its largest, which encompasses Manchester
and Liverpool.
Among individual electricity companies with high receipts are Bristol-based
Sweb with 40,000 paying Pounds 18m and Manweb, where 38,000 have paid Pounds
14.5m.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Clinton talks raise concern on rates: Bond prices fall
sharply after Fed chief attends White House meeting on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation mounted in financial markets yesterday that US interest rates
were set for a further rise as President Bill Clinton summoned Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to the White House for talks on US
economic policy.
Government bond prices in both the US and Europe fell sharply following news
of the meeting, despite a White House denial that interest rates had been
discussed.
The meeting was called at short notice - Mr Greenspan had to cancel a
planned speech at a Dallas conference - and came just ahead of Tuesday's
meeting of the Fed's open market committee, which sets interest rates.
The Fed is thought to believe that further rate rises are needed to cool
economic growth, but the White House sees little risk of higher inflation.
It insisted that yesterday's meeting was 'routine' and Mr Gene Sperling, a
senior White House aide, said Mr Clinton had sought Mr Greenspan's 'analysis
of the economic fundamentals'. He said no messages on interest rates had
been given or received.
Many Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to raise rates either immediately
after next week's meeting or in the next few weeks. The Fed may raise the
federal funds rate - the cost of overnight money to banks - by a quarter of
a point to 3.5 per cent.
Some economists believe Mr Greenspan will opt to send a stronger signal by
also raising the discount rate, at present 3 per cent, by half a point.
The Fed raised the fed funds rate by a quarter point to 3.25 per cent on
February 4 - the first increase in short rates for five years. US long bond
yields have risen steeply in recent weeks to nearly 7 per cent on the
assumption that the February 4 move was the first in a series of
tightenings. Although the White House supported the Fed's move in February,
it sees little immediate reason for further action.
US markets at first reacted fairly calmly to yesterday's meeting, appearing
to accept that Mr Clinton had not used it to browbeat Mr Greenspan over
rates. However, by the close of trading the 30-year Treasury Bond was more
than a full point down, pushing the yield to 6.92 per cent.
Broad-based share indices were subdued, although the Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed up 30.51 at 3,895.65 in a late burst influenced by technical
factors.
European bond markets had earlier fallen sharply as reports of the meeting
intensified fears that US short-term rates were set to rise again. The UK
government bond market was hit, but picked up on the news of a floating-rate
gilt auction. German and Italian bonds also fared badly.
In equities, London's FT-SE 100 rallied in the late afternoon to close 37.6
down at 3,218.1. Falls on continental European bourses averaged just over 1
per cent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index had earlier dropped 4.1 per cent.
Any further tightening of monetary policy would be condemned on Capitol
Hill. Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House of Representatives banking
committee, said the Fed's monetary policy was 'a true abomination'. The Fed
was fighting a non-existent inflationary threat and might throw millions of
Americans out of work, he said.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Building societies face sharp squeeze on funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's personal savers last month continued to desert building societies
in search of better returns on their money. The net outflow of Pounds 404m
was the highest for 7 1/2 years.
Strong competition for retail savings - from unit trusts and National
Savings products in particular - led to the fourth consecutive monthly
outflow, according to figures released by the Building Societies Association
yesterday.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at stockbroker UBS, said
the pressures on societies 'rule out any prospect of a mortgage rate
reduction in the foreseeable future'.
Evidence of the continuing scale of withdrawals coincides with signs that
societies are recovering in terms of mortgage lending. Net new mortgage
commitments rose from Pounds 1.83bn in January to Pounds 2.93bn in February,
the highest level since July 1993.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
said last month's savings figures reflected not just fierce competition for
funds but 'distortions caused by the payment of the second instalment on the
BT3 share issue'.
Pressure on societies' retail funding has intensified with the launch of the
pensioners' guaranteed income bond. National Savings said last week the bond
had attracted Pounds 480m in February. It pays an annual fixed rate of 7 per
cent gross for five years, and has been bought by nearly 90,000 people.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the UK's
sixth largest society, said societies did not need to attract new savings in
order to meet mortgage demand. Net advances of principal in 1993 totalled
only Pounds 9.43bn, compared with Pounds 24.09bn in 1990.
Societies are hoping that before the end of the year the limits on wholesale
funds they can raise will be relaxed, but if mortgage demand picks up more
sharply and they have difficulty attracting retail funds, they have the
option of increasing the rates they offer on savings and the charge on
mortgages.
Mr Longhurst said the intense competition among lenders for new mortgages
meant across-the-board rate reductions were unlikely.
The previous largest monthly outflow was in September 1986 when savers
withdrew money for the TSB Group flotation.

<TEXT>
The Czech government will pay Kcs1bn (Pounds 22.5m) to an estimated 10,000
victims of Nazi persecution during the second world war. However, the
compensation will apply only to those who suffered in concentration camps
and prisons, not to those uprooted and subjected to forced labour. The
government continues seeking compensation from Germany. Six Turkish MPs,
representing radical Kurdish groups, were charged yesterday and could face
the death penalty if convicted for offences against the unity of the state.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, said the MPs were surrounded by a
'cloud of terrorism' which linked them to the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
party.
The Slovak parliament yesterday called general elections in the autumn
following the ousting the Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in a no-confidence
vote. The vote for new elections on September 30 and October 1, a year and
half ahead of schedule, was unexpectedly unanimous after Mr Meciar dropped
his call for a June poll. On Wednesday an interim broad coalition government
headed by Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik was installed.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ahold overcomes US downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ahold, the Dutch food retailer which has built up a large presence in the
eastern US, posted a 12.5 per cent increase in 1993 net profit, with
improved results in the Netherlands and acquisitions in Portugal
compensating for a slight fall in earnings in the US.
Net profit rose to Fl 343.1m (Dollars 180.6m) from Fl 305m in 1992. The
company, which is preparing to take over its sixth US supermarket chain,
said operating profits in the US should show clear improvement in 1994, and
forecast an increase in full-year net earnings for the group as a whole.
Ahold is to increase its dual-currency dividend to Fl 0.62 and Dollars 0.23
per share, from Fl 0.57 and Dollars 0.22 in 1992.
Turnover in 1993 jumped by 25.5 per cent to Fl 27.1bn, of which about
four-fifths was due to the first-time consolidation of Schuitema, Ahold's
majority-owned Dutch wholesaler, as well as to acquisitions of supermarkets
and hypermarkets in Portugal.
At home in the Netherlands, operating profit soared by 32.6 per cent to Fl
296.7m, with around two-thirds of the rise due to acquisitions. Ahold's
Dutch supermarket chain, Albert Heijn, is the country's leading food
retailer with a 26.9 per cent share of the domestic market, up from 26.6 per
cent in 1992.
In the US, improved results were reported by three of the group's chains -
BI-LO, Giant Food Stores and Tops - but its two others, Edwards and Finast,
posted 'disappointing' results. Overall, US operating profit slipped to
Dollars 161.9m from Dollars 169m.
In February Ahold signed a letter of intent on the acquisition of Red Food
Stores, a Tennessee-based supermarket chain with annual sales of Dollars
585m.
It expects to conclude the transaction by late April.

<TEXT>
Credit du Nord, the retail banking arm of the Paribas financial group,
yesterday announced a sharp increase in net losses to FFr610.9m (Dollars
106m) for last year from FFr253.4m in 1992
Mr Bernard Auberger, chairman, said the bank was aiming to break even this
year but warned that the property market remained difficult.
Increased provisions of FFr1.8bn, up from FFr1.6bn in 1992, reflected the
weak state of the real estate market and largely accounted for the rise in
losses.
Credit du Nord said that its target of breakeven for this year, with profits
in 1995 and 1996, required an increase in its capital base.
Paribas, its parent company, said it would inject FFr618m of new capital and
subscribe, at market rates, to a FFr1.5bn subordinated convertible bond
issue.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Italy's centre parties launch offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's centre parties have launched a desperate offensive to avoid being
squeezed to insignificance by the big coalitions to their left and right in
the March 27 general elections.
Centrist leaders yesterday began a series of measured attacks focusing on
disagreements within the Progressive Alliance led by the former communist
Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the potential cost of media magnate
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's economic programme.
Until now the two principal groupings forming the centrist Italian Pact  -
the Popular party (PPI), formed from the defunct Christian Democrats, and
referendum leader Mario Segni's Pact - have been marginalised.
But in the past few days the centrists have taken heart from a growing
feeling that neither the left nor the right are likely to win an outright
parliamentary majority. They are thus hoping to play a broker's role in
forming the next government. Mr Giorgio La Malfa, the Republican party
leader and part of the Italian Pact, said yesterday: 'In the past few days
the centre has relaunched itself because people have realised there are not
two but three voting options . . . They also have woken up to the fact that
today's alliances on the left and right would be tomorrow's government if
either wins outright.'
He and other centrist politicians also highlighted the contradictions in the
position of the PDS's principal ally, Reconstructed Communism, formed from
the hardline rump of the old Italian Communist party. Reconstructed
Communism supports raising taxes on government bonds and withdrawing from
Nato.
At the same time, Professor Mario Baldassari, the chief economist of the
Pact, said the free market proposals of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia
platform risked a drop of some L45,000bn (Dollars 27bn) in budget revenues.
He said yesterday the programme would be impossible to carry out without
raising the ratio of debt to GDP to well over 125 per cent by 1995.
Mr La Malfa went further and claimed that a government formed solely from
the right - Forza Italia, the populist Lombard League and the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance - risked provoking a confrontation with Italy's trades
unions.
This in turn put at risk the July 1993 tripartite agreement between
employers, trades union and the Ciampi government linking wage increases to
productivity and ending wage indexation.
Coinciding with these criticisms, the former Socialist prime minister, Mr
Giuliano Amato, has been pointing to the need for a broad-based government.
Both Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, and Mr Berlusconi have been
hinting that this was an option they could support.
Playing on the large number of undecided voters and the fear of a polarised
result is the best tactic available to the centre. Nevertheless, the Italian
Pact and its leader, Mr Segni, still risks being the main victim of the new
first-past-the-post voting system that covers 75 per cent of parliamentary
seats. Both the left and right appear to have acquired a critical mass of
support, making it hard at the constituency level for Pact candidates to get
the most votes.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Sinn Fein stresses US peace role in N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, JUREK MARTIN, TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United States could play an instrumental role in helping achieve peace
in Northern Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said in
Belfast yesterday.
In reasonably upbeat remarks, Mr Adams told a St Patrick's Day rally that
the US administration was displaying a readiness to take a fresh approach to
the conflict in spite of sustained British pressure. He was speaking ahead
of yesterday's meeting between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
and US president Bill Clinton .
The Sinn Fein leader said republicans wanted to live in peace and without
coercion among their unionist neighbours. He added Sinn Fein neither
condoned nor encouraged armed actions and stressed that all parties had to
be involved in the current peace process.
Mr Adams's statement received a guarded welcome in Washington, with Mr
Clinton saying he was 'quite encouraged'.
Mr Adams's words came 'at a good time and I hope it has a good effect', the
US president said, standing with Mr Reynolds at the White House.
But he added it was 'premature' to discuss the question of issuing another
US visa to the Sinn Fein leader. 'The issue now, is what is going to be the
role of Sinn Fein in the ongoing peace effort. Will they join? I hope they
will,' Mr Clinton said.
Speaking later at a special St Patrick's day dinner hosted by the president,
Mr Reynolds said that US support for the Northern Ireland peace process
would have 'an important influence' on its outcome.'
In London, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was urged
strongly by Tory backbenchers to step up pressure on the Irish government to
improve security co-operation.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Modest economic recovery forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in investment will offset a slowdown in consumer spending
caused by April's tax rises, leading the UK economy to a modest but
sustainable recovery, says a forecast from the Society of Business
Economists.
The society, representing private-sector financial analysts, says in its
latest assessment that investment will grow 2.3 per cent this year and 3.8
per cent next. Manufacturing investment will rise 8.0 per cent next year.
Mr David Kern, chairman of the society's forecasting group, said it 'expects
the tax increases coming into effect in April to dampen disposable income
quite sharply, but the slowdown in consumer spending will be only modest,
mainly because of a decline in the savings ratio'.
Gross domestic product is predicted to grow 2.5 per cent this year, rising
slightly to 2.6 per cent next year, supported by an improvement in
stockbuilding and net exports.
Mr Kern said: 'Inflationary pressures will remain subdued over the next few
months, but there will be a gradual pick-up towards the end of 1994 and
through 1995, reflecting a gradual tightening in labour market conditions,
as further falls in unemployment cause a slow upturn in labour costs.'
Underlying inflation is forecast to be 2.6 per cent this year and 3.7 per
cent next. A survey from Birmingham Midshires Building Society
shows that consumers are postponing purchases until they are certain how the
tax rises will will affect them. Its consumer confidence index reached a
high in October last year but has fallen sharply.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Vehicle financing deals up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of vans and other light commercial vehicles bought on hire purchase or
other forms of finance leapt by more than half last month, providing a
further sign of returning business confidence, particularly among small
traders.
Finance sales of new light commercial vehicles rose 51.2 per cent. This was
narrowly eclipsed by finance sales of used commercials, which jumped 52.6
per cent.
Statistics from HPI, the vehicle credit information organisation, show a
47.8 per cent rise in finance sales of used trucks and other heavy
commercial vehicles, and a rise of 22 per cent in finance sales of new heavy
commercial vehicles.
Sales on finance of new cars jumped 34.1 per cent last month, and those of
used cars by 23.1 per cent.
This brought to 171,373 the total of sales on finance of new cars in the
first two months of this year. This was 27.3 per cent higher than the same
period of last year.
Used-car finance sales in the same period were 182,236, a 22.4 per cent rise
on the same period a year ago.
The statistics issued by HPI show that 63.3 per cent of all new cars sold
last month were the subject of some form of finance agreement.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Rifkind studies plan to lease army vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is considering a scheme by which
the army could lease lorries and Land Rovers as a means of making savings to
the already hard-pressed military budget.
The proposal to lease non-fighting vehicles is one of the main options being
considered in Front Line First, a Ministry of Defence study of the costs of
providing military support services which is near completion.
No final decision has been taken on whether to go ahead with the leasing
plan. However, the government has not ruled out the possibility of extending
the leasing principle to fighting equipment in the longer term.
Mr Rifkind floated the idea of leasing lorries in an interview in today's
Daily Telegraph.
The defence secretary told the paper: 'The armed forces buy huge amounts of
vehicles. Nobody in the private sector buys them - they lease. British Rail
is now leasing rolling stock - the same amount of capital will go a lot
further.'
He added: 'Why not do this in the armed forces? The operational commander
could not give a dam if he is leasing equipment.' On the principle of
extending the principle to fighting equipment, he said: 'I would not rule it
out.'
Mr Rifkind is under pressure to introduce cost savings in the defence sector
following last November's Budget in which the MoD was forced to incur some
of the largest cuts of any Whitehall department.
In the wake of the Budget ministers emphasised that the spending cuts would
not result in a reduction in Britain's front-line forces.
The Front Line First studies include proposals to reform a number of other
areas of equipment supply.
There are plans, for example, to introduce more flexible production lines
which could ensure that materials and parts are supplied at a time when they
are needed rather than holding huge quantities of goods in reserve.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Minister offers partnership role to unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's unions were yesterday offered a new partnership with the
government by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, but he told them they
would have 'no direct role in the determination of policy'.
Responding to last week's relaunch of the Trades Union Congress he told a
meeting of the Industrial Society that his door was 'always open for
dialogue' with the trade unions. 'But unions must recognise their own
limitations,' he said. 'There will be no preferential status for unions on
the inside of government.'
Mr Hunt highlighted the development of the government's proposed
apprenticeship scheme to train about 40,000 young people a year in
technical, craft and supervisory skills as an issue on which trade unions
and government could have talks.
He said it was 'heartening that unions may be shaping up and modernising'
and urged them to support employers in achieving greater competitiveness and
to concentrate on providing more individual services to their members.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, welcomed Mr Hunt's remarks. He said:
'It was good to hear that he and the government recognise the potential for
a positive trade union role. I do see plenty of scope for discussion.'
He was disappointed, however, that Mr Hunt had not acknowledged the big
contribution unions had made to the success of 47 of the top 50 profitable
companies in Britain.
Eleven trade unions yesterday started judicial review proceedings for an
injunction against Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to try to stop his
plans for changing the criminal injuries compensation scheme. They say that
the new scheme will provide minimal compensation to victims of violent
crime.
The Law Society, although not a party to the action, said it supported the
application. The hearing will be in the High Court on Tuesday.

Iran has scrapped visa requirements for foreigners visiting its free-trade
zones, according to a senior official, Reuter reports from Tehran.
Mr Morteza Alviri, head of the high council of free zones, said that under
newly-approved regulations foreigners could stay in the three zones without
visas for up to two weeks.
They would need police permission to stay longer or to travel to the rest of
the country, Mr Alviri added. His comments were reported by Hamshahri
newspaper.
The zones - Kish island in the Gulf, Qeshm island in the Hormuz Strait and
Chahbahar on the Gulf of Oman - were set up in 1989 to promote foreign
investment, export-oriented industries and trade.
Critics in parliament opposed easing of entry regulations for the zones,
saying it would create security problems along the country's main sea
routes.

Guyana has abolished tax holidays for foreign investors, creating what Mr
Asgar Ally, finance minister, says will be 'a level playing field for all
investors'.
Local business has been complaining of being put at a disadvantage to
foreign investors who have enjoyed grace periods and exemptions from a range
of taxes and duties.
'Existing tax holidays will be allowed to expire,' said Mr Ally. 'We have
not been granting special holidays to anyone for more than a year.'
The Guyana government has been seeking foreign investors to expand the
economy which is based on gold and bauxite mining and sugar and rice
production. Several have invested in power generation, telecommunications
and mining over the past four years as the government has been selling off a
number of state-owned enterprises.

Shares in Caterpillar jumped sharply yesterday when the US heavy equipment
maker said increased demand for its products would require it to hire more
workers than previously forecast.
The stock gained Dollars 3 1/4 to close at a 52-week high of Dollars 119 1/2
.
Caterpillar, the world's largest supplier of earth-moving equipment, said
that by the end of May its workforce would have grown by 1,000 from about
51,000 in late 1993. It was the second time the company had lifted its

<TEXT>
The prospect of the first big hostile bid for a US fund management-based
company moved a step closer yesterday as the board of Kemper voted
unanimously to reject a Dollars 2.2bn bid from GE Capital.
Directors of the Chicago-based fund management, insurance and broking
company were meeting three days after GE Capital, the financial services arm
of General Electric, first publicised its interest in an acquisition.
Mr David Mathis, Kemper chairman and chief executive, accused GE of trying
to 'steal Kemper with a 'low ball' proposal'. Shareholders would benefit
more from 'providing current management with the opportunity to realise
Kemper's potential,' he added.
The comments, contained in a letter to Mr Jack Welch, chairman of GE, which
was released after the meeting, echo Kemper's earlier rejection of the
uninvited advances.
GE replied: 'We will have a definitive response and will make it at the time
of our choosing.'

US Shoe yesterday said its board of directors will recommend that

Reuter reports from Cincinnati.
Citing financial and business risks that outweigh potential for financial
reward, the board of directors said the proposed spin-off would derail
current initiatives as they are turning round the company's apparel and
footwear operations, increase financing and operating expenses, eliminate
leverage in real estate, and pose solvency risks.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Washington extends BA-USAir code-sharing pact for a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday backed away from a trade confrontation
with the UK by extending for a year a British Airways-USAir ticket
code-sharing arrangement.
However, Washington attacked the UK government for showing 'no real interest
in pursuing a new and more liberal aviation regime'.
Mr Federico Pena, transportation secretary, said the US would not allow any
expansion of the code-sharing pact, which allows BA and USAir, the sixth
largest US carrier, to market each other's flights under the same ticketing
code. The two airlines operated in partnership between 38 US cities and
London.
Last year the deal was given a one-year conditional approval by Mr Pena, who
linked the future of the pact to negotiation of a liberalised US-UK air
services agreement.
Mr Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive of USAir, last night said
the administration had acted 'in the best interests of the American
consumer'.
At the heart of the conflict is a US demand for additional flights by its
carriers to London's Heathrow airport. Under a 1991 agreement, Heathrow can
only be served by American and United.
The US had also sought to link the code-sharing pact to the broader
renegotiation of the US-UK bilateral aviation agreement.
The UK had proposed a gradual three-stage process of liberalising
transatlantic air services and had insisted the US honour its obligations
under the 1991 agreement granting UK carriers code-sharing rights in the US.
The US, however, refused to discuss the three-stage proposal.
Washington came under heavy pressure from some of the biggest carriers to
renounce the existing aviation agreement between the two countries. The UK
in turn threatened to retaliate by cutting US services to Heathrow if the
code-sharing pact was not renewed.
Mr Pena said yesterday the extension of the code-sharing pact allowed the US
to 'assess all its options'.
The issue has been further complicated by BA's decision last week to suspend
additional investment in USAir because of the parlous financial state of its
US airline partner. BA has already invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 274m) in
USAir for a 24 per cent stake.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Arts: The 'Jeunes Danseurs' go for gold - Ballet in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris Opera Ballet occasionally gives its brightest young dancers a run
of special performances in which to show their considerable mettle. So, at
the weekend, the aspirant etoiles, feet as bright as their hopes, technique
as burnished as their confidence in their training, made a bid for glory. It
was an exhilarating spectacle. The Palais Garnier was crowded and the
atmosphere charged with that special French belief in gloire. And on
Saturday afternoon the young went for gold.
Chief ballet-master Patrice Bart centred this year's sessions around the
Romantic ballet. So there was Bournonville, looking - shall we say  - a bit
French-polished, and evocations of Marie Taglioni's roles; the enchanting
Vivandiere sextet which has survived for a century and a half thanks to
notation, and Petipa's Paquita trio. We saw golden gifts; we must hope for
golden futures and golden rewards. Certainly the performance demonstrated
the grace and security of French training - the Opera's ballet school
produces superb talent year after year - and the technical and artistic
assurance that the Opera engenders in its dancers.
The style is Franco-Italian, brilliant in beaten steps and turns, stylish
and sophisticated as to feet - the girls have virtues in point-work
undreamed of by British teaching. There is nothing unemphatic or unduly
modest about what we see, and no English Missery (I'm tempted to write
'English misery'). The young are there on stage because they want to
succeed; failings have to do with a desire for public approval: but
regardez-moi is not the worst of mottos. Lyricism is at a premium - a famous
dancer described it to me as 'dancing too slowly' - while that grandeur of
scale and phrasing we admire with Russian training is largely absent.
But in matter of polish, of physical wit and clarity the Jeunes Danseurs are
a delight. I loved the sextet from Napoli, done with southern vivacity, and
was charmed by Sandrine Henault's exquisite feet in the Flower Festival in
Genzano duet: every step was diamond-cut. Her partner was Eric Camillo,
buoyant, beautifully sure, and playing with real charm. Equally fine
Bertrand Belem, who sizzled through devilish solos in La Vivandiere, and
Paquita, and Gil Isoart as James in the second act of La Sylphide. Why
cannot our young Royal Ballet aspirants do as well?
The Opera's other young virtuoso is Emmanuel Thibault. I reported on him
last year. Slight in build, he has a technique which dazzles as much by its
easy elegance as by its prowess. In the Napoli pas, and then in a fragment
from Le Papillon, he showed a phenomenal facility - a circuit of the stage
interspersing racing leaps with tight, clear pirouettes was astonishing. He
is seemingly able to do with grace whatever he is asked, and unspoiled and
gentle in manner. He comes to life as he dances: curtain calls suggest a
young man almost shy of applause.
He was partnered in Le Papillon by Veronique Doisneau, ideally matched with
him in lightness, speed, and a sweet fragility, her dancing as effortless
and beguiling as his. Very airy, too, the sylphide sketched by Miteki Kudo,
leading her James through the glens of Bournonville's second act, and
turning and posing with delicious innocence. Grandly soaring was Sandrine
Marache, who bounded proudly through a Vivandiere solo. My only complaint
about the performance is the fact that Anton Dolin's version of the Pas de
Quatre in which four divinities of London's ballet in 1845 were brought
together in a contest of charm and steely temperament, was lightly guyed.
The steps, like the Pugni score, are pretty, and need to be prettily danced.
The mock rivalries, and the mopping and mowing between Saturday's
participants, were all too roguey-poguey. Real-life tensions that I have
seen among ballerinas who have incarnated their great predecessors have been
more subtly masked and far deadlier than this warfare of pink tulle and
moues.

<TEXT>
Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yassir Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres are expected to meet on Sunday in Cairo if, as seems
likely, the United Nations Security Council today passes a motion condemning
the Hebron massacre.
The decision to hold the meeting came on the same day that Mr Peres joined
the growing chorus of Israeli ministers calling for the evacuation of all
Jewish settlers from Hebron. Mr Peres' change of heart followed new evidence
that Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein may have been aided by a second settler
in carrying out last month's killings in a Hebron mosque.
With the PLO demanding protection from radical settlers as a precondition
for returning to formal Middle East peace talks, Israel's Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin also indicated for the first time that he might be coming
round to the idea of removing the Hebron settlers.
Well over half the ministers in Mr Rabin's cabinet have publicly backed the
evacuation of the settlers from their three small enclaves in the centre of
the city - a move that would go some way towards meeting PLO demands for
protection and seems to have made it possible for Mr Arafat to agree to meet
Mr Peres this weekend.
Three weeks after the massacre of at least 30 Palestinians inside Hebron's
Cave of the Patriarchs, and with the Middle East peace process
disintegrating, Mr Peres yesterday threw his weight behind the call,
declaring the Hebron settlers were a grave security problem.
While outnumbered at the cabinet table, Mr Rabin has consistently refused to
consider removing the Hebron settlers. But interviewed in Rome yesterday,
after the first ever meeting between an Israeli prime minister and the Pope,
Mr Rabin launched a fierce attack on settlers and recalled that, during his
first term as Israeli premier in the 1970s, he had prevented Jews moving
into Hebron, 'because I knew what the result would be'.
In Jerusalem the Israeli judicial commission investigating the massacre
heard testimony from soldiers who were on duty at the Cave of the Patriarchs
on the morning of the killings that Goldstein, an American-immigrant
settler, had not carried out the massacre alone.
Flatly contradicting the army's previous version of events, three soldiers
testified that Goldstein entered the mosque carrying an M-16 rifle and that,
five minutes later, a second settler entered, carrying a Galil rifle. Army
ballistics experts have reported that all 110 bullets fired inside the
mosque came from one Galil rifle. The new testimony throws open the question
of whether Goldstein, who was beaten to death by worshippers was even the
main perpetrator of the massacre.
Some witnesses earlier spoke of at least two men firing, others of a settler
throwing Goldstein fresh magazines.
One soldier, Sgt Kobi Yosef, admitted yesterday he fired two shots inside
the tomb, but insisted they were fired into the air. 'I thought at first an
Arab was shooting,' he said.
He also admitted closing the nearest exit from the mosque.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Riot police oust Vladivostok's mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The elected mayor of Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok was forcibly
removed from office by riot police yesterday after a raid on his office.
The move, officially described as the culmination of an investigation into
allegations of corruption, brings to the surface simmering disputes over
reform policies in a city where the growth of a free economy has been more
marked than in any other in Russia, but where the state factories which
provide the bulk of employment fear collapse and where some of the highest
votes for the ultra-nationalist and communist parties were cast at the
parliamentary elections last December.
Mr Victor Cherepkov, elected mayor last year, was removed from the mayoral
building early yesterday by 50 riot police - though later reports say he was
not imprisoned and a local television report showed him lying on a bed after
'suffering a heart attack'. The deputy mayor, Mr Vladimir Gilgenberg, was
carried out of the building, according to the Tass news agency.
Mr Cherepkov, a former submarine captain, has been charged with bribery,
according to Mr Veniamin Chichayev, an aide to the regional prosecutor. Mr
Cherepkov has denied the corruption charges and says political enemies have
been trying to remove him before next Sunday's elections to the regional
legislature.
Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff to President Boris Yeltsin, told Tass in
Moscow that the mayor had barricaded himself in his office and surrounded
himself by armed men. 'It seems his supporters were following the example of
the White House rebels,' he said, referring to the battle around parliament
last October.
Vladivostok's stock market, the most active in Russia, has boomed in recent
months - by trading shares in privatised companies. The city has led the
country in privatising its enterprises but, in doing so, has appeared to
trigger a reaction from the state plant directors who see their power base
eroding and from workers who fear unemployment.
Mr Cherepkov has been feuding for months with the Moscow-appointed governor
of the Maritime Territory, Mr Yevgeny Nazdrazenko - who initiated the
allegations of corruption. Mr Nazdrazenko yesterday appointed Mr Konstantin
Tolstoshin, the unsuccessful candidate in last year's mayoral race, as
acting mayor.
Local businessmen and diplomats had viewed Mr Cherepkov as more reformist
than Mr Nazdrazenko, a former factory director whose appointment the
business community regarded as a set-back for market reforms in Vladivostok.
Mr Nazdrazenko became governor of the Maritime Territory after Mr Boris
Yeltsin ousted his predecessor, Mr Vladimir Kuznetsov. Mr Kuznetsov is a
hero to local businessmen, who credit him with initiating the region's
pioneering privatisation of large enterprises. But Mr Kuznetsov's advocacy
of far-sweeping local autonomy put him at loggerheads with Mr Yeltsin, who
sacked him and replaced him with the more loyal Mr Nazdrazenko.
The dramatic attack on Mr Cherepkov appears to be a continuation of Mr
Nazdrazenko's, and Mr Yeltsin's, efforts to consolidate their hold on one of
Russia's most economically dynamic, but potentially separatist, regions.
Vladivostok, the base for the Russian Pacific fleet, was a closed city until
two years ago. Close to the Chinese border, its economy has been buoyed by
trade with its huge neighbour.

USM-quoted Learmonth and Burchett Management Systems plunged 44 to 96p after
announcing that difficult trading conditions meant group results for the
year to April were likely to fall 'well short' of market forecasts.
Advertising group Gold Greenlees Trott dropped 55 to 184p on its second
profits warning in six months. It said it was unlikely to make more than
Pounds 3m in the year to April and would therefore cut the total dividend to
5.3p a share from 8.3p last time.
Regional newspaper group Midland Independent saw its shares make a sparkling
debut as they opened at a 25p premium to their flotation price of 140p.
They continued to rise throughout the day and closed at 172p with nearly 24m
traded, the heaviest turnover on the London stock market.
New issue Israel Fund, a closed end investment trust concentrating on
Israeli companies, made a successful start with a hefty turnover of 13m. The
shares that traded with a warrant attached to every five rose from 82.4 to
86 cents.

FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reed tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magazine publisher Reed International fell heavily as full-year figures were
accompanied by a disappointing statement. The shares lost 27 at 878p on
exceptionally heavy volume of 4m. The Dutch arm Elsevier fell 2.4 per cent.
The market focused on cautious comments concerning the pick-up in the price
of raw materials and the difficulty of raising the price of the end product
in a period of low inflation. Smith New Court, which had a top of the range
forecast of Pounds 628m for the combined group's 1994 figures, trimmed by
Pounds 10m and argued that the rating was up with events in the short term.
However, like many analysts, it felt the market had reacted badly to the
statement. Ms Chris Munro of Hoare Govett pointed out that Reed had already
made allowances for the paper and print price rises by locking in costs.
Meanwhile, the squeeze from suppliers was signalled by confidence from Arjo
Wiggins Appleton. Profits of Pounds 122.1m were at the low end of forecasts.
But analysts raised estimates to around Pounds 175m for 1994 on the belief
that paper price rises of between 4 and 5 per cent in January were sticking.
The shares jumped 15 to 302p.
Relief that figures from United Biscuits were not as bad as some had feared
helped to lift the shares 11 to 349p on turnover of 6.2m. Speculation of
poor trading, particularly at US subsidiary Keebler, had dogged the stock in
recent weeks, a situation undermined by large provisions made recently by
other food manufacturing groups.
UB made a Pounds 110m provision, mostly against Keebler, although this was
offset to some extent by a good performance by the snack foods business
outside the UK. In spite of this, some analysts continue to fret over the US
business, although others took a more optimistic view. 'They have bitten the
bullet on Keebler,' was the opinion of one.
Keen jockeying ahead of next week's Opec meeting and strong oil share
performance overnight in the US pumped up activity in the sector. Two camps
 -one believing the weak oil price is about to go up, the other fearing it
has further to fall - made for heavy turnover, with much interest focused on
British Petroleum, which added 9 at 369p as 12m shares changed hands.
Turnover in Enterprise Oil soared to 9.7m after a chunk of 3.5m shares was
placed in the market at 408 1/2 p late in the session. Enterprise closed at
413p, up 2.
Fears over its treasury operations in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia
knocked 15 from the price of HSBC, which ended at 824p. The bank announced a
change in its treasury operations, but rumours that it would reveal losses
had gripped earlier trading.
A sharp improvement in profits for Legal &amp; General saw the life insurer's
shares move up 8 to 510p. L&amp;G announced full-year profits of Pounds 181m,
against Pounds 116.1m last time.
Reuters recovered 13 to 2021p after the group said it would meet with the
Chicago Board of Trade to iron out a dispute over Globex, Reuters'
after-hours electronic trading system for futures and options.
Conglomerate Hanson gained 4 1/2 at 284p in active trade of some 14m shares
as the company held a presentation in London to analysts and institutions
and announced its intention to expand into the Pacific Rim.
Buying in the US on Wednesday night lifted the London price of some leading
stocks. Glaxo, which has underperformed the market recently, advanced 14 to
690p, while ICI rose 12 to 787p.
Engineering group Lucas Industries shrugged off recent weakness after
Henderson Crosthwaite issued a buy circular on the stock ahead of Monday's
interim figures. The shares appreciated 6 to 215p on volume of 3.2m.
Car repair group Kwik-Fit forged ahead 11 to 167 1/2 p after reporting a 49
per cent increase in full-year figures.
Metals group Johnson Matthey hardened 3 to 571p after announcing a joint
venture with industrial materials company Cookson Group. The latter, a
strong performer in recent sessions, eased a penny to 282p on profit-taking.
Figures from environmental services company Rentokil Group fell below market
expectations, leaving the shares trailing 7 1/2 at 248 1/2 p as several
brokers downgraded profits estimates.

FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness slides on results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International drinks group Guinness was the worst performer in the FT-SE 100
stocks yesterday as it reported dull results undermined by sliding margins
and continued tough trading. The shares retreated 18 to 484p on turnover of
10m.
Although profits came in line with expectations - the company gave a good
indication following its restructuring with French group LVMH in January -
some market specialists were disgruntled by two exceptional items of Pounds
17m which they felt slightly flattered the headline figure. The 9 per cent
drop in operating profits at United Distillers also disappointed some, as
did the retreat in Spain.
Kleinwort Benson said the poor figures pointed to another year of earnings
decline, with little in the way of optimism for 1995. The broker, which has
reduced its profits forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 925m, has the stock as
a long-term hold but believes further weakness is likely in the short term.
NatWest Securities disagreed, pencilling in 7 per cent earnings growth this
year after taking into account the recent restructuring with LVMH, and with
a profits forecast virtually unchanged at Pounds 935m. The broker pointed
out that Guinness's key markets - the US, UK and Japan - have bottomed out.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (35): Where the bison roam free - Bronwen
Maddox visits an unspoiled wilderness where wildlife abounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long, scuffed tracks in the snow between the trees give some warning.
But it is still a shock when the black, shaggy bulk of a bison, one of the
largest and rarest wild creatures in Europe, emerges out of the forest
shadows at the roadside.
Poland's environment contains some of Europe's extremes: Silesian filth in
the south-west, and undisturbed wilderness in the east.
The government is keen for the wilder regions to attract tourism. But while
Polish environmentalists are worried about the impact of development, so far
the remoter regions remain astonishingly unspoiled.
Two hours east from Warsaw, the road becomes entangled in the Biebrzy
marshes - 100 kilometres of peat bog, the largest in Europe.
Naturalists recite its catalogue of wildlife with reverence: 36 species of
fish and 235 species of birds, which make it a stopping point on the
north-south migration routes.
When it floods in the spring, it becomes half land, half water; horses
become stranded trying to cross it, people resort to dinghies, and only the
marshes' 400 wild moose, with huge, splayed hooves, can venture across
safely.
The real heart of the Polish wilderness, however, is still further east.
The Bialowieza, Europe's last primeval forest, is a dark, ungroomed tangle
of oak and ash, straddling the border with Belarus.
For years the region has been a twilight zone of half-forgotten villages
connected by potholed roads. The ethnic and religious homogeneity of much of
Poland yields to a central European medley; the small Ukrainian and Belarus
communities are marked by the domed spires and double-barred crosses of
Orthodox churches.
The region's isolation has helped preserve species rare elsewhere.
Golden-beaked eagles crouch in the grass over dead chickens, while wild boar
gouge troughs in the snow looking for nuts, and the deeper forest recesses
conceal lynx and wolves.
But the undisputed pride of the forest is the bison, coaxed back from near
extinction after the war, when only six were left alive. The forests,
formerly hunting grounds for aristocrats, were protected as a nature reserve
under communism.
After careful breeding, there are now 251 bison roaming the forests in
dozen-strong bands, 37 in compounds at the forest's centre, and another 300
on the Belorus side of the border.
Taller and slimmer than the North American buffalo, their heads are larger
and thrust further forward. Adult males weigh up to 1,000 kilos, with
foot-long pointed horns. 'They have a wild temper - there is no possibility
of a person touching them,' say the foresters.
Mr Zbigniew Krasinski, head of bison research at the reserve, says: 'We are
looking for signs of problems because the genetic pool is so small, such as
a drop in fertility or physical deformation. But so far we have found none.'
Poaching is a concern - hunters do not attack the bison directly, but their
snares entangle the animals' muzzles and hooves.
So is the antagonism of farmers bordering the forest, whose crops are
regularly raided by adventurous herds.
But one of the reserve's most controversial tasks is keeping down the
numbers - the bison, which mainly eat grass, also strip the bark from ash
and oak.
The reserve exports as many bison as it can to other regions of Poland and
abroad.
However, it still must shoot several dozen a year to keep the population
stable. The staff 'pick the ones with defects - those which are weaker, or
were late calves, or limp', says Mr Krasinski.
Bialowieza has rejected the route taken by other Polish reserves in the
north-east and south-east where hunters are permitted to pay to shoot the
bison for sport.
According to Mr Krasinski, the right to shoot a large bison with impressive
horns - 'a gold model' animal - fetches about DM11,000 (Dollars 6,250).
'Maybe shooting would be profitable but there is a strong lobby of
environmentalists who say 'not in the Bialowieza - you can't shoot the king
of forest in his castle',' says Mr Krasinski.
That decision leaves the reserve with slender finances. It enjoyed 100,000
visitors a year before 1989, mainly large expeditions from state factories,
but now receives only 60,000, of which only 5,000 come from outside Poland.
The foresters are sanguine, however. 'We don't want mass tourism here', says
Mr Krasinski. 'Sure, money is a problem, but somehow we always manage.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (34): Rubbing salt into a city's wounds -
Pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The river Vistula in Krakow is now saltier than the Baltic sea because of
pollution from the coal mines of Silesia, according to the city's
environmental protection department. Every day, the equivalent of 18 freight
trains of salt, each with 50 cars carrying 20 tonnes, flows past the city.
Now the water in Krakow's new reservoir is deteriorating because of sewage
and fertiliser contamination, and the city could run short of clean water in
three to five years, environmental inspectors fear.
That is just one example of the ravages which Poland's industrialisation has
made on the environment. Most damage is concentrated in the industrial
heartland of the south and west, where air pollution in the late 1980s ran
at five times the national average. Life expectancy for Silesian men is five
to 10 years lower than the national average, at between 65 and 67 years,
inspectors say, and children in particular suffer respiratory diseases.
Mr Andrzej Kassenberg, an ecologist who sits on the environmental advisory
board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, says:
'Restructuring of the economy provides a huge opportunity not to repeat the
mistakes of the past.' The question now is whether Poland can take that
chance.
In the past three years there has been a dramatic improvement in air
quality, but the cause is the collapse of old industries not environmental
spending. According to Mr Konrad Turzanski, of the environmental protection
inspectorate in Krakow, emissions of dust and sulphur in the region are
around a third of their level in the mid 1980s partly because power plants
are operating at a third of capacity.
But as national figures show, water pollution continues to worsen, and the
problem of disposing of the cities' solid waste is increasing. Meanwhile,
rural areas lag behind: only 5 per cent of households in villages have
plumbing and 2 per cent sewage treatment, compared to around three-quarters
of the total in cities.
Government strategies for tackling these problems have so far had less
impact than economic slump. Poland's elaborate system of environmental
charges and penalties is under strain and only partially enforced.
Under these rules, regions can charge companies for emitting pollution, and
fine them if they break standards. The regional environmental protection
funds which receive the money give 40 per cent to the national environment
fund in Warsaw, 10 per cent to local communities, and then are free to spend
the rest on local projects for improving the environment. The national fund
receives some 7,000bn zlotys a year from pollution charges.
But the funds are handicapped by some companies' inability to pay. According
to Ms Anna Zawiejska, deputy-director of the Katowice environment
department, the coal mines are particular offenders. Nor can they afford to
invest in water treatment plants to remove the salt.
She points out, too, that if a struggling industrial plant which has not
paid its environmental charges is taken over 'the buyer wants any
liabilities to be cancelled'.
The heart of the problem is the threat that environmental spending appears
to pose to jobs. Mr Jerzy Wertz, director of the environmental protection
department in Krakow, estimates that 120,000 people are dependent on the
Nowa Huta steelworks. 'It is by far the most important employer in the
region, he says.
Environmentalists and local government officials say a growing awareness of
that potential conflict, and growing worries about redundancy, have made
people in the region ambivalent or even hostile to environmental
improvement. According to Ms Zawiejska, 'in 1989 Solidarity wanted the
steelworks at Bytom closed. Now they want it to stay open'. Environmental
groups say most interest in 'green' issues is found among educated people in
private companies. They are unlikely to bring political pressure to bear on
these regional dilemmas.
Some of the recent economic restructuring also poses a threat to the
environment. Mr Andrzej Weigle of the National Foundation for Environmental
Protection, a Warsaw-based environmental group, is worried that the
loosening of controls on farmers will lead to more tree-felling.
'In the past, rules were enforced. Now we have to persuade people that it is
in their interest to protect the environment. It is more democratic but
takes longer,' he says.
Hopes for environmental improvement are pinned on a gradual increase in
energy efficiency as more modern factories replace the old, and on better
enforcement of regulations.
Mr Jan Wrobel, a director at the national ministry of environmental
protection, says he can understand environmentalists' fears that companies
invest in Poland to take advantage of lax environmental standards. But in
the long run, he argues, these fears are unjustified: Poland's standards
will be brought up to those of western Europe. 'We do not allow factories to
come into being which break the rules.'
But others remain sceptical. According to Mr Kassenberg, 'my fear is that if
Poland becomes a European tiger, as some people say, air pollution will go
back to where it was'.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (33): Taste of bitter competition to come -
Breweries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When Heineken recently announced its agreement to invest Dollars 40m in
Poland's Zywiec brewery it drew attention to a lively industrial sector
which is making efforts to adapt to the challenges of a free market economy.
At present the industry, which produces around 14m hectolitres a year to
satisfy local drinkers' 40 litres per capita annual consumption, is heavily
protected by tariffs. But leading managers, such as Adam Loewe from Zywiec
and Pawel Sudol at the recently privatised Poznan brewery, know that their
companies have a few years at most to modernise before they come face to
face with competition from more efficient western European brewers.
Competition will intensify when customs barriers come down, in conformity
with Poland's association agreement with the European Union.
Brewers have had a taste of what is to come from a group of Australians led
by Tony Oates, formerly Alan Bond's finance manager, who in 1991 established
a Dollars 200,000 joint venture with two brewing companies in Gdansk and
Elblag, in northern Poland. The resulting modernisation and expansion
brought output up to 1.8m hectolitres last year.
Higher output has been coupled with aggressive marketing which has seen the
Australian-owned beer encroach on the Silesian market. Silesia is the
beer-swilling mining and heavy industrial part of southern Poland which is
the home of state-owned brewers such as Tychy and Zabrze as well as Zywiec.
Zywiec, a listed brewery, had already responded to the challenge by
developing an advertising campaign designed by J Walter Thompson seeking to
change the drink's image and aiming it at the prosperous young. It is more
expensive than other brands giving it a higher profit margin. It also
developed a nation-wide distribution organisation modelled on the methods of
companies like Coca-Cola.
However, the decision by the independent-minded Mr Loewe of Zywiec to enter
into the alliance with Heineken which gives the Dutch company a 25 per cent
share, showed that even Zywiec with its 8 per cent market share and
relatively strong profits, felt that time was running out.
In contrast, management at Okocim, the other listed brewery, found last
month to its surprise that Brau und Brunnen, a leading German brewery, had
secretly been buying up its equity and announced that it controlled a 25 per
cent share. The German decision was taken last year after it dropped plans
to build a new brewery near Brzeg in southern Poland at a cost of DM145m
(Dollars 82m).
Foreign investment elsewhere in the industry has been delayed by a ban on
sales of state-owned breweries to foreign companies. This has led to delays
in privatisation of the sector which saw a sale early in 1992 of 30 per cent
of the Koszalin brewery to Holsten, another German company. This was
followed by a hiatus which ended last autumn with the sale of the Poznan
brewery to a local investor.
Next in line is Ringnes, the Norwegian brewer, which is hoping to purchase
the ailing Warka brewery.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (31): Star-struck town fights back -
Profile / Starachowice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starachowice, a socialist-style company town of 60,000 souls half way
between Warsaw and Krakow, has been a classic loser from the wrenching
changes which have swept across Poland over the past five years. But a new
joint venture meat packing plant with 51 per cent US control, and a
refinancing plan for the town's main employer, the Star truck factory, has
brought the first glimmer of hope to a town where 37 per cent of the
workforce is unemployed.
Most have been out of work since the Star truck plant fell on hard times
three years ago. In its heyday in the mid-1970s Star turned out 20,000
trucks a year. Virtually everything in the town - central heating for homes
and public buildings, the hospital, the kindergarten, the high-rise housing
estates, the foundry and a cluster of sub-assembly and component plants -
depended upon it.
For decades Star turned out the same old models. It had no marketing
department, and did not need one. Every year a certain proportion of output
was allocated to the Polish military, some were painted light khaki and
shipped abroad to places such as Mozambique and Angola, and others were
allocated to various Polish enterprises or exported by state-owned foreign
trade corporations, mostly to other Comecon 'customers'.
It was a quiet life and a steady one for the 11,000 employees of Star and
their families, although that did not prevent Starachowice being one of the
hotbeds of the ant-communist Solidarity movement. But its real troubles
began only after Solidarity ousted the communists.
First came the cut in military budgets. Then the Comecon market collapsed.
Then privatisation of the former state-owned transport companies, the
bankruptcy of many large state-owned companies and the preference of the
emerging new private sector traders for cheap, second-hand imported vans,
caused demand to collapse.
Output last year declined to 1,600 vehicles, of which nearly 60 per cent
were small seven-ton models hastily introduced in an attempt to satisfy the
demand for smaller vehicles. An increasingly desperate search for a foreign
partner ended without success after first Volvo then Renault failed to
obtain tariff protection for their assembly operations.
Potential foreign partners were also deterred by the social problems
involved in taking over an old-fashioned, highly indebted state-owned plant
with strong union traditions.
Fortunately, inherited problems were not high on the agenda at the huge
unfinished construction site on the edge of town which lay abandoned for
nearly a decade after the government ran out of funds.
With the help of financial and other incentives from Warsaw, and lobbying by
the town council led by its dynamic young mayor, Mr Grzegorz Wakendzic, the
Epstein group, a private, Chicago-based meat processing and engineering
company with links to the Polish Diaspora, agreed to invest Dollars 36m in
completing and equipping the plant. The result was Constar, a joint venture
in which Epstein teamed up with Animex, a state-owned food processing and
trading company.
The new plant, which turns out 160 tonnes of processed meat a day, employs
1,400 workers and supplies most of southern Poland and export markets in the
US and Europe, including Russia.
Another 100 jobs were created by a new cigarette factory which makes cheap
cigarettes selling for the equivalent of 10 US cents a packet using the
poorest quality Polish tobacco and reconditioned Molins cigarette-making
machines which were bought as scrap. Soon the machines will be shipped to
Belorussia where they will be re-assembled and the Starachowice plant will
be re-equipped with new machines fed with higher grade tobacco.
But the main grounds for optimism surround the future of Star itself. A
financial restructuring plan has been put together by Bank Rozvoju, the
Polish Development Bank, on lines similar to its highly successful
restructuring plan for the Szczecin shipyards.
The Scczecin yards have become a textbook case of a restructured loss-making
state company which was restructured, made profitable and then prepared for
privatisation. The Star plan hopes to repeat the performance.
The starting point was the purchase by Bank Rozvoju of Star's debt with Bank
Slaski 'at a very high discount', according to Mr Wojciech Kostrzewa,
Rozvoju's president. The bank then arranged a 94 per cent writedown of the
1,700bn zloty (Dollars 80m) debt and accumulated interest, linked to a
debt/equity swap and an undertaking by Star to repay 6 per cent of its
principal debt (without accumulated interest) to creditors in 12 monthly
payment.
The unions, meanwhile, agreed to a further 25 per cent cut in employment
levels from 4,000 to 3,000 while the government agreed to finance severance
pay.
'We now hope to attract foreign investors to introduce new models. The
difficulties which put them off in the past have been largely eliminated. We
can now offer a debt-free, slimmed down company with a workforce and
management eager to make the plant viable,' says Wojciech Dworzaniki, the
deputy manager.
For Zbigniew Rafalski, the Solidarity union leader at the plant, the
agreement is the culmination of three bitter years for workers who have
struggled hard to preserve their dignity along with the plant but have come
to terms with the realisation that it will not, and should not, return to
its former size or importance.
In recent weeks, management and unions have been talking to a team from KIA,
the South Korean truck company, which is looking for a low cost assembly
base to supply its planned expansion into European markets. But they, and
the town itself, are still open to other offers both for Star, its hived off
subsidiary companies, and future greenfield investments.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (32): Poles begin to see the lights -
Advertising is changing the appearance of Warsaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the train travelling from west to east Berlin, it was once easy to spot
the frontier just by watching where the bright lights ended and the sombre
gloom began.
In the past five years free market economics have begun to blur the
difference as the appearance of eastern European cities changes with outdoor
advertising covering the still shabby exteriors of most buildings.
In Warsaw, few have done as much to change the way the city looks as
Catherine Sienkiewicz, the owner of Adpol, a company which owns 200
western-style illuminated bus stops carrying advertising.
Standing on the eighth floor of the Universal building above one of the
city's busiest points, Ms Sienkiewicz, an attractive blonde, says she went
into business once communism collapsed in 1989.
Ms Sienkiewicz's first steps, like those of many Poles now in private
business, was in imports of electronics goods. 'We ran a bonded warehouse,'
she says. Now, from her office she can see a crowd of people waiting for
buses and trams at her red-painted plexiglass and steel bus shelters.
The idea came to her and her erstwhile partner Mr Andrzej Litwinek, an
Anglo-Pole and refugee from Merrill Lynch in 1991, and the original six
shelters came from the United Kingdom.
Now they are manufactured in Poland and their cost makes up the lion's share
of the company's total 30bn zloty investment to date. Adpol still quotes its
prices in pounds sterling as a reminder of the early days.
Funded through bank loans the company made a small profit last year, its
second full year of operation with turnover worth 10bn zlotys in 1992
growing steadily. 'Our turnover in the first two months of 1994 has already
reached 5bn zlotys,' says Ms Sienkiewicz who has received several offers
from foreign companies ready to buy into her firm.
She refused, she says, because 'this is my future'. Adpol is now planning to
expand into other cities such as Gdansk on the Baltic coast.
Five per cent of Adpol's turnover goes to the Warsaw city authorities under
a 15-year agreement.
The bus company, which is still owned by the city, saves on the arrangement
because it does not have to clean the shelters each night. That is organised
by Adpol.
Ms Sienkiewicz says the advertising market is growing year by year, with
more foreign companies coming in to the country and local ones increasingly
appreciating the merits of trumpeting the merits of its product.
One fifth of the advertisements on the bus stops come from Polish-owned
companies, the latest being a Warsaw-based fat producer which has decided to
take on Unilever with its own Nova margarine brand.
But most of the business comes from the multinationals such as Philip Morris
and Master Foods as dog food and tobacco vie for the attention of bus
travellers and motorists stuck in increasingly common Warsaw traffic jams.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (28): A scramble to modernise - Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 17,000 workers who pour through the arched gates of the the Nowa Huta
steelworks each day have one pressing question: how many of them will keep
their jobs. Ten years ago the plant, which sprawls over 10 square kilometres
near Krakow, employed 35,000 people.
But now production levels have been cut by two thirds. Like the rest of the
Polish steel industry, Nowa Huta will spend the next few years fighting for
survival. If it succeeds, its managers expect it will employ only 8,000
people.
According to a Polish government assessment of the future of the steel
industry last autumn, 'without restructuring the domestic market could be
lost and most Polish steel mills will be threatened by bankruptcy'.
The challenge facing the industry is that the type and amount of steel
produced in the past were largely geared to the needs of the Soviet Union.
That demand has now collapsed, together with much of the requirements from
Polish industry.
As a result, production of crude steel slumped from a peak of 20m tonnes a
year in the early 1980s to 9.8m tonnes in 1992. With the gradual economic
recovery, total steel production picked up slightly last year, and the
industry ministry expects it to reach 11m tonnes this year. Steelmakers can
also look forward to a longer-term increase in demand from the huge task of
modernising Poland's infrastructure and industry.
But to gain a share of that market, Poland's 26 steel mills, 18 of which
were built before the first world war, will have to cut costs and capacity,
and then modernise. On the back of a study commissioned from a Canadian
consortium including consultants Ernst &amp; Young, the government estimates
that no more than 11.7m tonnes a year of liquid steel capacity is needed,
even allowing for an upsurge in domestic demand.
'Past construction booms only took about 2m tonnes a year,' says Mr Wiktor
Laszczyk, adviser on steel at the ministry of industry. 'And a quarter of
our steel used to be exported, almost entirely to the Soviet Union - those
markets have gone.'
The government also wants continuous casting, an energy-efficient means of
production and an international barometer of the level of modernisation, to
rise from 8 per cent to 75 per cent of production. Energy-inefficient open
hearth furnaces also need to be replaced by oxygen furnaces, and mills which
produce semi-finished steel need to invest in processing of finished
products, it says.
As well as cutting raw material and electricity costs, those changes will
curb some of the pollution belched out by the steel works - they are some of
the largest emitters of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide in Poland.
But some of the implications of restructuring have been more controversial,
in particular the Canadian Consortium's argument that at least six mills
should close.
Estimates also suggest that employment might have to fall from 147,000 to
43,000, although half the people affected might be transfered to
newly-formed service and engineering companies.
Instead of complete closure of mills, the government has tended to recommend
scaling down and sometimes merger. In Nowa Huta's case, restructuring may
mean merger with the rival giant steel works Huta Katowice to improve
production of sheet steel, the government has suggested.
According to the industry ministry, the investment needed to achieve the
industry's transformation runs to some Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn, Dollars
1.8bn in capital costs and the rest in redundancy payments and management
changes.
Mr Laszczyk insists, though, that 'the mills will have to find the money for
restructuring. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade prevents us giving
subsidies'.
The money will have to come from the mills' own resources or from foreign
credits, he said, although the government has indicated it may be prepared
to guarantee foreign credits, as it has done at Nowa Huta and Huta Katowice.
It will also press ahead with setting up mills as stand-alone companies,
prior to privatisation.
The price of failure, if the Polish steel industry fails to make this
transformation, is that Poland would have to find some Dollars 4bn to
Dollars 5bn a year in foreign currency to pay for steel imports.
'The government will not allow liquidation of the industry to happen as we
could not fill that gap in foreign trade,' according to Mr Laszczyk. 'I am
sure, therefore, that the industry will survive.' The steps the industry
takes in the next few years in its scramble towards modernisation will
determine whether that prediction comes true.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (29): How to pick a winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you were trying to pick a winner in the rapidly-changing Polish steel
industry, how would you go about it?
That was the question facing Air Products, a manufacturer of oxygen and
other industrial gases with a Dollars 3bn turnover worldwide, trying to make
its first large investment in Poland.
Air Products wanted to find a steel mill that was certain to survive the
shake-out in the industry, to which it could supply oxygen. The use of
oxygen instead of air in steel manufacture greatly improves the efficiency,
as well as reducing environmentally harmful emissions.
This is exactly the kind of investment which Polish mills will need if they
are to survive the transformation under way in the industry. The government
is adamant that it cannot contribute to the spending.
But 'we had to be pretty sure the partner was viable', according to Mr
Andrzej Zakrzewski, Air Products' business manager for Poland. The whole of
the group's investment would be dependent on that one customer.
Air Products' choice was the Huta-Zawierce steelworks near Katowice, which
makes steel from scrap steel. In November, Air Products opened its two
oxygen plants, supplying 100 tonnes a day, which cost DM14m.
According to Mr Zakrzewski, it suited both parties for Air Products to carry
the capital cost of building the plant. 'We get a fair return for the risk'
through the price at which oxygen is sold to the steelworks, he said.
The group was also keen to avoid complications of property rights and
historic environmental liabilities by building the plant on the
Huta-Zawierce site, rather than buying a site of its own.
The factors that tipped the balance in the investment decision were the
strides that Huta-Zawierce has made in recent years. According to Mr Jozef
Lotko, technical director of Huta Zawierce, the capacity of the furnaces has
nearly doubled since the 1970s, and it has installed continuous casting
technology.
The mill has also cut jobs from 6,300 to 4,300. It expects eventually to
have only about 1,500 as maintenance and engineering activities are hived
off as separate businesses.
However, since Air Products' original expression of interest, the mill has
had problems. Mr Lotko says that the first quarter of 1993 saw constant
stoppages because of lack of scrap steel, and the mill made losses.
The mill has now returned to profit. But Mr Zakrzewski emphasises that Air
Products received no guarantees from the government about the mill's future.
'In the end we made an act of faith,' he says.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (30): Pits face difficult challenge - Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three hundred metres below the surface of the Silesian hills, and four
kilometres along dark, dripping tunnels from the main shaft of the Janina
mine near Katowice, Mr Jerzy Poniewski, senior engineer, is adamant that his
son will not be following him into a career down the pit. 'He speaks German
and English and is going to medical school. He doesn't want to be a miner -
there are no prospects'.
Nevertheless, if Polish coal mining has a profitable future, the face of it
is probably the Janina mine. Mr Poniewski and his colleagues have hauled
Janina back from the brink of bankruptcy in June 1990, by a programme of
modernisation and job cuts yet to be undertaken by most of the industry. 'It
was a question of life and death,' says Mr Tadeusz Gruber, the mine's
deputy-director.
Restructuring the coal industry is one of the most difficult challenges
facing the Polish economy. Poland remains highly dependent on hard coal,
which supplies two thirds of electricity generation and more than three
quarters of industrial and household heating. Lignite provides another 14
per cent of primary energy consumption.
With an estimated 65bn tonnes of reserves, a third of which are being
actively mined, Poland also has some of the richest deposits in Europe.
There are geological handicaps - methane gas in some, underground water in
many, as in the Janina mine - but much of the coal has low sulphur content
and is close to the surface compared to that in the UK.
In theory, it is an industry which should have little problem attracting
outside investment. The World Bank, in a survey of the industry, has
recommended a continuing central role for coal production in the economy -
provided that restructuring takes place.
However, the present financial position of the 70 mines in Upper and Lower
Silesia and Lublin is precarious. Of the pits, which were reorganised last
spring into seven corporations, seven have been listed for closure.
Production has slumped from a peak of just under 200m tonnes in 1979 to
about 130m tonnes last year, largely because of the collapse in industrial
demand for electricity and heating.
In December 1993, the mines' liabilities exceeded their receivables - money
owing to them - by 32,000bn zlotys, according to Mr Eugeniusz Pawetczyk,
vice-president of the State Coal Agency, which was responsible for the mines
until last year.
The government and industry analysts are clear that jobs need to be shed to
bring the industry firmly into profit. According to the State Coal Agency,
the 305,000 employees in the hard coal mines in December 1993 (excluding
those working in lignite mining) represented a fall of 25,000 in the year.
'We need more cuts - half of the current total is our aim,' says Mr
Pawetczyk. He expects that the reduction this year will be some 32,000,
although 25,000 of that will be achieved by natural wastage and separation
of service and engineering companies.
Ministers are concerned, however, that cuts on that scale could be
politically explosive. The Janina mine is still the largest employer in its
district, and is directly responsible for the housing of 1,300 families. The
miners earn an average of 4m zlotys to 5m zlotys a month, well above the
industrial average of 3m zlotys to 4m zlotys, and reluctance about accepting
the offered six months' redundancy pay in return for leaving would be
understandable.
However, Mr Gruber says that the mine has managed to cut its workforce from
6,000 people four years ago to 4,000 mainly by separating service,
maintenance and engineering activities into separate companies, and by
hiring no new people.
'We used to have 50 people washing the miners' clothes, but now they are in
a separate company and we don't pay for their social services,' he says.
But industry analysts are concerned that some mines will simply try to raise
coal prices instead of cutting costs, because of the difficulty of making
redundancies. Last year, the financial plight of the mines was partly
alleviated by a deal with the generating industry allowing the average
domestic price of coal to rise by nearly a third.
That is a picture acknowledged by the directors of Weglokoks, the
state-owned company which handles 90 per cent of exports: 'The coal mines
were in a weak position last year before they grouped into seven companies.
There was too much competition to sell coal - now they have started acting
together, they have brought coal prices up to the level of costs.'
According to Mr Henryk Pyszny, Weglokoks' president, exports are currently
less profitable than domestic coal sales because of low world coal prices.
However if cheaper imports begin to challenge domestic production, the mines
could be plunged back further into deficit, the mines argue.
The recent changes made by a few mines point the way to solution of these
problems. But measured against the goals of internationally competitive
production and coal prices set by the market, coal mining is still near the
beginning of a long road.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (25): Integration remains the goal -
Foreign Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twice in 200 years, Poland has disappeared from the map of modern Europe.
The first time followed its partition between Russia, Prussia and Austria at
the end of the 18th century. The second calamity occurred in 1939 when
Poland was carved up between Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union.
Such a history inevitably leaves traumatic memories, and conditions the
basic aims of Polish foreign policy. These are the prevention of any future
risk of isolation, by integrating Poland into European economic and security
structures to the west, and the cultivation of close economic as well as
political links with its neighbours to the east.
Until two years ago Poland's eastern neighbour was a monolithic Soviet
Union. Now, apart from a short common border with the Russian enclave of
Kalingrad, it is separated from Russia by the Baltic states, Belarus and
Ukraine.
Poland's foreign minister, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, is ideally placed to
operate on both the western and eastern fronts of diplomacy. A former
central banker, who worked for years at the World Bank in Washington, he was
in charge of negotiations with the European Community which led to Poland's
association agreement with the EU.
He knows the nit-picking reality behind the EU's fine words about need for
greater European integration. He also knows that the main obstacle to the
entry of Poland and other central European states into an enlarged EU is the
Common Agricultural Policy.
At the same time, his experience at the centre of economic and financial
decision-making during Poland's economic transformation equips him with an
understanding of the problems facing Russia, and even more so Ukraine.
Poland's worries about the east are not military. The Russian army is
demoralised and pre-occupied. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the chauvinist victor of
December's Russian elections, is a worrying symbol of hurt pride and the
darker side of the Russian psyche, but not a new Stalin.
Poland's worry, shared by its central European partners, is of
de-stabilising flows of refugees and criminals rom the east. A still distant
nightmare is the danger of conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
Ideally, Poland would like to be under the security umbrella of full Nato
membership, but has accepted for the time being the half-way house of the
partnership for peace. But when Mr Andrei Kozyrev visited Warsaw as part of
his European tour last month security matters took up only a tiny portion of
their talks.
Instead, the Poles put forward a 26-point proposal for closer economic and
financial co-operation, not on the old state to state basis, but mainly
between private business people on both sides.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (27): Out of defeat, a new purpose -
Christopher Bobinski on Solidarity's position after the election shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The defeat last autumn of Poland's Solidarity-rooted coalition government by
parties with a communist past has given the 2m-strong Solidarity Trade Union
a new lease of life.
At last the movement, which proudly carries the mantle of its legendary
anti-communist struggles, has regained a sense of purpose. The Solidarity
Union failed to get any MPs into the powerful lower chamber of parliament
and this defeat shocked it into refocusing its future as a trade union
rather than as a stand-alone political movement.
Mr Marian Krzaklewski, a 43-year-old computer designer from the Academy of
Sciences in the industrial district of Silesia has led Solidarity since Lech
Walesa left his former power base to become the President of Poland in 1992
has learned the lesson well.
Talking in Solidarity's Gdansk headquarters, only 500 metres from the
shipyard where an 18-day strike won trade union rights for workers in 1980,
he stubbornly avoids being drawn on the political implications of
Solidarity's present militant stance.
Instead, supported by matter-of-fact officials, Mr Krzaklewski prefers to
stick to Solidarity's demands. Above all the union wants the government to
honour the pledge made by its Solidarity-based predecessor that real incomes
will grow in line with GDP and that more money be spent on fighting
unemployment.
Clad in Solidarity's traditional dress of jeans and jumper, long discarded
for suits and ties by those of the movement's leaders and supporters who
over the past five years have gone into government or business, Mr
Krzaklewski is obviously a man under a great deal of pressure.
Talking fast he reaches repeatedly for pencil and paper to illustrate his
points as he emphatically rebuts critics in the government and the media who
see the union's stance as dangerously populist and risks opening the
floodgates of inflation. At the same time he knows he is leading a movement
whose increasingly impatient membership has experienced annual falls in real
wages since 1990 and wants the trend reversed.
'The last government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka promised us that real incomes
would grow by half the rate of increase of GDP,' he says reaching into his
files to show an agreement signed after a three-week strike in the Silesian
coal mines in January 1993. 'But real wages fell by 3 per cent last year
while GDP grew by 4 per cent.' That alone would have been enough 'in
Germany, Spain or Italy for a general strike', he adds.
This year people will settle for zero growth in real incomes but not a
further fall, he concedes as he prepares to follow up the demonstration by
30,000 Solidarity supporters in Warsaw last month with a campaign of
selective strikes designed to force changes in government policies. But,
bitterly, Mr Krzaklewski admits that it was the previous government which
failed to stick to its promises on incomes which last summer prompted
Solidarity, then represented in parliament, to put the motion of no
confidence which led to Ms Suchocka's downfall.
But the present administration has also been in no hurry to inaugurate a
standing trilateral committee of government employers and unions which was
agreed with Ms Suchocka last spring to seek consensus on economic policy.
The committee, which is central to Mr Krzaklewski's hopes of establishing a
stable 'system' of consultation, was set set up only last month after work
on the stringent 1994 budget was virtually complete. Solidarity's main
tactical aim now is to press for an easing of this year's planned 28 per
cent price rise for electricity and 60 per cent for central heating.
The union also wants income tax thresholds raised and wage controls removed
to enable real wages to rise this year.
Mr Krzaklewski insists that he is not asking for this year's 83,000bn zloty
budget deficit to be increased. 'There is quite enough money for alleviating
social needs in the present budget,' he says. 'The problem is that it's been
spent wastefully up till now and hasn't gone to those who really need
support.'
Solidarity also wants the present government to put through legislation
enabling collective wage bargaining to go ahead at both the national and
shop floor levels. This is another subject, central to Solidarity's
strategy, on which the previous government dragged its heels. At present the
only statutory obligation on employers is to pay a minimum wage which was
set at a 1.8m zlotys a month last October.
Mr Krzaklewski argues that a system of collective wage bargaining would help
the government and the union to decentralise conflicts. More crucially, from
the union's point of view, it would also provide a way into the private
sector where Solidarity is sorely under-represented.
Mr Krzaklewski says he is not engaged in a crusade against the government
because of its communist roots and can live with it, provided it is able to
deliver higher living standards. But he does not like the 'post-communists',
as he calls them, and stresses that 'if they were to start infringing human
rights then Solidarity would have to react'.
The question that Mr Krzaklewski leaves unanswered, is what happens if
industrial discontent grows in Poland to such an extent that the
government's position is threatened. Who would Solidarity support then? The
former Solidarity-linked parties now in opposition, or President Walesa, the
historic flag bearer of militant Polish unionism who is gearing up for
re-election in 1995? Time will tell.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (25): The electoral wheel turns full circle
 -Anthony Robinson analyses the extraordinary turnaround in the thinking of
former communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'Poland's fate for so long was to be in the slipstream of history, lagging
behind developments elsewhere. But the 'round-table' talks of 1989, which
led to the first post-communist government in eastern Europe, and the
economic reforms introduced by Leszek Balcerowicz (finance minister) in 1990
put Poland in the vanguard of history. We have to build on these
achievements and move forward.'
The words of Alexander Kwasniewski, the former communist turned social
democrat who is now the driving force behind the Democratic Left Alliance
(SLD), Poland's largest political party, reflect an extraordinary turnaround
in Polish politics.
Five years ago Mr Kwasniewski was one of the communist party's top
negotiators, seeking to entrench communist power through a compromise with
Lech Walesa, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Adam Michnik, Bronislaw Geremek and other
Solidarity movement leaders.
The outcome of these round-table talks was a deal which ended the
communists' post-war monopoly of power, but limited non-communist parties to
only 35 per cent of seats in the lower house of the Polish parliament, the
Sejm.
Both sides failed to foresee that given the first chance in more than half a
century to vent their spleen, voters would give Solidarity an overwhelming
moral victory by sweeping its candidates into each of the allotted 35 per
cent of Sejm seats and all the 100 freely-elected senate seats.
As a result, by autumn 1989, Poland had the first non-communist government
in the former Soviet bloc. On January 1, 1990, Leszek Balcerowicz, the new
government's ascetic finance minister, devalued the zloty and made it
internally convertible. He also swept away a raft of communist-style
consumer and producer subsidies and launched Poland on a brave and
unprecedented experiment in liberal, free market economics.
Those reforms opened up entirely new perspectives for the development of
Polish society and the Polish economy. But Solidarity proved inept at
selling its achievements or in softening the impact of reforms on the
unemployed and on millions of workers for whom the market economy translated
into harder work, lower wages, social insecurity, a fast growing gap between
rich and poor and rising crime.
At last September's general elections the electoral wheel came full circle.
Voters swept the former communists of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD)
into first place with 171 seats in the 460-seat Sejm, followed by the
Peasants Party (PSL) with 131 seats. The Democratic Union (UD), the
mainstream Solidarity party, limped in third with 74 seats followed by the
intellectual left-wing Solidarity-linked Union of Labour (UP).
The votes of over 30 per cent of the electorate were neutralised by new
electoral rules which introduced a 5 per cent minimum threshold for entry
into the new parliament. A raft of right-wing and church-linked Christian
parties failed to jump this hurdle. Only the right-wing nationalist
Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN) with 21 seats and President
Walesa's so-called non-party reform movement (BBWR) with 16 seats, scraped
into the new Sejm.
Significantly, in his first important post-election speech Mr Kwasniewski,
leader of the main social democratic faction of the SLD, publicly apologised
to Poles for the misdeeds of the 45-year, post-war communist regime. He
openly acknowledged the achievements of the Solidarity-based governments as
gains for Polish society as a whole.
To sceptics, Mr Kwasniewski's magnanimity in victory was the mark of a
cynical apparatchik. To others it looked like the gesture of a smart and
far-sighted politician laying the groundwork for a future alliance with the
intellectual and moral leaders of Solidarity.
Such a 'historic compromise' is not yet on the political horizon, although
both the SLD and the PSL toyed with such a hypothesis before reluctantly
concluding that the post-electoral political arithmetic left little
alternative but to form an SLD-PSL coalition government.
Numerically the government, which is presided over by the peasant party
leader, 34-year-old Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, is strongly based.
It controls over two-thirds of the seats in parliament and has the power to
draft a new constitution. In theory, it could last out a full parliamentary
term, unlike all previous post-communist governments which fell after a few
months in power.
Legislation now passes the once fractious parliament virtually on the nod, a
big change from the endless debates followed by cliff-hanging votes which
characterised previous parliaments.
But the two partners make an odd couple. The government looks like a
miserable marriage of convenience, with little love or mutual respect
between its two very different political components.
The thinly disguised internal tensions burst into the open in January when
the prime minister summarily dismissed Mr Stefan Kowalec, the deputy-finance
minister. He was held responsible for the embarrassing 'success' of the
flotation of Bank Slaski, whose shares soared up to 13 times their issue
price at their debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The 'scandal' deepened when it emerged that few, aside from lucky bank
employees, had been able to register their shares in time to actually sell
them at the initial high price. Unconfirmed rumours swept town of a
'swindlers' list' of politicians and others who had been able to buy and
dispose of shares at favourable rates.
With hindsight the shares were sold too cheaply and listed prematurely. But
that did not seem the case during the long and difficult months when the
privatisation authorities were desperately seeking a foreign bank to buy a
minority share and were unsure of the public's appetite for bank shares.
Mr Kowalec, a technocrat brought in by Mr Balcerowicz back in 1989, was
slated to become the fall man for the mistake. But the expectation was that
he would be sacked by Mr Marek Borowski, the SLD finance minister, not the
prime minister.
The affair rapidly became a power struggle between the prime minister and Mr
Kwasniewski who holds no ministerial post but is widely perceived as the
real power behind the throne.
The culmination came when Mr Borowski sought both to re-affirm his control
over the appointment of his deputy and concentrate economic decision-making
generally in his hands. He offered to resign if his demands were not met. Mr
Pawlak, whose main aim was to underline that he was de facto as well as de
jure head of the government, called his bluff and Mr Borowski resigned.
The shock move badly wrong-footed Mr Kwasniewski who hitherto had treated Mr
Pawlak as a political lightweight. It also cast new light on the role played
by Mr Michal Strak, the deceptively relaxed and jovial head of the cabinet
office who is the main strategist behind the PSL.
'After the elections there was a widespread perception that Poland had a
one-party government again. That was wrong. But now people talk of
irreconcilable differences between the government partners and that's not
true either,' says Mr Strak. 'There is no alternative to this coalition and
that creates a framework for the government to carry on,' he adds.
Mr Strak is adamant that the prime minister, who is popular among his
farming and small-town constituents but looked down upon as an inarticulate
bumpkin by political salon Warsaw, will continue to use his premiership to
lead the government.
Mr Pawlak's own priority is to ensure that government policies favourably
impact on his party's rural constituents. 'It is better to provide farmers
with Dollars 50 of cheap credit than throw them off the land and have to
find Dollars 500 for unemployment pay,' he says. 'With 15 per cent of Poles
already unemployed we have to encourage those who are working and
maintaining their families,' he adds.
For a government with such a clear parliamentary majority its peasant party
component has curiously unambitious long-term plans. 'Previous governments
were reformist governments. We don't consider ourselves as reformers. Our
task is to deal with problems as they arise and above all to make the
machinery of government more efficient,' says Mr Strak.
The idea of modest government is attractive to many after the turmoil of the
last five years, particularly if a period of calm permits the further
development of civil society, a stronger role for local governments and the
sort of prosperity which allows the development of a stable middle class.
But there are several clouds on the horizon, including the shift back to
authoritarian nationalism in Russia, a looming parliamentary conflict over
the proposed Concordat with the Vatican and the presidential elections
scheduled for 1995. The latter is already casting a shadow over contemporary
politics as President Lech Walesa manoeuvres for support after coming to the
conclusion that his main potential rival is none other than Mr Kwasniewski
himself.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (24): Airwaves hit by a storm of criticism
 -Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's attempt to establish an independent commercial television channel
has run into a storm, confirming the special place politicians continue to
accord the medium.
Neither the granting of national broadcast licences to two private radio
companies, the Warsaw-based Radio Zet and RMF from Krakow, nor growing
concentration in newspaper ownership, seem to attract as much emotion and
attention as recent appointments in state-owned television or the granting
of the national commercial television licence to Polsat.
Polsat is wholly-owned by Mr Zygmunt Solorz, a 38-year-old entrepreneur from
Wroclaw, in south-western Poland. He won the licence in the face of
competition from several mixed Polish and foreign consortia.
These consortia included Bertelsmann, CLT, the Luxembourg-based European
broadcaster as well as CNN and Time Warner. But almost as soon as the
decision was announced by the nine-strong National Broadcasting Council, it
was criticised.
Most prominently, it was attacked by President Lech Walesa, who dismissed Mr
Marek Markiewicz as chairman of the council which was appointed last year by
the previous Solidarity-dominated parliament and the president to oversee
the airwaves under the country's new broadcasting law.
Mr Walesa would have happily removed Mr Markiewicz from the council itself
if he had had the power to do so.
Mr Markiewicz had already run foul of the president late last year when he
appointed Mr Wieslaw Walendziak, an even-handed journalist in his early
thirties with a right-wing background, to head Poland's state-owned TV.
Mr Walesa had wanted Mr Janusz Zaorski, the incumbent, to continue in the
job. He was seen as a guarantee that the president would get his fair share
of TV coverage during the presidential election campaign in the autumn of
1995.
But Polsat, where Mr Solorz employs both former communist functionaries and
young right-wing journalists of whom Mr Walendziak was one, is also
mistrusted by President Walesa, who has publicly accused Mr Markiewicz of
'giving the licence to the communists'.
The governing coalition, which is at present poorly represented on the
council has, stayed aloof from the fray. But it could be tempted in the
coming months to pack it with its own supporters.
In the meantime, President Walesa's attempts to undermine the council and
have the Polsat decision reversed are being eagerly watched by the losing
consortia in the licensing process.
They feel tricked by Mr Solorz, who made great play in public hearings on
the licence that his was a solely Polish-owned venture, a ploy which helped
win a consensus for his bid among the council members.
Now Mr Solorz says he is talking to many foreign broadcasting companies,
which are thought to include Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International, and it
could well be that, sooner or later, one will take up the 33 per cent stake
which Polish law permits a foreign partner to hold in a broadcasting
venture.
Polsat's competitors also argue that as things stand at present Mr Solorz
does not have the financial resources or the expertise to run the channel.
Because of problems with wresting frequencies from the military, for the
first few years the channel will be able to reach only 12m viewers, or a
third of the potential Polish audience.
But if Polsat faces considerable political uncertainty, the financial
problems could be just as great. The Broadcasting Council has imposed very
tight rules demanding that Polsat put out locally-made programmes and
information programmes. This will increase costs. The council will also have
the final say on Mr Solorz's eventual choice of foreign partner.
Meanwhile, the lion's share of the Dollars 130m annual advertising market
will continue to go to state TV, with its two channels which cover the
entire country. At the same time Mr Solorz, whose company is capitalised at
a mere 250bn zlotys, has been bound by the council to increase its capital
to 500bn zlotys and then to 1,000bn zlotys before looking abroad for
financial support.
Given initially low revenues and the political uncertainty surrounding the
licensing decision, that could prove difficult.
The storm also threatens to cloud the chances of the French Canal Plus pay
TV company to which the Broadcasting Council has said it will give local
licences. The French company's offer proved non-controversial and will not
have to depend on a still-to-be-developed advertising market for its
revenues.
But Mr Richard Miazek, one of the council's members, has already resigned,
complaining of stress. Others could follow. Parliament is due to vote on the
council's annual report next month.
Should this be rejected by parliament, the council will have to resign and
that would give the present governing coalition the chance to appoint its
own supporters. Presumably the process would then start all over again.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (23): The press goes private - Publishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE APPLEBAUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By a quirk of politics and history, newspaper publishing has become the most
fully privatised Polish industry. Newspaper publishing, not steel or glass
or cement, is an industry where all the principal companies already possess
a foreign shareholder.
It is also an influential industry. In a survey of reading habits, 90 per
cent of Poles claimed that they read a daily newspaper at least some of the
time, and 68 per cent claimed that they bought at least one weekly.
The explanation for the print media's high level of privatisation can be
traced to 1990, when Poland's first non-communist prime minister, Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, signed a law dissolving RSW Prasa, the press monopoly which
controlled the printing and the content of Polish newspapers.
The law was passed quickly, for political reasons: RSW Prasa was a hated
symbol of the old regime.
The RSW liquidation law was much criticised at the time, since it did not
always change the ownership of newspapers fairly or successfully.
Most provincial newspapers were quickly signed over to 'worker-management'
groups made up of journalists and editors; other papers were sold by auction
to the highest bidder. Robert Hersant, the French owner of Le Figaro, bought
shares in seven provincial titles, and paid Dollars 2m for a 49 per cent
stake in Rzeczpospolita, one of the two quality dailies with a national
circulation.
Other foreign investors include Swiss, Swedish, and American companies.
Nikola Grauso, a Sardinian entrepreneur, bought 55 per cent of Zycie
Warszawy, a Warsaw regional daily. German companies such as Heinrich Bauer
Verlag and Jahr Verlag have entered magazine publishing, and the former
tennis star and entrepreneur, Wojciech Fibak, owns shares in several
provincial papers and magazines.
Since then, only one national newspaper start-up has been significantly
successful - Gazeta Wyborcza, a daily which claims a circulation of 400,000.
Its roots lie in the former dissident movement and its founding editor, Adam
Michnik, was a corruscating critic of the old regime.
One or two regional start-ups, including the right-of-centre Czas, a Krakow
paper, have also proved successful. So has Nie, a satirical weekly whose
editor, Jerzy Urban, is a former communist party spokesman.
With these exceptions, Polish readers have proved remarkably conservative,
preferring to buy familiar titles rather than new ones. A series of
spectacular failures have deterred others. These include an unsuccessful
attempt, backed by the Polish-American Enterprise Fund, to publish a daily
along the lines of USA Today.
This conservatism has until now mostly worked in favour of the provincial
press. Grzegorsz Lindenberg, the former publisher of Gazeta Wyborcza who now
edits and publishes a tabloid, Super Express, estimates that 2.5m Poles buy
regional newspapers every day.
'Most journalists who work for local papers are connected to the old
regime,' he said. Some speculate that the influence of the provincial press
may have helped bring to power the present government, whose leaders come
from the former communist party and its allies.
Gazeta Wyborcza and Rzeczpospolita, the two quality dailies with a large
national circulation, have quite different political orientations. Gazeta
Wyborcza is closely linked to the group of centre-left dissidents who helped
to form the first post-communist government. One of the first newspapers in
Poland to start aggressively pursuing advertisers and to include attractions
such as a weekend colour supplement, Gazeta Wyborcza has in the past year
lost about 10 per cent of its circulation. Many of its readers defected to
Rzeczpospolita, whose circulation has jumped from 250,000 at the start of
1993 to 324,000 in February 1994, and which cleared about Dollars 3m profit
last year.
The paper's editor, Dariusz Fikus, attributes this jump to a more efficient
regional distribution network, and to the rapid rise of Warsaw's stock
market. 'With up to 400,000 people now playing the stock market, more people
want to read our financial and economic supplements,' he said. Others
believe Poles are now more attracted by the impression of neutrality and
solidity, and are less interested in reading an overtly politicised
newspaper.
If newspapers are heading towards greater objectivity in Poland, they are
also heading towards higher technology. Both national papers have also been
the beneficiaries of a technological revolution.
Four years ago, Polish journalists wrote on typewriters. Now, with the help
of capital coming from foreign investors, Gazeta Wyborcza and Rzeczpospolita
have skipped intermediate stages, and moved on to very advanced computer
systems.
At Rzeczpospolita, all reporters have laptop computers and modems, which is
more than many of their counterparts in western Europe are given. Gazeta
Wyborcza has 1,015 computers, 350 of which are linked in a network. Most of
the leading newspapers have also purchased or leased new printing plants,
and some are planning to move into colour printing.
What none of the Polish newspapers yet has is the kind of clout enjoyed by
the western press. 'The Polish press is still not in the position to force
the political class to do anything,' said Mr Lindenberg. Much of the
political weakness of the press is blamed on journalists trained in the
communist era, not all of whom have been certain of the difference between
rumour and news.
Because the press is not thought to tell the truth, press revelations of
bribery scandals and financial skulduggery have yet to force a politician to
resign.
'Not all of us have learned that we must always write what is true, and that
if we do not, we must pay high costs,' said Mr Fikus.
The Polish libel law is still weak; although there have been several
high-profile libel cases, no leading newspaper has yet been forced to make a
large payment to a victim of libel. Until that happens, an air of mistrust
will continue to hang over the journalistic profession in Poland.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (21): Unions fail to learn their lessons -
Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE APPLEBAUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1970s, all Polish schoolchildren were required to memorise a poem, in
Russian, about the portrait of Lenin which hung from their classroom walls:
'When the sun rises and looks into our classroom, it lights up brightly a
painting on the wall; like a word of greeting for a good day, Vladimir
Ilyich, as if alive, is looking at me.'
These days, Polish children no longer learn such rhymes. The textbooks are
different, the lectures in atheism have been replaced by catechism,
references to Marx and Engels have been eliminated from lessons. But while
Lenin may have disappeared from the classroom walls, the structure of the
Polish educational system itself remains essentially unchanged.
Politics determined the shape of the system in the past, and politics
continue to shape the reform of the system even now. The Polish parliament
contains fewer than a dozen lawyers but more than five dozen teachers, most
of whom are members of the ZNP, the former communist Polish Teachers' Union.
Together with workers from the health services, whose salaries also come out
of the central budget, teachers form the largest pressure group in
parliament.
On the ground, teachers also represent a large source of votes for the
former communists and communist allies who now lead Poland's ruling
coalition. For four years, however, the teachers' unions have also been in
the forefront of resistance to change, economic and otherwise.
Not that anyone outside the teaching profession doubts the need for
educational reforms. A World Bank report on Polish education, published in
June 1993, found irrelevant vocational programmes, serious shortages of
foreign language teachers and a lack of technical and computer literacy. It
concluded that 'failure to increase (secondary education's) relevance and to
improve its cost-effectiveness . . . will constrain the capacity of
enterprises and individuals to adjust to their new economic environment.'
Expenditure on education is declining in Poland, from 4.6 per cent of GDP in
1990, to 3.1 per cent in 1992, well below the average of about 5 per cent of
GDP spent in most west European countries. Yet reduction of financing has
not been accompanied by better management. Polish schools have run up high
debts, and although theoretically free, often require parental funding to
stay afloat. This is true not only of the 600 or so new private and
non-profit schools which have appeared since 1989, but of most ordinary
primary and secondary schools as well.
Teachers themselves are a particular problem. About 10 per cent of Polish
teachers do not have a university education, while others teach subjects
(most notably the Russian language) which are no longer required. The
ministry of education estimates that at least half are under-qualified and
in some subjects - chemistry, for example - the figure is closer to 75 per
cent. Yet university classes are notoriously overcrowded, and academic pay
is so low that Andrzej Siemaszko, a professor of sociology at Warsaw
University, believes that within a few years, universities may find it
impossible to employ anyone. Mr Siemaszko, who supplements his own salary by
playing the new stock market in Warsaw, said that 'no professors here can
afford to work for the university alone'.
Polish primary and secondary school teachers work unusually short hours (on
average, 18 hours a week) but are paid to match: last year, the average
secondary school teacher earned a monthly salary of 3.7m zlotys (Dollars
170). To solve this problem, the former government of Prime Minister Hanna
Suchocka published a reform programme in 1993 which called for teachers to
obtain higher qualifications, to work 40 hours a week, and to receive higher
pay as well.
That proposal was heavily criticised by the ZNP, which believed, probably
rightly, that such a change would make many teachers redundant. Asked
recently whether the union would agree to longer hours and higher standards,
Jan Zaciura, the chairman of the ZNP, replied that the union would not,
because 'that would be a revolution. Besides, law cannot work
retroactively.' By that, he meant that those teachers who are now irrelevant
or under-qualified should not be threatened with the loss of their jobs.
The union has also opposed attempts to decentralise education - to hand
responsibility for financing over to local government, for example  - on the
grounds that such a change would weaken the strength of the union. About a
quarter of schools are financed by gminy (local governments); during a
nationwide teachers' strike last May, only teachers from centrally-funded
schools stayed away, while teachers in locally-funded schools refused to
join.
While it has not, so far, bowed to the demands of its electorate in other
spheres, the government appears prepared to do so in the field of education.
Aleksander Luczak, the new minister of education, has not openly reversed
the Suchocka government programme, but sources in the ministry say that he
does not intend to fight the ZNP. Already, about 10 per cent of the ministry
employees hired by past Solidarity governments have been made redundant,
including at least one of the authors of the Suchocka government programme.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (22): Easing the pain of reform - Labour
and Social Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's finance minister Derek Keys likes to describe himself as 'the
minister of the bloody obvious'. His main job is to explain the limits and
the economic costs of demands from newly-enfranchised Blacks for social and
economic reforms.
Mr Leszek Miller, the former communist apparatchik who now finds himself in
a similar hot seat as Poland's minister for labour and social affairs, sees
his role as 'the minister for keeping the pain of economic transformation
within tolerable limits'.
The South African has a snappier one-liner, but the two men are clearly
tackling the same problem, albeit from opposing angles. The problem is how
to persuade enough people to accept only minimal improvements in their
immediate living standards to allow reforms and investment the time needed
to deliver the higher employment, better pay and improved services voters
really want now.
Mr Miller is lucky on two counts. Although the reversal of political
fortunes has put the 2m-strong Solidarity Union, with its tradition of
militant anti-communism, back in opposition to the government, the union is
weak in the fast-growing private sector where much of the new wealth and
most of Poland's new jobs are being created. Its old power base in the
mines, railways, shipyards and big factories has been eroded by
unemployment, and faces further reduction with the onward march of
privatisation.
Second, Mr Miller has an ally in Mrs Ewa Spychalska, the former Solidarity
unionist who switched to become the leader of the rival OPZZ union, which
was built up by the communists in the 1980s to counter the power and
influence of the then 10m-strong Solidarity anti-communist alliance of
workers, intellectuals and the Catholic church.
The OPZZ has more than 70 deputies in the new parliament, making it the
second largest faction in the governing SLD party after the Social Democrats
led by Alexander Kwasniewski. Mrs Spychalska is one of the most influential
deputies. Her view is that 'the bulk of Polish society decided in favour of
systemic change in 1989 and the unions were part of that decision. As for
capitalism, it has many forms and we look at developed capitalist systems
with interest and hope'.
Mr Miller conveys the same sentiments, but in a different way. 'Experience
has shown that the famous debate between the revolutionary Lenin and the
evolutionary Kautski has been settled in favour of the latter,' he says
bluntly.
He is anxious to dispel any suspicion that the election led in any way to a
restoration of the old system, although a fair proportion of the backbench
MPs elected on the SLD ticket and many of their voters, still hanker for the
good old days when security was absolute, mediocrity was a virtue and
laziness came with the job.
But his roots in working class Lodz, a depressed textile town making valiant
efforts to revitalise itself, give Mr Miller a shrewd idea of what the
voters who put the left back into power will stand. 'If Poles feel that the
cost of transformation is too high, or too unfair, society will reject
market reforms. So it is up to us to protect the continuation of market
reforms by making sure that these costs are bearable.'
As for fairness, Mr Miller backed down from his controversial proposal to
fund higher social spending by imposing a small tax on share transactions in
deference to the wider government objective of earning much greater revenue,
by selling off state shareholdings through the stock exchange at the highest
possible price.
That's pragmatism. But the share tax idea is likely to return, as is another
of Mr Miller's ideas - that any above budget revenue arising from faster
economic growth should at least be partly allocated to higher spending on
health, education and pensions and targeted on the poorest and most helpless
parts of society.
At the same time, however, Mr Miller also supports plans, inherited largely
from the previous Solidarity governments, for structural reforms which
involve the creation of self-financing, contributory national insurance and
national health systems which will take the strain off future budgets.
'Great social reforms are ahead of us in the benefit system, including
health and social security. Every reform will hurt somebody's interest and
we certainly don't expect any standing ovations. The paradox of Poland is
that it is a leftist government which now has to take on such tasks,' he
sighs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE APPLEBAUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent visit to the Dr J. Biziela Hospital in the western city of
Bydgoszcz found the hospital's economic director, Leszek Kowalik, on the
telephone arguing about the proposed purchase of a new piece of diagnostic
equipment. 'Professor,' he shouted down the line, 'we have negotiated with
everyone, now we are negotiating with some Italians who might sell more
cheaply, but it won't be ready just yet, I am sorry.'
A recent visit to the Polish ministry of health in Warsaw, on the other
hand, found the the new health minister, Ryszard Zochowski, staying late in
his office, unable to go home for the evening due to ongoing negotiations
with the health service unions. These unions, he said, did not understand
that the ministry could not increase their pay. 'Our budget was allotted to
us by the former government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka, and it is not
sufficient. Next year,' he concluded, 'I am sure it will be different.'
The similarity between the concerns of Mr Kowalik and Mr Zochowski is not
accidental. Caught between demands for modern medical supplies and demands
for higher salaries, the bureaucrats and politicians who run the Polish
health system find themselves, these days, almost constantly negotiating for
more money.
In recent months, the negotiations have taken on a new urgency. Cuts in
public sector funding, including the virtual freezing of salaries for
Poland's 735,000 health service workers, helped create public
dissatisfaction with the Solidarity-affiliated governments which ran Poland
for four years.
The present government, composed of parties affiliated to the former
communist party, promised to improve public sector funding. Now, Minister
Zochowski faces a high level of political pressure: he must placate an
electorate which is demanding better service and a group of trade unions
demanding higher pay, while at the same time operating a health system which
spends only Dollars 75 per capita, a figure well below western European
levels of Dollars 1,200 to Dollars 2,000 per capita.
Few believe that there can be much improvement in either service or salaries
if the health care financing system remains unchanged. At present, all
health care - including hospitals, clinics, and medical training - is
ultimately financed out of the central budget, although local governments do
help distribute some of the money.
Given the stringency of Poland's recent budgets, it is hardly surprising
that this system of central budget funding leaves hospitals in a Catch-22
position. On the one hand, as Mr Kowalik pointed out, the Biziela hospital
receives only enough money from the state budget to pay its operating costs,
70 per cent of which consisting of salaries, to make really large savings.
Incapable either of investment or of real savings, the hospital has slid
slowly into debt, and saves money by skimping on essentials. A mere 18,000
zlotys, about Dollars 0.81,is spent on feeding each patient three meals a
day. The average doctors' basic pay in Biziela Hospital is 3.3m zlotys
(Dollars 150) a month.
As a result, the Polish health service is famous for queues and bad food,
and Polish doctors - although many are no less qualified than their western
counterparts - are famed for their inattentiveness. Health care has also
ceased, in fact, to be free for everyone.
As in hospitals elsewhere in Poland, most doctors in the Biziela hospital
have been forced to turn to some form of private practice. Some do this
legally: one doctor in the department of internal medicine said he had set
up an office for private consultations in his home, along with many of his
colleagues. Appointments can be made faster, and medical standards are
believed to be higher in this new, semi-official private sector.
Others earn money illegally. At the Biziela hospital, a story, possibly
apocryphal but certainly typical, is doing the rounds. Allegedly, an elderly
patient was asked to pay 15m zlotys for an operation. Not knowing that this
was a bribe rather than an obligatory contribution, he wrote to the
hospital's director, to ask for a reduction. Bribery can also take the form
of gifts to nurses, who earn on average 2.4m zlotys, a month.
Although reforms of health finance have been much discussed, the governments
of the past four years have so far achieved very little. Like his
predecessors, Minister Zochowski favours a mixed system - one which, in
other words, would ask people to continue paying for part of their health
care, but in a more regulated manner.
The ministry is proposing to let the central government fund health
education and big central investments, while at the same time creating a
national insurance system to finance both family doctors and hospitals.
Although the project is not beyond the planning stages - it is not clear,
for example, whether the insurance system will be wholly state-run or partly
private - he said he hoped to begin putting such a system in place by the
end of the year. The health service unions say they support the switch to a
partially paid system. According to Mr Zochowski, they are now complaining
that the changes should be brought about faster.
But there are also fears that doctors and nurses will not support such
changes in practice. 'We know that about half the doctors in this hospital
support some form of privatisation in the health system,' said the doctor of
internal medicine at Biziela Hospital. 'We know that half are against.
Obviously, they are against because they make profits within this system,
and prefer not to face more competition.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (19): Doubling connections -
Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Successive Polish governments since 1989 have recognised that improving the
country's telecommunications system is central to the chances of attracting
foreign investment and economic growth.
To pay for a better service in future telephone charges have been forced
upwards, giving Telekomunikacja Polska (TP SA), the state-owned operator, a
70 per cent profit margin from which to finance development and supplement
World Bank loans and supplier credits.
The present centre-left government appears set on continuing this policy
with Mr Andrzej Zielinski, the new telecommunications minister, confirming
his predecessor's aim to have 10m lines installed by the end of the century,
double the present lineage. Mr Jerzy Stopczyk, TP SA's investment manager,
recognises that even if his company were to slow its investment efforts
private operators would step in to fill the gap. 'The rapid growth of the
past few years has got people used to the idea that telephones are
accessible and they will go elsewhere if we don't provide them,' he says.
Already some 70 licences have been issued to mainly small local private
projects which have yet to become operational. But RP Telekom, a company
working with Sprint of the US, is forging ahead on plans to provide a
private service in Pila and in Katowice in the first significant challenge
to the state-owned operator.
Meanwhile, TP SA plans to invest Dollars 600m this year on the installation
of 680,000 lines and around the same number is planned for 1995.
Recent capital investment has already improved international connections
significantly and by the end of this year the inter-city network, the
country's present communications nightmare, should be two-thirds complete.
Previous governments consciously chose a policy of restricting the number of
equipment suppliers to three - AT&amp;T from the US and Alcatel and Siemens from
Europe. These were then forced not only to buy ailing Polish
telecommunications equipment plants but also to produce half of the
equipment to be supplied to TP SA locally.
Mr Stanislaw Szuder, the head of AT&amp;T Telfa which has an agreement to supply
the Gdansk district with 230,000 lines, says he is happy with the
arrangement and confident the deal will go ahead. Private financing from
abroad for the project worth Dollars 150m still has to be agreed with TP SA
however in a deal which is expected to be closed in the autumn.
For the rest, TP SA is preparing a three-year plan to run till 1997 giving
suppliers an idea of what its short-term needs are.
Meanwhile, Centertel, a mobile phone operator jointly owned by TP SA,
Ameritech of the US and France Telekom, is pressing ahead with installing
its NMT phone system and already has around 11,000 subscribers. It will face
a formidable challenge, though, when the government decides to go ahead with
a tender for a more modern GSM network which in contrast to Centertel which
operates on 450 mhz, will be compatible with other European networks.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (16): Network lined up for more severe cuts
 -Railways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polish Railways (PKP) set great store by their plans to speed up the journey
time between Warsaw and Berlin by 85 minutes in 1997.
'It will be our visiting card,' says an enthusiastic Alexander Janiszewski,
the head of PKP, who is sorely constrained in his modernisation plans by
running losses which have to be covered each year out of the railways'
investment funds.
Seed money for the Ecu487m (Dollars 535m) Warsaw-to-Berlin project has come
from an ECU30m grant provided under the European Union's Phare (aid for
eastern Europe) programme. Further financing is to come from a European
Investment Bank Ecu200m loan which needs only Polish government guarantees
to be completed.
Talks are also advanced on an additional Ecu50m loan from the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development. Only the World Bank has doubts about the
plan which by bringing travel time down to 5 1/2 hours between the two city
centres would reduce the rail journey to within striking distance of
competing with flight time between Warsaw and Berlin.
'The World Bank thinks the project will divert resources from more pressing
needs elsewhere on our system,' Mr Janiszewski admits. But the PKP's overall
plans involve contraction rather than expansion. PKP is cutting lines as
economic changes of the past five years have brought a sharp fall in goods
and passenger traffic. The railways now carry less than half the goods
carried at their peak in 1980 when they moved 480m tonnes, compared with
214m tonnes last year, and carried 1.1bn passengers, compared with 530m in
1993.
Rail management estimates that the country only needs half of its 24,000km
network. Already 1,000km have been taken out of service since 1989 and
another 4,000km are slated for closure. Mr Janiszewski is hoping to hand a
further 3,000km to local governments.
The cut in traffic means that employees are having to be laid off in the
face of resistance led by the Solidarity trade union. Over 80,000 jobs have
been cut on the railways since 1989 leaving a total workforce of 252,000 at
the end of last year. A further 5,000 job losses are planned for this year.
At the beginning of the 1980s the railways employed some 450,000 people.
The cuts are also affecting rolling stock purchases and have hit the great
industrial suppliers - the Pawafag factory in Wroclaw and the Cegielski
works in Poznan. Cegielski has been especially vociferous in demanding that
PKP buy its Z-2 standard passenger cars which are not suited to the
high-speed line planned between Berlin and Warsaw.
The protests have, however, produced a deal with ABB Wagon Union in Berlin
under which Cegielski will co-operate in producing the first 50 modern cars
worth DM130m (Dollars 74m) and will also be handed the technology to produce
subsequent orders. Hermes, the German export credits agency, is financing
the deal which is backed by guarantees from Bank Handlowy and the finance
ministry.
Meanwhile, the factory has won a breathing space as PKP is buying 33 of the
older standard cars Cegielski makes to replace some of its 8,000 or so
existing stock at prices set at below production cost. Pawafag in Wroclaw
can only hope for orders from PKP to the extent of between 10 and five
electric locomotives a year as replacements for the 2,300 in service.
The privatisation ministry thinks that is enough to secure the future of the
factory which has just been put up for sale. Several leading western
companies, including Siemens, GEC Alsthom and ABB Henschel, have indicated
an interest in Pawafag which producedeight electric locomotives last year.
But Mr Janiszewski's priority is maintaining the level of the state budget
subsidy, set at 6,500bn zlotys for 1994.
Last year the subsidy amounted to 6,800bn zlotys which, with costs reaching
53,000bn zlotys and revenues of 44,000bn zlotys, still left a 2,200bn zlotys
deficit. Rail subsidies, he notes, are higher abroad and were they to be
further reduced then passenger services provided by PKP would have to
suffer.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (18): Red tape slows pace - Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE APPLEBAUM, Foreign Editor, The Spectator
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On one Warsaw corner, a building pockmarked by bullets fired during the
second world war is falling down. On the next corner, a brand new set of
offices, built with the money of foreign investors, is already in operation.
Slums stand beside prosperous shops, unfinished office blocks dot the
landscape. But the confusion is only the outward manifestation of a property
market that is growing very quickly, but not always consistently.
In fact, the Polish property market presents something of a paradox. On the
one hand, Poland faces urgent shortages of all kinds of housing and
commercial property. As in the past, young Polish couples live with their
parents due to the absence of cheap housing. At the other end of the market
Sprint, the American telecommunications company, recently asked Peter
Choynowski, the chairman of Prime Property Inc, to find 50 large houses,
built to American standards, for its employees. 'We've found 12,' he said,
'and we look for more every day.' Rents are upwards of Dollars 2,500 a
month; the asking price of one new, four-bedroom house in one of the better
Warsaw neighbourhoods is Dollars 450,000.
At the same time, however, property prices at all but the very highest level
of the market - a tiny handful of new office buildings in Warsaw and a few
large, well-located houses - are relatively low compared to other prices,
and have, in fact, dropped since the collapse of the communist regime. A
high quality, 100 square metre flat in central Warsaw can sell for as little
as Dollars 50,000, and smaller flats in new apartment blocks change hands
for Dollars 10,000. This is partly because recession and rapid economic
changes have forced many more properties on to a market which was
artificially small in the past. Low prices are also connected to several
bottlenecks which are peculiar to Poland's transitional economy.
It is still legally impossible to evict anyone from his 'primary residence'
and for this reason banks are wary of granting mortgages. Until the law,
which is due to change, is altered, most housing property will be purchased
with cash. 'Because they can't take out loans, people right now prefer to
rent than to buy,' said Ryszard Strzelczyk, the chairman of the Strzelczyk
Corporation estate agency.
As in the past, over-regulation and the slow pace of bureaucracy also
continue to affect the market. To buy land or buildings, foreigners are
still required to obtain clearance from the interior ministry. While few
purchasers are turned down, the procedure can add months to a transaction.
Land sales are further hampered - and development projects slowed - by
confusion over plans to carry out 're-privatisation', which would allow some
owners whose property was confiscated by the communist government to reclaim
it. Although much discussed, the law on re-privatisation has yet to pass,
and until it does - or decisively does not - many transactions will remain
on hold.
The other important bottleneck is the difficulty of obtaining finance - a
problem which Chris Grzesik of Price Waterhouse called a 'chicken-and-egg
situation'. Most Polish banks will not lend money to developers, he said,
until they have at least 30 per cent of their space pre-let. Yet, most
Polish companies, wary of
plans which often fell through in the past, will not sign a lease until a
project is well under way.
For those who can overcome bureaucratic obstacles, several trends are clear.
Because very high quality office space is virtually unavailable in Warsaw,
rents in the centre of the city are high. One Polish-American joint venture,
the Warsaw Corporate Centre, has rented out 90 per cent of its office space
at Dollars 50 a square metre since its completion in 1993. Most other
projects with foreign funding are in the planning stages, mostly slowed by
financing problems. Those which are further along include a joint venture
between Skanska, the Swedish developers, and the local authority, which is
designed to create 80,000 square metres of office space in central Warsaw.
The development of Warsaw's suburbs is also just beginning. Standard flats
in tower blocks are still being sold and purchased - they constitute, after
all, the bulk of the market - but the acquisition of a dzialka budowlana, a
piece of land on which to build a house, is what most Polish families are
now saving for. Some are now buying land which is not yet approved for
residential use. Several foreign companies have started development
projects, often using identical housing 'kits' imported from abroad,
although none has succeeded yet on a large scale. Already, in relatively
close suburbs such as Wilanow and Anin, more carefully designed family
houses are being built with the expectation that they will be worth several
hundred thousand dollars.
The bottleneck holding up suburban development is the absence of good roads
and public transportation. This is true of all principal Polish cities, but
Warsaw in particular. Many would-be suburban settlements in the more distant
satellite villages also lack proper sewage, water and electricity
installations.
Perhaps the best sign of the increasing interest in property is the
financial health, and increasing sophistication, of Warsaw's estate agents.
Once famous for being little more than individual brokers who took their
clients round the city on public buses, the big agencies now have
catalogues, computers, and advertising campaigns.
The Dragowski Agency, the largest in Warsaw, has an annual turnover of
nearly Dollars 1.5m and that is before the boom which Lech Dragowski, the
company's chairman, believes is coming within the next year or two. 'It is
senseless for Poles to invest in property while the stock market is still
rising 20 per cent every month,' he said. 'But when that ends, we may be one
of the beneficiaries.'

Poland, a flat country at the centre of Europe, is a road builder's dream.
As traffic density builds up and the importance of transit traffic grows, an
ambitious toll motorway building programme costing over Dollars 6bn and
stretching until 2007 is taking shape.
Mr Boguslaw Liberadzki, the transport minister, argues that the financial
burden of the programme cannot be carried by the state. Nor should the state
operate the 2,600km of the north-south and east-west motorways he wants
built over the next 15 years.
'I don't believe that a state-owned enterprise will do this in the most
efficient and profitable way possible,' he emphasises.
'Nor do I think that the state should take on new debt burdens to finance
the programme - it has enough on its plate as it is,' he adds referring to
Poland's heavy existing foreign debt.
His words would not raise eyebrows if coming from a minister in Poland's
previous free-market liberal governments.
But Mr Liberadzki is a member of the centre-left government elected in last
autumn and his words reflect the market-orientated pragmatism of the new
generation of social democratic politicians even though their origins trace
back to the communist years.
In another break with the past, Mr Liberadzki is also determined that the
new Motorway Agency, which will oversee the road building programme and
operate the routes, will 'above all be staffed by qualified financiers and
lawyers rather than by engineers'.
The state will oversee the new agency, and be reposnible for procuring the
land requird. Land purchase alone is expected to cost 1,500bn zlotys a year
for the next two decades, and amount to around 15 per cent of the cost of
the entire programme.
The agency will also be responsible for ensuring that the motorways, once
operational, are kept in good repair. But the engineers will be 'on tap, not
on top' as they were in the socialist period.
Mr Stefan Kirk, of Morgan Grenfell which helped finan ce Hungary's M1
motorway linking Budapest with the Austrian frontier, underlines that
'expert advice is of particular importance in view of the financial
complexity of these projects'.
Each new road will need 'reliable and adequate traffic projections' before
proceeding, he adds.
Mr Liberadzki agrees that Poland needs in-depth market studies to analyse
the surroundings of the routes up to 50km on either side and to look for
ways of channelling maximum traffic on to the tollways. He still has time
for the studies as the draft law governing the road building and operating
programme is still at the consultation stage between government departments.
It is expected to be approved by parliament later this year.
Only then will the main routes be put out to tender by the Motorway Agency
to consortia capable of offering construction, capacity financing and
operating ability. Mr Liberadzki says Dollars 500m should suffice to build
between 150km and 170km of motorway in the first stage of the 138,000bn
zloty (Dollars 6.2bn) programme.
The focus at present is concentrated on raising private funding. There is
little sign of more substantial funds coming from the European Union, in
spite of grandiose plans for trans-European networks, including a Berlin to
Moscow road link, unveiled last December by Mr Jacques Delors.
The four main routes planned include the 626km east-west motorway linking
Terespol on the eastern frontier to Warsaw and on across the western border
to Berlin, and the 502km link between Gdansk on the Baltic with the southern
border. Another 482 km east-west link is planned in the south between Medyka
and Germany.
The most controversial project is a 365km motorway which would link
Scandinavia via the port of Szczecin to the Czech frontier and on to
southern Europe. The latter roadway was added to the programme last
December.
The previous government's programme, accepted in the summer, only contained
the first three routes. But Scandinavian interest in acquiring fast access
to central and southern Europe through Poland is high and traffic in the
western territories is growing fast. At the same time a new high capacity
road would help to relieve the pressure on the German autobahns on the other
side of the Oder-Neisse rivers which mark the border.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (9): More than whisky galore - Food
exporters demand a national trade mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wild heather moors. Clear mountain streams. Deer and cattle roaming freely
in hills and glens.
Such are the images mentioned when foreigners are asked what Scotland means
to them. Harnessing these visions of unbridled nature into something
commercial might seem like trying to sell Scotch mist in a bottle, but the
leaders of Scotland's food and farming industry are intent on doing just
that. They want to create a trade mark to promote food and drink products
for their purity and quality.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland, which has initiated quality
marketing schemes for several agricultural sectors, says the Scottish
Quality Mark would emulate the Appellation Controlee system for French wine
or the Woolmark for knitwear.
In January the government gave the go-ahead for a business plan showing how
the quality mark would operate. The plan, which should be ready by the
summer, follows a report by the government-appointed Scottish Food Strategy
Group.
Mr James Millar, chairman of the group and of the Dundee-based supermarket
chain, Wm Low, says the mark would probably first be used for sales in the
UK and selective continental markets where Scottish produce has a
particularly good image. These include Paris and other big French cities,
southern Germany and northern Italy. The report says that, while Scottish
salmon and whisky are well-known, 'the level of perception of the general
range of Scottish food products remains low throughout Europe'.
Farming experts say the country needs aggressive marketing because of the
drawbacks associated with its natural advantages. If it is remote from
pollution, it is also remote from the cities where most of its potential
customers live. Targeting markets will be all the more important as the Gatt
deal and Common Agricultural Policy reforms prepare hitherto protected
European farmers for exposure to world market forces.
Livestock products account for 45 per cent of Scotland's agricultural
output. But competition for outlets will probably increase as CAP reform
reduces the amount of beef being accepted into intervention stores and
forces more on to the open market.
Fortunately for Scottish producers, animals reared using non-intensive
farming methods - the only way to farm much of the country's hilly terrain -
not only receive extra subsidies from Brussels but appear to be what
consumers want.
Exporters such as ANM Group, Scotland's biggest farmer co-operative, are
finding a ready market on the continent.
Like overall food output, beef production is 1 per cent or less of the EU
total. Scottish producers need to do more to help themselves, for example by
ceasing to export live animals and whole carcasses to France, says Mr Donald
MacRae, TSB Bank's agricultural specialist. 'It seems quite wrong to give
all the 'value added' to the French,' he said. 'It would make a lot more
sense for us to do the processing here.'
About 15 per cent of Scottish beef is already being sold through a scheme
guaranteeing its quality. The Farm Assured Scotch Livestock scheme, promoted
by the NFU, puts 500,000 lambs and 76,000 cattle to market each year.
Quality assurance schemes provide codes of practice for farmers and
standards for processors on, for example, animal welfare, feeding, chemical
inputs, hygiene and slaughter. The product's history is traceable back from
the supermarket shelf through processing to the production stage. 'Consumers
want to be assured that farming is environmentally-friendly,' says Alastair
Alexander, NFU marketing director.
Scotland already has schemes for pork, salmon, trout, cheese and venison and
others are planned for cereals and soft fruit. The financial advantages can
be considerable. Consumer research showed that 76 per cent of consumers were
prepared to pay more for Scottish salmon with the 'Tartan Mark' guarantee of
quality. This salmon was the first foreign product to be awarded the 'Label
Rouge' - a French mark of superior quality - in 1991 and commands a premium
of 10 to 12 per cent above other Scottish salmon sold there.
But introduction of a single Scottish quality mark faces potential
obstacles. It must be accepted by leading retailers, who may be sceptical
about its usefulness, said Mr MacRae.
'I can see some retailers saying: what is the quality mark doing for us? It
needs to have a decent amount of money so it becomes established in people's
minds and the big retailers can't ignore it.'
The food strategy group called for Pounds 450,000 a year for the body
operating the mark, Pounds 2m for a launch campaign in the UK, and an annual
promotion budget for all its markets of at least Pounds 5m. The government
and private sector will need to be persuaded of its worth.
Scottish food manufacturers already well-established in foreign markets may
be reluctant to share a common quality mark that could be more useful to
smaller competitors than to them.
Winning over farmers may prove difficult, too. Some farmers - such as hill
farmers who sell their sheep to be fattened on richer lowland pastures - are
a long way from the final consumer, and marketing may seem irrelevant.
The food strategy group admits there is some reluctance to join quality
assurance schemes. Mr MacRae goes further, accusing some farmers of a lack
of vision. A survey of farmers by the TSB and the NFU found concern that
membership of a scheme would involve hefty costs and much record-keeping -
both misconceptions, according to proponents of the schemes.
'It's not the cheapest that wins,' says Mr MacRae. 'Farmers have to buy the
quality argument, and in many cases they don't'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (8): EU funding may be a ray of hope in
the gloom - The Highlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The far north of Scotland has always had too many of its eggs in too few
baskets, according to Mr Sandy Brady, director of strategic planning for
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE).
This harsh truth has been cruelly underlined by the rapid rundown of the two
large oil rig construction yards which brought considerable prosperity for
most of the last 20 years to communities around the Moray and Cromarty
Firths.
The speed of the downturn is alarming. The McDermott yard at Ardersier, near
Inverness, now employs just 50 people on a care and maintenance basis - down
from a peak of 3,500 at the beginning of 1992. The Highland Fabricators yard
at Nigg in Easter Ross still has enough work for 700 people - but that is
down from a level of 2,000 in 1992.
Mr Brady is optimistic that orders will return to the yards, although
changes in technology mean employment levels are likely be more modest. But
policy makers must also face the possibility that - like the closed
aluminium smelter at Invergordon - the era of the big oil rig yards is
coming to an end in the Highlands.
The more diversified Inverness economy has coped relatively well with the
downturn, although unemployment has crept up to 12 per cent (high, but still
below the Highland average). The impact has been much worse in the Nairn and
Forres area, where unemployment is 19 per cent, and Easter Ross, where it is
16 per cent.
Job shops and retraining have helped an estimated 500 workers find
short-term contracts offshore or overseas, which has helped keep money
coming into the local economy and prevented a crash in property prices. Many
others are thought to have left the area.
However, the loss of lucrative blue-collar work will continue to be keenly
felt - particularly in Easter Ross communities such as Alness, which
attracted immigrants from the central belt of Scotland and beyond to work in
the now-defunct smelter.
Looking back on the coming of the rig yards, Mr Brady says: 'We would have
preferred to have had 40 small-scale enterprises, but that was not an option
we were offered. The ideal pattern for the Highlands is much more diverse
than we have had.'
A ray of hope in this gloom is the recent designation of the Highlands and
Islands as one of the European Union's poorest regions for the purpose of
economic assistance. It means the area could attract Pounds 260m over the
next six years.
Mr Brady says this decision, long lobbied for by the HIE, offered the chance
for a one-off improvement in the infrastructure.
Putting themselves in the same category as the - mainly southern - EU
countries qualifying for maximum EU funds was uncomfortable for officials at
HIE, who have long stressed the area's high-technology potential.
However, they could stress the region's remoteness. One key indicator was
sparsity of population, which is the lowest density in the EU. Only 2 per
cent of the land is arable.
Since remoteness was such an important reason for winning the EU cash, there
is understandable concern in the more outlying areas that the cash should
get to them - and not just be funnelled into Inverness and its catchment
area.
To avoid unseemly squabbling, it seems likely that the funds will be
allocated on an area basis, with local committees choosing which of the
range of possible projects should attract support.
Increased attention will certainly be paid to tourism, which already
accounts for 20 per cent of the region's gross domestic product and employs
about 20 per cent of its total workforce. Tourism, Mr Brady says, has
enjoyed slow but steady long-term growth, although this had been masked in
recent years by global recession and a run of poor summers. Winter sports
had also suffered two bad seasons; this season seemed to be much better.
HIE aims to extend the season, lengthen accommodation occupation levels and
encourage visitors to travel more widely. Mr Brady says: 'Autumn tourism is
good, with significant activity in October. We must concentrate on the
spring, which is only busy around Easter.'
By giving employment for about eight months a year, HIE hopes the local
population will see local tourism offering practically full-time jobs.
The salmon farming industry, which employs more than 6,000 people and has
brought much-needed work to even the remotest areas, is a particular area of
concern.
A recent study of Norwegian salmon farming by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy
firm, concluded that over the past five years the industry has enjoyed a 20
per cent subsidy on its cost of production from the Norwegian government.
Because of a surge in Norway's production, salmon prices in the EU have
collapsed well below the break-even point of many Scottish producers. Some
85 per cent of Norwegian salmon is exported to the EU. Brussels recently
lifted the minimum import price to Pounds 2.74 a kilo, but Scottish farmers
say this is still insufficient to restore their profitability.
Mr Brady says: 'We have tried very hard to put pressure on in Edinburgh,
London and Brussels - but it is not an issue over which the UK government
wants to have a stand-up fight with the Norwegians.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (7): North Sea learns to live with low
tide - Aberdeen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North-east Scotland has learned to live with the oil industry, which has set
it apart from the rest of the UK economy, producing local booms in times of
national recession and local recession when the good times are rolling
elsewhere.
Now the UK economy is struggling out of recession as the North Sea suffers
another employment downturn, but there is cautious optimism in the area
(Aberdonians are unfamiliar with reckless optimism) that the north-east is
not about to head off in the other direction again.
Professor Alec Kemp, of Aberdeen University's economics department, says
North Sea employment probably peaked in 1991 and is falling slowly. The
combination of the current very low oil price and a high production cost per
barrel because of lower production levels from oilfields developed in the
1970s has, he said, pushed companies to look for ways to economise.
Many new fields are smaller and require fewer people. Exploration drilling
has slowed since last year's petroleum revenue tax changes.
Mr Tom Snowling, economic research officer with Grampian regional council,
agrees that the oil companies, learning from the mistakes of the 1970s and
1980s, are much more cost conscious - a far cry from the industry's
free-spending days, when oil companies paid top rates for the skilled people
on whom traditional fishing and farming, paper and textiles industries had
relied.
Technology has helped. New drilling techniques mean fewer platforms are
needed to get the oil out, and smaller crews are needed for the platforms.
For example, Total's Dunbar jacket and topside is designed for a crew of 16,
a fraction of what would have been needed 10 years ago. Hook-ups of
platforms are now done with a few hundred people (a legend of the 1980s is
of 3,000 people on one platform, where there was standing room only).
But it is thought that only about a third of the 27,500 offshore workforce
live in the area: most live in central Scotland, north-east England and
further afield. Prof Kemp says the effect on the local economy of the
offshore slowdown will be offset by continuing relocation of high-skill,
high-wage personnel.
Intense local lobbying helped push the Department of Trade and Industry last
year to relocate to Aberdeen part of its petroleum exploration directorate.
That, says Professor Kemp, will have a knock-on effect in relocation of oil
company personnel who have to deal with the DTI on new field development and
field abandonment.
There is also, he says, a continuing movement of oil-related companies to
the north-east simply because it is still cheaper than south-east England
and more cost-effective to be nearer the activity.
One change in the industry which could have long-term implications is the
trend, among oil producers, away from engaging a large number of specialist
contractors, towards partnership agreements with a small number of prime
contractors.
The bigger service companies are now signing long-term arrangements with
operators where, says Sir Ian Wood, chairman of John Wood Group, Scotland's
largest private company, 'they are helping an operator drive his business.
We sit down with the operator and try to understand what he wants to achieve
and work with him in ways in which we share in his risk.'
Five years ago his company would have sought a straightforward maintenance
contract on one platform. Now it will negotiate, with an operator and five
or six specialist subcontractors, a design, construction and maintenance
programme on a number of platforms.
This, he says, has cut costs. In the longer term, such companies could
diversify into other areas, such as power generation, and should have the
size and expertise needed to operate in the international oil marketplace.
Sir Ian talks of consolidating a 'mini-Houston' in north-east Scotland.
Sir Ian, who is also chairman of the government-backed economic development
body Grampian Enterprise, acknowledges that an economy based on a wasting
resource has to look to its other industries.
The Aberdeen area, he says, 'has become an uncomfortably unbalanced
environment'. A generation has grown up in Aberdeen that has not known a
time without oil. Traditional industries have had to cope with a higher cost
base than anywhere else in Scotland.
Both he and Mr Derek Marnoch, chief executive of Aberdeen Chamber of
Commerce, believe oil has helped the area's other industries by making the
business climate more competitive, risk-aware and generally sharper.
Mr Marnoch talks of an economy working on two levels, with those outside the
oil industry struggling in an area where oil drives housing and other costs
 -but he believes there are probably more second earners than there are
elsewhere in Scotland.
As a high-wage area, the way to survive has been to work at the quality end
of the market - always the case for an area whose distance from the main
marketplaces means high transport costs. For example, the area's four paper
mills produce about 600,000 tonnes of paper and board a year, about 10 per
cent of UK output. But 400,000 tonnes is high-value printing and writing
stationery, about 20 per cent of the UK total.
Although they are in the same industry, the four mills are not direct
competitors, which allows them to co-operate in areas such as training.
Mr Ed Gillespie, general manager at Arjo Wiggins's paper mill on the
outskirts of Aberdeen, acknowledges conflict with oil in the labour market,
especially in the early 1980s. But now the oil industry is training more of
its own people, while both industries have cut labour demand through
technological change.
He has noticed that men in their 30s and 40s, tired of the rigours of the
North Sea and anxious to spend more time with friends and family, are coming
back to onshore industry. His recent move from five-and-a-half to seven-day
working created 70 jobs, for which 1,500 applied - although he did not
advertise the vacancies.
Mike Stephen, group managing director of Grampian Country Food Group, a
large-scale pork and chicken producer, says oil took away 'a lot of young
lads who would have worked on the farm or driven trucks,' but agrees that
'it's not every married man with a family who wants two weeks on and two
weeks off'.
But difficulties in getting process labour are pushing his company harder to
find technological improvements. although much of his process labour is
female, for which there is less competition.
His company is an example of how food production, that most traditional of
all industries, is becoming concentrated in a small number of large
companies - driven, he says, by hygiene regulations. Turnover is up from
Pounds 1m in 1980 to about Pounds 180m last year and, like other dominant
food processing companies in the area, it is under local ownership. The area
is strong in locally-owned premium food brands, such as Baxters of Speyside
and Walkers of Aberlour.
But behind the big, successful food companies there are also small
traditional farms whose finances have recently been fragile. And it is those
family farms which underpin the economies of small towns and villages
throughout the area, where the eventual loss of oil industry commuters can
be expected to hit very hard.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (11): Encore for a star performer - Stock
Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year the Warsaw stock exchange became the star performer among the
world's emerging capital markets. The challenge this year is to complete its
transformation into a fully-fledged capital market institution by ensuring a
copious flow of new issues and rapid expansion of the meagre crop of 23
listed companies. The list is expected to double this year.
The achievement of 1993 was to attract foreign capital and raise investor
interest, and show millions of Poles that a flutter on the market can be
more profitable than a bet on the horses, or leaving cash under a mattress.
Even in dollar terms average share prices soared by more than 700 per cent,
taking market capitalisation close to Dollars 3bn. The surge continued into
1994 with the Warsaw WIG index crossing the 20,000 mark for the first time
on February 28.
For Poland's fast-growing private companies, and for the government which
needs to raise revenue by privatising state companies, high share prices
represent a possibly unique opportunity to raise equity capital cheaply.
Current price levels, with price/earnings ratios in the high 30s and beyond,
are as much a function of limited supply as frenetic demand from virgin
shareholders attracted by visions of easy money in what, until now, has been
a one-way market, upwards.
The worst that could happen in 1994 is a spectacular collapse in
over-inflated share prices which would deter potential investors for years.
The best would be a gradual calming of prices as investors were offered more
and more new companies and new shares. The latter is what the market
authorities, and prospective new listed companies, and the government are
pinning their hopes on.
The market, where trading takes place three times a week under a modified
form of the French Bourse system with a 10 per cent limit on daily share
movements, survived the September elections with hardly a blip and is backed
by the substance of a growing economy and rising profits for many companies.
But, on occasions, the prospect of easy wealth has proved too much. When the
shares of Bank Slaski made their debut on the WSE earlier this year they
were quoted at 13 times the 500,000 Zloty issue price.
Then it turned out that most of the 800,000 Poles who applied for the shares
were unable to trade them, because of the long delays in getting shares
registered. Practically the only shareholders able to sell were employees of
the bank, which is the second of nine state-owned banks hived off from the
central bank five years ago.
The Slaski affair taught some important lessons. Politically, it led to the
dismissal of the deputy-finance minister who was responsible for floating
the shares, and selling a 26 per cent stake to the ING bank of the
Netherlands.
With hindsight it was obvious the shares were pitched at too low an offer
price. But that was not so clear at the time the share offer was being
prepared. Share prices generally were much lower and it was not easy to find
a foreign bank to take a significant stake. Foreign banks have been wary of
putting capital into Polish banks until a London Club debt agreement was in
place.
Probably the most important consequence of the Slaski affair is the thorough
way the Polish Securities Commission mounted an investigation of the first
day's trading, and the speed with which it then decided to close down the
bank's brokerage department and censure top management.
By this prompt action Mr Leslaw Paga, the tough, independent-minded
chairman, raised the already high reputation for probity of the Commission.
A reputation for transparency is probably the greatest long-term asset of
the stock exchange, which is run by Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the president and
chief executive officer.
But the Slaski affair also revealed the logistical difficulties facing the
back-room activities of the new securities industry. Virtually overnight,
brokers with little prior experience in an industry which did not exist
three years ago, have had to gear up to register and service more than 1m
new shareholders.
Most of the buyers have no experience of share purchase and only the vaguest
ideas of the true nature and worth of the companies behind the share
certificates.
But this, too, is changing as the popularity of the stock exchange has
spawned a growing volume of high-quality financial analysis.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (10): New issues in the pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's Securities Commission (PSC) is examining 10 prospectuses prior to a
stock market listing. Three are new issues by listed companies, the rest are
private and state companies going public.
Three small private companies have won PSC approval for a public offer. They
are:
Optimus, a computer producer from southern Poland with 36bn zlotys net
profit on 1993 sales of 1,082bn zlotys;
Prochem, a Warsaw-based chemical plant design bureau with 17.2bn zlotys net
profit on 155bn zlotys sales;
Domplast, which earned 27bn zlotys on sales of 224bn zlotys.
The three plan to raise a minumum of 474bn zlotys (Dollars 21m), with
Optimus alone accounting for Dollars 15m.
Over the last quarter three quoted companies - BRE, Exbud and Efekt - raised
1,134bn zlotys (Dollars 51m) through rights and new stock issues.
Swarzedz, the Poznan-based furniture company, and Bank IG are currently
offering rights and new shares of 1,040bn zlotys.
The Privatisation Ministry intends to sell the Polifarb Wroclaw paints
producer and the Jelfa, pharmaceuticals plant from Jelenia Gora in April
through a public offer.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (12): Doors open to foreign credit -
Foreign Debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreement between Poland and its London Club creditors for a 42.5 per
cent reduction and rescheduling over 30 years of its total Dollars 13.2bn
debt to foreign commercial banks re-opens the door to Polish commercial
borrowing on international capital markets.
The deal signed in Frankfurt on March 11 is arguably the most important
single economic and political event since former finance minister Leszek
Balcerowicz inaugurated his shock therapy market reforms in January 1990.
That is certainly the view of Poland's plenipotentiary foreign debt
negotiator, Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, who steered negotiations for the Polish
side.
'The London Club agreement means normalisation of financial relations. It
will enable Poland to raise the finance needed to ensure continuing economic
growth and to meet the hump in debt repayments ahead,' he said. 'Without
such an agreement Poland would have been forced to renegotiate the Paris
Club agreement (with official creditors) and that would have been suicidal.
A window of opportunity opened up and we took it,' he says.
Under the terms of the outline agreement the net present value loss to the
banks of the write-off will be around 42.5 per cent. This is below the 50
per cent sought by Poland which was required by its 1991 Paris Club
agreement with official creditors to seek a deal similar to the two-stage 50
per cent write-down in Poland's Dollars 33bn official debt.
The banks refused to be bound by the Paris Club terms, however, and argued
that Poland, a potentially rich country with considerable natural resources,
a skilled labour force and a fast-growing economy, could afford to pay more.
Poland will repay part of the Dollars 9.3bn principal and Dollars 3.8bn
unpaid interest and a menu of instruments repayable over 30 years.
These include 45 per cent discounted bonds, on which interest will be repaid
at market rates, par bonds with interest well below market rates and 'new
money' in the form of base debt bonds at below market interest, but
repayable over five years.
Mr Krowacki expects the initial cost to Poland of the London Club agreement
will be around Dollars 1.3bn in 1994, of which Dollars 500m will be provided
by the World Bank and Dollars 300m by the IMF, leaving Dollars 500m to be
financed from the reserves of the Polish National Bank.
Poland's total debt servicing charge, including London Club repayments, will
probably exceed Dollars 6bn annually by the end of the first decade of the
new century, Mr Krowacki calculates. By then the gamble is that steady
growth, partly fuelled by access to international capital markets, will have
greatly increased Poland's GDP - and its capacity to finance a higher debt
burden.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (15): Delay has been beneficial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past four years, Poland has had five governments and five ministers
of privatisation, although one of them, Janusz Lewandowski of the Free
Market Liberal Democrats, held the job in two different governments.
Now the head of an economic think-tank in Gdansk, Mr Lewandowski, who
privatised a rush of state companies in his last months as minister in the
government of Ms Hanna Suchocka, is at liberty to compare the Polish
experience with privatisation elsewhere. 'Looking back, I think we should
have taken more advantage of the first flush of romantic enthusiasm for the
free market economy and privatised quickly like the Czechs,' he says.
'But unfortunately we had nothing like the clear political leadership shown
by Vaclav Klaus, who as finance minister then prime minister of the Czech
Republic, has given a single-minded continuity to Czech economic reforms.'
Instead, Poland had a series of weak coalition governments. 'My main
problems in the last government were the Christian parties, who were
suspicious of capitalism in general, and President Walesa who came up with
his own scheme promising Poles that privatisation would make them all
Dollars 1,000 richer. That made us vulnerable to suspicion that we were
selling off the supposed 'family jewels' of Polish industry to foreigners
too cheaply or corruptly. The Czechs had stronger and more committed
executive power - and a president, the former playwright Vaclav Havel, who
did not meddle in economic policy,' he adds.
What is more, neither Hungary nor former Czechoslovakia, nor indeed any
other former communist state, had any equivalent to the powerful Solidarity
movement and the tradition of worker power it represented. Privatisation in
Poland has often been delayed and conditioned by the need to involve the
workforce.
The Suchocka government's tripartite 'Enterprise Pact', which was heavily
influenced by the workerist views of Jacek Kuron, the former labour minister
and long-time Solidarity and Worker Defence Movement (KOR) activist,
specifically gave an important role to the unions and the management of
state-owned enterprises.
In spite of the obstacles, including the lengthy bureaucratic procedures,
the attempt to twin privatisation with a broader industrial development
strategy through complex sectoral studies, and the heavily politicised
decision-making process, Mr Lewandowski underlines that privatisation has
progressed a long way in four years.
'At an enterprise level Polish companies have adjusted much faster than the
more chaotically privatised Czech companies. In the Czech Republic the
managerial changes associated with private ownership are only beginning and
the investment funds are run mainly by state-owned banks.'
The statistics tend to back up the former minister's argument. Polish
industrial production and GDP have been rising strongly for two years. The
Czech Republic and, especially Hungary, are still on the verge of sustained
growth.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (13): Focus on food processing -
Christopher Bobinski discusses the role of the Agro-Industrial Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Agro-Industrial Bank is Poland's newest bank and Mr Dariusz Ledworowski,
the former foreign trade minister who runs it, is confident about its
future.
'We're starting after all the others, so we won't be repeating their
mistakes and we have qualified staff. All our credit officers have at least
three years' experience, and no more than five,' he says. That means none is
influenced by socialist-style banking.
The bank has been helped by the toughness of the central bank's supervisory
regime. 'Slightly to our surprise they really came in and checked out the
qualifications of our staff,' Mr Ledworowski says.
The bank opened in February and iscapitalised at a modest 170bn zlotys
(Dollars 7.7m). Part of the capital comes from the funds earned from sales
of European Community food aid in 1990, and part from the US Congress-funded
Polish American Enterprise Fund which has 20 per cent of the equity. The
EC-funded Counterpart Fund owns 46 per cent. Various farm-related state
agencies are the remaining shareholders.
The shareholders reflect the bank's specialisation - the financing of
medium-sized food processing businesses - rather than farming itself. 'The
European Community, which had to give the go-ahead for aid funds to be put
into the bank, liked that idea,' Mr Ledworowski says. He hopes to lend 150bn
zlotys by the end of this year.
Later, the bank intends to raise new capital, by bringing in private
shareholders, and also to develop an investment banking arm to establish an
equity fund for privatisations. Other specialised activities will include
channelling EC aid for the financing of rural gasification and telephone
projects and loans to managers who have leased former state farms.
At present the new bank provides little competitive challenge to the huge
Food Economy Bank (BGZ), which is closely linked to the ruling Peasants
party and has received a capital injection of more than 3,000bn zlotys from
the state. The BGZ was the main source of finance for the farming sector and
the agricultural machinery industry in the past, along with a mass of mostly
weak and undercapitalised rural co-operative banks.
But the new bank is targeting the most forward-looking parts of the
country's developing agro business which offers the best opportunity for
adding value to Poland's farm output.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (14): Smorgasbord of methods -
Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a seemingly endless gestation, Poland's new National Investment Funds,
or NIFs, should see the light of day within weeks. 'The first funds will be
ready by the middle of the year and distribution of shares in the funds will
take place around the end of the year,' promises Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the
privatisation minister, who is from the SLD side of the coalition
government.
But a big logistical effort will be required to cope with the resulting
explosion in share ownership. 'When the NIFs are up and running, 9m Poles
will have shares and maybe 1.5m will retain them. This means we will have to
develop our capital markets and the supporting institutions. At present
there are only 400,000 investors who have accounts with brokers and a
further 350,000 waiting to open one. We will have big organisational
problems unless we find innovative solutions like selling shares through the
post office or insurance companies,' the minister says.
The ministry is looking for assistance from abroad, especially from the EBRD
which has indicated it would consider lending up to Dollars 400m to help
restructure companies involved in the scheme. More than 30 potential fund
management groups, many of them joint venture partnerships between foreign
merchant banks and financial institutions and their Polish equivalents, are
competing for the privilege of managing a portfolio of 20-30 former state
controlled enterprises each.
'The phrase mass privatisation is artificial. In fact it is a large
restructuring programme covering about 10 per cent of Polish state
companies', says Mr Kaczmarek of a scheme under which up to 600 of the
formerly 8,000 state enterprises will be managed by NIFs on behalf of their
ultimate owners, the 9m Poles who will be offered shares in the funds.
Mass privatisation is only one part of a smorgasbord of privatisation
methods used in Poland. Most of the biggest deals have essentially been
trade sales to foreign investors, but many economists and businessmen
believe that the most effective privatisation has involved various forms of
asset-stripping of state enterprises, of more or less transparent legality.
In this way many over-sized state companies have been effectively
downgraded. In many cases the funds received, or part of them, have been
used to help finance the restructuring of the enterprises' rump activities
while the assets sold, including truck fleets, surplus warehousing or office
capacity and selected workshops and equipment, have often been much more
efficiently and profitably used by their new private owners.
To a substantial but largely unquantifiable degree the availability of cheap
assets from state enterprises helped to compensate for the initial shortage
of capital in the private sector and sidestep the difficulty and high cost
of borrowing money from the banks. But the often underhand and opaque
process has inevitably brought charges of corruption and theft and
engendered a degree of popular discontent with privatisation which surfaced
at the last elections.
Mr Kaczmarek, a strong supporter of privatisation like other senior SLD
members whose experience of running a bankrupt command economy converted
them to the virtues of private enterprise, says that one of his priorities
is to try and change the image of privatisation and depoliticise the subject
by making the processes of privatisation more transparent.
His task has been made easier by the surge on the stock market which has
given millions of Poles their first tangible evidence that a capitalist
economy allows even the small man to benefit.
Above all, a functioning stock market offers the government a new, and
transparent way of privatising state assets and acquiring funds for the
state treasury without raising taxes.
'We did not realise how much capital was available in Poland until the
booming stock market flushed it out,' says Mr Kaczmarek. 'But I fear that
many politicians remain suspicious of and hostile to capitalism and are
capable of destroying this positive development,' he adds. Many of them are
backwoodsmen in his own party. But perhaps the most outspoken critic of
privatisation and the new capitalist system is Bogdan Pek, the Peasant Party
privatisation spokesman who is head of the parliamentary privatisation
committee. Tension between the two men is a reflection of the seismic fault
lines which underlie the coalition of former communist Social Democrats and
suspicious farmers imbued with anti-capitalist notions derived from their
religious faith.
The first test of privatisation through the stock market will come shortly
with the initial public offer of shares in the Polifarb paint company which
will simultaneously raise capital for the new company and funds for the
treasury. But Mr Kaczmarek is also thinking of selling some of the 20-30 per
cent shareholdings which the state retains in many privatised companies as a
strategic move to help calm what many see as an overheated exchange by
increasing the supply of shares.
But the way in which the surging stock market has helped to increase the
attractiveness of privatisation to workers and managers, who get 10 per cent
of the shares in their privatised enterprise free, and preferential terms
for additional shares, is sometimes proving a double-edged weapon. 'Workers
and managers are sometimes tempted to try and lower the value of the
enterprise before privatisation as this makes the shares cheaper,' the
minister worries.
The problem here is that the privatisation ministry is not in complete
control of the privatisation process by any means. 'The ministry can prepare
projects but it is the ministry of industry which has control of 1,100
enterprises which are sellable and many other assets are owned by provincial
and municipal bodies who often apply different standards and procedures,
confusing foreign investors, especially as some of the local authority heads
remain opposed to privatisation on principle,' he adds.
It is partly to reduce that confusion that the State Agency for Foreign
Investment (PAIZ) has been reinforced in recent months with the aim of
providing potential foreign investors with a one-stop institution
specifically designed to guide them round the bureaucratic maze.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (5): High tolls over the sea to Skye -
Tom Lynch looks at government efforts to increase the private sector in the
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bridge reaching out from the mainland to Skye is the most visible symbol
of the government's determination to push forward the frontiers of the
private sector in Scotland.
Those frontiers will not be cheap: the bridge will have the highest tolls in
Britain. Supporters of the project say that people pay for the less
convenient ferries in any case, and that the bridge will be toll-free when
the contractors pay off the cost of building it - some time in the next 20
years.
Opponents say the bridge should be part of the roads system. They point to
the low tolls on other bridges and lament the government's abandonment of
its 1979 policy that the islands should not be disadvantaged by high
transport costs.
The bridge is being built by a joint venture between Miller Construction, a
privately owned Edinburgh company, and Dykerhoff Widman. The consortium will
operate the bridge and collect tolls.
The scheme symbolises the government's determination to pursue its policies
in a country where it is increasingly acclimatised to being a political
minority. For example, only one tiny (80 pupils) school has voted to opt out
of local authority control - and a strenuous political campaign, including
intervention by the Sunday Times newspaper, failed to get the government a
result at Paisley grammar school last year.
In England and Wales, contracting out of local authority services had a high
profile through the 1980s. Right-wing councils such as Wandsworth in London
enthusiastically privatised service provision. In Scotland, there were no
Wandsworths to blaze trails in the Labour-dominated local government scene,
but compulsory tendering has brought a steady rise in contracting out.
As in England and Wales, the electricity industry was sold. ScottishPower
and Scottish Hydro Electric are regarded as the flagships of Scottish
privatisation, realising Pounds 3.5bn, but water and sewerage were not. They
were too firmly locked into the local authority structure (and the ultimate
commercial sanction, disconnecting a household, is unlawful in Scotland).
Almost all the factory portfolio of the Scottish Development Agency, now
re-formed as Scottish Enterprise, was sold in 1990, and Pounds 50m-Pounds
60m a year in assets in the five new towns are being sold in preparation for
their winding-up by 1996.
The next move in privatisation is likely to be Scotrail, one of the first
seven British Rail franchises to be offered. The government hopes that this
will be run by the private sector by early 1995.
The Scottish rail network is nearly self-contained: 95 per cent of services
run entirely within Scotland. It is this which has impelled potential
bidders to lobby for the franchise holder to have control of the track, as
well as for the services. This vertical integration is strongly opposed by
Railtrack, which is to take over ownership of BR's track and signalling, but
there have been indications that the government may be sympathetic.
In the Scottish Office - subjected to market testing, like the rest of the
civil service - a steady Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m a year of work is being
contracted out. The department has few large blocks of work to hive off:
most management units employ fewer than 50.
Scottish Enterprise and its equivalent, Highlands and Islands Enterprise
(HIE), and other quangoes such as the Scottish Tourist Board are required to
contract out services where possible. HIE has even contracted out its
investment appraisal.
Steps are being taken to change the law to allow prison privatisation,
legalised in England and Wales in 1990.
State-owned bus operations have been sold and privatisation of council-owned
fleets is well under way, but privatisation of Caledonian MacBrayne, the
islands ferry operator, was rejected. KPMG is reviewing Scottish Office
subsidies for all shipping services and is expected to report, within the
next two months, on the scope for private sector involvement.
The forestry industry (important in Scotland, overseen by the Scottish
Office) is also under review. Outright privatisation is thought to have been
rejected by the ministerial working group. It is expected to report later
this year in favour of increased private sector participation.
The local government reform bill, currently before parliament, provides for
three new state corporations to run all water and sewerage from 1996. Lack
of private sector expertise in the area means that English and French
companies are prominent in offering the sought-for private investment;
councils are discussing, with private sector consortia, about a dozen
'build, own and operate' schemes for sewerage provision valued at Pounds
1bn. However, there are hopes that Scottish utilities may take an interest.
This new stress on private participation in the public sector, spearheaded
by the government's private finance initiative, is allowing the pace of
privatisation in its broadest sense to accelerate in Scotland. The increase
in tempo poses a challenge for Scotland's private sector. Because
contracting out has been slow to get off the mark, Scottish companies are
less likely than their southern colleagues to have the bidding expertise.
Current uncertainty over transfer of undertaking rules - the EU directive
which protects the rights of workers whose jobs are contracted out - is
having a particular effect on smaller companies thinking of bidding for some
of the packages of work on offer.
Mr Peter Fleming-Wilson, former chairman of the Cleaning and Support
Services Association, says it is difficult for contractors to decide whether
it is sensible to bid, when even taking counsel's opinion on whether the
rules apply is expensive. He believes a pattern is beginning to emerge,
although contractors still have to do their homework.
Neither does he feel that all councils are as helpful to contractors as they
might be. True, the Scottish Office has seldom found grounds for intervening
in tendering exercises, and no direct labour organisations have been closed
down, as has happened in England. Tendering will be slowed during local
government reorganisation.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (6): High road, low road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reform of local government may spark more opportunities for the private
sector: the new smaller unitary authorities will not have the capacity to
take over from the large regional councils in maintaining principal roads.
Some of these roads are likely to become government-managed trunk roads. It
is not yet clear how maintenance of this bigger trunk network will be
organised, but the government may want to expand routine maintenance
contracts into more ambitious maintenance and management contracts.
It is possible to envisage a contracting consortium building a road and
delivering it ready to operate (a national road charging system would allow
payment according to how quickly the road was ready for traffic), followed
by a management contract with another consortium. Current government
thinking means that, probably, the element of risk-sharing would be
increased.
New road schemes are being explored - a potentially large amount of road
building, given the size of Scotland's trunk network.
Four consortia are interested in building a second Forth Bridge - the need
for which is a matter of some controversy. Any new bridge would be
associated with improved road and other transport links from the bridges and
the airport to Edinburgh.
A new road link between the M8 Glasgow-Edinburgh motorway and the main
M74/M6 cross-border road is also under consideration, together with
improvements to the Kincardine Bridge across the Forth between Edinburgh and
Stirling.
Another potential opportunity is the proposed national driver information
system for Scotland (the government is currently engaged in a consultation
exercise about this). Upgrading of the electronic information system around
Glasgow is proposed, and the creation of a new system in the Edinburgh area.
Officials claim that the Scottish Office's integrated structure allows it to
plan important road developments without the tensions surrounding similar
schemes under discussion in Whitehall.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (8): Supervision reinforced - 'The wild
west days of Polish banking are over,' says bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The president of the National Bank of Poland, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz,
turned up in parliament late on a Friday night last month to tell a packed
Sejm that four state-owned banks were having problems. A further 15 private
banks and 229 out of 1,600 co-operative banks were threatened with
liquidation or facing collapse, she added.
Her warning was greeted calmly, without any sign of a run on the banks by
anxious depositors in the days that followed. But why did she run the risk?
'Sorting out the problems of the banking sector requires a clear political
decision. That's why I went to parliament to explain the situation,' she
explains. She hastens to add that 'the wild west days of Polish banking are
over' now that the central bank has reinforced its supervisory powers. But
she feels the need for wider political understanding of the need to
recapitalise several of the largest banks and support a consolidation of the
banking system.
Ms Waltz told parliament that Bank Handlowy, the foreign trade bank, was the
only one among 15 state-owned banks to produce 'good results' last year. All
nine of the commercial banks hived off from the BNP five years ago at the
start of bank reforms were also in reasonable shape, she added, partly
because seven have been partially recapitalised from state funds.
Two of the original nine banks, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK) and Bank
Slaski (BS), have now been privatised and recapitalised through the sale of
shares to private investors. The EBRD paid Dollars 12.7m for a 28.5 per cent
stake in WBK a year ago while ING bank of the Netherlands paid Dollars 60m
for its 25.9 per cent stake in Bank Slaski. The remaining seven banks are
due for privatisation over the next two years.
The emergence of nine privatised regional banks, with substantial foreign
minority shareholders, will mark a big step forward in Polish banking. But
Cesary Stypulkowski, the president of Bank Handlowy, the biggest and most
consistently profitable Polish bank, argues that 15 medium-sized banks are
too many for an economy Poland's size. 'Probably four or five stronger banks
would be better,', he says.
The whole banking sector, he argues, is undercapitalised. 'The total
capitalisation of Polish banks, at around 40,000bn zloties, is equivalent to
that of the 12th largest bank in Germany,' he notes. 'The Polish economy
demands more than that.'
Bank Handlowy, which has been transformed over the last three years from a
foreign trade bank into a universal corporate bank, alone accounts for a
quarter of the total capitalisation of the banking system. It is the only
Polish bank which has managed to preserve the real value of its capital
base, he says. It raised its provisions from 6.2bn zlotys in 1992 to 9bn
zlotys last year after another year of sharply higher profits. Any future
capital increase is most likely to come through a stock market flotation of
new shares which would dilute the state shareholding and amount to partial
privatisation.
Meanwhile, the most difficult problem is how to deal with the 70 or so small
and undercapitalised private banks which are the weakest part of the banking
system, alongside the small rural co-operative banks.
Both the government and the central bank are worried about the political
fall-out of small bank failures in rural areas. The NBP would like to
persuade foreign banks to take over and absorb these smaller banks. But few
are willing to accept such a poisoned chalice. Until now foreign banks, such
as Citibank, have preferred to set up their own wholly-owned operations, or
take stakes in larger, state-owned banks.
The central bank also has plans for the 1,600 rural banks, of which more
than 200 are in a shaky state. 'We would like to form nine or 10 competitive
associations of small co-operative banks and then refinance the new
associations,' Ms Waltz explains.
Until now one of the main obstacles to the entry of foreign capital into the
Polish banking system was the absence of a London Club deal. One benefit of
the protracted negotiations, however, is that the 400 foreign banks involved
in the outcome have been keeping close watch on Polish developments. Some
are expected to seek entry to this fast growing market now that an agreement
has been reached.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (9): Lame ducks are the target - Foreign
Banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most foreign banks were waiting for the outcome of Poland's negotiations
with the London Club creditors before deciding whether to open an operation
in the country.
But if they do take the plunge they will probably find that getting a
banking licence will not be easy. The NBP, the central bank, has imposed a
de facto moratorium on new banks as it struggles to repair an ailing private
banking sector which expanded too fast in 1990 and 1991 and is now knee-deep
in bad loans.
Ms Gronkiewicz Waltz, the NBP chairman, says she is happy to see foreign
banks coming, but only if they consider taking one of the sector's lame
ducks under their wing. That also applies to local investors keen to set up
a new bank, she adds.
This leaves a handful of banks including Credit Lyonnais, Westdeutsche
Landesbank and Banque Nationale de Paris, working together with the Dresdner
Bank, waiting in a queue and browsing through the NBP's 'transfer list' of
around 15 small private banks in serious trouble.
But 10 banks with a majority foreign shareholding, who obtained their
licences in 1990 and 1991, are already in place. One, the American Bank in
Poland, in which Banker's Trust has a 17 per cent stake, is preparing a
stock exchange flotation. This would allow foreign shareholders, such as
Time Warner and Morrison Knudsen, the US building company, to exit
profitably.
Other banks include ING, which bought 25.9 per cent of Bank Slaski, and two
Austrian banks active throughout central Europe, Creditanstalt and
Raiffeisen, and Citibank.
Citibank is probably the most profitable of the foreign banks. It
concentrates on providing foreign trade and cash management services for big
foreign investors such as International Paper and McDonald's and has also
attracted local customers with the range of electronic banking services on
offer. The wholly-owned subsidiary, opened in November 1991 by Mr William
Rhodes, Citibank's deputy-chairman, last year reported a 415bn zloty
(Dollars 18.5m) net profit on the US bank's initial investment of Dollars
10m, backed subsequently by a Dollars 7.5m subordinated loan from its parent
company.
The bank intends to raise its capital to around 900bn zlotys after retaining
the net profit of 131.5bn zlotys in 1992 and last year's net profit,
together with the subordinated loan. But last year the bank's profit tax
break, equal to the sum of the initial capital, expired. Its new capital
base will be twice as large as Citibank's Hungarian subsidiary, which is
capitalised at Dollars 20m and reported a Dollars 14m profit in 1992.
Citibank's locally-recruited 120-strong staff are young. For one in three it
is their first job. 'We have brought in grey hairs from outside the country'
says Mr Allan Hirst, the local Texas-bred chief executive. The branch spends
Dollars 400,000 on training annually.
Mr Hirst is sensitive to criticism that foreign banks constitutes a
competitive threat to local banks. 'All the new Polish clients with whom we
are doing business have also stayed with their old banks,' he says. From
Citibank's point of view it is Polish banks such as Bank Handlowy and the
new Export Development Bank (BRE) which are keeping up the competition on
interest rates and services.
That said, however, Citibank Poland's gross profit of 541.7bn zlotys last
year is high compared to local private banks such as BRE which reported a
gross profit of 357.9bn zlotys on a balance sheet double Citbank's 5,010bn
zlotys.
This year's capital increase will give Citibank a chance to expand its
lending as Polish banking laws restrict individual loans to 10 per cent of a
bank's capital. But Mr Hirst also intends to maintain his bank's competitive
edge by building up its technological capacity to manage corporate finance
and foreign exchange transactions. 'In 10 years' time we want to be the
provider of the highest quality banking products and services bar none,' he
says.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (7): Primed for privatisation - Profile /
Polski Bank Rozwoju
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polski Bank Rozwoju, the Polish Development Bank (PDB), is one of the new
financial institutions set up by the first post-communist government to help
finance the transition to a private, market-based economy.
It began operations in February 1991. Untrammelled by communist-style
banking habits its functions are to finance fledgling companies, to
lubricate the restructuring of public sector enterprises and to channel
funds from international institutions such as the World Bank and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) into specific
projects.
Such is the pace of change in the economy, however, that Mr Wojciech
Kostrzewa, the young, German-trained president, says 'we have become less
and less a development bank and more and more a specialised corporate
investment bank'. The bank, he adds, 'offers a full range of products for
large and medium corporations', which means loans of Dollars 500,000 and
above.
Last year saw a virtual doubling in loans granted from 1,391bn zlotys to
2,521bn zlotys, a 65 per cent real increase after inflation, confirming the
rapid growth in demand for investment finance from an increasingly confident
private sector. More than 80 per cent of PDB's loans are to private or
privatised companies and it is the only Polish bank which runs a regular
commercial paper programme, including an active secondary market.
The bank expects a heavy demand for investment credits from joint venture
companies but the bank's commercial paper activities are limited to public
companies listed on the Warsaw stock exchange. They are preferred because
they are subject to the regulatory discipline and tough disclosure
requirements of the US-style stock exchange regulators.
The bank is involved in bringing new companies to the stock exchange and has
teamed up with Kleinwort Benson, the UK-based merchant bank, to set up and
manage one of the new National Investment Funds which will be created as
part of the mass privatisation programme.
But Bank Rozwoju is also helping to financially restructure state-owned
enterprises prior to privatisation. The most successful example to date
concerns the Szczecin shipyard. The deal involved a complex 2,500bn zlotys
debt write-off and rescheduling agreement involving several leading banks
and more than 1,800 suppliers. It was linked to a series of parallel
productivity agreements with the trade unions and the introduction of modern
managerial methods. This combination has transformed the shipyard from heavy
loss-maker into one of Europe's few unsubsidised profitable shipyards.
The Szczecin shipyard now turns out around 15 ships a year worth more than
Dollars 250m and is on the way to privatisation. It recently gained new
orders from Chile and Argentina in addition to orders from Germany, other
European customers and South Africa.
The bank now hopes to repeat the Szczecin formula at the loss-making
state-owned Star truck plant at Starachowice, 200 km south of Warsaw which
has been an unemployment black spot ever since the collapse of the old
Soviet market for medium trucks and the evaporation of orders from the
Polish military in 1991.
Last year Deutsche Investitions und Entwicklungsgesellschaft, a specialist
German project financing institution, took a 2.64 per cent stake in the bank
alongside Italian, French and Austrian minority shareholders. The Polish
Treasury, with 73 per cent of the 1,796bn zlotys capital, remains the
biggest shareholder.
This may change, however, if the government authorises PDB to raise fresh
capital and dilute the state shareholding by a public offer of shares on a
stock exchange which is increasingly coming into its own as a viable source
of equity finance and as a privatisation vehicle. If the government gives
the green light, as expected, 1994 could see the start of PDB's
privatisation.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (4): Tories redraw the map with ease -
Local Government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The map of Scotland is about to be changed by a bill which has so far passed
with surprising ease through the standing committee considering it in the
House of Commons. The bill will replace the current two tier structure of
local government with a system of single tier authorities.
It will also remove management of water and sewerage out of the hands of
local authorities and entrust it to three new water authorities under boards
appointed by the secretary of state. There are no plans to privatise
Scottish water, but the private sector will nevertheless be heavily involved
in upgrading the water and sewerage systems.
The Conservative government signalled its intention of reforming Scottish
local government in 1991, put out a detailed consultation paper in 1992 and
last July presented its plans in a white paper.
The white paper said the government intended to abolish the current system
of nine regional and 53 district councils, and replace them with 25 unitary
authorities. The three unitary island councils would remain unchanged,
making 28 councils in all.
All Scottish political parties have said they favour moving to a single tier
system, but for the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Scottish National parties
the move would accompany the setting up of a Scottish parliament.
The government wants to modernise local government partly to take account of
the fact that local authorities are gradually providing fewer direct
services themselves. From a party political point of view the Conservatives
want to weaken the dominance of Scottish local government by the Labour
party.
The Conservatives' chief target is Strathclyde regional council which,
because of the unbalanced drawing of the last new map in 1974, deals with
2.2m people, nearly half the Scottish population. As well as being assertive
in dealing with the Scottish Office, Strathclyde is, to the Tories,
irredeemably Labour.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, recently argued in the quarterly
journal Scottish Affairs that the current structure, in which regional and
district councils have powers which occasionally criss-cross, was
complicated, illogical and expensive, partly because of the inadequate power
of the districts. Some regions, he said, were too big to be effective, some
districts too small; and they lacked independence because of councils'
shared responsibility.
The consequence, he said, was lack of public interest in local government,
shown by low turnout in elections and the lack of public affection for the
1974 structure, especially the regions.
Under the white paper proposals Strathclyde would be broken into 10 councils
while the eight district councils in the Highlands would disappear, leaving
a single authority based in Inverness. Apart from losing control of water
the new councils would be expected to form joint boards with neighbouring
authorities to administer such things as police and fire services. Some
councils might administer certain services on behalf of their neighbours.
The new councils will be elected in 1995 and begin operating in 1996.
The main public reaction to the white paper was outrage at the way the new
map appeared to protect those areas where Conservatives commanded a majority
(such as Stirling, Ayr and Eastwood, to the south of Glasgow) by creating
councils with smaller populations than their Labour-dominated neighbours,
giving rise to the claim of gerrymandering. (Yet senior Scottish Office
officials are said to have been surprised that the government did not go
further in drawing up boundaries to Tory advantage).
Apart from that, many people were perplexed that there is again to be change
only 20 years after the 1974 reform.
Professor Arthur Midwinter of Strathclyde University, a specialist in local
government, argues that the two-tier system has worked well and that the
white paper proposals would not necessarily make local government more
accountable, or engender greater local loyalty than the present system.
Above all, he says, if the government wants both to have effective local
government and to achieve substantial efficiency savings it should set up
not more than 15 authorities.
The proposed structure, he says, will lead to greater centralisation because
most of the councils would be too small to be viable. Small authorities
would have difficulty providing all the services required, and bigger
neighbouring councils might be unwilling, for political reasons, to help
them out. Joint boards would lack the democratic legitimacy needed for
decisive action.
Labour-controlled Strathclyde region argues with come force that it offers
considerable economies of scale in administering such services as education,
police, fire, and transport over a very wide area. It operates the biggest
passenger transport authority in Britain with British Rail providing an
efficient and expanding commuter rail service whose coherence could be in
jeopardy under a large number of councils.
Lothian, a much smaller region which is nevertheless to be split between
Edinburgh and two other councils, has also put forward a case for a single
unitary authority.
So far the only major concessions the government has made during the passage
of the bill are on the boundaries of the new councils. Ayrshire is to have
three councils instead of two, Inverclyde is to be carved out of West
Renfrewshire, and Berwickshire is not after all to be merged with East
Lothian. These changes, which make the gerrymandering charge slightly
weaker, took place partly because of pressure from local Tories. But they
mean that (including the three island councils) there will now be 30 new
councils instead 28 and Strathclyde will now be broken into 12 not 10
councils.
Mr Lang, asked by the Financial Times whether the reform would lead to
savings and 'big improvements' in the cost of local government, said it was
'largely driven by the wish to create more efficient, more coherent, more
accountable local authorities. I'm certain there will be savings of some
substance as a worthwhile side-benefit. But it's driven by the natural
allegiances, the history and traditions, Scottish geography and demography.'
He went on: 'The strength and diversity of what we are proposing will result
in having a single tier with a clear focus for the delivery of local
services. The fact that we are able to contemplate savings which could
amount to Pounds 1bn over a 15-year period is tremendous.'
Mr Lang said he got the impression when he travelled round Scotland that the
local government reform was a popular change. 'Let's be honest. A lot of
people don't worry too much about how their local government service is
delivered as long as it's delivered efficiently. If they stop to analyse why
it's delivered inefficiently and expensively in many cases it's the result
of the duplication and bureaucracy and the expense and inefficiency that
two-tier structures bring.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (2): The cycle is different - James
Buxton examines the economy in the aftermath of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Scotland,' says Mr Jeremy Peat, chief economist of the Royal Bank of
Scotland, 'tends to outperform the UK during a recession, but do less well,
relatively speaking, when the UK economy turns up.'
The first part of that remark is almost an understatement. Scotland had a
remarkably mild recession in the early 1990s. As Professor Donald MacKay,
chairman of Scottish Enterprise, the economic development agency, pointed
out in a speech a few days ago, the Scottish economy showed greater
resilience in recession than that of southern Britain.
Redundancies in Scotland, he said, had been lower, the rate of business
failures was smaller, real incomes increased more rapidly, manufacturing
held up better and retail sales were more buoyant.
To the amazement of seasoned economists, Scotland's unemployment rate was
overtaken by the UK average in late 1991 and has remained below it - a
phenomenon never seen since formal measurement of unemployment began in the
1920s. In January seasonally adjusted unemployment in Scotland was 9.4 per
cent, compared with the UK level of 9.9 per cent, and unemployment in
Scotland was worse only than East Anglia, the East Midlands and the
South-West.
Just as Scotland never experienced the full force of the boom of the late
1980s, neither did it have to cope with the bust. Neither Scottish
individuals nor Scottish companies became heavily indebted in the way that
many in southern England did, and accordingly suffered much less when the
economy turned down.
Scotland also suffered less, as Prof MacKay pointed out, because it had lost
its smokestack industries in the 1980s and acquired, mainly through inward
investment, a world-class electronics and information technology industry.
In fact, if the category 'electrical and instrument engineering' is stripped
out of the official statistics, Scottish manufacturing output shows a
worrying decline from mid-1991 onwards.
Yet shallow recession is still painful for many people and 9.4 per cent
unemployment is far too high. It is hard to convince a Glasgow taxi driver,
struggling to comprehend how the de-industrialised city now earns its
living, that the disappearance of smokestack industries is anything but a
tragedy and a betrayal.
The question now is whether the Scottish economy will follow its historic
pattern, with its growth rate dropping below that of the UK, or whether some
of the factors which made the recession in Scotland shallow will continue to
preserve Scotland's relative buoyancy.
Most economic forecasters believe that gross domestic product growth in
Scotland will lag slightly behind that of the UK in 1994 and 1995, because
southern England has the capacity to expand faster. The average of six
independent forecasts of GDP growth in Scotland for 1994 and 1995 suggest
that in 1994 the Scottish economy will grow by 2.4 per cent against the UK's
2.6 per cent, and the gap will be much the same in 1995.
The report Regional Economic Prospects by Cambridge Econometrics is unusual
in suggesting that Scotland's GDP growth will exceed that of the UK this
year, though it says it will tail off next year.
The North Sea oil industry, which is another main factor keeping Scotland's
economy up during the recession, achieved its highest output of oil since
1988 in January 1994, reaching 2.4 barrels per day. Output is expected to
continue growing to late 1995.
But while forecasts by Scottish Enterprise of a marked downturn in
expenditure by the offshore oil industry were recently revised upwards, the
offshore fabrication yards are desperately short of orders.
Scotland, having done relatively well out of defence expenditure over the
decades of the Cold War, is now suffering from the defence cuts. The Rosyth
naval dockyard in Fife has seen its workforce fall from 6,000 in 1988 to the
current level of 3,600, because of a diminished workload from the navy. Last
year the government awarded the contract for servicing Trident submarines to
Devonport instead of Rosyth, and although it allocated Rosyth surface ship
work until 2005, Babcock Thorn, the yard's managers, say employment could by
then have dropped to 2,200.
One potential bright spot highlighted by Mr Peat of the Royal Bank of
Scotland is spending on infrastructure. Scotland is reckoned to have done
relatively well in the 1994/95 public expenditure round. A big investment
programme in roads is being kept up.
Every economy is a patchwork of light and shade. Prof Donald MacKay said in
a speech last autumn that Scotland had over the 1955-1992 period matched the
efficiency gains achieved by the UK economy, but had failed to maintain its
share of UK employment - if it had, another 140,000 jobs would have been
created. 'We have clearly failed to diversify existing businesses or
introduce new activities,' he said, pointing also to Scotland's low
birthrate for new businesses.
This was despite having higher public expenditure per head than the rest of
Britain, favourable treatment under regional policy, consistent success in
winning inward investment and the benefit of North Sea oil on its doorstep.
Scotland's dependence on inward investment was recently starkly underlined
in a study of the Scottish electronics industry by the US Monitor
consultancy. It said that because the industry consisted largely of
foreign-owned branch plants it lacked the ability to respond spontaneously
to market opportunities.
It also said that sectors such as defence electronics were likely to be hit
by the decline in defence spending; that future inward investors might find
eastern Europe a cheaper location than Scotland; and that Scotland might
miss out on future developments in electronics. If nothing were done and no
new inward investors came, employment might fall from the current 45,000 to
27,500.
Monitor's findings appeared to some to be unduly alarmist. Nevertheless its
report was accompanied by the creation of the Scottish Electronics Forum, an
unprecedented grouping of both multinationals and indigenous Scottish
companies which is working on ways of strengthening the industry's
competitiveness.
Some senior people in the industry believe, however, that a change in
government policy is needed, to give more encouragement to multinationals to
carry out research and development (R&amp;D) in Scotland, thus giving them
deeper roots, and to support more innovation by indigenous companies to
match the big grants available to companies which create jobs in large
numbers.
These arguments do not find great favour with Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary: 'I don't regard (inward investment) as the only answer to
Scotland's problems, or the only alternative to indigenous industry.
'I think our schemes do work because we are actually winning the battle on
R&amp;D, and getting more R&amp;D, just as we are getting more inward investment,
and we're doing it without buying it at a higher price such as other less
competitive countries are willing to pay.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (3): 'Quiet confidence' as recovery
gathers pace - Andrew Bolger reviews the financial sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial sector, long one of the most vibrant parts of the Scottish
economy, is in good heart.
Scotland's clearing banks have seen profits begin to surge as the UK's
emergence from recession brings a drop in bad debts. Independent fund
managers look back with satisfaction on booming world stock markets.
The main cloud on the horizon concerns the life assurance companies. They
face regulatory uncertainty and difficult choices as to how best to market
their products, now that competition from banks and building societies seems
set to increase.
Mr Alfred Moon, a director of the Royal Bank of Scotland, the biggest
clearer, feels 'quiet confidence' as the country recovers from a downturn
which arrived later than in England. Scotland has also avoided the problems
of negative equity caused by the late-1980s property boom and subsequent
crash in the south-east of England.
The Royal Bank intends to build on the success of Direct Line, its rapidly
growing 'direct-dial' motor insurer, by launching a new company specialising
in sales of non-standard motor and home policies. The Royal also recently
opened a new Pounds 2.6m dealing room in Edinburgh, geared mainly to
offering capital market and foreign exchange services to its Scottish
customers.
A slightly more cautious note is struck by Mr Peter Burt, treasurer and
chief general manager of the Bank of Scotland, the second largest clearer.
Although recession came later to Scotland, he believes it has by no means
gone away: 'There are still some after-shocks.'
Lacking the Royal Bank's extensive network of branches south of the border,
Mr Burt says the Bank of Scotland intended to concentrate further on
developing niche markets such as credit cards, screen-based banking and
venture capital.
An ebullient mood prevails at Baillie Gifford, the independent Edinburgh
investment management firm which has increased its funds under management
tenfold since 1984 to their present level of more than Pounds 10bn. The firm
has achieved this commanding position by attracting an increasing amount of
money from UK pension schemes, which now account for more than 50 per cent
of its funds.
Baillie Gifford is one of several Scottish investment firms which have won
an increasing amount of business from US pension funds. Americans have
wanted to tap their long-standing expertise in emerging markets,
particularly in the Far East, and also use them as a route into investing in
Europe.
Over the last 10 years Baillie Gifford has seen the proportion of its
business in investment and unit trusts shrink from 76 to only 22 per cent of
total funds, but the firm remains interested in the retail market. Mr Gavin
Gemmell, senior partner, says: 'There is huge potential in Europe - for the
first time in a generation the wealth in Germany has not been wiped out by
war.'
An American connection has certainly proved stabilising for Murray
Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund manager which recently sold itself to
United Asset Management of the US. Rivals say settlement of the ownership
question has been good for morale.
Mr Giles Weaver, a director of Murray Johnstone, says the firm's 230 staff
are responding well to a more performance-oriented environment. The Glasgow
firm is one of only two global firms in UAM's stable of 38 fund managers and
it hopes the new owners will bring further clients and more financial
backing, if necessary.
More difficult challenges face Scotland's nine life assurance companies,
which together command more than 20 per cent of the UK market in long-term
life assurance and pensions, and employ more than 20,000 people. Last year
Halifax, Britain's largest building society, announced it would sever its
exclusive tie with Standard Life and set up its own insurance company.
The Edinburgh-based Standard Life, the UK's largest mutually-owned life
insurance company, sold 18 per cent of all its new business through Halifax
offices in 1992. Standard intends to replace the lost Halifax business by
building up its direct sales force, which already stands at 380 and will be
increased to 1,000.
Mr Tom King, Standard Life's general manager of marketing, says he is
confident that his company would thrive, but adds that the looming
over-capacity in the industry was likely to lead to a shakeout.
Scottish Life is more typical of the other mutuals in that it relies almost
entirely on independent financial advisers (IFAs) - as Standard Life does
for 66 per cent of its business. Mr Ray Milne, Scottish Life' s assistant
general manager of sales, says he is confident that IFAs would largely be
exonerated when the current investigations into the mis-selling of pensions
were complete, although all the transaction documents may not have been
properly completed.
However, Mr Milne believes that struggling with this growing burden of
paperwork has prevented the Scottish mutuals from developing new products in
growing areas such as care plans for the elderly.
Concern about the future of the mutuals and the increasing pressures on
banks to reduce staff contributes to the feeling that the great job-creating
record of the financial sector in recent years has run out of steam - and
could be reversed.
Scottish Financial Enterprise (SFE, the promotional body for the financial
community) estimates that the sector accounts for about 15 per cent of
Scotland's GDP and more than 10 per cent of its jobs. The number of jobs in
the sector has increased by about 50 per cent since 1986.
Mr James Scott, executive director, says SFE had pinpointed the training of
back-office staff as one area needing improvement. As a former senior civil
servant in the Scottish Office, Mr Scott believes that government still
thinks too much in terms of manufacturing when it considers encouraging
inward investment and job creation. He says: 'A start-up in the financial
sector is at least as valuable as one in manufacturing or tourism.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (4): Poverty stalks the losers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the irrefutable evidence of greater prosperity generated by a
substantially transformed economy many Poles feel excluded from the
benefits. Out of a population of 39m, nearly 9m are pensioners and almost 3m
are registered as unemployed. More than 700,000 of the unemployed, those
without jobs for over a year, are no longer eligible for unemployment pay
and have to rely on other forms of social security, although many are able
to supplement their small official incomes by part-time work and
moonlighting.
Sociologists believe children are the main sufferers from the poverty to
which the abolition of food, housing and heating subsidies has exposed
families of the unemployed or those on low incomes. They are most exposed to
the high prices which have replaced the subsidised basics of the socialist
past.
By the end of 1993, the real incomes of Poland's 15m wage earners were still
2.9 per cent below the levels of December 1992, in spite of a 9 per cent
rise in real average wages in December. For millions of workers and the
unemployed real incomes remain well below 1989 levels, although the quality
and variety of goods available is much higher than five years ago when
imported or domestically-produced consumer goods were in short supply.
In March the hated popiwek, or tax on public sector wage increases, is being
abolished, as promised by the SLD during its election campaign, although it
is being replaced by a similar wage restraining mechanism.
The coalition government of former communists and peasant farmers is
sensitive to the demands of its worker and peasant electorates for greater
social security, more social spending and higher wages. But it is still
probably true that the rapid growth of the private sector, which now
accounts for around 60 per cent of total employment, holds out the main
prospect for future job creation and wage gains. Rising labour productivity
rather than labour militancy, holds out the best prospect for wage earners
in 1994, especially when employment starts to rise again after four years of
steep declines.
Unemployment rose again last year, however, to reach nearly 2.9m, more than
15.7 per cent of the labour force at the start of the year, and could well
top 3m before starting to fall. High unemployment reduces militancy and acts
as a brake on wages growth.
The trade unions have also lost much of their former political and economic
clout. The unions are specially weak in the fragmented private sector of the
economy, where employment is rising, but are also losing ground as the
public sector, with its oversized factories, ageing mines and shipyards,
restructures the best or closes the hopeless loss makers.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (5): Flow of funds quickens - Foreign
Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Poland remained in default on its foreign debt it was forced to rely
primarily on foreign governments and the international financial
institutions for the bulk of its foreign borrowing requirements. This will
now change.
The World Bank alone set aside more than Dollars 3.5bn for lending to a wide
range of projects in Poland from agricultural modernisation to banking
reform and environmental protection.
The EBRD has more projects in Poland than any other former communist country
and the International Finance Corporation has invested more than Dollars
250m.
Until now the rate of disbursement has been rather slow, reflecting
bureaucratic and political delays and institutional limitations to Poland's
capacity to absorb such funds.
But the London Club agreement opens the way to a much more efficient use of
capital by allowing Poland's fast-growing enterprise sector to raise equity
capital abroad and allow the Polish state to raise funds from the syndicated
loan market on more favourable commercial terms.
Recent months have seen a considerable increase in foreign equity
investment.
But the Dollars 2-3bn which has flowed into Poland over the past four years
compares poorly with Hungary which has attracted more than Dollars 7bn and
has only a quarter of Poland's nearly 39m-strong domestic market.
The bulk of equity investment has been made by the multinational consumer
goods manufacturers who have been busy buying and modernising existing
plants and shops, building new greenfield factories and bottling plants and
advertising heavily to create brand recognition and brand loyalty.
The two biggest foreign investors to date are Fiat, which has committed
Dollars 2bn to expanding output and building up the country as the sole
source for Europe-wide sales of its new Cinquecento model, and Coca-Cola
which has already invested Dollars 170m and has committed another Dollars
50m in fierce rivalry with Pepsi-Cola.
But the fast expanding list of consumer goods companies attracted by the
prospect of a rapid growth from a low base in a large market now includes
the leading deter-gent and household ware companies, including Unilever,
Procter and Gamble, Henkel, Benckiser and Cussons, the big fast food chains
from McDonald's to Burger King and Pizza Hut, and a growing number of
chocolate, con-fectionery and food processing companies and breweries.
Latest forays into the consumer field include Cadbury Schweppes, which has
just built a Dollars 30m chocolate factory on a greenfield site near
Wroclaw, and Nestle which paid Dollars 25m for a 45 per cent stake in the
Goplana confectionery factory near Poznan.
At the beginning of march Heineken paid Dollars 40m for a 25 per cent stake
in Zywiec, the recently privatised brewery.
The Heineken deal, in particular, revealed how high the cost of acquisitions
has risen in recent months.
This follows the spectacular revaluation of the presumed worth of quoted
companies on the Warsaw stock exchange where prices rose ninefold in 1993.
The Warsaw Bourse Index has risen a further 50 per cent so far this year.
A wave of new listings and new share flotations is expected in 1994.
The rising cost of buying Polish companies has highlighted the prescience of
those bold and long-sighted enough to enter the Polish market four to five
years ago when good potential assets could be had for a song.
High on the list of successful early birds is Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) which
has invested well over Dollars 100m and much managerial and technical input
but now employs more than 8,000 people in a series of strategic sectors well
placed to take advantage of the expected infrastructure investment boom
which lies ahead.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (3): Expectations continue to soar -
Sustainable economic growth appears to be within grasp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Polish economy is expected to show the fastest economic growth in Europe
again this year, thanks to higher productivity, rising domestic and foreign
investment and growing exports. The gross domestic product (GDP) is
projected to rise by 5 per cent after a 4 per cent officially reported
increase in 1993 which bankers believe probably understated the real growth
in the private sector.
Total output is now close to levels attained before the 'shock therapy'
reforms of 1990, followed by the collapse of the Soviet market in 1991,
which sent output from the old state industries into a tailspin. Sustainable
economic growth appears to be within grasp, given reasonable political
stability domestically and no destabilising shocks from Poland's eastern
neighbours.
Industrial output at the end of 1993 was 8.1 per cent higher than a year ago
while growth in the under-recorded and previously underdeveloped service
sector has risen even faster. But the volume indicators fail to tell the
full story of an economy which now produces goods and services of a much
higher quality than four years ago - but employs 3m fewer workers to do the
job.
Socially and politically, high unemployment is a big worry. But economically
it means that strong productivity gains are underpinning the transformation
of the economy and creating the basis for rising profits, a growing rate of
capital accumulation, and job creation.
The underlying improvements have been overstated by last year's 900 per cent
rise in share prices on the Warsaw stock exchange which pushed price-equity
ratios to dizzy heights. But the emergence of a toughly regulated,
reasonably efficient stock market is undoubtedly one of the main economic
developments of the past 12 months.
This year should see rapid expansion in the number of listed companies, from
the present 22, and a flood of new issues and capital increases as private
companies take advantage of high share prices to raise cheap equity capital.
The government is also expected to exploit this new channel by selling off
parts of state enterprises through share issues. Strengthening of the
financial infrastructure generally is also a high priority with 22,000bn
zlotys (Dollars 1bn) earmarked in the budget for re-capitalisation of the
state-owned banks while smaller undercapitalised private banks will be taken
over by bigger groups under central bank supervision. After lengthy delays,
the mass privatisation of more than 400 state enterprises and the transfer
of managerial control to 20 new national Investment Funds (NIFs) is expected
to be finalised by the autumn, along with the creation of new pension funds,
investment trusts and insurance companies.
Inflation, measured by the consumer price index, rose sharply at the end of
1993, due to a hiccough over meat prices, although the average dropped to 36
per cent last year from 44 per cent in 1992. Price increases dropped back to
1.6 per cent in January, in line with projections of a decline in inflation
to 27 per cent on an annualised basis this year.
Prospects for future growth, meanwhile, have been enhanced by last week's
London Club agreement for a 42.5 per cent reduction of Poland's Dollars
13.2bn foreign commercial bank debt. This should greatly facilitate the
inflow of foreign investment required to modernise the economy and fund
ambitious infrastructure schemes.
Sustained growth and reducing inflation to single digits by 1998 as planned
by the National Bank of Poland, the independent central bank headed by Ms
Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, also requires continuing political will to meet
IMF-approved monetary and fiscal targets in the face of growing political
pressure for higher social spending and trade union demands for higher
wages.
The centre-left coalition government formed after last September's elections
inherited the outlines of a stringent budget. The revised budget with its
deficit ceiling of 83,000bn zlotys, around 4.1 per cent of GDP, even
survived the resignation of Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister, and a
power struggle between the coalition partners over control of economic
policy.
The successful introduction of value added tax (VAT) last July and the
higher overall tax receipts deriving from a rising GDP allowed the new
government to raise social spending marginally. Higher revenue and lower
than forecast spending kept the 1993 deficit to 3.6 per cent of GDP, well
below the 5 per cent target.
Parliament approved the 1994 budget on March 5. This paved the way for a new
IMF standby agreement, which in turn will ensure implementation of the 20
per cent, second-stage write-down of Poland's official debt at the end of
March. This completes the 50 per cent overall write-down in Poland's former
Dollars 33bn official debt agreed by the Paris Club in April, 1991.
Servicing the foreign debt will be expensive, costing around Dollars 6bn
annually by the middle of the next decade. But, short term, Poland's
reserves rose last year to Dollars 7.6bn in spite of a Dollars 2.3bn trade
deficit last year and the London Club agreement should make future borrowing
easier.
The stronger reserve position is accounted for partly by the spending of
foreigners, including planeloads of shoppers from oil-rich Russian towns and
more than 45m German day-trippers attracted by cheaper shopping.
But reserves have also benefited from rising foreign investment in the
Warsaw stock exchange and in Polish companies and from the capital flight
out of Russia last year.
Several other indicators also suggest that real incomes and the level of
overall economic activity are probably higher than officially stated. An 11
per cent rise in retail sales in real terms last year, indicates that
disposable incomes have been rising although official statistics point to a
further 2.9 per cent decline in average real wages last year.
The progress already made is impressive. Most subsidies and distortions have
been removed, many of the most energy intensive and polluting factories,
mines and plants have been closed, restructured or down-sized. More than 60
per cent of the economy is now privatised and several former loss-making
state sector companies, even in traditional sectors such as shipbuilding
have been turned around. Once staid foreign trade organisations, like
Budimex and Elektrim, have been privatised and transformed into
internationally competitive companies which could form the core of future
'national champions'.
The Polish economy still has a long way to go before it can deliver western
living standards. But unemployment should peak and start to fall in 1994 as
higher investment gets under way. This will ensure the sustainability of an
upswing which is already well into its second year and could last for years,
provided it is not choked by inflationary increases in public spending and
incomes.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (6): Profitable vision - Profile / Asea
Brown Boveri
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be hard to find an international company with a clearer strategic
vision of its role in the development of post-communist Europe than Asea
Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish power engineering group. It would be
even harder to find a company which formed that vision so early and applied
it so thoroughly and profitably.
Poland has been central to that strategy. ABB has invested well over Dollars
100m over the past six years, and concentrated heavily on educating and
training what has grown by acquisition and expansion into a more than
8,000-strong workforce. They are employed in a dozen power generation,
pollution control, switchgear, railway rolling stock and signalling and
engineering enterprises throughout Poland. They produce the products which
will be most needed when the country's expected infrastructure development
takes off.
Until recently, ABB's growth in Poland was centred on the acquisition of
majority stakes or at least management control of former state enterprises,
through a variety of ways which reflected the rich menu of privatisation
choices.
Most enterprises were run down, obsolescent and relatively cheap, especially
the early purchases when ABB was virtually alone in the field. Serious
investment in new plant was held back until the human capital and skills of
the newly-acquired companies were honed by the transfer of know-how,
managerial methods and re-training.
Increasingly, however, the quality of output from Polish plants has been
raised to ABB group levels, as proved by the recent granting of the European
standard ISO 1091 certification for the gas and steam turbines produced by
the ABB Zamech plant, one of the earliest acquisitions.
Having picked up many of the best of the former state companies ABB is
shifting ground on the acquisition front. 'Our emphasis is now on green
field investments. The last three investments were of this type. They have
modest start-up capital but the great advantage of being able to structure
according to a business plan fom the start,' says David Brown, president of
ABB's Polish operations.
One of the unexpected benefits of having come in early and strongly to the
Polish market stems from its minority, 10 per cent shareholding in Elektrim,
the former foreign trade company. Elektrim is fast developing as Poland's
biggest private enterprise with sales approaching Dollars 1bn and rising
profits. Thanks to the booming stock exchange ABB is now sitting on paper
profits on its Elektrim shares which come close to the value of its
investment in Poland to date.
ABB companies are also well placed to gain big contracts to supply
compressors and other Polish-made equipment for the 700km-long Polish
section of the projected Dollars 7bn new gas pipeline from the Yamal
peninsula in northern Russia to western Europe.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Scotland (1): Nearly a trouble-free zone -
Scotland's economy has done better in recession than many other parts of the
UK. Demand for constitutional change has gone quiet since the 1992 general
election and the main political controversy now is over the proposed reform
of local government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When John Major, the UK prime minister, looks through his cabinet papers it
is unlikely that he needs to linger very long on those concerning Scotland.
After the turbulence in Scottish affairs which lasted from the late 1980s up
to the 1992 general election, Scotland is today one of the few areas under
the government's care that are almost trouble free.
Its citizens are no longer in sullen revolt over the now defunct poll tax or
other unpopular government measures. Nor are they engaged in hectic debate
about Scotland obtaining its own devolved parliament - or seceding from the
UK altogether.
Instead they are concerned with the more mundane issues of making a living
during the economy's slow emergence from a recession which in Scotland was
relatively mild, but which still made people who kept their jobs feel they
were lucky.
The 1992 election was a watershed for Scotland. The Conservatives had made
Scotland's constitutional future their main issue north of the border,
campaigning against both devolution or independence proposed by their
opponents. Because the party won the election nationally and was the only
party in Scotland to increase both its number of seats and its share of the
vote (marginally, but against all predictions), the movement for
constitutional change was halted.
Yet Scotland is still governed by a party which won little more than a
quarter of the Scottish vote at the general election.
The response of Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary whom Mr John Major
appointed when he became prime minister in 1990, was to call for a change of
tone and a note of reconciliation in Scottish politics. He added then,
however, that 'the policies will remain the same but the pace and flavour of
them will be tempered."
The government has become less confrontational and more deft in its handling
of Scotland. It has slowed the pace of reforms to the Scottish education
system, reached a truce with the schoolteachers and does not seem too
concerned that only one secondary school has opted out of local authority
control. After putting out to public consultation the option of privatising
the Scottish water industry, it backed off in the face of almost universal
opposition.
Yet most health service hospitals in Scotland are administered by trusts or
soon will be, and opposition to them long since became little more than
ritual. The government, far from sheltering ScotRail, the Scottish arm of
British Rail, from the full force of railway privatisation, intends it to be
one of the first parts of the network to be franchised - but preferably to a
franchisee with Scottish credentials.
The government no longer insists on appointing Conservative party supporters
to every vacancy on its many quangos. Recently Mr Campbell Christie, general
secretary of Scottish TUC, joined the board of a hospital trust.
The government's response to agitation for constitutional change was to
produce a document which acknowledged that Scotland was a nation, and
outlined ways in which the union of the United Kingdom could work better for
Scotland. More administration is being devolved from Whitehall to the
Scottish Office, and the grand committee of 72 Scottish MPs is to consider
uncontentious Scottish legislation and will be able to question ministers.
But the necessary changes to standing orders are waiting for the Labour
opposition 'to start behaving,' in the words of Mr Lang, before they are
debated and implemented.
It is a sign of the government's confidence that devolution is off the
agenda that it wishes to dispose of the Royal High School, the building in
Edinburgh which contains the chamber built in 1978 for a Scottish assembly.
One of Mr Lang's strongest arguments against a devolved parliament is that
it would imperil Scotland's access to resources and decision-making in
London.
Yet the fact that the Treasury and the Foreign Office have been able to
override the Scottish Office on the question of supporting Scottish salmon
farmers in their dispute with Norway over alleged dumping shows that
Scottish influence has its limits.
Many people are surprised that Scotland accepts, albeit grudgingly, policies
which the majority of Scots oppose. Arnold Kemp, the editor of The Herald
(formerly the Glasgow Herald) newspaper, gives this explanation in his
recent book The Hollow Drum - Scotland since the War*:
'Scotland is a nation so divided by regional jealousies and tortured by
self-doubt, in which radical or socialist politics have never been able to
form an enduring alliance with bourgeois or romantic nationalism, that it is
easy for the UK ruling party to govern it without a majority of Scottish
seats."
A good example of the way the government exploits those divisions shows in
the lack of united opposition to the plan to reform Scottish local
government, replacing the existing two tier system with a large number of
unitary councils. Mr Lang has not convinced many people that the new system
will necessarily be more effective or more economical than the present one,
but by offering many local communities their own single tier council he has
set the representatives of the districts against those of the regions.
But Tory successes over policy have not translated into voting support. Two
opinion polls published this month show support for the Conservatives in
Scotland at only 13 per cent and 14 per cent, the lowest levels ever. For
the first time, the Conservatives were in fourth place after Labour (49 per
cent according to System Three), the SNP (25 per cent) and the Liberal
Democrats (14 per cent).
It was a rotten augury for the regional council elections in May and the
European elections in June. Mr Lang told the Financial Times that
difficulties in popularity in Scotland related to the UK political situation
and that the Tories no longer faced 'hostility of the deep-rooted and very
focused kind that we experienced at the last election.'
The Tories are unlikely to benefit from the upturn in the economy because
although Scotland did not go deeply into recession, there is little
confidence that things are decisively better.
'A lot of companies had unrealistic expectations of what recovery would look
like,' according to Mr Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish
Council Development and Industry, which lobbies for economic development.
'Their managers are keeping their heads down and are reluctant to spend or
invest. That could defeat the vigorous recovery we would like to see."
It is a sign of how much the Scottish economy has changed in the past few
years that the sector spearheading the recovery in output is the (largely
foreign-owned) computer industry. Financial services are also doing quite
well. The Ravenscraig steel plant (closed in 1992) and almost all Scottish
heavy industry are only memories.
That perturbs many Scots - but does not matter, provided Scotland can break
the cycle by which it has consistently failed to generate enough new
businesses and jobs, thus forcing people to emigrate to England or elsewhere
and causing the Scottish population (now 5.1m) to decline gently. The
chairman of Scottish Enterprise, Professor Donald MacKay, said recently that
if, since 1955, Scotland had matched the rest of the UK in generating new
businesses, it would have created 140,000 extra jobs.
That is why an initiative launched last year by Scottish Enterprise to help
more Scots develop an entrepreneurial culture is so important.
Aa a member of Edinburgh's professional classes said recently: 'For me the
acid test of whether Scotland is really improving is whether my son, who is
now 15, gets a satisfactory job in Scotland when he leaves university, or
whether he has to board the train to London.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (1): Cleared for take-off - The agreement
with its London Club creditors signed last week, re-opens access to
international capital markets for central Europe's biggest economy and most
strategically-placed country. Anthony Robinson and Christopher Bobinski look
at future prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The biggest potential obstacle to Poland's future prosperity was removed
last week when Warsaw and its London Club bank creditors signed a debt
reduction and rescheduling agreement. The deal gives Poland an overall 42.5
per cent reduction on its Dollars 13.2bn commercial bank debt, stretches
repayment over 30 years, and, most important of all, re-opens access to
international capital markets for central Europe's biggest economy and most
strategically-placed country.
The London Club deal closely followed approval by the Polish parliament of
another tight budget for 1994. This won approval from the International
Monetary Fund, thus paving the way for implementation of the second and
final stage of a 50 per cent cut in Poland's Dollars 33bn debt to the Paris
Club of official government creditors agreed in April 1991.
While Poland was in default many potential investors, including foreign
banks, preferred to wait on the sidelines. It had to pay a premium for its
foreign borrowing while equity investment favoured Hungary or the Czech
Republic, even though Poland's strong economic growth and 39m-strong
domestic market were seen as increasingly powerful attractions. Now the
decks have been cleared for the least bureaucratic and most productive kind
of investment - equity investment by foreign companies bringing with them
managerial and technological know-how, new products and access to global
markets.
This is the kind of capital needed to underpin future export-led growth, as
has already been demonstrated by those companies such as Fiat and ABB who
looked beyond Poland's short-term problems and took a strategic view of
Poland's long-term future five years ago.
Fiat is in the midst of a Dollars 2bn investment programme and already
exports the bulk of its Polish-produced Cinquecento model to Europe-wide
markets. With a much more modest investment ABB has bought or set up a dozen
companies employing more than 8,000 people. It is exporting heavily and
using its re-trained Polish personnel to spearhead ambitious expansion plans
in Russia and Ukraine.
The list of international companies investing in Poland was growing fast
even before the London Club agreement. But the bulk of them were
consumer-orientated, ranging from Cadbury-Schweppes and McDonald's to
Unilever and Procter and Gamble.
The beauty of the Paris and London Club agreements taken together is the
prospect they provide of Poland being able to attract the medium- to
long-term capital needed to help finance the infrastructure development
required to underpin sustainable economic growth.
Poland, is preparing to build a network of east-west and north-south toll
motorways, to modernise the main east-west rail links through Poland between
Berlin and Moscow and transform its outdated telecommunications.
Lot, the Polish airline which has just survived a bruising encounter with
traffic-hungry British Airways, has already re-equipped itelf with western
aircraft.
Even taken singly these projects are beyond the financing capacity of both
the Polish banks, themselves in the process of re-capitalisation and
consolidation, and the cash-strapped Polish state. And the list is not
exhaustive. Heavy investment is required to modernise the coal, steel and
other heavy industries, both to reduce pollution and to complete the
adjustment to a rational market economy from the distorted, command economy
inherited from the communist past.
An estimated Dollars 3.5bn alone will be needed to finance the construction
of the 700km-long Polish section of the projected new high- capacity gas
pipeline from northern Russia's Yamal peninsula to Germany and other EU
markets.
Orders for all these projects are likely to favour those companies which
have invested in the appropriate production facilities in Poland.
The government has already specifically tied foreign participation in
telecommunications modernisation to investment in Polish production
facilities.
Even before the expected investment boom begins, the Polish economy has been
showing signs of remarkable dynamism. The economy grew by 4 per cent last
year and GDP is expected to rise by a further 5 per cent in 1994. Poland was
the first to introduce traumatic market-orientated reforms in January 1990
and has become the first post-communist economy to emerge from the initial
collapse of unwanted and uneconomic output.
The economy has already been transformed by the phasing out of subsidies,
the transformation of the zloty into an internally convertible currency, and
the unforeseen decline in trade with the east which followed the death of
Comecon, the old communist trading organisation.
Such a transformation in such a short time was bound to be traumatic. The
winners are easy to see. For bright, energetic youngsters, and entrepreneurs
of all stripes, including many from the former communist nomenklatura, who
were frustrated under the old system, this is a great time to be alive.
City streets are full of new cars, banks, shops, hotels, restaurants.
Millions of Poles are sitting on paper profits from one of the most
spectacular stock market surges. Up to 9m Poles are expected to pay a
nominal sum for shares in the partly foreign-managed National Investment
Funds which will be set up this year to manage up to 600 state companies to
be privatised under the mass privatisation programme.
But nearly 3m are officially unemployed, the streets are almost as full of
beggars as those in London or New York. Drug addiction, prostitution, theft
and violent crime are all sharply higher, and more visible. The strain shows
in a rising death rate, lower life expectancy and a steep fall in the birth
rate.
The housing shortage remains acute, the health service is starved of funds,
the education system likewise. The former heroes of socialist labour, the
steel workers, miners and railwaymen, and much of the intelligentsia, have
seen their industries, professions and status downgraded. Income
differentials have widened dramatically. Farm incomes alone have halved over
the past five years as domestic subsidies were cut and EU-subsidized food
imports flooded in.
All these people have votes. Last September the peasant farmers and workers
who once supported Solidarity rejected the amateur politicians who replaced
the communists in 1989. They voted back into power two parties with roots in
the communist past, the Peasants party (PSL) whose leader, 34-year-old
Waldemar Pawlak, is the prime minister, and the Democratic Left Alliance
(SLD) led by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski.
The coalition controls morethan 60 per cent of the seats in parliament. It
has the power to rewrite the constitution and can re-define and reduce the
role of President Lech Walesa who comes up for re-election next year.
The government has a strong majority and faces a weak and divided
opposition. In theory it could last the full four-year life of parliament.
This is unlikely. The coalition partners do not like or trust each other and
the unpredictable Mr Walesa is busy manoeuvering for position behind the
scenes. There could well be a government crisis at any time followed by
early elections, possibly to coincide with the presidential vote.
The important thing is that economic and other reforms are now irreversible
while the govrning parties, and particularly the SLD leadership, share the
consensus view that market reforms must continue. Poles only have to look
east to Russia, and even more so to Ukraine, to compare the benefits of
sticking with painful reform with the misery of prolonging the process
indefinitely by half measures and backward steps.

FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dealers reported an uneventful session on the last full day of trading in
the March contracts in both Footsie futures and stock index options, writes
Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at 3,247 and
slow but steady buying saw it advance to the day's peak of 3,267 just before
midday.
News that the Bundesbank had left rates unchanged saw March come off the top
and it drifted gently lower for the next few hours on light selling.
A bout of heavy selling by independent traders in the last half-hour before
the close brought a further retreat before March finished at its starting
level of 3,247, a 10-point discount to cash, with volume of 15,640 at the
official close.
June finished at 3,252 with turnover reaching 8,781 lots. A trader pointed
out that the cost of rolling over a long position had fallen from 10 to 7
points, showing a willingness to maintain a short position in March ahead of
its expiry. This was said to signal a retreat in the market over the next
few sessions.
In the Liffe FT-SE Mid 250, volume in March was 473 lots, and the same
contract on the OMLX saw 538 dealt.
Business in Liffe traded options was dull, volume reaching 25,829 contracts.

FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gains trimmed at close of a nervous
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another nervous session in UK equities saw early confidence challenged in
the final hour of trading when both government bonds and stock index futures
ran into selling pressure. Securities markets accepted with good grace the
Bundesbank's decision to keep its key interest rates unchanged, and at first
responded well to favourable indications on US inflation from the
Philadelphia Reserve Board. But the readiness of investors to sell into a
brief advance in gilt-edged securities seemed to disclose underlying
nervousness over interest rates.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,255.7 for a gain of 12.8
on the day. The market peaked at Footsie 3,262.9 just before the
announcement from the Bundesbank, and came back smartly for a while as it
digested the decision of the German central bank to leave both the Lombard
and discount rates unchanged - as well as giving no information on the next
repo tender.
Few analysts had counted seriously on any reduction in German discount rate,
while any change in the Lombard rate would have been of largely cosmetic
significance. Consequently, share prices soon steadied in London and began
to move higher again as Wall Street responded favourably to the news from
the Philadelphia Reserve Board.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost its early gain, however, to show
little change from overnight when London closed down for the day. More
importantly, UK bonds turned down and quickly showed that they still have
the power to upset the stock market.
Traders stressed that the pressures associated with the expiry this morning
of the FT-SE 100 Index March contract were affecting share prices last
night. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, unaffected by expiry considerations, slipped
3.8 to 3,886.6. Seaq volume remained fairly high, at 659.4m shares; on
Wednesday, 625.5m shares were traded through the Seaq electronic network,
returning a retail, or customer, value of Pounds 1.46bn.
Company news continued to provide many individual features but gave less
guide to the market as a whole. Reuters, the global business information
group, improved on the news that it has revised its Globex contract with the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. But the early gain in the shares was later
reduced.
The Footsie was helped by firmness in the pharmaceuticals, as well as by
indications of a strengthening market for oil shares. Good trading volumes
in equities continued to indicate that the institutions are not net sellers
of UK shares but are busy reshuffling portfolios in response to the sharp
rise in yields in the bond markets. Dividend-yielding stocks found buyers
again, with Schroders, the London merchant bank, again providing a good lead
for the financial sectors.
With the Bundesbank now unlikely to make any definitive move on interest
rates for a month, attention is expected to refocus on the US Federal
Reserve, which is still expected to tighten credit policy. UK equities have
shown this week that they are still highly vulnerable to moves in the London
bond markets.
However, the stock market is expected to be preoccupied today with the
effects of the futures settlements on both sides of the Atlantic. In London,
there were signs that futures traders appeared unwilling to extend positions
into the June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index.

FT  18 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Philadelphia Fed data provide
some support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Advancing technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq small-capitalisation market to
record heights yesterday. Meanwhile, blue chip issues on the New York SE
picked up after a mid-morning setback to post gains on the day, writes Frank
McGurty.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 16.99 ahead at 3,865.14, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.47 at 470.89. In the secondary markets, the
American SE composite inched 0.81 up to 470.63. The Nasdaq composite was a
solid 4.86 ahead at 803.85, well above the all-time closing high of 800.47
set on January 31. NYSE volume came to 303.9m shares.
Equity prices moved steadily ahead in early trading, supported by comforting
data from the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia. Its March business outlook
survey showed a moderating growth trend in the region, and a significant
decline in prices paid by manufacturers.
The news set off a flurry of buying in the benchmark 30- year Treasury bond,
which had rebounded in the previous two days on a series of data suggesting
inflation was in check.
But the long bond's rally could not be sustained. As a result, equities gave
back most of the morning's modest gains. The second turning point came in
the early afternoon, when the blue chips moved forward ahead of today's
'triple witching' expiration of stock options and futures.
The Nasdaq remained in positive territory all day, largely on the strength
of computer stocks. Lotus Development surged Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 85 1/2
on announcing a marketing and development agreement with AT&amp;T.
Dow component Caterpillar jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 119 1/2 . The
heavy equipment maker said it would rehire 1,000 workers because of better
than expected demand for its products.
AMR, parent of American Airlines, shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 after warning
that it expected a loss greater than Wall Street's estimate of 24 cents a
share. UAL, United Airline's parent, retreated Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 129
1/4 amid uncertainty on the prospects of a proposed employee buyout.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo closed one per cent down after volatile trading awaiting
the outcome of Brazil's debt talks with foreign creditor banks and amid
caution about congressional talks over the government's economic plan.
The Bovespa index, after touching 13,625 and 14,400, ended at 13,938, off
146 points on the day. On Wednesday the index rose 4.2 per cent.
Canada
Continued buoyancy in base metal and energy shares helped to take Toronto to
another strong close, in spite of turmoil in Canadian debt markets. The
Canadian dollar tumbled sharply, pressuring bonds but assisting Toronto
commodity shares. The TSE 300 index added 17.6 at 4,543.3 and rises led
falls by 475 to 331 after volume of 78.1m shares.

FT  18 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent weakens after Buba
holds ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were mildly higher in the morning, but tended to ease after the
Bundesbank left key interest rates unchanged, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT led the way with the Dax index 2.33 higher at 2,175.06 on the
session, but falling to 2,160.45 as bund and index futures weakened in the
afternoon. Turnover fell from DM9.7bn to DM8bn.
Financials, which had risen earlier this week on interest rate hopes, came
back on the Buba news, Deutsche Bank weakening from a close of DM823 to
DM808.50. Chemicals were also weak after gains earlier in the day, and there
was a suggestion of nervousness ahead of today's 'triple-witching' expiry of
stock and Dax future options.
BMW came in the afternoon with a one-for-eleven rights issue and a
comparatively gentle fall in 1993 profits, according to Mr Christopher Will
at Lehman Brothers, who noted the comparison with Volkswagen's DM1.9bn loss,
confirmed at around the same time. The rights issue took BMW down to DM855
at one point from its earlier close of DM871, before the profits brought it
back to DM859.50 at the end of the day.
Lufthansa had a better reception for a substantially reduced parent company
loss for 1993, which took the shares in the airline up DM2 to DM197 in floor
trading. In specialty chemicals, Beiersdorf jumped DM26, or 3.1 per cent to
DM878 on a better than expected 13 per cent rise in net profits.
PARIS remained in positive territory, although the CAC-40 index ended off
the day's high of 2,260.60 with a rise of 5.13 to 2,247.84. Turnover was a
little under FFr4bn.
LVMH and its associates were the day's main story as the luxury goods group
pleased the market with its results, lifting the shares FFr208 or 5 per cent
to FFr4,389.
The effect rubbed off on associates Christian Dior, up FFr16.4 or 4.4 per
cent at FFr389.90 and Bon Marche, the supermarket chain, up FFr41 or 5.3 per
cent at FFr809.
Merrill Lynch, in a note issued earlier this week, upgraded LVMH from
neutral to above average, reckoning that after two years of
underperformance, all the bad news was out.
AMSTERDAM closed slightly lower in line with the trend elsewhere on the
continent, the AEX index slipping just 0.74 to 424.50 after an earlier
session high of 427.84.
Results came in from Elsevier, Hoogovens, and Ahold; the first two fell back
and the latter rose against the trend.
Elsevier was one of the day's biggest fallers, off Fl 4.30 at Fl 177.40,
although its results came broadly in line with expectations. Some brokers
expressed disappointment over its cautious forecast for 1994.
Hoogovens off Fl 1.20 at Fl 64.80, suffered on news of a convertible bond
launch, while Ahold, the retailer, up 50 cents at Fl 51.30, pleased
investors with its forecast of improved earnings in 1994.
MILAN pulled ahead on the first day of the April account amid strong demand
for industrials as investors begin to focus on the prospects for improved
1994 corporate results. The Comit index rose 3.85 to 680.60.
BCI opened at L5,900 as the new shares, sold at L5,400 in the bank's
privatisation, were admitted to the market. The shares closed at L5,898, a
net fall of L149 for the old shares, trading ex-dividend. The shares were
sold on the open outcry system early in the day to cope with a flood of
profit-taking by small investors on their privatisation allocations.
Pirelli, seen as a recent underperformer, rose L126 or 5.5 per cent to
L2,428, helped by recurrent talk that the group could be considering making
a capital increase.
Stet added L58 to L4,993 in response to comments by the industry minister
that he hoped a merchant bank would be appointed before the elections at the
end of the month to advise on the privatisation.
ZURICH marked time in moderate volume as investors adjusted positions ahead
of today's expiry of Soffex options and futures. The SMI index edged 0.6
higher to 2,887.7, restrained by a SFr19 loss to SFr1,250 by the heavily
weighted Nestle and a SFr12 fall to SFr828 by Ciba.
Schindler certificates rose SFr60 or 3.7 per cent to SFr1,670 as the
elevator producer announced better than expected 1993 results. SMH bearers
bounced SFr34 to SFr870 on the view that Wednesday's fall had been overdone.
MADRID's general index ended just 0.20 lower at 339.97. Continente, the
hypermarket operator, closed at Pta2,720 on its market debut against an
offer price of Pta2,650.

FT  18 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Political reform sustains Milan bourse
 -Analysts are positive ahead of this month's general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Italian equity market, one of Europe's best performers last year, has
been looking remarkably resilient as the country prepares to go to the polls
on March 27 and 28, for what is arguably the most important general election
since 1945.
The Comit index posted a 38 per cent advance during 1993, as heavy domestic
demand was augmented by buying from the UK, Germany and France.
US investors have joined the fray this year and the market has risen a
further 9.9 per cent, boosted by the successful privatisations of the IMI
financial services group and Banca Commerciale Italiana, and the planned
fusion and privatisation later this year of the telecommunications sector, a
long time favourite with foreign investors.
But turnover, while still high, has slipped this month from the record
levels seen in February when it surged to a daily average of almost L955bn,
peaking at around L1,200bn on some trading days.
Last year's strong performance took place against an unpromising background
of political uncertainty and the fast unfolding and widening corruption
scandal.
Few doubt that the market faces a period of uncertainty while the new
coalition government, whatever its ultimate composition, finds its feet.
However, most analysts are positive on the medium term outlook. Mr Lorenzo
Stanca at Credito Italiano expects that the generally acknowledged need for
constitutional reform will trigger the formation of a broad coalition, but
not perhaps for 45 to 60 days after the polls, as parties jockey for
position.
He says that the next cabinet will have room to continue the policy of
cutting the budget deficit begun by the Amato and Ciampi administrations.
The financial markets, he expects, will react negatively in the immediate
aftermath of the election, before picking up again as the identity of the
new government becomes clearer.
Mr Nicholas Potter, his colleague, expects to see the Comit index up at the
760 level within a year, from 680 yesterday. He says the economic picture
facing the incoming administration will include inflation falling as a
result of structural changes in the labour, service and retail markets.
However, he thinks that the official target of 2.5 per cent inflation by the
end of this year, compared with last month's provisional 4.2 per cent, is
optimistic.
Mr Potter adds that service sector employment is falling rapidly for the
first time in nearly 20 years, which will leave consumption flat in 1994;
and he thinks the aim of reducing the public sector borrowing requirement as
a proportion of gross domestic product will need to be achieved through
spending cuts rather than new taxes, which are already becoming unbearably
high.
Mr Fabio Basagni of Actinvest, an independent research group, sees no reason
to change his forecast of a rise to around the 800 level in the Comit index
by August, before the market stages its traditional reversal during the
autumn as complex negotiations get under way for the 1995 finance bill.
He expects a moderate, centre right-inspired coalition government to emerge
from the election and believes that the equity market has already decided
that this would be a vast improvement on previous administrations.
The market, he says, will continue to be driven by strong liquidity, the
accelerating privatisation process, the positive outlook for the lira and
the strength and speed of an export-led economic recovery.
Mr Mark Howdle at JP Morgan expects Italy to be the strongest performer
among the main European markets this year, and he believes that shares could
rise by a further 35 per cent over the coming 12 to 18 months, taking the
Comit index above its life-time high of 908 set in May 1986.
'Italy's partial catch-up with other European markets over the past 18
months was a period of rehabilitation, when a chronically underperforming
market began to react to prospects of structural reform in Italian society,'
he says. But this year and next should be a period of 'rerating', in which
its financial markets adjust more fully to the radical political and
economic changes already achieved, as well as those still to come.

FT  18 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Fall in Hong Kong puts
selling pressure on region

<TEXT>
Although heavy profit-taking ahead of the March 31 book closing depressed
share prices, the Nikkei 225 average was finally only marginally lower as
some of the losses were eroded by foreign investors' purchases of
large-capital blue chip issues, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei lost 85.61 at 20,592.16 after a day's high of 20,692.97 and low
of 20,449.44. Corporate selling pressured prices from the start, but the
index fluctuated in a narrow range during the afternoon, supported by
bargain hunting.
Volume amounted to 570m shares, against 629m. Traders forecast that
corporate and institutional profit-taking would last to the end of the
month, but also noted growing investor confidence.
Declines led rises by 598 to 427, with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks shed 4.74 to 1,648.53 and the Nikkei 300 was
0.91 easier at 303.12. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 3.40 at
1,368.13.
Steels continued to be bought by foreign investors. Nippon Steel, the most
active issue of the day, rose Y4 to Y360 and Kawasaki Steel moved up Y5 to
Y378.
Overseas investors also purchased blue chip high-technology stocks, Hitachi
strengthening Y13 to Y970 and NEC Y30 to Y1,110.
Trading houses were higher on reports of their entry into the multimedia
industry through cable television. Mitsubishi gained Y30 at Y1,130 and
Nissho Iwai Y11 at Y484.
Profit-taking depressed car shares. Toyota Motor receded Y10 to Y2,100 and
Nissan Motor Y16 to Y897.
Construction issues were also lower, with Ohbayashi down Y23 to Y660 and
Tobishima falling Y11 to Y517. Department stores, which are expected to
report weak earnings, lost ground, with Mitsukoshi retreating Y13 to Y942.
Some individuals and dealers targeted speculative stocks. Honshu Paper
forged ahead Y48 to Y770 and Keisei Electric Railway Y36 to Y1,010.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 42.78 to 22,545.16 in volume of 156m
shares. Roundup
A sharp fall in Hong Kong affected neighbouring markets, although some rises
were recorded further afield.
HONG KONG shed 2.1 per cent, led by selling in the futures market, the Hang
Seng index losing 207.48 at 9,513.13 after a day's low of 9,432.79. Turnover
picked up to a provisional HKDollars 4.6bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 3.5bn.
HSBC was the most active stock, falling HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 96.50 in
turnover of HKDollars 410.2m. Cheung Kong lost HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 40
and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 55.50.
KUALA LUMPUR was 1.8 per cent lower, depressed by broadly based
profit-taking among index-linked stocks and second and third liners. The
composite index fell 19.28 to 1,027.20.
SINGAPORE was marked down 1.5 per cent, pressured by institutions unloading
blue chips and speculators selling cheaper-priced stocks. The downward
pressure was also attributed to programme-linked selling and redemption
selling from foreign investors.
The Straits Times Industrial index dipped 32.16 to 2,153.65. DBS Land fell
14 cents to SDollars 4.02 in spite of posting healthy 1993 earnings.
SEOUL continued to retreat for the third straight day amid further
consolidation in blue chips, and the composite index receded 7.97 to 898.56.
MANILA rose sharply on strong buying of blue chip stocks, taking the
composite index ahead 70.41, or 2.6 per cent, to 2,713.31.
While volume fell to 3.04bn shares from Wednesday's 3.49bn, turnover value
increased to 1.14bn pesos from 1.08bn pesos.
TAIWAN put on 1.2 per cent as buyers came into the market late in the day.
The weighted index rose 65.72 to 5,397.06, although turnover was thin at
TDollars 39.05bn.
AUSTRALIA eased in light trading, reflecting a weakness in the bond market.
The All Ordinaries index shed 9.1 to 2,164.4 in ADollars 527.2m turnover.
BHP slipped 4 cents to ADollars 17.46 and Western Mining declined 20 cents
to ADollars 7.13, but CRA defied the trend, rising 10 cents to ADollars
17.76.
CHINA's B shares weakened, with Shanghai's index losing 2.7 per cent to
61.71 and the Shenzhen index 0.5 per cent to 69.89.
Brokers commented that overseas investors were worried about the overheating
economy, with many reweighting portfolios in favour of Japan.
KARACHI closed at a record high on strength in the financial sector as the
market resumed trading after a seven-day holiday.
The KSE 100-share index rose 27.65 to 2,589.71.
BOMBAY was steady, the BSE 30-share index edging up 1.02 to 3,792.98, as
liquidity picked up marginally from the very low levels of the previous two
sessions which followed the imposition of a ban on forward trading.
COLOMBO finished higher, the all-share index gaining 11.23 at 1,252.02, but
brokers said they expected the improvement to prove shortlived and that the
market would resume the correction which began on March 1.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Bundesbank holds fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bundesbank's decision to leave its key lending rates unchanged caused
little consternation on the European foreign exchanges but was nevertheless
enough to trigger further falls in the dollar, write Emma Tucker and Graham
Bowley.
Few had expected the German central bank to lower its discount rate, but the
market had been hoping for a symbolic cut in the Lombard rate.
A fall in this rate - which forms the ceiling for German market rates -
would have had little real significance, but would have been interpreted as
a sign of the Bundesbank's commitment to further relaxation of monetary
policy.
The dollar moved as high as DM1.6920 ahead of the Bundesbank's announcement
and in anticipation of such a cut, but slipped once it became clear that the
Bank had not acted.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said: 'The
markets were very frustrated by the Bundesbank's lack of action. The D-Mark
immediately strengthened against the dollar and other European currencies.'
Analysts are now strongly optimistic that the Bundesbank will ease rates at
its next meeting on April 14. In the meantime, the authorities are expected
to continue making gradual reductions in the securities repurchase rate.
The repo rate is now 5.88 per cent, compared with 6 per cent at the
beginning of the month. Mr Huw Roberts, assistant bond strategist at NatWest
Capital Markets, believes one more cut in the repo rate will give the French
room to reduce their intervention rate - currently at 6.10 per cent - next
Thursday.
The last change in the French key rate was on February 24, but the
authorities cut by only 10 basis points, a move which failed to impress
those looking for a more trenchant easing in monetary policy to spark
economic activity.
The Bundesbank's caution was not the only thing contributing to the dollar's
jaded performance yesterday. A report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve
showed lower activity and subdued price pressures. As a result, fears of
tightening in US monetary policy receded further.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said: 'The Federal Reserve
published a low activity number, but the price indices were the main market
focus, and both the input and output price numbers were lower than expected.
They left the US bond market stronger and the dollar more vulnerable as
expectations of a rate cut receded.'
Other news from the US went largely unnoticed by the markets. Initial
jobless claims for the week ended March 12 came in at 342,000, in line with
expectations.
Mr John LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor, said the economy's vigour has
picked up, but White House economic adviser Mr Robert Rubin said the Clinton
administration does not see any signs of a resurgence of inflation. He
predicted growth of 3.0 to 3.5 per cent and said long-term interest rates
should remain in a range consistent with that growth. The dollar closed in
London down more than a pfennig on the day at DM1.68. But it rallied to end
New York trading at DM1.6883.
The pound remained vulnerable yesterday, following the mixed bag of economic
statistics published earlier this week. A survey by IDEA, the financial
market consultants, asked foreign exchange dealers to forecast a range for
sterling over the month ahead. The results included a low of DM2.46 and a
high of DM2.57 with a mid-point range of DM2.5025 to DM2.5425.
'Sterling is still definitely in its sick bed,' commented Mr Chris Furness,
senior currency analyst at IDEA, adding that technically the pound looked
'very bearish indeed'.
It closed in London at DM2.5158, down from the previous day's DM2.5227. Mr
Turner said: 'The markets are still feeling last month's (UK) base rate cut.
They feel the government is taking risks with inflation and doubt its
commitment to keeping it down.'
There was relief on the UK money markets when most of a Pounds 2.45bn
shortage was removed in the early round. This followed several particularly
tight days.
The overnight rate softened after the early round to 5 5/8 per cent, only to
move back up to around 6 per cent over the lunchtime when the Bank did not
carry out any midday operations. Later the Bank provided the market with
around Pounds 400m in unspecified late help, bringing total assistance for
the day to Pounds 2.45bn.
The Canadian dollar was very weak, falling to a seven-year low against the
US dollar. It later rallied when the Bank of Canada intervened and bought
Canadian dollars. Mr Turner said that yesterday's very good inflation figure
meant that underlying inflation was no more than 1.0 per cent.
'Short-term interest rates could go below US rates, but real bond yields are
attractive and could boost the currency,' he added.
The Canadian currency finished at CDollars 1.3678 per US dollar, compared
with the previous day's close of CDollars 1.361.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Close vote expected on
Nymex/Comex merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOCA RATON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the New York Mercantile Exchange and the big New York metals
market, Comex, will vote April 25 on a proposal to merge the two futures
exchanges, pending final approval of the merger prospectus by both exchange
boards of directors next Monday.
The merger, which has been under discussion for a year, would make the Comex
a subsidiary of the Nymex and give members of each exchange some overlapping
trading rights.
Nymex has offered Dollars 50m for the smaller exchange, and has projected
about Dollars 8m of cost savings each year as a result of combining the two
administrations. The two exchanges already share trading space in New York's
World Trade Centre. Both are seeking to expand elsewhere in New York.
The plan to merge the two exchanges has been controversial from the start,
and a Nymex official this week gave it only a 60-40 chance of gaining
membership approval. Mr Daniel Rappaport, Nymex chairman, noted that for the
initiative to pass at the Comex, it must earn the approval of two-thirds of
the membership, adding: 'We all know that getting a two-thirds affirmative
vote on anything at the exchanges is nearly unheard of.'
At the Nymex the proposal needs 50 per cent of the vote to pass.
A law suit filed last month by a group of options traders at the Comex will
complicate the transaction, Mr Rappaport said. The options traders, who have
minority membership rights at the metals exchange, are suing to share in the
Dollars 50m distribution should the merger be approved.
'The suit introduces a level of uncertainty about how much each Comex member
would receive in the event of a merger,' he said. 'This potentially could
tip the scale', against the plan. He said that while the Nymex is named in
the suit, it is the Comex that must resolve the options traders' complaint.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: ANC takes the heat out of
mining policy debate - Chest-thumping has given place to level-headed
discussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After an inauspicious start in January, the African National Congress and
the South African mining industry have stopped chest-thumping and begun what
seem to be level-headed discussions about the country's future mining and
minerals policy.
The ANC wants the establishment of a new forum to include government, labour
and a wider representation of the industry than the Chamber of Mines - made
up of the leading mining houses but not foreign companies like RTZ and
Shell. Joint technical committees are already tackling issues such as
mineral rights, the environment, and safety, while the ANC has instructed
its newly established Minerals and Energy Policy Centre to draw up a
small-mining policy.
These developments stand in stark contrast to the stormy briefing in late
January when the ANC presented its draft policy to the industry. Mining
executives vented their spleen at what they understood to be plans for the
nationalisation of mineral rights and state intervention in minerals
marketing.
In reality, the ANC talks only of the 'reversion' of mineral rights to the
state and the creation of a state minerals marketing auditor, although Mr
Paul Jourdan, co-ordinator of mineral and energy policy, has done much to
clarify its position after the furore. The latest draft stresses the
importance of consulting industry and omits wild estimates of extra revenue
that might be raised by the 'national marketing' of minerals.
Mr Jourdan stresses that the ANC intends only to bring the country's mineral
rights regime in line with public ownership that exists in some US states,
Canada and Australia, and that has to be negotiated. Confusion about
minerals marketing stemmed from a proposal for a state marketing corporation
put forward by the Macro-Economic Research Group, a left-wing ANC-aligned
think-tank, which never made it to draft policy, while the ANC was unaware
that the South African Reserve Bank already monitored mineral exports daily.
Mr Nick Segal, economics spokesman for the chamber, says the two parties can
now focus on the central issue: 'The maintenance of a healthy mining
industry which includes more players than in the past.' The chamber
emphasises how precarious the mining business can be with employment on gold
and coal mines having declined from more than 600,000 to 390,000 between
1989 and 1993, and the sector's contribution to gross domestic product
shrunk from more than 16 per cent in 1986 to less than 10 per cent in 1992.
The mines have worked hard to stay in business, investing R50bn (Dollars
14bn) in new projects in the past decade, improving productivity, and
building a more constructive relationship with labour. The chamber says a
sound future will depend on a stable economic and fiscal environment aimed
at supporting existing mines and encouraging new investment.
In general, the ANC finds little fault with the chamber's analysis and has
come to appreciate that the country's huge mineral wealth is a mixed
blessing in some ways. The rigours of the global mining business are such
that undisciplined exploitation of the lion's share of world chrome,
platinum, and vanadium reserves that South Africa has would see commodity
prices tumble and bring the industry to its knees.
However, a sense of injustice pervades ANC thinking on an industry that it
sees as dominated for too long by a small clique of white-owned
corporations. If mining, which still contributes nearly three quarters of
foreign exchange earnings, is to provide the backbone of reconstruction and
development, which Mr Jourdan believes it can, the industry will need new
sticks and carrots to take up the challenge.
Large new capital projects given the go-ahead in the past 18 months have
created precious few jobs while the ANC argues the stranglehold the
chamber's members have over South Africa's most attractive mineral rights
precludes the development of small-scale mining businesses and deters
foreign investment. Passing mineral rights ownership from business to the
state is a vital first step. The long tenure of mineral rights vital for
developing high-risk long-term projects can be met by tailoring mining
leases to industry needs, Mr Jourdan argues.
Mr Segal says there is no question of the chamber defending the status quo
for the sake of it, but the complex mixed mineral rights regime, developing
over 100 years, remains the cornerstone of the industry and underpins its
ability to mount deep-level, long-term projects.
He believes the absence of small-scale mining is overstated by the ANC -
South Africa has dozens of small gold and coal operators - and encouragement
of the sector has to be squared with the country's unique geology, which
lends itself to large mining operations.
He adds: 'There is scope for small-scale mining, for which access to mineral
rights may be an impediment, but so are finance, safety and environmental
considerations. We have work to do.'

FT  18 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine's pits of despair -
Coal mining subsidies are helping to drive the economy further into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's mighty and mythicised coal industry has sunk into utter decay and
despair, bringing down the two-year-old nation's economy with it.
The country has been pouring money into the Donbass coal mining region to
save it - but that has only made matters worse. Ukraine's hyperinflation, 90
per cent in December, is largely caused by the massive subsidies needed to
keep 262 coal mines operating and 1.2m coal workers employed (5 per cent of
the labour force).
Employment in Ukraine's coal industry is no bed of roses, however. Four or
five miners die for every 1m tonnes of coal produced, making it the most
deadly in the world. And it pays the lowest mining wages in Europe  - so low
that many cross the border illegally to work in Russian mines at cut-price
rates. But cheap labour does not mean that the industry offers good value
for money to the nation as a whole - the Ukrainian miner produces only 5 per
cent of the coal his European or North American counterpart does.
There is also an environmental cost, which extends beyond Ukraine's borders.
The country's coal industry contributes 3 per cent (2.2bn cubic meters) of
the worldwide emission of methane, a greenhouse gas associated with global
warming.
At the time of independence in 1991 Ukrainians had banked on the rich coal
reserves of the Don River basin to offset lost Russian energy imports and
earn precious dollars abroad. Coal was to be a key asset of the Ukrainian
state, rather than the drain on resources it is today.
The Kiev government spends trillions of its currency, the karbovanets,
(hundreds of millions of US dollars) propping up loss-making coal mines.
Last year the coal industry could only cover 20 per cent of its costs and
the government had to make up the rest. This year subsidies have been
reduced to 40 per cent, but still amount to Dollars 50m a month. Some coal
pits are extremely profitable and could could be viable without state
subsidies. But the government channels the proceeds from the profitable
mines to the unprofitable.
At present the state takes 95 per cent of production at fixed prices,
through the Soviet-style state order system, to satisfy about a quarter of
Ukraine's energy needs. Only 5 per cent of production is left with the mines
to sell at unregulated prices.
This arrangement leaves the successful mines with no money for technological
improvements and investment. Everyone, from the Soviet factory boss, Deputy
Prime Minister Valentin Landyk, to the coal strike committee chairman,
agrees that the inefficient mines need to be closed down.
Even Zhenya, a 27-year-old miner at the Gorky pit in Donetsk, is under no
illusions. 'This pit should have been shut down years ago,' he says. 'They
only keep it running so that we're employed. They're afraid of us.'
The Gorky mine, nearly exhausted, is almost 1km below the ground. Extracting
the coal from its thin layers is such a laborious process that its 660
miners only get 1,600 tonnes a day. (In Europe, where mining is fully
mechanised, 660 workers take out over 66,000 tonnes of coal a day on
average.) Many of the mines are negative value adders - the below-ground
resources are worth more untouched than the value of the coal mined. 'It
would be cheaper to close down the mines, just pay workers their salaries
and import coal from abroad,' suggests one western official.
As in Europe and North America, closing down loss-making mines without mass
unemployment is a daunting challenge for Ukraine's leaders. There is no
political will to take action as no one want to take responsibility for
unemployment and the potential social unrest.
About 90 per cent of the coal industry is based in the densely populated
Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, where there is virtually no labour
mobility. Kiev fears that sudden unemployment could cause a 'social
explosion', especially among a highly Russified population that is
disenchanted with Ukrainian independence.
The government is also reluctant to challenge the powerful eastern coal
mining lobby, which exploits the east-west tensions in the country. Ending
coal subsidies could be portrayed as an anti-eastern move, fueling the
popular perception in the east that Kiev is controlled by
western-nationalist interests.
To close the pits without social unrest would require a long term retraining
programme and development of new industries to hire workers. But Ukraine has
no money for an ambitious, co-ordinated restructuring programme.
Meanwhile, the pits are in ruins. Wooden supports from Russia are rotting
out - one of the chief causes of frequent pit collapses - as Ukraine cannot
afford to import new ones. There has been no significant investment in the
coal industry for over 10 years. Much mining is still done by hand.
One innovative, but long-term, solution for Donbass is to harness its
methane, the natural gas that is now causing underground explosions and
environmental destruction. There are 25.4 trillion cubic metres of methane
in the Don Basin, enough to satisfy even Ukraine's inefficient energy
consumption for over 250 years.
Though uneconomic at the moment, technological investment could make
coal-bed methane extraction an energy production alternative in the future,
while reducing Ukraine's 80 per cent reliance on natural gas imports from
Russia and Turkmenistan.

FT  18 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium hits fresh highs -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM prices finished close to 19-month highs at the London Metal
Exchange. Dealers said the market took advantage of a constructive technical
picture and recent strength in copper to break through resistance at Dollars
1,330 a tonne for three months delivery.
COPPER initially extended this week's upward move and the three months price
traded up to an 8 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,981 a tonne before running
into heavy overhead sales. By the close it was showing a loss of Dollars 5
on the day at Dollars 1,962.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures closed with strong gains after
opening at the highest levels since the dollar contract started three years
ago. The May position opened Dollars 19 higher at Dollars 1,330 and quickly
put on another Dollars 10 as the market sucked in a further surge of
investment fund and trade buying.
Some traders said positive chart patterns now heralded further gains,
initially targeting Dollars 1,400 a tonne and some even talking of Dollars
1,500.
COCOA had a quiet day, ending mostly lower despite a firm start.

FT  18 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool sold well again this week, and the overall market indicator
finished another 8 cents higher at a new seasonal peak of 554 cents a kg.
New Zealand was also a firm market, with some wools dearer, though the
selection there had a slant to carpet types and not always comparable with
last week's sharply dearer sale. The outstanding market of the week was the
auction of British wool in Bradford with prices 7.5% to 10% dearer, and also
at new seasonal peaks. All the pressure to rising prices seems to be coming
from primary markets and little pull from the retail end is indicated in the
trade. Australian offerings are higher than expected in the remaining weeks
of the season and a negligible amount of stockpile wool is to be added to
three auctions to test out this method of stockpile disposal, due to start
in the first half of the next season.

FT  18 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: Prices weaken as Bundesbank leaves rates
alone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds weakened in moderate turnover following the
Bundesbank's decision to leave German interest rates unchanged.
Although few market participants had seriously expected a rate-cut
announcement, there had been lingering hopes for a small cut in the 6.25 per
cent emergency Lombard rate, or an announcement of fixed-rate securities
repurchase agreements at a lower rate.
'It was a classic case of silly stories making the rounds,' said Mr Huw
Roberts, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets. He expects the
Bundesbank to continue lowering its repo rate gradually in coming weeks.
Until the Bundesbank's council returns from its four-week Easter break,
central-bank watchers will shift their gaze to the US Federal Reserve, whose
open-market committee is due to meet on Tuesday.
Many European dealers are hoping for another Fed tightening sooner rather
than later. This, accompanied by further European rate cuts, is seen to help
European bonds separate from the US Treasuries market.
After firming at the open on short-covering in the futures market, UK gilts
took another tumble after German rates were left unchanged. Moreover, after
reports of overseas selling on Tuesday, some traders said the market was
awash with unwanted supply.
The Treasury's announcement that it was giving the Bank of England greater
freedom to operate in the gilts market had little impact - if anything,
traders said, it should have had a positive effect, as it may make gilt
issuance more transparent.
The June long gilt future fell by  19/32 point to 111 5/32 .
German bunds shed about  1/2 point in the 10-year maturities, with traders
reporting most activity in the futures pits. The June bund futures contract
fell 0.45 point to 97.23.
French government bonds weakened roughly in line with bunds, and traders are
now focusing on next Thursday's meeting of the Bank of France's policy
council. They hope it may follow the recent small easing on Germany's repo
rate.
'If the German repo rate falls again next week, we could see a move from the
Bank of France,' said NatWest's Mr Roberts. France's 6.10 per cent
intervention rate currently stands 22 basis points above the Bundesbank's
repo rate.
Rollovers from March into the June futures contracts on Matif dominated
trading, with investors reported to be largely sidelined. The March notional
bond future closed 0.46 point lower on the day, and fell another 0.34 point
in after-hours trading.
Spanish bonds got an early lift when the the Bank of Spain injected
overnight funds at a slightly lower rate. However, the late weakness in
other bond markets dragged Spanish bonds lower, with the June futures
contract ending at 101.12, down 0.19 point.
The June Italian BTP futures contract fell 0.52 point to 111.58.
After a two-day rally, the US Treasury market consolidated yesterday despite
news of low inflation and moderating growth in a regional economic survey.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 11/32 at
92 23/32 , with the yield rising to 6.821 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note eased  1/16 to 99 7/16 , to yield 4.913 per cent.
Early on, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's March business outlook survey
brought a new ray of optimism to the market. The report's current
prices-paid index came in at a tame 16.0, compared with 30.4 the previous
month, while the overall business activity index slipped to 24.1, against a
prior reading of 26.7.
Separately, the Labor Department said the initial claims for state
unemployment benefit receded last week, a development generally anticipated
by analysts. Overall, the data reinforced the impression that inflation was
not a threat to the value of fixed-rate securities, as suggested by this
week's figures on consumer and producer prices.
Traders responded by bidding up bond prices to modestly higher levels.
However, after two straight days of strength - a rarity in recent weeks -
they could not resist the impulse to book profits.
Despite the good numbers, the market was holding a cautious tack ahead of
the Fed's policy-making session next Tuesday. A second move by the central
bank to boost short-term interest rates is expected to coincide with the
meeting.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Maltese borrowing debut draws
high-yield investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first offering by a Maltese borrower met selective demand yesterday from
investors looking for higher-yielding paper.
Freeport Terminal (Malta) launched a Dollars 205m 15-year offering of bonds
to finance a new container terminal. The deal is guaranteed by the Republic
of Malta and is rated A2 by Moody's.
The issue has a sinking fund, which starts to repay principal from March
1999, giving the issue an average life of 10 years. The structure, which is
rather unusual for a Eurobond, is designed to suit the nature of the project
financing.
Dealers said the issue was attractively priced, taking account of the
structure. At 115 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury, it appeared
generous relative to other single-A rated credits, they said. More than half
the paper was placed in the US, where single-A corporate bonds are trading
as tightly as 60 basis points over the curve, according to lead manager
Bankers Trust.
The offering included a 144A option for placement with US institutional
investors.
European investors were less enthusiastic, as they remain nervous about
buying long-dated dollar paper, and are also less familiar with sinking
funds. 'The deal was attractively priced - it was just a question of selling
the story on the borrower,' said one syndicate manager involved in the
transaction.
The deal reflects growing demand for less than top-rated dollar paper.
Dealers said they have seen selective buying of dollar-denominated corporate
bonds, which are trading at relatively wide spreads and have the potential
to tighten.
In the Canadian dollar sector, Toyota Motor Credit and ASLK-CGER launched
smallish three-year offerings, which are expected to be placed gradually
with retail investors.
Elsewhere, in an important step in Bolivia's return to the international
capital markets following the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s, BHN
Multibanco, a Bolivian commercial bank, launched a Dollars 10m issue of
Euro-notes. The bank has already issued certificates of deposits, but this
is its first offering of notes, made under a Dollars 25m programme arranged
by West Merchant Bank.
Moody's has upgraded the rating of New Zealand's foreign currency debt from
Aa3 to Aa2, reflecting important structural changes. The rating agency said
that New Zealand's foreign currency debt/exports ratio and current account
deficit are declining, while economic growth is picking up.
New Zealand launched a Dollars 1bn offering of five-year floating rate notes
earlier this week.

Wharf (Holdings) has become the first big Hong Kong conglomerate to receive
a publicly-declared long-term debt rating. Standard and Poor's rating agency

Wharf clinched it ahead of Swire Pacific, the conglomerate which is also

<TEXT>
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and its investment banking arm
Wardley Holdings are pooling their resources in treasury and capital markets
operations. The move is designed to boost dealing capacity and better
exploit Asia's fast-growing debt markets.
Under the restructuring, HSBC's 50-strong team and Wardley's 58 dealers will
be brought together in a purpose-built treasury facility in the bank's Hong
Kong headquarters.
Staff will be hired to bring the total to 150 people by the year-end, with
room for a further 100 positions. However, HSBC and Wardley will retain
their own balance sheets and legal identities.
Hongkong Bank said the growing sophistication of Asian investors, together
with the introduction of dragon bonds and new derivative instruments, had
prompted it to beef up and restructure operations to meet customer demand
and maximise profitability.
He said that although Hong Kong had long been an important trading centre
for foreign exchange, other aspects of treasury and capital markets business
had only recently taken off, especially on the debt-origination side.
The new treasury facility will be the nerve centre for the origination,
underwriting, distribution and trading of a wide range of debt securities.
It will also provide a broad spectrum of interest, currency and
index-related swaps and derivatives.
It will also embrace the group's existing foreign exchange and money market
services.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Earnings ahead to Dollars 66m at
Minorco
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Minorco, the offshore investment arm of South Africa's Anglo American group,
lifted operating earnings to Dollars 66.6m from Dollars 37.7m in the six
months ended December. Turnover increased to Dollars 1.2bn from Dollars
1.17bn.
The Luxembourg-listed group last November completed a Dollars 1.43bn asset
swap with Anglo, which owns 46 per cent of the shares. It took control of
Anglo's non-diamond interests outside South Africa.
The group, which has restated figures for the 1992 half to reflect the asset
swap, said that for the first time operating profits were its main source of
earnings. 'This completes the transformation from a holding company to an
operating natural resources group,' said Mr Hank Slack, president and chief
executive.
Significantly lower financial income helped to reduce earnings before
extraordinary items to Dollars 105.9m from Dollars 117.8m. But extraordinary
gains of Dollars 57.7m, mainly from profits on the sale of its stake in
Charter Consolidated and Zambian Copper Investments, left net earnings at
Dollars 164m, against Dollars 133m. The interim dividend is 19 cents.

Brierley Investments has sold an 8.5 per cent stake in forestry group Carter

CHH was controlled by a joint venture of International Paper and Brierley

Brierley will continue to hold 8 per cent of CHH through the joint venture
company, and has no plans to sell further shares.
It became a shareholder in CHH in 1990, when the group faced a liquidity
crisis.
Mr Paul Collins, Brierley chief executive, said the company had been a
significant contributor to the substantial 'enhancement' of CHH's value.
Brierley had stabilised the ownership structure, underwritten two capital

holding company with International Paper.
CHH, now managed by International Paper, has large forests in New Zealand

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply-reduced interest charges and higher passenger volumes have allowed
Qantas, the state-owned Australian airline in which British Airways holds a
25 per cent interest, to announce an after-tax profit of ADollars 71.6m
(USDollars 51m) for the six months ended December.
This compares with a ADollars 365.5m loss in the same period of the previous
year, but the 1992-93 figure was struck after ADollars 433.2m of abnormal
items, primarily write-offs and restructuring expenses arising from the
merger of Qantas, traditionally Australia's international carrier, with
Australian Airlines, the large domestic airline. There were no abnormal
items in the latest set of figures.
Qantas said yesterday that operating profit, before tax and abnormals, rose
from ADollars 33.8m to ADollars 100.5m, with total operating revenues
standing at ADollars 3.46bn, against ADollars 3.44bn.
Even this comparison, however, was muddied because Australian was included
for only four months in 1992, compared with the full six months last time.
If Australian had been included for the full six months in 1992, Qantas
estimated that the most recent figures would have shown a 10.3 per cent rise
in revenues and an increase in operating profits from ADollars 27.6m to the
ADollars 100.5m figure.
Qantas described the results as 'creditable,' but admitted that operating
yields had fallen on both domestic and international operations, hitting
profitability. Staff-related costs increased 'significantly', while fuel
costs rose in line with the increase in available seat kilometres - up 8.7
per cent on international routes and 11.1 per cent on domestic.
Net interest costs, by contrast, fell very significantly, to ADollars 38.3m
from ADollars 122.3m. This follows the recapitalisation of the group and the
injection of the British Airways investment in February 1993.
Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas chairman, warned yesterday that the seasonal
downturn in traffic during the current six months would mean that the
second-half results are weaker than those just reported.
'I would expect something less than the first-half result in the current
period,' he said.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Political anchors on Qantas
float - No date has been set for the airline's sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big political question mark overshadows the latest results from Qantas.
Will the airline be floated this autumn? Or will it come to the stock market
in mid or even late 1995, a full two years later than the Australian
government originally planned?
Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas' chairman for the past year, says the decision
must be made in the current financial year to allow for all the
administrative work involved in the 'early' privatisation option.
And he is blunt about Canberra's options: 'It's going to be judgment call
for them, and not an easy one. They've got, in many ways, conflicting
considerations. One is the state of the share market, which at the moment is
strong - that would argue for going earlier.
'On the other hand, Qantas has been subject to very significant changes  -
the merger with Australian, and in its management. The business is
improving, and we're making progress. So from that point of view, you'd be
persuaded to give it more time.'
This is Mr Pemberton playing diplomat. Pushed a little further, he admits
that management wants to wait - a view also expressed by British Airways'
chairman, Sir Colin Marshall - and cites two simple reasons.
First, there is Qantas' profitability - or lack of it. 'We've set ourselves
a (profits) target of over ADollars 400m (USDollars 285m). That's what we've
set as the right return on shareholders' funds,' he says. 'We never quite
meant it as a precondition to privatisation. What we were really conveying
is that any discretionary shareholders will be looking for that sort of
return. The yardstick has to be a normal commercial yardstick, not what
people might be satisfied with because the airline industry's going through
a tough time.'
Secondly, there is enormous internal upheaval which currently suffuses
Qantas, as it tries to blend long-standing international operations with
Australian's domestic network and undertakes an extensive executive
overhaul. 'From a management perspective, we'd like to have the time. It's
easy to overlook the fact that privatisation, and all the due diligence, is
a horrendous process for management.'
Yesterday's results will almost certainly add ballast to the Qantas/BA point
of view. Net profits of ADollars 71.7m, coupled with Mr Pemberton's
prediction that the second half will be 'something less,' suggest that
Qantas will miss its ADollars 400m target by a very large margin in 1993-94.
Moreover, much of the latest improvement seems to come from lower interest
charges - the product of a recapitalisation which accompanied BA's ADollars
665m investment last year. Adjusting to reflect a full six-month
contribution from Australian in the first half of 1992-93, Qantas calculates
that first-half operating profits rose by around ADollars 73m, year-on-year.
The fall in interest charges, net of the increase in depreciation and
amortisation costs, explains more than ADollars 47m of this.
Yesterday Qantas declined to quantity the fall in operating yields during
the first half - beyond saying that, in percentage terms, it was in single
digits. But it did make it clear that the fall affected both domestic and
international operations, although the latter suffered more markedly. Since
December, it suggests that the overall position is little changed from last
year.
While reporting only 'acceptable' figures for the first half, Qantas also
plays up the extent of the changes which its new management still feels the
carrier needs to make.
'I think there's a very big issue about the quality of our revenues - the
markets we're in, the routes that we're flying. There's a lot of room for
improvement,' says Mr James Strong, who took over as managing director last
autumn.
Then there is the labour situation. 'I don't believe the company has got
anywhere near the productivity trade-offs that we should have got in terms
of the enterprise bargaining agreements that were entered into,' he
continues.
Even in those areas where optimists might envisage short-term progress, the
carrier takes a very cautious line. Qantas, for example, said that its
American routes continued to make losses in the first half - in contrast to
Japan, the Orient, New Zealand and the UK. But the Pacific market has seen
two major US players - Continental and Northwest Airlines - retreat during
recent months. Fares have jumped significantly.
But Mr Strong refuses to be bullish. 'There's a tendency to say, they've
gone, terrific, everyone's going to make money in the Pacific. But there
really are tremendous time-lags. It's been a sea of red ink for a long, long
time and it's not suddenly going to be awash with US greenbacks.'
In short, Qantas has made its case for a late float. Over to Canberra.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: German bank gets bonus from
Luxembourg arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, the largest bank in the Grand Duchy, is paying its
German parent bank a special dividend of DM174m (Dollars 103m) on top of a
normal dividend of DM124m after making record profits last year.
Pre-tax profits at the Luxembourg arm of Germany's biggest bank rose by 44.4
per cent from DM440m to DM636m. The increase reflected what Mr Ulrich Weiss,
chairman of the bank's advisory board, called an extraordinary constellation
of favourable factors.
Profits from private customer business more than quadrupled, Mr Weiss
explained at a press conference earlier this week, while the bank benefited
from buoyant trading conditions in the world securities markets last year.
In addition, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg profited from the sale of Third World
debt at higher prices than its written-down value. This gave rise to a
profit of DM209m, which Mr Weiss said would have been treated as an
extraordinary gain in the previous year. Profits from mainstream lending
business rose 12 per cent.
The profits contribution from private customer business was not quantified,
but Mr Weiss said that the number of customers increased by 28 per cent last
year, with a 56 per cent increase in special depository accounts for
securities. The volume of funds under management in these accounts doubled
to DM5.8bn.
The spectacular increase in profits highlights a massive transfer of funds
from Germany to Luxembourg in recent years, triggered largely by the
perceived tax benefits of investing in the Grand Duchy.
The first catalyst to the flow of funds to Luxembourg came at the end of
1991 when the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe ruled that interest
income should be subject to a withholding tax.
A 30 per cent withholding tax was introduced at the beginning of last year,
prompting further transfers of capital, but the capital flows have partially
reversed more recently in anticipation of a modification to the tax regime.
This flow of funds back into Germany - DM25bn in the last quarter of 1993 -
is one of the main reasons for the 20 per cent-plus increase in German M3
money supply in January.
Although investing in Luxembourg is not illegal for German citizens, the
German tax authorities last month launched a raid on Dresdner Bank,
Germany's second-biggest bank, claiming that the bank was actively helping
its customers evade tax.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Earnings ahead to Dollars 66m at
Minorco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Minorco, the offshore investment arm of South Africa's Anglo American group,
lifted operating earnings to Dollars 66.6m from Dollars 37.7m in the six
months ended December. Turnover increased to Dollars 1.2bn from Dollars
1.17bn.
The Luxembourg-listed group last November completed a Dollars 1.43bn asset
swap with Anglo, which owns 46 per cent of the shares. It took control of
Anglo's non-diamond interests outside South Africa.
The group, which has restated figures for the 1992 half to reflect the asset
swap, said that for the first time operating profits were its main source of
earnings. 'This completes the transformation from a holding company to an
operating natural resources group,' said Mr Hank Slack, president and chief
executive.
Significantly lower financial income helped to reduce earnings before
extraordinary items to Dollars 105.9m from Dollars 117.8m. But extraordinary
gains of Dollars 57.7m, mainly from profits on the sale of its stake in
Charter Consolidated and Zambian Copper Investments, left net earnings at
Dollars 164m, against Dollars 133m. The interim dividend is 19 cents.
The group is proposing to change its financial year-end to a calendar year
to bring it into line with North and South American practice. It will pay a
final dividend for the year to June, followed by a second final for the 18
months ending December this year.
Minorco now operates four divisions - gold, base metals, industrial
minerals, and pulp and paper. Gold production improved by 5 per cent to
331,200 ounces at an average price of Dollars 380 an ounce, up from Dollars
353. Copper production rose to 51,400 tonnes from 46,300 tonnes, with an
average price 13 per cent down at 92 cents a pound.
The group invested Dollars 270m in existing and new businesses in the half.
At the end of December net cash stood at Dollars 842m, compared with Dollars
1.04bn last time.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Email buys out US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Email, the Australian domestic appliance manufacturer and distributor, said
yesterday that it was buying the joint venture which it owns with
Westinghouse, the troubled US group, for around ADollars 65m (USDollars
46m).
The Email-Westinghouse venture was set up in 1985, and has annual sales of
around ADollars 120m.
Its operations span a number of areas, including switchgear, metering
equipment, air handling and printed circuit board products. Its main
manufacturing sites are in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Manila.
Email said that all the businesses are currently profitable and it expects
the deal to enhance earnings per share. As part of the deal, the 11.1m
shares in Email owned by the joint venture will be sold via Potter Warburg,
the Australian broker.
Due to this associated share sale, Email took the opportunity yesterday to
make a profits forecast for the year ending this month. It said trading had
been better than anticipated, and that 'this provides confidence that last
year's reported profit of ADollars 60.1m will be exceeded by not less than
40 per cent'.
NRMA, the Australian insurance group, said yesterday that it will decide
whether to float on the Australian stock market in August.
If it goes ahead, policyholders will be asked to vote on the plan in
October, and the listing could take place in November.

Four Japanese companies have formed a multi-media venture that could prove a
strong force in advanced communications in Japan.
Tokyo Power Electric, Mitsubishi and Mitsui, the trading companies, and
Tokyu, a railway company, are to work together on a project to use cable TV
networks for telephone services.
The project will test the possibility of linking an optical fibre cable
network with a cable TV network to offer multi-media services. The TV link
is operated by Tokyu Cable, part of the Tokyu group.
The project will initially look at technical and marketing problems, but
will eventually study bringing together broadcasting, telephonic and
interactive video services.
Tokyo Electric Power, Mitsubishi and Mitsui also have stakes in a cable
network. The alliance is widely seen as creating a foundation for a
telecommunications network which could compete effectively with the industry
leader, NTT.
The move comes amid de-regulation of Japan's telecommunications and cable TV
industries. The ministry of posts and telecommunications recently said it
would allow cable TV companies to offer telephone services on their lines.

Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine
Matheson group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent rise in net profits to
USDollars 197.5m for 1993, up from Dollars 177.8m the year before.
Mr Tim Westinghouse, finance director, said earnings were hit by currency
fluctuations, especially in Australia and the UK, combined with a
competitive retail climate and low inflation in many of the countries in
which the group operates.
Nonetheless, he said, the results were ahead of market expectations.
Earnings per share climbed just 4 per cent to 11.28 cents, following last
year's Dollars 202m rights issue of convertible preference shares.
Ordinary shareholders will receive a final dividend of 4.1 cents, up from
3.9 cents a year ago.

Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine
Matheson group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent rise in net profits to
USDollars 197.5m for 1993, up from Dollars 177.8m the year before.
Mr Tim Westinghouse, finance director, said earnings were hit by currency
fluctuations, especially in Australia and the UK, combined with a

Earnings per share climbed 4 per cent to 11.28 cents, following last year's
Dollars 202m rights issue of convertible preference shares. Shareholders
will receive a final dividend of 4.1 cents, up from 3.9 cents a year ago.
Profits before interest fell 15 per cent to Dollars 64.6m in Australia,
where the group operates 238 Franklins stores and three Big Fresh outlets,
partially due to the fall in currency but also because of increased
overheads prompted by Sunday trading and the move into Big Fresh.
Contributions from the UK, where Dairy Farm owns 29 per cent of Kwik Save,
were lifted by record earnings at the discount store; but the Spanish retail
chain Simago continued to make a loss. The chain, acquired in 1990, is
expected to turn into the black this year.
Asia produced Dollars 93.6m of profits before interest, with Wellcome
supermarkets in Taiwan making their first full-year profit. In Hong Kong,
the supermarkets performed satisfactorily in spite of spiralling wage and
rental costs.
Dairy Farm also announced its intention to buy up 'odd lots' of shares from
Hong Kong and Singapore small investors - some 30 per cent of the firm's
shareholders hold fewer than the 1,000 shares which make up a board lot - at
a 5 per cent premium to the market price: a move which could potentially
cost the group Dollars 1.8m if fully taken up. It affects just 0.06 per cent
of Dairy Farm's issued share capital.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bad loans shatter a broker's
biggest dream - The house is paying for over-expansion during the 'bubble'
era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When officials from the Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa Bank and Nippon Credit Bank
moved into Sanyo Securities in August to help with its restructuring
programme, they expected the worst.
'We thought we would have to deal with all sorts of irregular deals and
illicit transactions done during the 'bubble' period,' says one banker.
Sanyo's broking books, however, proved to be financially healthier than
feared. Mounting bad loans at its finance subsidiaries turned out to be the
core problem.
It took months of haggling for Sanyo, its creditor banks and Nomura
Securities, its largest shareholder, to put together a restructuring deal
agreeable to all.
Sanyo is one of Japan's 10 medium-sized broking houses which rank below the
Big Four - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi.
The second-tier brokers proved more vulnerable than their bigger
counterparts to volatile share prices, mainly because of increased costs
stemming from over-expansion in the late 1980s, and the lack of financial
reserves.
For Sanyo, which has been one of the most aggressive among the
middle-rankers, the restructuring plan announced yesterday symbolises the
death of grand ambitions.
Mr Yoichi Tsuchiya, Sanyo president, anticipating the reduction of barriers
between the banking and securities industries, saw the company becoming a
large financial conglomerate with broking and banking as its two main
pillars. It built a huge Y8bn (Dollars 75.7m) trading office in central
Tokyo, and ploughed cash into its finance subsidiaries, which in turn lent
aggressively to property concerns.
Mr Tsuchiya was hailed as one of Japan's most successful young businessmen.
Had the stock market continued to rise, along with trading volumes, Sanyo
would have been among the handful of brokers with the operational capacity
to cope.
The plunge in Japanese shares, however, put paid to the medium-sized
brokers' ambitions to join the ranks of the Big Four.
Weaker houses have been forced to seek help from key shareholders. Cosmo
Securities was bailed out by Daiwa Bank last year, becoming a subsidiary,
while Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank extended support for Kankaku Securities through
subordinated loans.
And analysts expect to see more bail-outs of medium-tier securities houses.
Japan's ministry of finance is anxious to prevent brokers failing and so
further weaken frail investor confidence. It is twisting the arms of banks
and larger brokers with large shareholdings in the weak brokers to help with
their restructuring.
The main problem facing medium-sized brokers is that most have been
unsuccessful in diversifying their revenue sources.
They are highly geared to equity commissions, and in most cases are twice as
dependent on such commissions as the top four. Nomura, for example, derives
only one-fifth of its revenues from equity commissions.
Reduced ability to cut costs may also hurt the medium-sized brokers. On
average, they have succeeded in cutting costs by between 10 and 20 per cent
in the two years to last March, but financial analysts point out that the
room for further cost-cutting is limited.
Most of the second-tier brokers have already cut personnel costs by reducing
salaries and overtime and streamlining branch networks. Further streamlining
may hurt client bases.
However, Ms Alicia Ogawa, financial specialist at Salomon Brothers, says
brokerages are taking comfort in the slight upturn in the Tokyo stock
market.
She says that as long as current market conditions remain, the brokers will
'continue to limp along,' unless, of course, they are hit by a very big
loss.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sanyo Securities unveils Y80bn
write-off

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sanyo Securities, the troubled Japanese broker, yesterday announced a
restructuring plan under which it will write off Y80bn (Dollars 756.5m) of
bad loans at its finance subsidiaries over the next nine years.
It is also raising Y20bn in capital through a rights issue to its three
leading creditor banks and to Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder.
Mr Takashi Kaminami, Sanyo director, said the broker would suffer a pre-tax
loss of Y8bn for the year to March 31 due to losses from non-performing
loans at its three non-bank finance affiliates. Sanyo, one of Japan's 10
second-tier brokers, reported a pre-tax loss of Y33.4bn the previous year,
and had hoped for a profit of Y200m this year.
The decision comes after months of negotiations among the three creditors -
Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa Bank and Nippon Credit Bank - and Nomura Securities.
The banks have agreed to lower interest rates on the loans to the Sanyo
subsidiaries to 1.25 per cent.
Sanyo said of the Y114.3bn in outstanding loans at Sanyo Sogo Capital, its
largest finance affiliate, Y70bn were non-performing. The broker plans to
sell Y40bn of its securities over the next few years to raise capital to
cover part of the losses.
The announcement comes a week after a rescue plan for Kankaku Securities,
another second-tier broker which is to write off Y50bn in losses stemming
from illicit client deals. Daiwa Bank, a commercial bank, last year bailed
out Cosmo Securities, which was also suffering from heavy losses.
Japan's medium-sized brokers have been the hardest hit by the Tokyo stock
market slump. Sanyo said it still had to conclude some negotiations and
hoped to announce a detailed plan by the end of this month.
Meanwhile, other Japanese brokers announced revisions in earnings forecasts
for the current year to March 31. They blamed lower-than-expected turnover
on the Tokyo stock market.
Nomura Securities, the industry leader, scaled down its earlier pre-tax
estimate of Y70bn to Y50bn, against a pre-tax profit of Y2.4bn the previous
year. Second-tier brokers expecting to fall into the red in spite of earlier
profit expectations include Cosmo Securities, forecasting a loss of Y5.4bn,
Dai-Ichi Securities, at Y7.2bn, and Yamatane Securities with a Y3.3bn
deficit.

Until recently, multi-media and the information super-highway in Japan were
considered over-regulated.
However, the Japanese authorities have recognised their economic potential
and taken cautious steps to ensure the country does not fall too far behind
the US.
Earlier this week, a government panel forecast that multi-media business
would be a Y70,000bn (Dollars 662bn) industry in the near future.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bugatti ownership revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Romano Artioli, an Italian entrepreneur, has emerged as the 100 per cent
owner of Bugatti International, the Luxembourg-registered holding company
which last year acquired Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive
engineering consultancy, from General Motors.
The ownership of Bugatti International has remained a mystery ever since the
company was formed in the late 1980s, with ambitious plans to revive the
prestigious Bugatti marque and develop a new range of 200 mph supercars.
Mr Mario Barbieri, vice-chairman of Bugatti Automobili, said Artioli family
interests now held 100 per cent of Bugatti International.
Bugatti refused to reveal the identity of the previous shareholders, but
said that Mr Artioli had held a majority interest in Bugatti International
from the outset.
Bugatti has engaged CS First Boston as financial adviser, and Price
Waterhouse as auditor.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: American Airlines forecasts
greater loss

Shares in American Airlines, the second-biggest US carrier, fell by Dollars
1 to Dollars 63 yesterday as the company confirmed reports that it was
heading for worse-than-expected losses in its first quarter.
The Texas-based airline refused to put a figure on the losses, but said they
would be greater than the 24 cents a share being forecast by Wall Street
analysts. In last year's first quarter the airline lost Dollars 22m, or 43
cents a share.
Earlier the shares were suspended after the Dallas Morning News quoted
American Airlines pilots as saying the airline's first-quarter net losses
could exceed Dollars 100m.
They said they had been told in a meeting by Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of
American Airlines, that the carrier lost Dollars 59m in February after
losing money in January. They also said Mr Crandall wanted to increase the
airline's productivity and re-enter some of the markets it had left.
American Airlines later disputed the figures, saying it lost Dollars 46m in
February because of bad weather and low fares. It would not comment on the
newspaper's report that airline executives were expecting full-year profits
of Dollars 150m.

<TEXT>
Entel, Chile's largest long-distance telephone operator, yesterday decided
to raise Dollars 350m through the issue of American Depository Receipts
(ADRs) in New York and shares on the Santiago exchange.
The cash is to be raised in two tranches, one this year and another in 1996,
said company spokesman Mr Marcelo Maturama. It will be used to fund the
company's expansion plans including extension of its micro-wave and
fibre-optic lines and the development of its personal telephone service.

Banco de Chile, the country's largest private bank, yesterday became the
second company within a week to have trading in its shares suspended after
three shareholders filed an injunction against the board of directors.
The series A shareholders filed a 'recourse' with the Court of Appeal in an
effort to stop Banco de Chile issuing new shares to series B shareholders
instead of cash dividends.
Lawyers representing the three complainants claim the measure threatened
'fundamental constitutional rights' pertaining to property ownership.
The move would inevitably dilute the stake of series A shareholders, who own
9 per cent of the bank.
The Superintendencia, the country's banking watchdog, stopped all trading
for the rest of the week after Banco de Chile failed to overturn the
injunction.

<TEXT>
Agip Petroli, the refining and distribution subsidiary of ENI, the Italian
state-owned oil and gas group, has agreed to sell its Liquipibigas business
for the equivalent of Dollars 146m as part of its preparations for
privatisation.
The purchaser is Novogas, a Brescia-based joint venture between Primagaz of
France and Brixia Finanziara, a privately-owned Italian company in transport
and fuel distribution. The deal includes a 35 per cent interest in the
Livorno gas import terminal.
Liquipibigas, based in Milan, owns and operates the second-largest liquefied
petroleum gas distribution network in Italy with 25 storage and bottling
facilities. Its revenues last year were L359bn (Dollars 215m).
ENI is reshaping its energy interests into a new company which is due to be
privatised next year. Yesterday's sale, first announced last summer, was
conducted through an auction and is among the largest of ENI's disposals so
far of non-core businesses.
Novogas was advised by Merrill Lynch.
Great Lakes Chemical Corporation of the US has acquired the plastic
materials activities of EniChem Synthesis for L150bn, writes John Simkins in
Milan.
ENI's revenue from pri-vatisation now totals about L2,700bn, and the
businesses sold have a combined turnover of more than L4,000bn with a total
workforce of 11,000.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Floating in a much colder
climate - Richard Tomkins reports on Northwest's problems and prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pity Northwest Airlines. Back in January, it might have made sense for the
fourth-biggest US carrier to plan a return to the stock market this month
with an initial public offering worth about Dollars 400m.
With hindsight, the timing could hardly have been worse.
The company's executives must have watched aghast as the climate for the
offering turned from fair to abysmal. First, the US domestic air fare war
was given fresh momentum by the outbreak of a new battle in the east coast
market.
Then USAir, the sixth-biggest US carrier, warned that competition from
low-cost carriers would cause it to lose even more money than last year's
net loss of Dollars 349m. Next, stock market analysts started reassessing
their forecasts of a current year recovery for the US airline industry.
On Wednesday this week, Northwest slashed the expected asking price from its
earlier target range of Dollars 19-Dollars 21 a share to Dollars 13 or
Dollars 14.
Yesterday produced yet another blow to the offer when American Airlines, the
second-biggest US carrier, confirmed reports that it was heading for
worse-than-expected losses in its first quarter. Northwest then announced it
was indeed opting for the bottom end of its new range by pricing the shares
at Dollars 13 each.
Even before the spate of bad news began, enthusiasm for the offer had been
tepid. Just six months earlier, in July 1993, the airline's heavy debts and
mounting losses had come within a whisker of taking it into bankruptcy.
Northwest was not the only airline losing money: the US industry as a whole
had lost Dollars 10bn in the preceding three years. But Northwest's problems
were worse than most other companies' because the airline had been taken
private in 1989 through a highly-leveraged buy-out that left it burdened
with Dollars 3.4bn of debt.
Unable to service its debts, Northwest narrowly avoided bankruptcy by
deferring Dollars 3.1bn worth of new aircraft deliveries over the next eight
years and reaching an agreement with its unions cutting Dollars 886m from
labour costs over the next three years. These moves persuaded its creditors
to defer the maturities of Dollars 1.8bn worth of debt obligations due
between now and 1996.
Since then, the airline has done relatively well. It was the only one of the
five biggest US airlines to turn in a profit in last year's fourth quarter.
(It made a net profit of Dollars 10.5m compared with net losses of Dollars
695m the previous time.) Analysts have predicted that the combination of
Northwest's lower debt and labour costs combined with a pick-up in the US
air travel market could bring net profits of Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m
this year.
By some measures, the airline's prospects are attractive. Its markets are
less exposed to low-cost competition than those of some other US carriers;
it is building a global route network through its strong strategic alliance
with KLM, the Dutch carrier, which holds a 21 per cent stake in the company;
and it is by far the strongest US carrier in the US-Japan market.
Investors, however, remain cautious. Many of the measures that have led to
Northwest's recovery sound more like a temporary reprieve than a permanent
solution. The labour cost agreement, for example, was for three years only,
so wages will snap back to pre-concession levels in August 1996; the
deferred debt of Dollars 1.8bn will still become payable in 1997; and
aircraft renewals cannot be put off forever. Nor does it help that Fortune
magazine recently ranked the company as far down as number 400 in a list of
the 404 most admired US companies.
At the top of the original targeted range, Northwest's initial public
offering would have raised Dollars 420m before underwriting fees, with the
bulk of the money being applied towards debt reduction. Yesterday, that
figure shrunk to something nearer Dollars 260m.
The figures may seem almost irrelevant in the context of the airline's
Dollars 4.4bn of net debt at the end of last year. But analysts assume the
offering was aimed at re-establishing the company on the stock market to
open the way for further, larger scale fund raisings. A flop now will augur
badly for the future.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Risk control helps Kredietbank
rise 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kredietbank, one of Belgium's largest private banks, yesterday said a
programme of diversification and risk control had helped it to boost profits
by 15.1 per cent last year.
Total consolidated net profit for 1993 was BFr9.8bn (Dollars 269m), up from
BFr8.5bn the previous year. The board has proposed a dividend of BFr200 per
share, up from BFr185 per share in 1992.
Kredietbank said the growth in profits, which was broadly in line with
market expectations, had occurred even though its operations in the Belgium
business sector had been hit by falling demand for credit and a rising level
of write-offs during the past year.
'The worst recession since the second world war . . . and an unfavourable
situation between short and long-term interest rates led to weak domestic
demand for credit, an appreciable increase in write-downs for credit to
Belgium businesses and great pressure on the interest rate margin,' the bank
said.
However, this had been largely offset by an expansion in international
lending and home loans.
Meanwhile, customers' deposits had risen by 15.3 per cent in 1993 to
BFr1.4bn.
Most of the growth was due to an expansion of time deposits and savings
certificates.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Governments cut stake in DAF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch and Flemish governments have cut their combined holding in Daf
from 52.5 per cent to 48.6 per cent. Last year, the two governments led the
rescue of the Dutch truck maker.
Mr Cor Baan, Daf chairman, confirmed a net profit of Fl 10.8m (Dollars
5.40m) in the company's truncated financial year from March 2 to December
31. However, he warned that the company still faced very difficult market
conditions. He indicated that further job cuts and cost-savings might be
necessary.
Rather than having any immediate impact on the way Daf is run, the move to a
minority stake by the two governments was seen as a gesture towards
Brussels, and its reluctance to see overt intervention by governments in
corporate rescues.
The rest of the shares in Daf Trucks NV, created with Fl 463.3m of risk
capital a year ago, are held by an Amro-led consortium of banks and
institutional investors.
The company indicated there were unlikely to be further substantial changes
in the equity structure 'for the foreseeable future'.
Daf's net profit was on turnover of Fl 1.3bn. It made Fl 24.1m at the
operating level.
In spite of the slump in continental Europe's main truck markets, Mr Baan
said he expected further growth and 'noticeably higher' profits in the
current year.
Production volumes were now 10 per cent higher than the 40 vehicles a day
originally planned.

The company delivered 9,432 vehicles in its first financial year, 5,880 of
them Dutch-built and the remainder from the UK-based Leyland Trucks, now a

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bekaert, the Belgian wire and steel cord producer, yesterday announced net
profits of BFr2.2bn (Dollars 60m).
The result marked the second year in which Bekaert had succeeded in breaking
out of its former loss-making position, after the BFr1.05bn sale of its
shares in a Japanese steel cord joint venture had boosted its total profits
last year to BFr2.71bn. Without this item profits were ahead 35 per cent.
Baron Jean Charles Velge, chairman, said although the market for steel and
wire cord continued to suffer from falling prices and currency devaluation,
Bekaert had boosted profits by expanding into key niche areas.
The board has proposed a dividend of BFr300 per share, up from BFr250 in
1992. CBR, the Belgium cement company, announced that operating profits
before depreciation had risen by 5.7 per cent last year to BFr10bn.
But with most of the rise due to improvements from its US operations and
profits from its newly acquired East European cement works, the group
admitted it had experienced a difficult year in Western Europe.
As a result the board proposed the dividend per share should fall to BFr604,
down from BFr606 the previous year.
The results were the first indication of the group's performance since
Heidelberg Zement, the German construction group, bought a 43 per cent stake
in the company from Societe Generale de Belgique last September.

Telephone tariff proposals that have indirectly caused the suspension of
shares in Chilean telecommunications group CTC have been sent back to
regulatory authorities for possible revision.
The sub-secretary of telecommunications, Mr Jorge Rosenblut, said he did not
believe the review would 'lead to any significant changes' in the tariff
structure which, as stands, is expected to have a negative impact on CTC
profits.
CTC, 43 per cent owned by Telefonica of Spain, is Chile's biggest company
with a market capitalisation of over Dollars 4bn. The company trades one
quarter of its shares in New York through American depository receipts.
Banco de Chile, the country's largest private bank, yesterday became the
second company within a week to have its shares suspended in Santiago.
A government watchdog cited a 'legal ruling' that had prevented Banco de
Chile from 'pronouncing over an essential matter at a shareholders' meeting'
that was to have taken place yesterday.

FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bugatti ownership revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Romano Artioli, an Italian entrepreneur, has emerged as the 100 per cent
owner of Bugatti International, the Luxembourg-registered holding company,
which last year acquired Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive
engineering consultancy from General Motors.
The ownership of Bugatti International has remained a mystery ever since the
company was formed in the late 1980s, with ambitious plans to revive the
prestigious Bugatti marque and develop a new range of 200mph supercars.
Mr Mario Barbieri, vice-chairman of Bugatti Automobili, said that Artioli
family interests now held 100 per cent of the equity in Bugatti
International, following a move by Mr Artioli to exercise various options
allowing him to take full control.
Bugatti International is planning to seek outside finance to help fund
ambitious new model programmes that are being developed by both Group Lotus
and Bugatti Automobili.
Bugatti refused to reveal the identity of the previous shareholders, but
said that Mr Artioli had held a majority interest in Bugatti International
from the outset.
Bugatti has engaged CS First Boston as financial adviser, and Price
Waterhouse as auditor.

its US and European cards business to a new executive, marking the latest
senior-level reshuffle in the international credit card industry.
Both Visa and MasterCard have recently replaced long-serving chairmen. The
moves signal growing competition between banks and other issuers in the
credit card industry, as well as a shift in focus away from the mature US
market.
Citicorp said it had created a new position of head of credit cards for the
US and Europe. Previously, responsibility for credit cards had rested with
regional managers, who had responsibility for all retail banking products.
The bank named Ms Roberta Arena as the first head of the cards business,
catapulting her into one of the most prominent positions in the industry.
She is now general manager of the US cards business, and was previously in
charge of European credit cards.
The bank has been largely successful in defending its market position in the
US against new entrants in recent months.
The reshuffle in part indicates an intention to shift emphasis to other
markets with better growth prospects. Citicorp has 29m cardholders in the
US, compared with 600,000 in Europe.
Mr James Bailey, who had run all of the bank's US consumer banking
businesses since the beginning of 1992, has been named head of global
transaction services.

<TEXT>
Ahold, the Dutch food retailer which has built up a large presence in the
eastern US, posted a 12.5 per cent increase in 1993 net profit, with
improved results in the Netherlands and acquisitions in Portugal
compensating for a slight fall in earnings in the US.
Net profit rose to Fl 343.1m (Dollars 180.6m) from Fl 305m in 1992. The
company, which is preparing to take over its sixth US supermarket chain,
said operating profits in the US should show clear improvement in 1994, and
forecast an increase in full-year net earnings for the group as a whole.
Ahold is to increase its dual-currency dividend to Fl 0.62 and Dollars 0.23
per share, from Fl 0.57 and Dollars 0.22 in 1992.
Turnover in 1993 jumped by 25.5 per cent to Fl 27.1bn, of which about
four-fifths was due to the first-time consolidation of Schuitema, Ahold's
majority-owned Dutch wholesaler, as well as to acquisitions of supermarkets
and hypermarkets in Portugal.
At home in the Netherlands, operating profit soared by 32.6 per cent to Fl
296.7m, with around two-thirds of the rise due to acquisitions.

Vital Forsikring, one of Norway's top three insurers, has reported a sharp
rise in 1993 operating profit, helped by a substantial increase in financial
income and lower interest rates, which pushed up the value of its securities
portfolio.
Operating profit jumped to NKr3.32bn (Dollars 453m) from NKr824m as premiums
increased to NKr3.31bn from NKr2.8bn. Gross financial income nearly doubled
in 1993 to NKr5.14bn from NKr2.63bn.
Vital has proposed lifting the 1993 dividend by NKr1 to NKr5.75. Group
operating expenses rose to NKr570m from NKr548m but costs, as a percentage
of premiums, fell by 2.4 percentage points to 17.2 per cent.
The company said that since 1990 its cost ratio has declined by 34 per cent
as a result of increased premium volume and it aims to cut the ratio to 13
per cent by 1997.
Vital said that premiums from group pension policies increased by 31.6 per
cent, while premiums for individual annuity and pension insurance were 0.1
per cent lower. Group life premiums were 4.9 per cent up on 1992, while
individual life insurance premiums increased by 8.9 per cent.
According to the Norwegian Insurance Association, Vital increased overall
market share to 21.1 per cent in 1993 from 17.8 per cent in 1992.
The value of shareholdings and other investments rose to NKr4.31bn in 1993
from NKr3.45bn while bonds increased to NKr19.33bn from NKr13.81bn.
Separately, the group said it was finalising negotiations to acquire a large
property in central Oslo, comprising 75,000 square metres, from Sweden's
Skanska group for NKr1.3bn.
Vital said the pending deal was one of the largest property transactions
ever carried out in Norway.
The group's real estate portfolio comprises a gross area of an estimated
270,000 square metres and a book value of more than NKr1.9bn. In 1993, real
estate activities provided a rate of return of 8 per cent.

reduction in deficit

<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the German airline set for privatisation later this year,
performed better than expected in 1993. The parent company returned a
pre-tax loss of DM50m (Dollars 30m) compared with DM297m in the previous
year. This reduction in losses was better than the target of halved losses,
the airline said yesterday.
The improved results reflected a boost in sales combined with reduced costs.
The number of passengers carried rose by 3.8 per cent and the volume of
freight by 5.4 per cent.
This helped offset falling prices and turnover remained flat at the 1992
level of DM15bn.
Total operating costs dropped by DM500m during the year, 3 per cent of the
total. This was mainly due to staff cuts: the number of employees fell by
4,000 during the year, saving DM300m.
Lufthansa has already said that it aims to break even at the group level in
the current year after losses of less than DM500m in 1993.
The government is likely to reduce its 51 per cent stake this year by not
taking up its entitlement to new shares in a large rights issue planned by
the airline.

two months of year

<TEXT>
The first firm signs of recovery after a four-year slump in the German
chemicals industry emerged yesterday as BASF reported improved earnings and
sales in the first two months of the new year. Mr Jurgen Strube, chairman,
said he expected the trend to continue.
All divisions except plastics and fibres were making operating profits but
they, too, should be back at break-even levels by the end of the year, he
added. An improvement on last year's net earnings of DM858m (Dollars 507m)
was possible despite an expected sharp increase in corporate taxes.
Group turnover of DM6.7bn in January and February was up 4 per cent on a
like-for-like basis. Mr Strube also noted a double-digit rise in new orders
at the German parent company, BASF AG. No profit details were given.
'We have come off the starting blocks well,' Mr Strube said, reflecting
mounting confidence elsewhere in the sector. But he warned that recovery was
likely to be slow and a worldwide improvement in chemicals markets could not
be expected before next year.
BASF's pre-tax profits last year, confirmed yesterday at DM1.06bn, down 14.6
per cent on 1992, were less than a quarter of the record DM4.4bn earned in
1989. Sales have fallen by DM7bn in the same period to DM40.6bn.
A breakdown of 1993 sales, published yesterday, clearly showed the impact of
the European recession. While turnover from North and Latin America
increased by 7.6 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, generating DM11bn in
revenues, European sales dropped 8 per cent to DM25bn.
Germany, which accounts for around half the group's European business,
showed a 12 per cent fall.
Plastics and fibres, BASF's biggest single division, and agricultural
chemicals - both plagued by overcapacity and price erosion - recorded sales
declines of 6 per cent and 19 per cent respectively.
Mr Strube, who was appointed at the start of the slump in 1990, said
restructuring would continue. Product areas offering no long-term prospects
of acceptable results would be examined to see if co-operation with other
manufacturers, sale or closure would yield improvements.
Restructuring efforts last year included the purchase of Mobil Chemicals'
polystyrene business and ICI's European polypropylene operations.

<TEXT>
Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium company, narrowed its losses in
1993, with the steel division turning in a small profit but aluminium
activities falling further into the red.
The company's net loss was more than halved to Fl 234m (Dollars 123m) from
Fl 595m in 1992, when the figures were heavily influenced by restructuring
provisions of Fl 370m. The 1993 figures included slightly more than Fl 60m
in extraordinary charges.
Hoogovens, which raised more than Fl 360m in a rights issue in late 1993,
said yesterday that it would again omit its dividend to shareholders. It
also announced plans for a convertible subordinated bond issue of at least
Fl 275m.
Group turnover fell to Fl 7.22bn from Fl 7.72bn in 1992, reflecting an
erosion in selling prices for both steel and aluminium. This external price
decline offset part of Hoogovens' internal achievement in getting its costs
down by Fl 450m last year. Since 1991, Hoogovens has achieved internal cost
savings of Fl 900m.
Despite lower demand for steel in Europe and the fall in general prices,
Hoogovens' steel division managed to post a pre-tax operating profit of Fl
5m, a strong reversal of the previous year's loss of Fl 234m.
However, pre-tax operating losses in aluminium widened to Fl 265m from Fl
162m. Aluminium prices have been hit by surplus stocks worldwide,
exacerbated by the stream of cheaper aluminium from the former Soviet Union.
For 1994, Hoogovens is forecasting that it will make a modest profit before
extraordinary items.

Celsius Industries, the newly-privatised Swedish defence contractor,
yesterday announced a SKr721m (Dollars 92m) profit after financial items for
1993, up 32 per cent from a year earlier.
The group, which accounts for around 50 per cent of the Swedish defence
industry, benefited from rationalisation, its purchase of CelsiusTech and a
strong contribution from Safe Partners, the accommodation rig company in
which it holds 40 per cent.
A dividend of SKr6.50 per share is proposed.
The operating result improved by SKr322m to SKr348m as sales grew to
SKr11.6bn from SKr10.5bn. Lower interest rates meant the group's financial
income dropped to SKr373m from SKr519m.
Orders rose by SKr4.5bn to SKr11.6bn during the year to take the group's
order book at the year-end to SKr25.6bn.
CelsiusTech, which was bought from Nobel Industries early last year, made a
first time contribution of SKr135m. Kockums, the submarine unit, saw a
slight weakening of its result to SKr209m from SKr221m.
Most disappointing was the performance of Bofors, the weapons systems
division, where profits halved to SKr112m from SKr220m. The unit was hit by
lower sales and redundancy costs.

executive

<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Dolgen, who has a reputation as one of Hollywood's shrewdest
deal-makers and toughest managers, is quitting Sony Pictures Entertainment
to head a new film and television entertainment group being formed by Viacom
following its Dollars 10bn takeover of Paramount Communications.
The appointment is a key one for Viacom, because Paramount's Hollywood
operations have had a lacklustre record in recent years, even though they
were the main prize in the recent bitter takeover battle for the company.
Viacom needs to improve sharply its results to justify the high price it
paid for the business.
Mr Dolgen's move, announced by Viacom yesterday, is a fresh blow to Sony
Pictures Entertainment, which owns the Columbia and Tristar studios and has
suffered in recent years from a very mixed box office record and
considerable senior management upheaval.
Mr Dolgen, 48, was president of Sony Pictures Entertainment's motion picture
group, where he had responsibility for the business side of the group,
rather than creative operations, and was renowned as a cost-cutter who
reined back its once lavish expenditure.
He has a reputation as an intimidating manager, with a confrontational
style: his office at Fox Inc, where he worked before joining Sony, was
nicknamed the 'house of pain and suffering'.
His move comes at a time when Japan's Sony, which paid Dollars 3.4bn for
Columbia in 1989, is exploring the possible sale of a minority stake in its
motion picture operations to a strategic investor, such as a telephone or
cable company.
Mr Dolgen will be chairman of Viacom Entertainment Group, which will oversee
Paramount's film and television business and incorporate Viacom's own
substantial television production, distribution and broadcasting operations.

A long-awaited upturn in the forestry cycle was signalled yesterday by MoDo,
one of Sweden's leading forestry groups, when it announced a sharply reduced
loss for 1993 and predicted a strong return to the black this year.
Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive, said: 'The upturn in the market which we
clearly saw in the last quarter of 1993 is gaining momentum. The balance
between supply and demand is improving.'
He noted that prices for pulp and fine paper had already risen strongly this
year and predicted increases for other products.
MoDo said the price rises and its own competitive position should enable it
to produce a profit of more than SKr1bn (Dollars 127m) in 1994.
Like other Swedish forestry groups, its position has been improved by
cost-cutting, lower interest rates and the weaker krona. It expects capacity
utilisation at its units to rise to 90 per cent this year, from 85 per cent
in 1993.
Last year, the group cut losses after financial items to SKr449m from
SKr1.51bn, with the deficit in the fourth quarter amounting to only SKr22m,
against SKr824m in the same 1992 period.
The group said higher volumes, increased productivity and a near SKr2bn
reduction in costs since 1990 had helped to compensate for the fall in
market prices during the year.
Sales expanded to SKr17.1bn from SKr15.7bn. There was an operating profit of
SKr687m, compared with a SKr407m deficit in 1992.
MoDo felt the full effects of rationalisation and the weaker krona in its
Swedish units, where operating profits reached SKr1.2bn after a SKr182m loss
in 1992.
However, a deeper operating loss of SKr522m at its French unit proved a drag
on the result, as did the higher costs of servicing foreign debt.
The French operations were negatively affected by the strong franc and low
market prices.
The group is not proposing a dividend for the second year running.

The placing of a minority stake in a US offshoot enabled Cairn Energy, the
oil and gas explorer and producer, to report pre-tax profits up from Pounds
818,000 to Pounds 2.31m in 1993.
The Pounds 3.66m surplus made up for a write-down of oil and gas assets
totalling Pounds 2.66m. Results were also helped by the acquisition of
Teredo Petroleum in May and a firm US gas market.
However, Mr Norman Lessels, chairman, warned that if the current low oil
prices were maintained 1994 cash flow and profits would be adversely
affected.
Group turnover was up from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 18.2m. Earnings per share
were 3.52p (3.03p).
During the year the group sold its interest in the Hatfield Moors UK onshore
gas field and an onshore New Zealand oilfield for a total of Pounds 1.9m.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Folding of the brewing umbrella - Regionals
lose the protection of Whitbread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday of last week, with little fuss, one of British brewing's
historic institutions was abolished when Whitbread, one of the giants of the
industry, sold Pounds 225m-worth of shares in eight smaller brewers.
Thus ended the so-called 'Whitbread umbrella', whereby for 40 years
Whitbread had held strategic stakes in local brewers to protect them from
takeover by their bigger rivals.
The obvious question now arises: given that protection was necessary in the
first place, are the regional brewers being thrown to the wolves?
Not necessarily. In many industries, size means everything. In UK brewing,
there is evidence that middle-sized companies these days can not only hold
their own against the giants, but can actually gain ground.
This can be simply illustrated by combining the results of a dozen regional
brewers* and comparing them with Britain's biggest brewer and publican,
Bass.
Last year, the regional sample had combined sales of Pounds 1.8bn and
operating profits of Pounds 255m, a margin of 14 per cent. Bass's brewing
and pub divisions had combined sales of Pounds 2.3bn and profits of Pounds
361m, a margin of 16 per cent. Scale economies, it seems, are worth
something in UK brewing: but not much.
Look at the best performers in the regional group, and the balance tilts the
other way. Morland, the Oxfordshire brewer, had a margin last year of 23 per
cent. Over the past five years, its sales have grown by an average 19 per
cent a year, while its earnings per share are up 11 per cent over the
period. Greene King, based in East Anglia, has margins of 19 per cent and
average sales growth of 7 per cent. Bass as a group raised its sales by 2.5
per cent a year over the period, while its earnings fell by nearly a third.
In one sense, Bass could argue that its poor performance is the result of
enemy action. Since 1989, when the government took steps against the
industry on competition grounds, there has been a ceiling on the number of
licensed premises the big brewers can own. Not only are groups like Bass and
Whitbread barred from increasing their pub estates: in compliance with the
Beer Orders (as the legislation is known) they had to get rid of pubs and
take large restructuring charges against profits.
In fact, the Beer Orders are less of a constraint than they appear. They
limit only the number of pubs the big brewers can own. Bass, like many of
its smaller competitors, has little desire to increase the number of its
pubs. This is because the tied house system has left the brewers with a long
tail of small, unprofitable tenanted pubs whose sole purpose is to mop up
the last of the brewery's output. The big or middle-sized brewers want to
get rid of those pubs and acquire bigger, more profitable managed pubs
instead.
More fundamentally, the big brewers face the problem that in some parts of
their business, size can be a positive disadvantage.
It is, of course, more economical to produce beer in huge, modern breweries,
and to promote national brands through the national media. But distribution
is another matter. Very often, the local brewer has all his pubs within a
few miles of the brewery: and for a product consisting almost wholly of
water, most of whose retail price goes to the government, this is an
important advantage.
As for the pubs themselves, a crucial drawback for the big brewers is that
they have failed to introduce branding into their outlets.
Retail chains like Boots or Marks and Spencer can use a standard national
format to drive smaller rivals out of business. For the big brewers, the
reverse can be the case. Watneys, for instance, now jointly owned by Grand
Metropolitan and Fosters, has in recent years expunged its name from many of
its pub frontages, preferring modest anonymity.
The result of this can be a reverse economy of scale. Run one pub, and you
make a given profit. Run fifty, and you have to hire an accountant, a buyer,
a property expert and security staff. Quite possibly, none of those pubs
will be more inherently profitable than the one you started with. If so, the
extra overhead is a dead loss.
So what shape will the industry take, now that Whitbread has taken its
umbrella away?
Brokers' analysts, who are perhaps interested parties, argue for a degree of
concentration. But, they agree, it will take a limited form. Rather than the
big brewers snapping up the smaller, the medium-sized brewers will snap up
the smallest. This may take time, since many of the smallest are protected
by family holdings or restricted voting structures.
The point is, however, that the middle-sized brewers from which Whitbread
withdrew its protection last week are mostly able to take care of
themselves.
Companies such as Morland, Greene King, Marston and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley
have developed varied and successful strategies to cope with the changing
world of UK brewing.
In stock market terms, all stand on higher multiples and lower yields than
the industry leaders. For the big brewers, the Beer Orders are a handy
excuse for not snapping up their smaller rivals. In truth, they might be
pushed to afford them.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sanderson Bramall lifted by acquisitions to
Pounds 3.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolstered by acquisitions, profits of the Sanderson Bramall Motor Group
advanced from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 3.77m pre-tax in 1993.
Turnover surged from Pounds 106.83m to Pounds 223.06m. The Skipper
companies, acquired last July and partly financed by a Pounds 17m rights
issue, contributed Pounds 84m to turnover and Pounds 1.41m to profits.
In all, acquisitions added Pounds 103m to turnover and Pounds 2.12m to
profits.
Earnings worked through at 10.09p (5.04p) and a proposed final dividend of
1.74p lifts the total by 20 per cent to 2.4p.
In October, the group completed the purchase of 28 per cent of Flightform,
the UK franchise holder for Thrifty Vehicle Rental, the US rental company.
Earlier this month contracts were exchanged to purchase motor group
Petrogate.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods falls to Pounds 9m asGerman
recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the UK waste man-agement company, yesterday announced a sharper
than expected 53 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds
19.3m to Pounds 8.98m as the effects of severe recession in Germany began to
bite.
The company also said it was planning to strengthen its board with three
non-executive appointments. The first would be Mr Mark Radcliffe, a director
of the London Stock Exchange. The others would be named soon, Lord Lane of
Horsell, chairman, said.
Laidlaw, the Canadian group which owns 35 per cent of Attwoods and has three
directors on the board, yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to the UK
company. Mr Jim Bullock, Laidlaw's chief executive, said he did not intend
to maintain the status quo with Attwoods in the long term. But, 'we are not
in any way poised to sell our position,' he added.
Attwoods, meanwhile, stressed the rest of the year would be difficult. Mr
Ken Foreman, chief executive, said full-year profits were expected to be
lower after a series of one-off charges.
Mr Foreman was more optimistic about 1995 however. 'I believe real growth
will show through then,' he said. There were signs of an improvement in the
UK, with landfill prices expected to firm after the introduction of
environmental legislation in May.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to January 31 were hit by the final
Pounds 2.7m exceptional costs of settling protracted litigation in the US.
The previous year had also been flattered by some Pounds 5m in currency
gains. At the operating level, excluding litigation costs, profits were 12
per cent lower at Pounds 16.26m. Sales were 9 per cent higher at Pounds
178.49m.
The UK returned the best performance, with a 39 per cent increase in
operating profits to Pounds 2m on sales 17 per cent ahead to Pounds 30.4m.
Mainland Europe suffered from the sharp downturn in Germany, and operating
profits fell by 40 per cent from DM13.2m to DM7.9m (Pounds 3.07m) on sales 4
per cent lower at DM81.4m.
US profits, which suffered from losses in the medical waste operation as a
result of price pressure, fell from Dollars 21.2m to Dollars 13.8m (Pounds
9.4m) on sales Dollars 2m lower at Dollars 171.6m.
The dividend is held at 1.75p. Earnings fell from 5.27p to 1.97p per share.
COMMENT
Attwoods shares are likely to be overshadowed by Laidlaw's future
intentions, the problems in Germany and exposure to very mature markets.
While the good news is that significant progress has been made on improving
the balance sheet, and prices are firming in the UK, doubts remain about
margins in other parts of the world. Forecasts were downgraded from about
Pounds 30m to about Pounds 23m after a disappointing second quarter. This
puts the shares on a prospective p/e of about 22, which looks fully valued.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dawsongroup advances 67% to Pounds 7.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawsongroup, the Milton Keynes-based commercial vehicle hire and
distribution company, lifted pre-tax profits by 67 per cent for the year
ended December 31.
Mr Peter Dawson, the executive chairman who holds almost 65 per cent of the
shares, said that the performance proved that the company had pursued the
right strategy through the recession.
Profits were up from Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 7.92m. Turnover grew by 14 per
cent from Pounds 46.7m to Pounds 53.3m, and operating margins rose from 19.2
per cent to 24.2 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 10.4p to 17.3p. A final dividend of 3p is
proposed, giving a total of 4.5p (3p).
Mr Dawson, who today resigns as executive chairman to become chairman and
managing director of a new Dutch division, said the group was continuing to
make progress to broaden its customer base.
The group has two main divisions - truck and trailer rentals and a large
Volvo truck dealership.
The rentals division's profits before tax were 77 per cent ahead from Pounds
4.21m to Pounds 7.45m on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 36.6m (Pounds
34m).
Mr Michael Williams, who took over as chief executive in November, said the
key factor in the rentals division performance had been the utilisation and
hire rates on short-term rentals for both trucks and rentals.
The average short-term truck fleet was 11 per cent down, while utilisation
was 4 percentage points ahead at 76 per cent. The average short-term trailer
fleet was 14 per cent ahead, with utilisation maintained at 83 per cent.
The size of the contract hire fleet, which contributes 40 per cent of
revenue, had been maintained. In contrast, the portable cold store fleet
grew by 40 per cent and doubled turnover to Pounds 2m.
Pre-tax profits for the commercial vehicles division fell from Pounds
534,000 to Pounds 475,000 on turnover sharply up from Pounds 23m to Pounds
35.3m.
Mr Dawson said he expected to see continued growth in the coming year. The
two-week old international division, which he is heading will operate in the
cold store and trailer markets, and hopes to have 25 units in each market by
the year end.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Oliver takes first step on road to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oliver Group, the multiple shoe retailer, has marked the first stage of its
recovery programme with a return to the black in the year ended January 1
1994.
Following its exit from non-core activities, the group turned in a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 244,000, compared with a restated Pounds 20.87m loss
previously. The shares rose 4p to 48p yesterday.
Sales in the year fell by 10 per cent to Pounds 73.6m, largely reflecting an
average of 72 fewer branches than last time. However, on a like-for-like
basis sales growth was 5.7 per cent, which Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said
'represents a promising step forward.'
Mr Cassidy said this year had started well with sales in the first 10 weeks
ahead of last year on a like for like basis and in line with expectations.
At the trading level, the profit was Pounds 1.12m (Pounds 11.26m loss)
before a Pounds 489,000 surplus (Pounds 7.53m loss) on disposal of
properties. There was also a Pounds 277,000 charge this time for closure
costs, which mainly comprised a Pounds 261,000 goodwill write-off on the
Brick Studio business.
Net interest was halved to Pounds 1.09m, helped by falling interest rates, a
Pounds 2.85m increase in cash and a Pounds 2.7m fall in bank borrowings.
Gearing was reduced to 58 per cent (73.1 per cent).
Earnings per share were 1.49p (82.08p losses). Again no dividend has been
declared - none has been paid since 1991.
Mr Cassidy said major improvements in children's footwear ranges had
produced impressive gains in 1993. 'We intend to push home this advantage in
1994,' he added.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Purchases help Baynes rise 48%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contributions from acquisitions helped Charles Baynes, the distribution and
specialist engineering business, lift 1993 pre-tax profits by 48 per cent.
The group, which spent Pounds 48m on purchases during the year dominated by
Buck &amp; Hickman, the industrial tools distributor acquired for Pounds 33m
last autumn, said contributions from these operations pushed profits up from
Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 8.2m.
Sales advanced to Pounds 91.2m (Pounds 70.3m), including Pounds 27.2m from
acquisitions. The comparative figure included Pounds 5.68m from discontinued
activities. Continuing activities rose 41 per cent.
Acquisitions provided Pounds 2.56m of operating profits of Pounds 7.9m
(Pounds 4.1m). Profits from underlying businesses moved ahead 34 per cent to
Pounds 5.4m, despite a 1 per cent fall in turnover.
Earnings per share increased to 3.71p (2.8p), while a proposed final
dividend of 1.075p (0.9p) takes the total to 1.65p (1.425p).
Welcoming the figures, Mr John Perkins, finance director, said the group had
defied flat markets in the UK and continental Europe and increased operating
margins by embarking on a cost-cutting programme.
Aerospace engineering suffered the brunt of the rationalisation as the
workforce was cut by 25 per cent to 430 after six plants acquired from
Cookson Group were merged on one site.
'The aerospace business remains poor and we do not envisage a substantial
pick up before 1995,' according to Mr Perkins, who predicted further
rationalisation in the valves and packaging sectors.
He also hinted at fresh acquisitions, which would be financed from cash
reserves or debt rather than new equity.
COMMENT
With net cash of Pounds 10.1m, Baynes is well-placed to pick off small
engineering companies and has the support of its bankers to go for larger
prey. Its ability to do so has been enhanced considerably by stripping out
costs from existing businesses and making shrewd purchases at home and
abroad. Impressed by its strategy, analysts have upgraded profit forecasts
to Pounds 12.1m. Although the prospective multiple of 17.5 is ahead of the
sector average, the shares are worth considering given the group's record
for earnings enhancing deals.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Learmonth &amp; Burchett's shares fall on
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Sys-tems, the USM-quoted computing
services company, fell by 31 per cent from 140p to 96p on a warning that
profits for the year to April 30 were likely to be well below expectations.
The company also said it was unlikely to pay a final dividend.
At the halfway stage, Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, had indicated pre-tax
profits for the full year of about Pounds 1.8m.
The source of the company's problems is poor trading in the UK, where
customers have been slow to finalise orders.
Mr Neil Davies, chief financial officer, said that full-year losses before
tax of up to Pounds 1m could be expected if two or three of the company's
larger customers failed to complete purchases.
The company said that a reorganisation had been put in place, including the
resignation in December of the director responsible for operations and a
reduction of Pounds 2m in operating costs, but improved results from the UK
business could not be expected before next year.
At the halfway stage the shares lost a quarter of their value when the
company reported pre-tax profits of only Pounds 210,000, 73 per cent lower
than the Pounds 753,000 recorded the previous year.
Turnover for the half year was Pounds 13.1m.
LBMS develops large scale and expensive computer software which makes it
easier for computer specialists to write programmes.
The company now derives more than half its turnover from the US, where LBMS
is growing at an average of 50 per cent a year.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Templeton raising up to Pounds 140m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A conversion issue by Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust is to
raise up to Pounds 140m in a placing and offer of up to 140m C shares.
Conversion will take place once the assets relating to the C shares are 80
per cent invested or on September 16 1994, whichever is the earlier.
The institutional placing, through Smith New Court, will account for 105m of
the new shares, and the remaining 35m will be available to existing
investors and the public. Templeton, with total assets of about Pounds 391m
is already the largest of the 8 emerging markets investment trusts.
The new shares will be offered with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis.
The warrants, which are exercisable at 399p annually from 1995 to 2004, will
also be given to existing shareholders.
As at March 11 1994 the trust's diluted net asset value was 396.3p per
share.
Last applications under the public offer are due on Thursday April 14.
Emerging markets funds were popular with investors last year, and Mr Mark
Mobius, Templeton's investment manager, is regarded as one of the experts in
the area. However, the shares of all emerging markets trusts have come off
the top recently.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Edmond hit by higher provision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An increased provision of Pounds 1.65m against land holdings left Edmond
Holdings, the Northampton-based housebuilder, with higher pre-tax losses of
Pounds 1.89m for the 1993 year on turnover lower at Pounds 11m.
The comparative figures showed land provisions of Pounds 322,000 and pre-tax
losses of Pounds 1.15m on turnover of Pounds 12.6m.
Mr Andrew Naish, chairman, said the second half had seen an improvement for
the first time in five years, resulting in a profit for the period of Pounds
61,000 before provisions and tax.
The company said that in view of the better trading and its underlying
strength it was proposing to maintain the final dividend at 0.15p for a
total of 0.3p (0.5p). Losses per share were 3.1p (1.5p).

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower debt provisions help Birmingham
Midshires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham Midshires Building Society announced a two-thirds rise in 1993
pre-tax profits to Pounds 39.7m, compared with Pounds 23.9m, helped by a
fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
The society, the UK's 13th largest, cut its provisions from Pounds 37m to
Pounds 22.3m. Mr Mike Jackson, chief executive, said that the society had
acted earlier than some others in making provision and in taking aggressive
action to deal with arrears. He expected provisions to fall at a similar
pace in 1994.
Assets rose over the 12 months by 13 per cent to more than Pounds 4bn for
the first time with Pounds 4.3bn, against Pounds 3.8bn, after a series of
mortgage book acquisitions during the year.
The society's cost to income ratio remained above the sector average, though
it fell from 53 per cent to 49.4 per cent last year. Mr Jackson said he
expected the ratio to continue to fall, though at a slower rate because of
the investments the society was undertaking.
Birmingham Midshires is spending some Pounds 20m in a new building, and is
also investing in changing its core computer systems.
Mr Jackson said that the society was 'in growth mode' and set as its
priority the development of new products for its customers such as current
accounts and offshore operations.
The society has stepped back from some of the activities into which it
diversified a few years ago. It has sold its commercial insurance broker,
stopped offering to process mortgages for third parties, and has a reduced
estate agency business of some 22 branches compared with the 71 it had in
1990.
Birmingham Midshires attracted net retail funds of Pounds 251m in 1993, in
which its postal accounts were an important element. Wholesale funding was
21.7 per cent of total shares and deposits.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Travis expands as profits double to Pounds
20.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travis Perkins is paying Pounds 41.8m to acquire the builders' merchants
division of AAH, the pharmaceuticals and distribution company, writes Andrew
Taylor.
Mr Tony Travis, chairman, said the purchase would put the company - the UK's
fifth largest builders' merchant - on a par with Harcros and Jewsons, the
second and third biggest builders' merchants behind market leader Wolseley.
The group also announced more than doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.5m
(Pounds 10m) for 1993 on a turnover 14.6 per cent ahead at Pounds 347.7m.
Earnings jumped to 13p (6.7p) and a maintained final dividend of 5.5p makes
an 8p (same) total.
Travis Perkins, which operates mainly in southern England and the south
Midlands, currently owns 166 branches. It will be acquiring a further 46
outlets, many of which are in northern England and also in Scotland.
Wolseley, the world's biggest supplier of heating and plumbing equipment,
operates from more than 600 branches. Rival bidders for the AAH business are
thought to have included Wolseley, Meyer, CRH and Erith.
Mr Travis said the merchants had benefited from cost cutting in previous
years as volume sales increased by about 11 per cent last year, of which
only 3-4 per cent was due to previous acquisitions. Prices had also risen by
about 3-4 per cent.
This had enabled the merchants to increase net margins from 3.2 per cent to
5.7 per cent. Travis Perkins sells a broader mix of products than AAH, which
concentrates on lower margin heavyside goods such as bricks and blocks.
The builders' merchants business of AAH by comparison generated net margins
of about 3 per cent on sales of Pounds 78.3m and pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.1m in the year March 31 1993. Profits are thought to have increased to
about Pounds 2.4m in the current year on similar sales.
The purchase price could be adjusted by up to Pounds 5m depending on an
audited value of net assets.
AAH, which is also negotiating the sale of its Yorkshire Brick subsidiary,
said the purchase price represented an exit p/e of 29.4 on 1993 profits. It
said the sale would increase AAH earnings for the year to March 31 1994
above market expectations.
Following the purchase Travis will be left with borrowings of about Pounds
25m compared with cash of Pounds 11.7m at the end of last year.
COMMENT
The purchase price is not cheap even on an exit p/e of 24 on 1993-94
profits. Nonetheless, there is plenty of potential for margin recovery and
cost savings and the management should be supported. The acquisition not
only gives critical mass in terms of purchasing power but also improves the
regional spread of the business - only five outlets out of 200 are likely to
close because of overlap. Profits could reach Pounds 27m-Pounds 28m this
year rising to Pounds 36m-Pounds 38m in 1995. Worth having in your portfolio
in a sector which looks becoming increasingly aggressive.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Eyes focus on the construction industry -
Survey points to an increase in takeover and merger activity over the next
12 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a fifth of contractors and building material companies expect to
be involved in acquisitions, mergers or joint ventures during the next 12
months, according to an industry survey published today in New Builder
magazine.
The survey asked managing directors and chief executives of 180 companies
about their intentions on staffing, merger activity and financing over the
next year. It included most of the 20 largest contractors and building
material suppliers in the UK. Twenty nine per cent of contractors, 20 per
cent of building material companies and 27 per cent of housebuilders
expected to be involved in mergers, joint ventures or acquisitions.
Takeover activity is expected to rise sharply as the industry moves out of
recession and companies move to widen skills, increase their market share
and reduce capacity in the sector by purchasing financially weaker rivals.
Travis Perkins, the builders' merchant, yesterday announced the purchase for
Pounds 41.8m of the building merchants' interests of AAH - increasing by
more than a quarter the number of outlets it operates from.
Taylor Woodrow, the large construction and property group, last month paid
Pounds 30.8m to buy Heron's housebuilding operations. Chief executives of
Wimpey, the contractor and housebuilder, Rugby, the cement group, and
Marley, the building materials company, announcing annual results this week,
signalled that they are also prepared to make acquisitions - taking
advantage of improved balance sheets and better trading conditions in the UK
and US.
Housebuilders such as Beazer, Persimmon, Redrow and Wainhomes - currently
involved in share issues likely to total more than Pounds 700m - have also
not ruled out acquisitions as a means of increasing their land holdings.
Rationalisation of the brick industry is long overdue with companies like
Ibstock Johnsen, which has struggled during the recession, a potential
candidate for takeover or merger.
Builders' merchants are expected to be particularly aggressive following the
Pounds 210m float announced recently by Graham Group, currently part of BTR,
the industrial conglomerate.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall advances 65%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A substantial increase in the profits of the fund management division were
behind the 65 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax at Jupiter Tyndall Group.
Mr John Duffield, chairman, said that there had been a good start to the
present year, with a further substantial rise in the fund management
activities.
The shares rose by 18p to 279p.
On turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 14.5m), profits were
Pounds 9.41m (Pounds 5.71m). Earnings per share were 22.1p (13.6p) and an
increased final dividend of 7p is proposed for a total of 11p (7.5p). An
enhanced scrip issue alternative is also planned at a level 50 per cent
higher than the cash payment.
Fund management profits advanced 68 per cent to Pounds 6.69m with rises from
pension funds, investment trusts, offshore funds and the company's Hong Kong
office. The banking side fell slightly to Pounds 3.18m.
As a result of the growth in fund management the split between Jupiter's two
activities had changed from 53 per cent for fund management to 47 per cent
for banking in 1992 to 68/32 over 1993.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cala at Pounds 337,000 and calls for Pounds
7.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cala, the Edinburgh-based housebuilder and property developer, is raising
Pounds 7.9m through a 1-for-5 rights issue of up to 7.16m new ordinary
shares at 116p.
At the same time, the company announced a continuation in the recovery seen
in the second half last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 337,000 for the
six months to December 31 against losses of Pounds 2.85m.
Mr Geoffrey Ball, the chairman, said the return to profitability had been
helped by lower interest rates and improved trading conditions in the UK
housing market. It had also been helped by action taken, including running
down the joint venture housebuilding business in southern England, closing
the commercial property division in England, reducing the housebuilding
divisions from seven to two, reducing overheads and improving site
operations.
Turnover for the six months rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 27.1m (Pounds
20.6m) generating operating profits of Pounds 755,000 (Pounds 1.38m losses).
Interest charges took Pounds 402,000 (Pounds 1.24m).
Earnings per share emerged at 0.63p (5.39p losses) and the interim dividend
is stepped up to 0.9p (0.75p). The directors are hoping to recommend a final
of not less than 1.8p.
Mr Ball said that since the beginning of 1994 Cala's trading experience in
Scotland had been consistently good while that in England remained patchy.
The proceeds of the rights issue will be used to increase Cala Homes
(Scotland)'s growth and enable Cala (South) to build up its land bank over
the next two years. It is fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson Securities.
The shares fell 5p to 137p.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gas move benefits British Borneo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greater exposure to the gas market helped British-Borneo, the exploration
company, to offset the effects of a declining oil price and report a 14 per
cent increase in net profits to Pounds 8.7m for the year to December 31.
Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo had had 'a hell of a
year. I think we have now come of age.' The company increased its oil and
gas revenues by 56 per cent to Pounds 28m.
Mr Gaynor said British-Borneo had maintained its exploration success rate of
40 per cent for the third consecutive year. It intended in the current year
to step up investment in exploration, particularly in the US, from about
Dollars 18m a year to up to Dollars 30m.
The changes to the petroleum revenue tax introduced in the last budget had
made the North Sea a less attractive option. Exploration costs were some
four times higher as a result, Mr Gaynor said.
British-Borneo had doubled investment in the US to about Dollars 9m in the
year just ended, helping it to benefit from the 15 per cent increase in the
average US gas price during the year. Part of the revenue improvement was
due to becoming an operator, as opposed to being a hands-off investor, for
the first time, Mr Gaynor said.
British-Borneo was beginning to see opportunites to build up its oil assets
in light of the weak price. Any acquisitions and investments would be funded
through cash flow, Mr Gaynor said.
Income from the group's portfolio of oil and gas investments fell from
Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 5.4m. However, the group realised some Pounds 4.3m
from the portfolio which ended the year with a market value of Pounds 19.3m.
The dividend was maintained at 4.433p, for a steady total of 7.1p. Earnings
rose from 16.93p to 19.33p.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Arjo optimistic despite 24% decline to
Pounds 122m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The paper industry has begun to recover after five years of decline,
according to Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper manufacturer. In
an optimistic statement yesterday, it said that paper prices had begun to
rise in the last quarter of 1993 and remained firm this year.
However, the benefits of this recovery in prices and volume came too late to
prevent a 24 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 122.1m (Pounds
161.1m) in 1993.
Volume rose by 3 per cent and turnover by 4 per cent to Pounds 2.73bn.
However, at constant 1993 average exchange rates, turnover fell 4 per cent
implying an average fall in prices of 7 per cent.
The pre-tax figure was hurt by exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds
13.7m for the closure of a German pulp mill and a 25 per cent reduction in
staff at a Spanish mill.
It was also hit by provisions for unrealised losses on foreign currency
loans to its Portuguese associate Soporcel. This figure was Pounds 14.1m
(Pounds 3m).
The effect of these was that operating profit, before exceptionals, was down
just 5 per cent to Pounds 184.4m (Pounds 193m).
Earnings per share fell by 35 per cent to 7.5p (11.6p). The proposed final
dividend is held at 3.85p making an unchanged 6.5p for the year.
The dividend cover of 1.3 was a low in the current cycle, said Mr Alain
Soulas, chief executive. He repeated the company's aim of maintaining long
term cover in the 2 to 2.5 range.
Net borrowings rose slightly to Pounds 303.2m (Pounds 284.9m) with gearing
at 25.7 per cent (23.6 per cent). Mr Soulas said that the strength of the
balance sheet meant 'we can grow by acquisition, especially in paper
merchanting.'
COMMENT
At first sight, Mr Soulas' optimism looks overdone. A few months of recovery
seem scant compensation for years of falling sales and profits and a frozen
dividend. But a business like Arjo's has huge operational gearing: when
sales and prices recover, a lot of the gain falls straight through to the
bottom line. The real question is whether the sales growth since the autumn
has been much more than merchants restocking. Four years of falling prices
meant that stocks were as low as possible on the grounds that they would be
even cheaper the following month. But there are some good signs: real price
rises and six months of better sales sounds like genuine demand. Even if
there is a hiccup over the slow summer months, 1994's pre-tax profits should
easily exceed 1992's and possibly stretch towards the Pounds 170m mark. That
would be a long way short of the Pounds 260m achieved as recently as 1991
and would still leave the stock on a chunky prospective p/e in the upper
20s. But if recovery continues, that operational gearing should come to the
rescue and push the p/e below the market average by 1996.

FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: JM and Cookson in ceramic link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, and Cookson, the specialist
industrial materials group, are planning to link their ceramic interests in
a joint venture that would be number two in the world market.
The colour and print division of Johnson Matthey, which makes colours,
stains and liquid precious metal preparations for the tableware, sanitary
ware and glass industries, would be joined with Cookson's ceramic supplies
and minerals division. This side makes colours and glazes for the tableware,
sanitary ware and tile industries.
Both companies cater for different aspects of the world market, which Mr
Chris Clark, managing director of Johnson Matthey, estimated as worth Pounds
1bn a year. The market leader is Ferro of the US, with more than 20 per
cent.
Johnson Matthey's division made operating profits of Pounds 11.3m on sales
of Pounds 103.3m in the year to the end of March 1993, when its net assets
were Pounds 69.9m. Cookson's division made operating profits of Pounds 11.8m
on sales of Pounds 135.6m in the year to end December, when net assets were
Pounds 90m.
The joint venture, to be known as Cookson Matthey Ceramics, would be owned
half and half and have up to 20 per cent of the world market. Both companies
are transferring assets of equal value to the venture, so there would be no
compensating payments.
Mr Richard Oster, who has spent the past few years refocusing Cookson on its
core businesses, including ceramics, described the proposed deal as 'sort of
a dream come true'.
Mr Oster will be chairman of Cookson Matthey Ceramics, and Mr Clark chief
executive.
