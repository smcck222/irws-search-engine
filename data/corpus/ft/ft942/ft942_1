FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ford's German arm sees return to

<TEXT>
Ford-Werke, the German subsidiary of the US motor group, said it would move
out of the red and make at least DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) profit this year,
but warned that the German car market was making only a tentative recovery.
Mr Albert Caspers, chief executive, said new registrations in Germany were
likely to increase by just 2 per cent compared with very bad figures the
year before.
His comments about the German market reflect those made by Adam Opel, the
General Motors subsidiary, which reported a loss of DM503m earlier this week
and said only that it hoped for a 'dramatic improvement' this year.
Ford-Werke is the largest subsidiary of the US group and includes the
Belgian works at Genk.
It exports to 60 countries and lost DM132m last year compared with a loss of
DM469m in 1992, but said it made 'an impressive three figure million profit'
in the first six months of this year.
Mr Caspers blamed the 1993 losses on lower sales and foreign exchange
losses. Turnover in 1993 fell 3.7 per cent to DM21.2bn and was set to
increase 10 per cent in the coming year.
Impressive sales of the Mondeo had helped and exports to France, the UK and
Spain had increased by around 10 per cent.
Ford increased its share of the European car market in 1993 to 11.5 per
cent, from 11.2 per cent, and had maintained a German market share of 9.3
per cent.
The company last year set aside DM300m to fund restructuring and said it was
unlikely to use all of the sum even after laying off several hundred more of
its 43,800 workers this year.
However, the Cologne-based group warned that the good first-half results
could not be repeated in the second half, and there was little prospect that
the two German factories in Cologne and Saarlouis could increase their
capacity above the 80 per cent being worked at the moment.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Kessler rules out US cigarette sales ban: FDA says agency is
not intent on prohibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Dr David Kessler, the US food and drug commissioner, does not wish to ban
cigarette sales even if his agency is empowered to regulate nicotine as a
drug, the New York Times reported yesterday.
A congressional sub-committee has been attempting to determine whether the
tobacco industry should be more closely regulated and the FDA - at the
request of anti-smoking groups - has been compiling evidence on the
addictive qualities of nicotine and whether tobacco companies manipulated
nicotine levels in order to hook smokers.
The tobacco industry fears that, if the FDA is given jurisdiction to
regulate tobacco based on the addictive nature of nicotine, the agency would
move to prohibit cigarette sales, driving US tobacco companies out of
business.
But sub-committee members and, now, Dr Kessler, have said it is not their
intention to prohibit cigarette sales, an action which conjures up images of
alcohol prohibition in the US.
Responding to a suggestion that the FDA is acting as though prohibition were
its only alternative to force Congress to find a compromise that severely
limits, but does not ban, cigarette sales, Dr Kessler said: 'We haven't
approached it that way.' He added: 'We must investigate seriously the
question of whether nicotine is a drug under the law. If we did come to that
conclusion. . . the blunt instruments we have at the FDA to deal with the
issue. . . are not necessarily the best to find a reasonable final policy.'
He said he would like to see regulation focused on preventing people -
particularly teenagers - from taking up smoking. The FDA, Congress and the
tobacco industry said they could find common ground on this.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Row over state role in Israel Chemicals

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel Chemicals, the country's biggest chemical and fertiliser group and
one of the nation's leading exporters, is at the centre of a row between
ministers and government officials over the next phase of its privatisation.
Mr Micha Harish, the minister of industry and trade, has publicly criticised
the Government Companies Authority, charged with selling state-owned
companies, and called for the resignation of Mr Yossi Nitzani, its director.
Mr Harish's wants to make the company, of which the government holds 75 per
cent, to move its headquarters from Tel Aviv to Beersheva, in the Negev
desert. He said it was vital that large state-owned companies such as IC
move there to encourage foreign investment in the development of the Negev.
However, when Mr Nitzani last week met New York-based investment banks to
discuss the next phase of IC'sprivatisation the bankers were reported to
have voiced concern about government interference in the management of the
company.
They also expressed reluctance to become involved in selling shares in the
US so long as the government continued to hold a majority stake. Investment
analysts said the government had to make a clear statement of its timetable
for selling shares in the company.
The government has decided to reduce its stake in IC to 28 per cent by the
end of this year and plans to sell 15 per cent of the company to a private
investor and 32 per cent by international public offering.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Keating renews effort to strengthen economic ties with
Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday ended a three-day
business promotion visit to Jakarta, reflecting his renewed effort to place
Australian-Indonesian ties on a sound economic footing after a history of
political differences.
Relations between the two countries have had a bumpy ride over the last few
years following Australia's criticism of Indonesia's record on human rights.
Mr Keating's efforts to divert the focus to economic issues has become more
urgent in the run-up to the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit
in November, which will be chaired by Indonesia.
Two-way trade between Australia and Indonesia rose to Dollars 3bn last year,
nearly twice its level of five years ago, and Indonesia is Australia's
11th-largest trading partner. While Mr Keating is keen to promote close
business ties, Indonesia showed more interest in accelerating the pace at
which its trade deficit with Australia is shrinking - to Dollars 566m last
year from Dollars 833m in 1990.
Mr Keating's visit coincides with Australia's biggest trade exhibition ever
 -Australia Today Indonesia 1994 - which is being held in Jakarta.
Although Mr Keating would have preferred to adhere to economic matters,
pressure in Australia forced him to raise the question of Indonesia's recent
press bans. Last week the Indonesian government banned two leading magazines
and a tabloid - Editor, Tempo and DeTik - in its most severe clampdown on
political debate in years. The ban came after the government had pledged to
foster more political openness.
Mr Keating said he expressed his regret at the press ban, which he said
'appears to conflict or at least contrast with the openness generally
occurring in the Indonesian economy', but did not give the impression the
press ban was discussed in any detail.
This was Mr Keating's third visit to Indonesia in three years. On each
occasion he has vowed to move away from discussing their relations in
political terms. 'No country is more important to Australia than Indonesia,'
he said during a visit in March this year. 'For too long we were inclined to
see both Indonesia itself and our relationship with Indonesia, in almost
exclusively political terms.'
In Australia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade published a report
on the Australian-Indonesian trade relationship yesterday, to coincide with
the Jakarta trade fair and business conference. The report, including a
series of articles by both Australian and Indonesian officials and academics
came to no firm conclusions about the relationship's likely development, but
some authors stressed that the countries' geographical proximity would be no
guarantee of enhanced economic ties.
The report quoted Mr Richard Woolcott, head of the Australia-Indonesia
Institute, as saying that 'opportunities will not fall into our lap because
we are neighbours', and pointed out that while Indonesia is a very large
potential market for Australia, the reverse does not hold true. 'Australia
is geographically isolated, and must overcome any tendency to insularity to
which this might give rise by linking in with rapidly developing regional
transport and telecommunications networks,' it suggested.
The report noted that in key areas, such as textiles, the trade relationship
is still hampered by past protectionist policies. While Indonesia has
developed its textile export industry, and is acquiring an increasing amount
of cotton from Australia, one author said there could be 'more mutually
beneficial two-way trade as both countries move to greater liberalisation'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan has remained relatively immune to the choppy performances that have
characterised emerging markets so far this year. Since the budget
announcement earlier this month the KSE 100 index has gained some 5 per
cent, a fact which has surprised some analysts. BMA Capital Management,
based in Karachi, says the market's strength has come in spite of a negative
reaction to the budget proposals from the business community.
The government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is attempting to control
inflation, aiming for a target in 1994-95 of 7 per cent, against the current
level of around 15 per cent, and reduce the budget deficit through a package
of measures which includes a general sales tax on consumer durables.
BMA says that since business conditions and corporate earnings forecasts are
improving, the equity market should continue to advance: 'An optimistic view
of corporate profitability should envelop investor consciousness between the
fourth quarter of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995, as signs of an
economic recovery become more evident through the haze.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Shooting for new heights: Pain-killers are improving but the
search is slow, says Clive Cookson in a series on drug discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No other pharm-aceutical sector is so dependent on two such ancient families
of drugs as the Dollars 5bn-a-year (Pounds 3.2bn) pain-killer market. For
severe pain doctors can do no better than stupefy patients with chemicals
derived from the opium poppy, notably morphine and diamorphine (the
pharmaceutical name for heroin).
For mild pain the standard is still aspirin, based on a simple compound
found in willow bark and developed industrially in 19th-century Germany. It
is the model for a large family known as Nsaids (non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs) which combine analgesia - the medical term for pain
relief - with a tendency to reduce inflammation.
The only radically new drug in the sector is sumatriptan (trade name
Imigran) launched by Glaxo of the UK in 1991 to relieve migraine headaches.
It works by reducing the swelling of blood vessels in the head, which is a
primary cause of migraine.
Sumatriptan is on its way to becoming a blockbuster, with analysts
predicting sales of more than Dollars 1bn a year in the late 1990s, because
migraines are quite common, affecting 10 per cent of young adults, and the
drug commands a high patent-protected price (Pounds 7 per tablet or Pounds
17 per injection in the UK).
But sumatriptan is designed only to treat one specific cause of pain. There
is no immediate prospect of such innovative drugs being introduced for other
important causes of pain or for general analgesia.
Looking further ahead, scientists are much more optimistic, as they make
progress in understanding exactly how people feel pain. Once the biological
mechanisms are understood, pharmaceutical researchers can design drugs to
block pain.
'This is an extremely lively time in pain research,' says Clifford Woolf,
professor of neurobiology at University College London. 'The research could
lead to major new pain therapies, after a long period in the doldrums when
we essentially relied on aspirin-type drugs, morphine and local
anaesthetics.'
Pain evolved as the brain's warning signal to the body. It may be a warning
to get out of harm's way or to protect a limb or organ that is suffering
from injury, disease or over-exertion. There are pain receptors throughout
the body, which fire signals via the nervous system to the brain where they
are translated to feelings of pain at the appropriate site.
In principle, therefore, pain-killers can either act peripherally at the
site of the painful stimulus or centrally on the brain and central nervous
system. In practice, researchers are only just beginning to disentangle the
central and peripheral effects. The conventional idea that morphine and
opiates act centrally, while aspirin and Nsaids act peripherally, turns out
to be an oversimplification.
'One of the most important developments recently is the realisation that all
clinical pain has a large central component - and that is changing the whole
pharmacological approach to the management of pain,' Woolf says.
The phenomenon, discovered at UCL and other universities, is called 'central
sensitisation'. Nerve cells in the spinal cord become unusually sensitive in
response to painful tissue damage; they then react in an exaggerated way to
ordinary sensations of touch and pressure, which may produce further pain
over a long period. In other words, far from getting used to pain, our
nervous system becomes more sensitive to it.
This discovery has implications for the use of existing pain-killers. In
particular, it suggests that 'pre-emptive analgesia' is sensible if the
doctor knows in advance that the patient is about to undergo a painful
experience such as surgery. Clinical evidence supports this strategy:
patients given morphine before an operation suffered less post-operative
pain than those receiving the same dose immediately afterwards, even though
both groups were anaesthetised during the operation itself. Apparently
pre-operative morphine reduced the sensitisation.
Two neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) systems seem to be involved in the
sensitisation effect. Both are potential targets for new drugs.
In one system, glutamate transmitters act on the NMDA receptor. Chemicals
that block the NMDA receptor would be powerful pain-killers but would
probably have side-effects, since NMDA performs many other roles in the
brain.
The other system, in which a transmitter called Substance P acts on the
tachykinin receptor, is a more active field for pharmaceutical research.
Glaxo, Pfizer, Merck, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and other companies are working on
it. If they succeed in developing drugs to prevent sensitisation, patients
will retain normal feelings while avoiding severe pain.
At the same time, pharmaceutical researchers are working to improve the
performance of Nsaids. As Sir John Vane, the British pharmacologist, showed
in 1971, aspirin-like drugs work by inhibiting the production of
prostaglandins, hormones which make nerve endings sensitive to painful
sensations.
Recent experiments have shown that an enzyme called cyclo-oxygenase plays a
leading role in this interaction. It comes in two forms, Cox-1 and Cox-2,
which have different effects on prostaglandin synthesis. Existing Nsaids act
on both forms. But their action on Cox-1 produces the side-effects for which
Nsaids are known, such as bleeding and stomach ulcers, while action on Cox-2
causes the desired analgesia and anti-inflammatory effects.
Many drug companies are now using this information in the search for more
selective Nsaids that act only on Cox-2. Success would be an important
advance because, although the risk of serious side-effects for any
individual patient is low (one in 10,000 prescriptions), millions of Nsaids
are prescribed every year and the total number of complications is high.
Michael Langman and colleagues at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham,
estimate that in the UK alone 2,000 people are admitted to hospital every
year as a direct result of Nsaid side-effects.
While the research goes on behind the scenes, the most visible activity in
the pain-killer market is the growing range of drugs available without a
prescription. In the UK, for example, Napp Laboratories recently launched
Paramol, an over-the-counter analgesic containing dihydrocodeine, a mild
opiate previously available only on prescription. It was the first
pain-killing ingredient approved for OTC sale in the UK since ibuprofen in
the 1980s.
An event of greater significance for the world pharmaceutical industry was
this month's launch in the US of Aleve, a new OTC pain-killer, by Procter &amp;
Gamble, the consumer goods giant, in a joint venture with Syntex, the
leading analgesics manufacturer. (Syntex was taken over last month by Roche
of Switzerland for Dollars 5.3bn.)
Aleve is based on naproxen, Syntex's best-selling Nsaid, whose patent
expired in December. According to Linc Bynum, who is responsible for the
company's clinical research on pain-killers, Syntex carried out four years
of trials, involving several thousand patients, to pave the way for Aleve.
Its analgesic effects were compared extensively with ibuprofen and
paracetamol (known as acetominophen in the US) in people whose wisdom teeth
had just been extracted.
All the data had failed to persuade the US Food and Drug Administration
advisory committees last year that Aleve should be given an OTC licence, but
in January the full FDA approved the product after Syntex agreed to reduce
recommended doses and add warnings on the label for children and the
elderly.
One feature of Aleve that worried the FDA committees was the fact that it
remains active in the body for longer than existing OTC pain-killers. They
believed this could lead people to take excessive doses by accident. But
Aleve's long life - pain relief lasting eight to 12 hours - will give it a
marketing advantage over rivals that need to be taken more frequently.
The series continues next month with a look at treatments for stroke.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: German tool orders up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German machine tool orders climbed by 14 per cent in the first quarter of
1994 and continued to experience double-digit growth in April, the VDW
industry association said yesterday. Domestic orders rose 14 per cent and
foreign ones 15 per cent. Without announcing an overall increase for April,
the VDW noted that domestic orders exceeded levels of a year ago by 20 per
cent. Foreign demand in the first quarter was particularly strong from the
US, the former Soviet Union, China, Switzerland, Italy and France. The
industry, which is slowly emerging from its worst post-war recession, saw
its order backlog at the end of the quarter rise to 4.9 months from an
average of 4.7 months for all of 1993. Capacity utilisation climbed to 76
per cent in March from a 1993 average of 71 per cent. AP-DJ, Frankfurt.
The Bundesbank said it allocated 14-day securities repurchase funds at this
week's tender at a lowest rate of 4.96 per cent. This compares with last
week's lowest accepted rate of 5 per cent. It accepted bids for DM63.2bn,
mostly at a rate of 4.97 per cent.
The Belgian national bank yesterday cut its key central rate for money
market lending by 0.05 of a percentage point to 4.95 per cent and lowered
its regular overnight interest rate by 0.05 of a point to 6.45 per cent. It
held its discount rate unchanged at 4.5 per cent and its emergency rate for
overnight lending at 9 per cent.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Women mean business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese companies may have cashed in on the success of the all-male
J-League, but women's soccer in Japan has also benefited from corporate
involvement.
Although still relatively unknown, the women's league, established in 1989,
has pulled itself out of obscurity due to participation of company teams two
years ago. The dwindling league has increased its member teams from six to
10, and advertising by companies has helped double the number of women
involved.
However, recent sponsorship has been hit by the recession, and many
companies have been forced to scale down their involvement in sport. Kumagai
Gumi, a construction company, recently dissolved its baseball and basketball
teams, while NKK, a leading steel maker, abolished its volleyball and soccer
teams.
Although times have also been tough for the securities industry, Nikko
Securities, which owns the Nikko Dream Ladies soccer team, says it remains
committed to the sport. Nikko was the first corporate-sponsored team to join
the league, and the company has even brought players from Norway and the US
to play in the team full time.
'When we first started I was more concerned about the cost and financial
returns,' says Hitomu Hara, a general manager of Nikko Securities in charge
of the team. 'But then I realised that there was more to having a team than
financial benefit.' He says that Nikko now wants to raise public awareness
of the sport.
But unlike the J-League, women's soccer may take longer to become popular.
Non-Japanese players point out that cultural differences still present
barriers in the game. Gunn Nyborg, a former member of the Norwegian national
team and now a midfield player for Nikko, says Japanese women players are
less driven by the desire to prevail as individuals and try to win through
collective efforts as a team.
She also points out that the rise in women's soccer in the west has been
closely linked to the women's movement. In a country where equality between
men and women has hardly managed to take root, it may take time for the
sport to gain wide acceptance.
But unlike in Norway, where the teams are club-oriented and players have a
harder time supporting themselves financially, the Japanese corporate system
offers security. As long as Japan organises its league system and invests in
coaches from Europe, in 10 years' time Japanese female soccer will join
international ranks.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (6): US farmers win
pledge on subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US farm subsidies and programmes will not be cut to make up for the
shortfall in government revenue caused by the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, according to Mr Leon Panetta, outgoing
director of the budget office.
Mr Panetta made the pledge while speaking before a House agriculture
committee. The administration has yet to account for approximately 25 per
cent, or Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn), of the tariff revenue which the US will
lose under the Uruguay Round.
Mr Panetta's assurances to the House committee were intended to quell
rumours, circulated by Gatt opponents earlier in the week, that the
administration was planning to slash agricultural aid in order to cover the
lost revenue.
Some members of Congress had threatened to oppose Gatt implementation
legislation if the administration cut farm programmes.
Mr Michael Espy, US agriculture secretary, yesterday said Mr Panetta's
announcement demonstrated the administration's deep commitment to domestic
farmers.
Despite reports that an announcement of the administration's solution to the
Dollars 3bn loss was imminent, no statement has been released so far this
week.
Federal lawmakers, who have yet to pass legislation to implement the Uruguay
Round, have raised a number of other concerns about ratifying the Gatt deal.
These range from its perceived conflict with US laws and infringement on US
sovereignty to fears about the loss of domestic jobs.
Special interest groups opposing US implementation of the Uruguay Round and
participation in the proposed World Trade Organisation - the successor to
Gatt - have stepped up their attacks recently, staging a 'national call-in'
to the Capitol Hill switchboards to voice their opposition.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (13): New confidence in sports car
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are congestion, environmental legislation and associated factors finally
killing off the sports car and romantic notions of the open road?
The new product programmes of some of the world's biggest car makers, and
the resurgent fortunes of some of the smallest, suggest the very opposite.
Porsche, the German luxury sports car maker, itself is now in the middle of
a drastic overhaul, with new management, new methods and an impending new
product range which, it claims, will return it to comfortable profits and
30,000-a-year output within the next four or five years.
If its predictions are borne out, they would reinforce the assertions of
industry analysts that the sales slump was a manufacturer, not a market,
problem, and that despite road congestion and other adverse environmental
and legislative pressures, there will remain enough sports car enthusiasts -
or at least people prepared to pay for 'something different' - to justify
manufacturers of all sizes investing in products for them.
Unlike mainstream sectors such as saloon cars, the 'sports car' market is so
multi-faceted as to defy easy categorisation.
It embraces individual company production levels from a few dozen a year to
approaching 50,000, and prices from under Pounds 10,000 for near-kit cars to
the Pounds 400,000-plus 'supercars' of McLaren and Jaguarsport.
At one end of the spectrum, UK-based Morgan is earning a modest but steady
living from producing around 500 versions a year of a two-seater with its
origins in the 1930s. At the other lies Japan's Mazda, which has almost
single-handedly filled the vacuum left by MG with its 'cheap' - Pounds
16,000 in the UK - MX-5 roadster.
In the US, where MGs were once by far the biggest selling sports car, the
MX-5 has achieved peak sales of 36,000 units in a single year. As with
Porsche, its fall to around 22,000 in the US last year is believed to
reflect more the ageing of the model itself in what is inevitably a
fashion-conscious sector of the market than any weakening of the sports car
market itself.
It is this consumer capriciousness, coupled to the oil crisis and recession
of the early 1980s, which for a long time frightened most Western volume
producers out of the sports car market.
Equally, more manufacturers are taking heart from the belief that there is a
worthwhile market and from advances in simultaneous engineering and other
technologies that favour smaller production runs.
For example, there were the decisions of resurgent Chrysler to put into
production its outrageous, eight-litre, V10-engined Viper open two-seater
sports car and, in the past few weeks, to add a coupe version of the same
model. More than 1,000 Vipers have already been sold, despite a Pounds
55,000 price tag.
The same confidence inspired Ford to invest in a new Mustang which harks
back to the sports car concept of the original 1960s models. Meanwhile,
General Motors' sports car, the Corvette, regularly finds a 20,000-plus
market in the US. A two-seater sports car is to enter production next year
at BMW's 80,000 cars a year plant in Greenville, South Carolina.
Problems of definition blur the size of the sports car market in Europe,
because many manufacturers consider coupes like the Opel/Vauxhall Calibra
and the new Ford Probe as legitimate successors to some of the traditional
open two-seater market.
When these are included, industry monitoring group Automotive Industry Data
suggests, there is an available west European market of between 250,000 and
300,000 units. Certainly it is big enough to tempt back some large
manufacturers who had previously all but abandoned this market. Fiat, which
owns Ferrari, Lancia and Alfa Romeo, is launching a two-pronged attack with
an all-new Fiat coupe and an equally new open two-seater Alfa, the Spyder.
Thanks to new engineering and production technology, financially
hard-pressed Fiat has gone ahead with projected volumes of around 20,000 a
year. Indeed the Fiat coupe, which uses Tipo hatchback floorpan and
mechanicals, is a pet project of Fiat Auto managing director Mr Paolo
Cantarella. It may not make much money in itself, but he expects the glamour
of the sleek two-seater, now on sale to benefit the group's more mundane but
bigger volume models struggling for a bigger share of Europe's mainstream
market.
Similar calculations are evident in other parts of the industry. All last
year General Motors was touting around Europe's motor shows the Tigra, a
small two-seater based heavily on GM's small European hatchback, the
Spanish-built Opel Corsa. If the public liked it, GM promised, the company
would build it. It has now given it the green light.
Perhaps the most eagerly-awaited new sports car of all will emerge in the UK
next year - the first genuinely 'new' MG since the demise of the MGB more
than a decade ago. Rover group, now part of BMW, is taking an unusual route
to market with the range of small MG sports cars it intends to launch in
Europe and Japan in 1995, some 15 years after killing of the 'B' of which
more than 500,000 were produced.
The car's body is being designed, developed and manufactured by Motor
Panels, the Coventry-based subsidiary of the Mayflower engineering group.
Mayflower is investing up to Pounds 24.2m for the initial engineering
design, development and tooling work, including the production facilities
for the body shells.
The two companies expect to share the profits from the project, code-named
PR3. The car will use a 1.6 litre version of Rover's avant garde K-series
engine, cost around Pounds 15,000 and is envisaged to be produced at a rate
of 15,000 to 20,000 a year.
Rover has already paved the way for the MG marque's revival with the launch
last year of the RV8, an updated, limited production version of the MGB
using Rover's V8 engine from the Range Rover.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (12): The debate hots up as sales
rise - Motoring's growth stock in Britain in 1993 was unquestionably the
diesel car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Initial industry forecasts of 200,000 sales for diesel cars in the UK last
year were rapidly overtaken by events. In the end, 340,500 diesel cars were
registered for a market penetration of 19.1 per cent.
But can the bull run in diesel cars continue?
The answer is almost certainly 'yes' though the signs are confusing. In the
first three months of this year diesels took 21 per cent of registrations.
Yet in March one of the leading contract hire companies, Leasecontracts,
made some feverish public statements that spoke of 'utter diesel madness'
and forecast crashing residuals that would lead to 'terrible financial
pain.'
So who is right?
The doomsters or the companies who continue to vote with their feet by
telling employees - from junior rep to managing director - that in future,
like it or not, they are going to have to drive diesel cars?
It is fair to point out that similar doom-laden forecasts were made a year
or two ago by people in the contract hire business whom one expected to know
what they were talking about. They turned out to be totally unfounded.
Expert forecasters were embarrassed.
Technology has transformed the performance and refinement of today's diesel
engined cars. Business motorists who reckon they are noisy, sluggish and
smelly are either parading their prejudices or have never driven one.
It is true that most diesel cars still sound a bit gruff when they are
started up from cold. Once they are driven off, though, even a trained ear
finds it difficult to tell the difference between the best of them and a
petrol-engined car.
The strongest cards in the diesel's suit have always been reliability (there
is no electric ignition to go wrong) and economy (up to 30 per cent lower
fuel consumption is achievable in real world driving conditions). They are
still winning cards - but are diesels as environmentally friendly as their
advocates claim?
The cold, hard facts say they are actually cleaner than petrol cars with the
most elaborate kind of exhaust catalyser.
But logic has to struggle with emotion: when clapped-out urban buses and
ill-maintained, often overloaded lorries are seen to be spewing out stinking
smoke, diesel cars become tarred with the same brush.
Flawed and superficial reports from bodies like Quarg (Quality of urban air
review group) muddy the waters further. Earlier this year, Quarg expressed
concern over the rapid growth in diesel car sales 'unless problems of
particulate matter and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are effectively
addressed.'
In fact, although diesel cars emit twice as much NOx as petrol cars when
new, they then improve while petrol cars get worse. Over their entire
working life, total NOx emissions are no different.
On short journeys after cold starts, diesel cars produce one-tenth of an
equivalent petrol engine's pollutants. And catalysers wear out or are
damaged in service to a much greater extent than most motorists - and
environmentalists - appreciate. Cowie Interleasing reported recently it had
had to replace 75 catalysers on the relatively small number of cars so
equipped in the large fleet it manages for corporate clients.
Managing director Neill Pykett says the replacement rate for catalysers  -
'one of the modern motor car's most delicate and expensive components' - was
'unacceptably high.'
Catalytic converters can shatter even in a low-impact collision and were
liable to be damaged by driving too fast over a traffic 'hump' or mounting a
kerb. But about 35 per cent fail 'for quite inexplicable reasons,' he says.
One car manufacturer had advised Cowie Interleasing to make maintenance
provision for one 'cat' replacement per vehicle per three-year contract. As
they cost between Pounds 300 and Pounds 900, this could hit private
motorists hard.
It could also make the gloomy forecasts of a meltdown in diesel residuals
look wide of the mark, if only because auction prices for three or four year
old ex-fleet cars from about 1996-97 must reflect the cost of possibly
imminent catalytic converter replacement.
As for the diesel cars themselves, they simply improve all the time. The
French PSA Group (Peugeot-Citroen) made the running for a number of years.
Though its products - Citroen AX, ZX, Xantia and XM and Peugeot 106, 306,
405 and 605 - are as good as ever, they no longer enjoy a monopoly of
excellence.
PSA's 12-valve, 2.1-litre engine used in the Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 is
about to be enlarged, which will give these large, comfortable and
economical executive-class cars a mid-range performance boost without
significantly increasing fuel consumption. The 2.1-litre unit would drop
nicely into a Citroen Xantia because it is based on the same block as the
1.9-litre XUD engine.
With automatic transmission, this could be the compact, elegant and
high-performing diesel many a business motorist - whose employer's budget
does not extend to a BMW or Mercedes - is waiting for. Mercedes-Benz offer
super-smooth, four valves per cylinder diesels with four, five or six
cylinders in the C-Class and E-Class.
In power output they are outranked by BMW's superlative, in-line 6-cylinder
diesels which come with turbo-charging and intercooling; the naturally
aspirated Mercedes engines are stayers rather than sprinters.
Vauxhall (Opel) buys smooth yet muscular four-cylinder turbo-diesels from
its Isuzu associate and the new Omega diesels have in-line six-cylinder
engines bought-in from BMW.
These Omega diesel saloons and estates, which can be had in the most
luxurious trim levels, with air conditioning and automatic transmission,
will be pace-setters among executive diesels at down-to-earth prices.
Before long, Rover, which currently buys four-cylinder engines from PSA for
its smaller diesel cars, will be offering a diesel version of the 600 with
the ultra-economical direct-injection engine, jointly developed with
Perkins.
Rover pioneered the direct-injection car diesel engine. Audi and Fiat have
them too, though the Fiat DI is not sold in Britain.
Other makers will be taking the direction-injection path to even better fuel
economy than is offered by the indirect-injection engine. Injection
equipment capable of delivering the very high pressures needed by the small,
high-speed DI engine has been developed by Lucas and other suppliers and is
now in volume production.
So far, the Japanese manufacturers have been less enthusiastic about selling
diesel cars on the UK market than their mainland European competitors.
An interesting development is Mazda's decision to introduce a diesel version
of the 626 to Britain with a belt-driven supercharger rather than the
otherwise universal exhaust-gas driven turbocharger.
The main benefit of belt-driven supercharging is that the extra power and
torque is on tap at very low engine speeds, whereas a turbocharger does not
have much effect on performance below about 2,000 rpm.
The technique is well known; Opel had a supercharged diesel version of the
Senator some years ago. It made the elderly and unrefined 2.3-litre engine
much better, but not good enough to match the more sophisticated engines
then available in Mercedes-Benz diesel cars.
Mazda claims the 626 supercharged diesel goes exactly like a petrol car
under all driving regimes. Competing manufacturers will be keeping a close
watch on developments.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (11): Ammunition for
scaremongers - Doomsday scenario watching has become a US preoccupation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inhabitants of the Kanawha valley in West Virginia were treated to a
doomsday scenario this month.
This valley, running east from Charleston into the foothills of the
Appalachians, houses chemicals plants run by no fewer than 12 different
companies. In an exercise that will eventually be repeated throughout the
US, the managers of those plants talked publicly about what could happen if
their safety procedures went badly wrong.
Until now, chemical companies have been understandably reluctant to discuss
potential disasters with their local communities. 'It is the moral
equivalent of Bhopal: they know what could happen, and they're not telling
us,' says Fred Millar, a long-time activist and former director of the
Friends of the Earth toxics project.
But the publication of 'worst-case scenarios' - projections of the damage
that would be caused by the worst possible accidents at chemical plants -
will be forced in the coming years. The US Environmental Protection Agency,
under the provisions of the Clean Air Act of 1990, is currently drafting
rules on what should be disclosed, and how. The Kanawha exercise marked an
early experiment by the chemicals industry: the companies involved wanted to
act first, using their own definitions of what amounts to a 'worst-case
scenario'.
When widely published around the country, the information will provide
plenty of ammunition for scare-mongers - including those legislators in
Washington DC who want tougher environmental controls on the chemicals
industry. For instance, chlorine used for water treatment in the nation's
capital could, based on a worst-case assessment, create a poisonous cloud
enveloping a large part of the city, including the President's home.
'Even the White House is not immune. The data is going to scare a lot of
people,' says Mr Joe Mayhew, vice president for the environment and policy
analysis at the Chemical Manufacturers' Association.
The attention likely to be given to this information, when published,
indicates how much further the chemicals industry still has to go to win
over public confidence in the US. A survey conducted for the CMA two years
ago revealed how low the public's esteem for the industry was, and - despite
an extensive public relations effort - things have barely changed.
The industry's approval rating 'probably hasn't improved a lot,' says Darwin
Wike, head of corporate environmental stewardship at Du Pont. Mr Mayhew at
the CMA agrees, though he puts it less pessimisticly: 'It's not getting any
worse.'
The Clean Air Act's requirement for companies to reveal the potential damage
their chemicals could cause signals the direction in which regulation of the
industry is moving. Until now, it has focused on emissions of waste by
chemicals companies, with the EPA producing lists of polluters and their
discharges. In future, attention is likely to be directed more towards the
actual (and potential) harm to public health and the environment, and
towards the use (rather than just the disposal) of chemicals.
The industry plans to stress the low probability of major accidents
occurring. However, the pressure of public opinion will almost certainly
have an effect, for instance by encouraging companies to review their
arrangements for storing their most hazardous materials.
Campaigners want companies to go further. They should, says Millar, publish
the results of safety audits and details of how much insurance they have (if
companies carry insurance to cover most of the costs of a disaster, he
argues, they have less incentive to prevent it happening).
There is also growing pressure for more information about how chemicals are
being used. At present, the state of New Jersey is alone in collecting
detailed information in this area. Federal regulation is skimpy: under the
Toxicity Control Act, big users of chemicals are subject to a report once
every two years on the volumes of chemicals they use. In future, that could
be extended, forcing more frequent reporting and more detailed information -
including, for instance, the extent to which the chemicals are recycled.
This data, ironically, could end up being of use mainly to chemical
companies. They are already the biggest users of the EPA's data on toxic
releases, says Mr Mayhew - such information provides important clues about
what competitors are doing. Detailed information about what materials the
chemicals companies are using would go further still.
While regulation looks set increasingly to add to the costs and reduce the
flexibility of the chemicals industry, it has at least one thing to cheer
about on the environmental front.
The proposed reform of the Superfund legislation, governing the clean-up of
hazardous waste, would reduce the legal wrangling over who should shoulder
the costs on particular sites. The result would be lower legal bills - one
of the biggest costs in the clean-up process.
Chemicals companies, meanwhile, are also finding more efficient ways to
spend the money they set aside for environmental purposes. The danger, says
Mr Wike at Du Pont, is that the easiest and most effective programmes are
the first to be adopted, and that smaller and smaller gains are made with
each additional step: 'You get 80 per cent of the reduction with the first
20 per cent of spending.'
One way of improving the impact of environmental spending has been to shift
attention from the treatment of waste, for instance with incinerators or
water treatment plants, to a search for ways to reduce waste in the first
place.
Companies have also become more efficient at setting targets for their
emissions. Du Pont, for instance, used to impose waste reductions targets on
its operating units: now, it is switching more of the initiative to plant
managers, asking them to come up with their own proposals first. Managers
closer to the operations should be better positioned to propose the
environmental programmes which have the biggest impact for the least cost at
their plants.
The industry is also hoping that the EPA will countenance more voluntary
waste reduction programmes, rather than enforced ones. Its so-called '33/50'
programme, which set stepped targets for reduction of certain emissions by
first a third and then a half, is a model which many in the industry would
like to see repeated.
Despite these initiatives, the rulebooks keep getting thicker. The EPA is
about to add more than 300 additional chemicals to the list of those whose
output has to be measured. Under the Clean Air Act, tighter permit
regulations will shortly make it difficult for virtually any changes to be
made to a chemicals plant without going through the entire approval process
again, the industry complains.
'We're slowly falling behind the rest of the world in terms of developing
new processes,' says Mr Wike.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (12): Salmon, not
sewage - Case study / The cleansing of Teesside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not so many years ago, talk of the lower reaches of the River Tees welcoming
migratory salmon would have seemed laughable.
Teesside's rapid industrial and urban expansion throughout the 19th century
and much of the 20th had foully polluted the river as it neared the North
Sea.
Industrial and sewage discharges combined to create a quality of water which
bred little except protest demonstrations by environmental activists.
Some of the environmental campaigners' wrath was directed at the National
Rivers Authority, the UK's river watchdog, for not imposing immediate
draconian cuts in ICI's effluent discharges from its Teesside plants, the
group's largest concentration of manufacturing assets in the world.
The NRA countered by arguing that it must give industry achievable targets,
imposing phased reductions on the levels of permitted discharges in order to
work progressively towards its goal of the passage of migratory fish along
the Tees.
In line with this philosophy, the Tees has been the focus of one of the UK's
biggest estuary clean-ups. ICI alone has spent Pounds 100m since 1990 on
environmental improvements on Teesside, mostly river related.
While its corporate aim, announced in 1990, for its sites worldwide is to
cut waste by 50 per cent by 1995, its Teesside operations are working to a
higher target of 68 per cent. Total waste produced from its manufacturing
activities on Teesside has fallen so far by 57 per cent, from 521,000 tonnes
in 1991 to 226,000 tonnes in 1993.
The major contributor to this reduction has been the end of the disposal of
acidic ammonium sulphate at sea by ICI's Acrylics business, following the
opening of the Pounds 66m sulphuric acid recovery plant at Billingham, part
of the Pounds 110m Monomer 8 complex.
Now, ICI and Northumbrian Water are working together on a Pounds 100m
effluent treatment works project which should further the NRA's aim of
restoring a thriving salmon fishery to the Tees.
Last month, Northumbrian Water submitted to Cleveland County Council a
planning application for the proposed treatment works, to be sited on a
disused ICI waste disposal site on the south bank of the Tees. The purpose
of the plant is to deal with sewage from 400,000 Teesside residents and
discharges from ICI's Wilton petrochemicals complex.
The eventual Pounds 100m cost of the two-phase project will be borne by
Northumbrian Water, with ICI paying fees for each tonne of waste treated.
Northumbrian Water has also held discussions with seven chemical companies
at Seal Sands, on the north bank of the river, about the possibility of
their using the plant too.
The Pounds 50m first stage of the project includes construction of a Pounds
35m underground transfer sewer along the Tees' south bank, so sewage is
taken from existing treatment plants for discharge downstream nearer the
river mouth. In its first phase, the treatment works will deal with ICI's
pure terephthalic acid (pta) discharges from Wilton.
The second phase will involve treatment of more ICI effluents, and also a
higher standard of treatment of the sewage before discharge to the river, to
meet the European Urban Waste Water Directive, at present due to come into
effect in 2001.
Currently ICI's Wilton site has a biochemical oxygen demand - a measure of
river oxygen depletion due to pollution - of 80 tonnes a day, but the NRA
has said this must be reduced to 50 tonnes by 1996. ICI expects the
treatment of pta discharge at the new plant to bring a net reduction of 19
tonnes. Treatment of more discharges by the plant's second phase should help
ICI meet its own target of a Wilton BOD of 25 tonnes a day by the year
2,000.
In the early 1970s, Wilton's BOD was 400 tonnes. 'We've got it down to a
fifth of what it was 20 years ago,' says ICI. 'Dealing with the remaining
fifth is more difficult and more expensive.'
ICI and Northumbrian Water, both involved in improvement work on the Tees
since the 1970s, believe it makes sense to pool their expertise and
resources in this way, in anticipation of future tighter standards.
They hope the effluent treatment works, which requires consent from the
boards of Northumbrian Water and ICI Chemicals and Polymers, will be
approved by Cleveland county council before the end of 1994, so its first
phase can be commissioned in mid-1996.
Northumbrian Water's general manager of projects Mr Doug Shearer says the
plant does not involve incineration or the import of waste, both of which
are highly contentious issues on Teesside.
The council, mindful of the delicacy of environmental issues in its heavily
industrialised area, has pledged full consultation. 'Obviously we haven't
been happy about discharges into the river and sea,' says Mr David Walsh,
chairman of the council's environment, development and transportation
committee. 'We want to study the implications of this approach.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (8): Green tide
reaches high water mark - Germany, with the world's toughest controls, may
be having second thoughts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last December, when the German chemicals industry was still wallowing close
to the bottom of the worst profits trough since the war, and still wincing
from a media onslaught which followed a rapid-fire series of accidents at
Hoechst, it was offered a few crumbs of comfort from an unlikely source.
The opposition Social Democrat Party (SPD), in concert with the IG Chemie
union, published a position paper on the industry's future. The main
recommendations seemed unremarkable: the simplification of environmental
legislation and acceleration of planning procedures to facilitate the
introduction of 'environmentally-acceptable products'.
But the paper, personally endorsed by Mr Rudolf Scharping, SPD leader,
marked an important development. The senior opposition party, whose attitude
towards the chemicals industry had long been fudged by a lingering
attachment to the more rigorous environmental policies of the Greens, had
shown that it had heard and deemed justified the industry's most serious
complaints about the direction of German environmental policy.
The costs of environmental protection are a sore point among chemicals
producers in most industrialised countries. But it is the range and
complexity of legislation which give the greatest cause for grief within the
German industry. Federal laws, arguably the strictest in the world, are
overlaid by separate legislation engendered in each of the country's 16
Lander.
The result is a scarcely-penetrable entanglement which generates work for
enthusiastic and meticulous bureaucrats and frustration for companies which
see their attempts to innovate and regain competitiveness repeatedly bogged
down.
A company seeking to build a new chemicals production plant in the federal
republic must observe more than 2,000 laws and regulations. According to
industry calculations, the average time taken in Germany to win official
approval - be it for planning permission, a new product, change-of-use in
existing plant - is 13 months compared with six months elsewhere in Europe.
Mr Horst Konig, head of research planning at BASF, says the time and costs
involved are becoming increasingly critical as competitors race to be the
first - or the cheapest - in the market with new products or techniques. R&amp;D
projects, even though carried out with no guarantee of success and
subsequent profits, were particularly vulnerable, he wrote in a recent
article.
He provided an example of a new dye intended for the textiles industry where
cost-consciousness is especially keen. The dye was especially promising
because it was almost entirely absorbed by cotton fibres and left barely any
traces in the waste water. However, the manufacturing process generated
three by-products. Even though they were used in other processes and never
left the plant in their original form, each had to be checked and approved
at a total cost of DM200,000, Dr Konig wrote.
Meanwhile, the net of environmental legislation continues to expand and
impinge on Germany's fourth-largest exporting sector. The planned
Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetzt - a catch-all law designed to complete the
circle of development, production, use and re-use or recycling for new
products - allows for no exceptions. The aim of the legislation is to oblige
industry to develop new products and the techniques for recycling them in
parallel. According to Mr Konig, this will apply even to one-off, low-volume
manufacture of experimental materials or products even before a market has
been found for them.
If research and development in Germany continued to be obstructed by
indiscriminate restrictions, valuable jobs in research and application
technology would be lost, he wrote. Production would inevitably follow and,
in the end, so would scientific knowledge. 'The widespread exodus of gene
technology should act as a warning,' he added.
The Bonn coalition has already acknowledged that deregulation has an
important part to play in ensuring future growth in the German economy, and
last year put forward a wide-ranging discussion paper on the subject which
was clearly intended to prepare the ground for change. The SPD's position
paper - part response to the now-fading cyclical crisis in the chemicals
industry, and part campaign document - showed a similar intent. Whoever wins
the forthcoming federal election, there are promising signs of a consensus
that more flexibility and less red tape are in order.
On the other hand, there are no indications from any side that German
environmental legislation will be made less rigorous. The aim is more to
reconcile the demands of the law with the desire to preserve jobs and
encourage the evolution of a more specialised chemicals sector as the old,
low added-value production drifts increasingly and inevitably abroad.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the Bonn environment minister, recently proclaimed that one
of his aims during Germany's impending European Union presidency, was to
establish the EU's 'continuously developing' environmental policy as an
example to the rest of the world. In consort with his French counterpart, Mr
Michel Barnier, he said he would press for higher security and protection
standards all round, and more stringent application of existing regulations.
In the future, he said, he expected the four EU membership candidates,
Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria, to strengthen the ranks of the
advocates of environmental protection. Europe must come to appreciate that a
vigorous environmental policy offered economic opportunities.
It was doubtless coincidental, but on the same day Mr Heinrich von Lersner,
president of the federal environmental agency, chose to highlight some of
the economic advantages. He argued strongly against the advocates of a
'pause' in environmental legislation. His 20 years' experience had taught
him that neglect of the environment damaged the economy while investment in
its protection almost always paid dividends.
The world market for protection technology was now worth Dollars 285m a
year. The US had 16 per cent, Japan 13 per cent, but Germany was still
market leader with a 21 per cent share. There was a danger, Mr Lersner
noted, that Germany would lose its lead if potential purchasers were put off
by warnings that environmental protection was bad for an economy's health.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (10): When directors
are liable - The risk of court action is increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Bottomley says most directors and senior managers of UK companies are
just not frightened enough.
'The legal aspects of caring for the environment need to be taken much more
seriously,' he warns. 'The personal responsibility of directors is going to
become an increasingly important area and people running companies need to
become much more aware of what they may be up against.'
Mr Bottomley is senior partner of Hammond Suddards, one of the 'big five'
firms of corporate lawyers in Leeds. Many large law firms have set up units
of specialists in environmental law during the last few years but what makes
Hammond Suddards especially qualified to comment is that ICI outsourced its
environmental litigation work to the firm in 1992.
Lawyers hoping for more clients are no different from any other salespeople,
so their claims should always be treated with caution, if not scepticism,
but there appears to be evidence to support Mr Bottomley's case.
The case is this: fines on companies for pollution offences are having a
slow impact; but directors and senior managers carry personal legal
responsibility for the actions of a company, its employees and its agents.
Therefore, enforcement bodies are increasingly likely to 'go' for
individuals and try to obtain large fines against them - or even prison
sentences. Mr Michael Shepherd, one of Hammond Suddards' litigation team and
a specialist on legal and court procedure, says that in some fields such as
waste disposal, gaol sentences have already been handed down.
Many companies have written environmental policies which are meant to show
that directors and senior managers take their responsibilities seriously and
expect the company's employees and agents to do the same.
Based on precedent in other fields of law, many believe this will protect
directors and senior managers if something goes wrong and a pollution
offence is committed 'down the line' without their knowledge.
Whether a criminal act by an employee or agent is the action of a company
depends on his or her state of mind, intention, knowledge or belief, as well
as the facts and circumstances.
If the law requires a guilty mind as a condition of an offence, the company
will be guilty if the directors and senior managers intended to commit the
offence, but not if they had no such intent and the offence was committed by
a junior employee who is not an officer of the company.
Tesco v. Nattras in 1972 is the latest precedent of three relied upon in
support of this. Here, a supermarket ran out of cut-price chickens being
advertised nationally on special offer. The supermarket manager substituted
chickens from stock labelled at a higher price and Tesco was prosecuted by a
local trading standards officer.
The case went through the appeal system, where the final decision was that
Tesco was not guilty because the senior management had no intent to commit
an offence and the local supermarket manager was too lowly in the
organisation to make the company liable.
Mr Stuart Bell, a Hammond Suddard lawyer specialising in environmental
policy, says this gives many directors and senior managers a false sense of
security for two reasons.
The first is that many pollution offences are absolute, and therefore do not
require a guilty mind for companies and individuals to be charged.
Mr Bell says most environmental law specialists believe the trend will be
for increasingly more pollution offences to become absolute ones. There will
be no defence against them, only a plea of mitigation. The company without a
well-defined environmental policy will be in trouble.
The second reason he advances is of a discernible trend by legislators - in
effect, the government - to make personal responsibility much more important
in corporate governance. The Food Safety Act of 1990 gives a clue as to
developments.
It says if an offence is proved to have been committed with the consent,
connivance or through neglect by a director, manager, secretary, or any
other similar officer of a corporate body - or anyone purporting to act in
such capacity - the person is guilty and liable to punishment.
Similarly worded sections are now included in the Acts of Parliament
covering health and safety at work, consumer credit, company law, financial
services, trade descriptions, water resources, planning, fire precautions,
crowd safety, insolvency and environmental protection.
This means having a written environmental policy may not be enough. It has
to be applied and supervised right up to boardroom level. Procedures also
have to work at all times. For example, having an environmental officer
acting as internal policeman may not be enough if there is no procedure to
cover for his or her holidays.
It means a site foreman cannot turn a blind eye to where an outside
contractor dumps a load of waste - nor the directors of the company involved
claim that it was nothing to do with them because they did not know. All
parties must have taken reasonable precautions to ensure safe disposal
eventually took place.
Concerted attempts to stop illegal waste disposal - particularly dumping of
toxic waste - are already under way.
'Cowboy' operators who have charged for long haulage to legal dumps, or for
digging holes to bury waste, but have then dumped illegally and locally, or
at surface level, have been successfully prosecuted recently and gaoled.
Some environmental lawyers believe the directors of companies that hire such
operators may be next, 'to encourage the others'.
An attempt is also being made by the authorities to establish a precedent
that will supersede Tesco v. Nattras as far as environmental law is
concerned. The case involves pollution of a waterway via an underground
culvert on a new housing estate, and whether the directors and senior
managers of the company involved can be held responsible for it.
National Rivers Authority v. Alfred McAlpine Homes (Southern) is now in the
appeal system. If the NRA wins, environmental law at least will greatly
increase the onus on corporate officers for what happens 'down the line' -
however remote from head office.
Is all this the scare tactics of lawyers trying to drum up more business? Mr
Bell warns: 'Large numbers of companies have no policy on waste
minimisation, waste reduction and waste disposal. Big companies are OK but
many medium-sized and smaller ones have no idea at all.
'When you look at the figures, the number of prosecutions is very small
compared with the number of breaches. But the number of prosecutions has
doubled year on year since the National Rivers Authority came into being in
1989.'
Penalties are also likely to be stiffer. Although they are limited to Pounds
20,000 and six-month sentences in magistrates' courts, fines are unlimited
in the crown court, where gaol terms of up to two years can be imposed. In
addition, companies can be made to pay for putting the pollution right - and
this may cost much more than any fine. Incidentally, fines and remediation
costs are not chargeable against revenue for tax purposes - they come
straight out of profits.
Mr Shepherd also says environmental pressure groups are likely to bring
their own prosecutions, as Greenpeace inflicted on ICI last year. Greenpeace
did not win, but it demonstrated a new avenue for making companies more
environmentally responsible.
The question for directors and senior managers is whether they can afford
not to take the lawyers' warnings seriously.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (9): Outdated and
inefficient - Communism has left a costly legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's an ill wind which blows nobody any good, and nowhere is the old truism
more apparent than in the former communist states of eastern Europe and
beyond.
In the four years since the collapse of communism, precipitous declines in
output from the old state-controlled heavy industrial and chemical plants
have been accompanied by a substantial decline in the level of both air and
water pollution. Unfortunately, however, the volume of accumulated chemical,
nuclear, metallic and other wastes in the ground, in often poorly
constructed and maintained dumps and storage dams and in the seas fed by
polluted rivers, remains horrific and lethal, particularly in the former
Soviet Union.
In volume terms by far the biggest sources of pollution remain the region's
coal-fired power stations, steel mills and refineries of all types.
Over a third of Europe's entire emissions of sulphur dioxide are pour out of
a complex of lignite or poor quality coal-burning power stations and
chemical plants in the so-called 'black triangle' where Poland, the Czech
republic and former east Germany meet.
Poland alone expects to spend Dollars 1bn reducing emissions at one of the
biggest polluters, the 2,000MW Turow power station complex, while the German
environment minister has promised that the former east German plants will be
brought up to EU emission standards by 1996. The German government has also
agreed to finance similar environmental improvements at the Prunerow power
station just across the border in the Czech republic.
The coal mines are also a potent source of water pollution, especially in
Poland where saline water pumped out of the deep mines of Silesia flows down
the Vistula and into the Baltic, one of the most polluted seas in the world.
The Baltic is closely followed by the Black Sea which is also virtually
landlocked and receives the effluent from the Danube and the big rivers
flowing through southern Russia and Ukraine.
The chemical industry by comparison is a limited polluter, but this mainly
reflects the low level of its development in the former communist bloc and
the fact that many chemical, synthetic fertiliser, petrochemical and related
plants were put up there on a turnkey basis by western contractors.
Even so many were built before the awakening of environmental consciousness
in the West, and even plants built in the 1970s frequently deliberately
skimped on smoke abatement, water filtration and other environmental
protection equipment. Even when environmental protection equipment was
installed, itwas rarely switched on or it became inoperative because of
breakdowns and shortages of spare parts.
But environmental protection became a powerful stick with which to beat
communist governments in the 1980s and many of the most polluting plants
were closed in the first flush of enthusiasm after the collapse of the
Berlin Wall and installation of the first post-communist regimes. Given the
monopoly nature of the communist production system, however, several of
these plants had to be re-opened to ensure minimal supplies of drugs and
essential chemicals for other industries.
Lack of investment and poor maintenance left the former East German chemical
industry, much of it coal-based, especially vulnerable once German
re-unification revealed the combination of low productivity and
environmental nastiness. The introduction of D-Mark pricing was the last
straw and whole swathes of the industry have simply been wiped out, leaving
a huge bill for rehabilitating the polluted land on and around the sprawling
acres where the plants once stood.
Poland and the Czech Republic also have substantial chemical industries
facing similar problems but are spared the additional burden of over-valued
currencies. In Romania, where the worst polluters (such as the unspeakable
carbon black plant at Copca Mica in Transylvania) have been simply closed
down, the overblown petrochemical and refining industry is working at a
fraction of its capacity.
Throughout the region, fertiliser plants, refineries, petrochemical
complexes and pharmaceutical plants have either been closed or are working
far below capacity. With over-capacity in the west, little money is going
into modernisation or on new greenfield sites, although the latter are
generally regarded as a much better investment.
The decline in Russian oil production and, above all, the end of the era of
cheap Soviet energy and input prices is the main factor which has exposed
the uncompetitive nature of most chemical production in the region and led
to the lower output and the consequent fall in pollution. Russian statistics
show an average 20 per cent decline across a broad swathe of chemical output
in 1992 with no sign of recovery to date.
Reliable figures are hard to come by in this area but official Polish
statistics show that output of the Polish chemical industry fell 25 per cent
in 1990 and a further 13 per cent in 1991 before rising by 7 and 8 per cent
in the following two years. But the emission of gases, which fell from 5.1m
tonnes in 1989 to 4.1m in 1990 continued to fall even when production
started to rise. The statistics show a similar trend in the emission of
poisonous dust emissions.
This is only partly due to investment in anti-pollution devices which has
remained minimal given the poor economic state of most chemical enterprises.
The fall in emissions mainly reflects greater awareness of ecological issues
and greater efficiency in the use of fuel and inputs prompted by more
rational pricing. Gone are the days of big investment in huge, inefficient
and polluting plants to produce basic chemicals from cheap Soviet oil. In
future, the emphasis will be on much smaller plants, many of them
foreign-owned or using the latest western technology to produce
world-quality drugs, detergents, paints and downstream consumer products at
greenfield sites governed by EU pollution standards. The forerunners of this
new phase are the detergent plants set up in Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic and elsewhere by Henkel, Unilever, Benckiser and Procter and
Gamble.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (9): Travelling businessmen can
keep in touch / An investigation into the latest in in-car communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radio waves have beamed a one-way stream of entertainment and information
into moving vehicles ever since the first car radio was fitted. But, over
the past decade, advances in data processing and cellular radio-telephony
have added a new two-way 'interactive' dimension to in-car communications
which is already increasing the productivity of the travelling executive on
the road.
Leaving the office no longer means forsaking the facsimile machine, the
computer system and the telephone. Cellular- radio telecommunications
services in particular have proved to be a valuable business tool, initially
for voice, and now for data communications.
Equipped with the right cellular telephone handset, a portable computer and
a fax-modem, it is now possible to exchange data with head office, collect
electronic mail or send a facsimile message while on the move. Where a hard
copy is required, lightweight high quality portable printers are now
available, as are notebook PCs with inbuilt ink-jet printers.
If secure high quality voice-only telecommunications are required, the
business traveller will soon be able to use one of the new pan-European
GSM-standard digital cellular telephones to make a telephone call almost
anywhere in Europe. In a couple of years satellite-based systems will offer
digital telecommunications services from anywhere on earth. Alternatively,
if data-only transmission is needed then a new breed of dedicated mobile
data service operators has begun to appear.
This revolution in mobile telecommunications started in the US in the early
1980s and spread to Europe via Scandinavia and the UK in the mid-1980s.
Since cellular radio telephone services began in Britain in 1985, the number
of subscribers to the two original analogue networks, Cellnet and Vodafone,
has grown to about 2m - or a fifth of the total 10m cellular telephone
subscribers in Europe.
From the outset, cellular telephones found their way into executive vehicles
in the form of dedicated carphones. In equipment terms carphones still
provide a cost-effective option for the corporate fleet, but lightweight
pocket-sized hand-portable telephones have come to dominate equipment sales
in recent years. Most of these handsets can also be used with a car kit -
which extends battery life and provides better reception - but can also
leave the vehicle along with the user.
Meanwhile, the range of cellular services available to the business user has
expanded dramatically in the past two years. In particular, digital cellular
technology has led to a second generation of cellular networks in Europe,
while encouraging the operators of the older analogue networks to cut prices
and re-organise their tariff structures.
In the UK Cellnet and Vodafone offer a total of six different tariffs on
their analogue networks. In addition both have built digital networks based
on the GSM standard. In Britain, where the old analogue networks still
provide superior national coverage, some analogue handset prices have been
cut to Pounds 100 or less and the uptake of these new GSM services has been
relatively slow.
However, in Germany and other markets where analogue network capacity was
restricted, or had not been developed, GSM subscriber numbers have grown
rapidly over the past two years. In some markets, particularly Denmark and
Germany, aggressive marketing has already resulted in the elimination of the
price premium on GSM equipment.
The launch last year of the Mercury One-2-One service in the UK - the first
digital PCN (Personal Communications Network) in the world - followed by
inauguration of Orange, the network owned by Hutchison Telecom, in April has
provided subscribers in Britain with further options. Orange's tariff
structure in particular is designed to appeal to high volume business users.
In Europe PCN networks are also planned in Germany and France.
In the longer term these digital cellular services should have another key
advantage over their analogue counterparts - digital technology makes it
much easier to transmit data over a cellular radio network.
The liquid crystal displays on GSM and PCN handsets can potentially be used
to provide a sophisticated pager and message service. In addition, handsets
equipped with an appropriate socket should eventually be able to accept data
from a notebook PC or a handheld personal digital assistant, without the
need for a modem.
In the meantime, however, it is perfectly possible - though somewhat more
difficult and less reliable - to send or receive data over an analogue
network using a special wireless modem and handset. Another alternative is
to sign up for a dedicated mobile data service, such as the Ram Mobile Data
network in the UK, that is designed to work with portable PCs and other
digital equipment such as facsimile machines at high speed.
Digital radio in either cellular or satellite form, is also likely to
provide the communications backbone for another set of productivity
enhancing tools for the motorist - so-called route guidance and congestion
avoidance systems.
There are already a number of commercially available route guidance systems
in use in the UK and elsewhere. Among the real-time systems is
Trafficmaster, which is used by more than 4,000 British motorists. It is a
dashboard-mounted unit which tells drivers about traffic speeds on about
1,000 miles of motorways in the south and midlands, pinpointing delays and
estimating travel times.
The information is collected by infra-red sensors placed on bridges and
gantries over motorways which monitor the speed of passing traffic and send
the information to a control centre in Luton from where it is relayed
immediately to subscribers' vehicles.
More sophisticated systems integrating problem identification, satellite
global positioning systems and route guidance are likely in the next decade.
Much of the groundwork for these systems has being undertaken under the
aegis of EU-sponsored research programmes such as Prometheus which have
brought together the big European vehicle and components manufacturers in
strictly non-competitive collaborative research.
Some researchers are already suggesting that by the end of the century
in-car electronic navigation equipment, working with global positioning
systems, will allow a driver to follow the progress of a journey on a moving
map shown on a screen, or enable emergency services to pinpoint a disabled
vehicle.
Research is also being conducted in the UK and elsewhere into Radio Data
Systems which would allow local traffic information to replace national
broadcasts in digitised form. This up-to-date data would be decoded by the
in-car navigator and the driver alerted to problems ahead either via a text
display, or by a computer generated voice.
What seems certain is that the next generation of communications technology
will enable the travelling businessman to send and receive vastly more
information. At the same time, increasingly sophisticated data processing
equipment will enable this information to be analysed, manipulated and
displayed more easily - and integrated with other in-vehicle electronic
systems ranging from entertainment equipment to collision avoidance systems.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (10): Leasing catches on in Britain
 -Private contract purchase schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FEAST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A two-year-old scheme to get private buyers into new cars has met with such
success that many in the industry expect it to account for half of all
private transactions in the future.
The format, which works on the basis that most buyers are far more
interested in the size of the monthly repayment than the total cost, was
imported from the US, where it is known simply as leasing.
In Britain, leasing attracts VAT, a tax which is already included in a new
car's retail price, and this has prompted the Finance and Leasing
Association (FLA) to come up with the generic term, private contract
purchase (PCP).
The first such scheme in the UK, Ford's Options was introduced in 1992 in
the run-up to the August sales boom.
Ford's big rivals were quick to follow - Vauxhall with Choices, Rover with
Select, Peugeot with Passport and so on. Now, practically every car
manufacturer has a PCP. Early problems, caused largely by a lack of dealer
training, seem to have been ironed out.
The attraction of a PCP is that a driver can get behind the wheel of a new
car for relatively low monthly payments. 'As it is aimed at private
purchasers, we find Select is skewed towards our smaller cars, the Metro and
200,' says Mr John Lowndes, marketing operations director at Rover.
Mr Andy Green, sales director of Nissan, which was one of the last into the
arena with its Preferences scheme, adds: 'PCPs are particularly attractive
to younger drivers.'
The schemes differ in detail, though the principles are similar. A driver is
required to make a deposit of 30 to 40 per cent. When the contract is drawn
up, the dealer estimates the car's value after the end of the agreed period
(either two or three years) based on the driver's projected annual mileage
(6,000, 12,000 or 18,000). The driver then pays a monthly fee based on the
difference between the new and secondhand prices, plus interest charges.
At the end of the fixed term, the customer can decide to keep the car by
making the final 'balloon' (or lump sum) payment, swap to another new model,
or simply walk away. Thus, a Pounds 6,500 model such as a Citroen AX can be
driven for three years for under Pounds 100 a month. A Pounds 13,000 car
such as a Ford Mondeo costs under Pounds 220 a month over a two-year period.
A PCP does not make a car any cheaper; the difference between the final cost
of a hire purchase agreement and a PCP (including the balloon payment) is
small. But it does make it more affordable in the short term.
It presents the customer with a fundamental alternative to car ownership: it
offers the opportunity of paying just for the use of the vehicle, rather
like a long-term rental agreement.
The schemes arrived at a fortunate time for the motor trade. New car demand
was still depressed after several years of expanding demand. Even the recent
quickening of pace in sales has come mainly from fleet purchasers where
orders are counted in terms of 25 or more cars. The private, or retail, side
has lagged behind.
PCPs have stimulated interest among private buyers at a time of considerable
economic uncertainty. The schemes, with their fixed, low cost monthly
outlays, give consumers peace of mind when so much else is uncertain.
Repair costs are covered by the manufacturer's warranty and some purchases
carry roadside assistance programmes. The only additional outlay is common
to all cars: insurance, tax and servicing.
Some of the more recent PCPs are going further. Toyota's Terms plan can be
extended to include regular servicing. Citroen's new Elect scheme can be
expanded to include items that wear out such as tyres.
'If you look at PCPs within the finance-funded sector, they moved from
nothing to about 25 per cent within 18 months, Rover's Mr Lowndes says. Mr
David Nash, public relations manager of Ford Credit, reports a similar
performance. 'Ford is doing between a quarter and a third of its retail
business through Options,' he says.
Ford, Rover and other companies expect PCPs will eventually account for one
in every two private car transactions.
Ford, which tested Options regionally for two years before the national
launch, reports that 68 per cent of early customers are renewing their
original plans and seven out of 10 are choosing a newer model under the
terms of the PCP. The remainder are either buying the original car or
switching to other manufacturers.
'Our long-term goal is to retain an Options customer for life,' declares Mr
David Flanigan, managing director of Ford Credit - one of the reasons his
competitors decided to join the PCP bandwagon so rapidly.
In the US, leasing now accounts for one in six new cars, and Ford recently
began testing similar schemes in the Netherlands and Spain. However, PCPs
are not a feature of the motor trade in most other European countries
because of VAT and personal tax regulations.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (11): All-aluminium on the road -
The lightweight metal that is challenging steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Audi's new all-aluminium executive car will be the first of many. That is
the confident prediction of Mr David Schlendorf, president of Alcoa's
automotive structures division. Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium group,
and Audi have jointly developed the new Audi A8 - the German company hopes
to sell 20,000 a year.
Alcoa is supplying skeleton-like spaceframe bodies for the Audi from a new
plant at Soest in Germany on which it spent DM140m (about Dollars 81m). Audi
expects to take up the rest of the capacity at the Alcoa plant with another
niche car, which will be produced in slightly higher volumes than the A8, as
well as being less expensive.
'Five years from now in Europe you'll see at least 10 aluminium
spaceframe-bodied niche cars, either in production or announced by a number
of manufacturers,' says Mr Schlendorf.
Audi, which spent about DM1bn (Dollars 600m) on the A8, and Alcoa, decided
to find a new way of making cars. As aluminium is initially much more
expensive than steel, they believed it would be too costly simply to
substitute aluminium components for those traditionally made of steel.
Instead, they designed a car that has many fewer individual components and
structures than are used in a steel vehicle. They developed a spaceframe
composed of fewer than 100 extrusions and castings compared with 300 for a
stamped steel body. New manufacturing processes had to be developed to
produce these spaceframes as well as new aluminium alloys, claimed to be
safer than steel.
For car makers the new technology offers several advantages: it cuts the
weight of a car's body by about 35 per cent compared with steel bodies
without reducing the vehicle's size; it reduces tooling expense by as much
as 50 per cent; and cuts the number of parts to be stocked and the time
taken from design to production.
However, at present the process is economic only for production runs of up
to 100,000 cars a year. But Mr Schlendorf says Alcoa is ready to spend
another Dollars 1bn or so on a partnership with a car manufacturer wanting
to produce the first high-volume (more than 100,000 a year) aluminium-bodied
cars. He expects to set up at least two more plants in Europe within five
years. By the end of the decade Alcoa may have installed a satellite
production system to make aluminium bodies across Europe.
Meanwhile, Alcan of Canada, Alcoa's biggest competitor, is taking a
different route to high-volume, all-aluminium car production, in partnership
with Ford, the world's second-largest automotive group. During the Alcan
annual meeting in Montreal on April 29, Mr Jacques Bougie, the chief
executive, was handed the keys to the first Ford Aluminium Intensive
Vehicle. This was one of 40 experimental vehicles identical in appearance to
the Mercury Sable, a popular mid-sized US car - but 400lb lighter.
Ford and Alcan also believe that aluminium is suitable for building
high-volume, rather than just niche, cars.
Ford, it seems, has overcome most of the problems associated with producing
aluminium cars from an infrastructure which was set up to build them from
steel. From the start the car company wanted to use its existing equipment,
including big steel presses, which represented a huge investment, and has
spent Dollars 25m to prove this is possible.
Mr Gian Frontini, until recently Alcan's vice-president, technology and
engineering, but now director of fabrication and information technology,
says the project involved two big challenges: how aluminium could be formed
on steel presses and how to join aluminium. These have now been solved.
Alcan proved it was possible for aluminium to be shaped on existing steel
presses - even using the same tooling in some cases. Ford made a
breakthrough with special light welding robots.
Mr Frontini says he has not been given any inside information by Ford about
its future production plans but he expects that the group will gradually add
more aluminium body parts to certain models and in five or six years a car
with an all-aluminium structure will be launched.
Ford also plans a big expansion in its use of aluminium over the next five
years to penetrate the sheet, or 'skin,' usages that have traditionally
belonged to steel. This includes aluminium fenders, hoods, decklids and trim
on the next generation of the Taurus car, likely to be launched in the
autumn of 1995.
The group is already the biggest user of aluminium in the US motor industry.
Its experimental vehicle, Synthesis 2010, which is a rolling test bed for
new automotive technology - including a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine
made of aluminium - has a body made of aluminium. Synthesis achieves weight
savings of about 1,000lb compared with the present steel Sable, while having
about the same interior dimensions.
Weight saving is the big incentive for the US and Japanese car industries to
turn to lightweight aluminium. The US government is imposing ever-tightening
fuel economy standards and aluminium enables carmakers to meet those
standards by reducing weight without any loss of performance.
However, the main incentive for European carmakers is a conviction that car
recycling will become a big issue in future. European companies are also
enthusiastic about the high-performance characteristics aluminium gives to
cars.
All the big aluminium companies now have co-operative programmes with either
a carmaker or a vehicle components supplier. For example, Hydro Aluminium,
part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group and Europe's biggest
producer of aluminium extrusions, has a vested interest in the success of
the spaceframe concept, which could be a big user of extrusions in future.
Hydro has also been co-operating on car spaceframe concepts since the
mid-1980s with Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in
Italy and recently signed a co-operative agreement with Sumitomo of Japan.
Last year Hydro started supplying aluminium sub-frames from a Michigan
factory for General Motors' new Corvette sports car. The sub-frame was
previously produced from stamped aluminium sheet. Mr Ted DiGuiseppe,
vice-president, sales and marketing, Hydro Aluminium Automotive Structures,
says his company's sub-frame weighs only 11kg, or 2kg less than the stamped
aluminium equivalent and also saves 75 per cent on tooling costs - an
important consideration with a model to be produced at the rate of only
20,000 to 30,000 a year. In total, the extruded sub-frame costs 18 per cent
less than the stamped one.
Mr DiGuiseppe remains to be convinced that the Ford-Alcan concept of
replacing steel car 'skins' with aluminium will not be too expensive. He
admits, however, that companies such as Hydro which are offering aluminium
spaceframes have the difficult task of persuading car companies not only to
use a new material but also new manufacturing processes.
Alcan's Mr Frontini says: 'The choice of technology is up to the auto
companies. And Ford has firmly decided that the stamped unibody is the
answer.'
The debate will continue, but whatever the outcome, one way or another the
automotive industry will use a great deal more aluminium in the future.
2000. A US Aluminium Association study showed the average 1991 US-built car
contained 191lb of aluminium, 47 per cent more than in 1981. It is estimated
1994 cars will average about 235lb and Ford predicts that, by 2005, the
average will reach 500lb.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (8): Smart suits appreciate low
depreciation - Arthur Way explains why four-wheel drives are keeping their
grip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In a manner that reflects their progression along a muddy track,
four-wheel-drive vehicles (4x4s) have shown no signs of faltering during
recent years in the UK marketplace.
At 58,561 units in 1993, demand for 4x4s - also known rather quaintly as
off-road cars - was double the level of just two years earlier, and eight
times as high as 10 years ago.
These numbers refer to the entire off-road car sector, which can be divided
into three main groups. At one end of the spectrum are such vehicles as the
Daihatsu Fourtrak and Suzuki Vitara. These often come in soft-top variants,
favoured by younger owners for their affordability and the element of 'fun'
they provide. As such, they do not fall into the executive category.
Next come the mid-range models, typified by Ford's Maverick and its cousin
the Nissan Terrano, both of which are manufactured in Spain. These are
closer to executive-car territory and, in some cases, are chosen by senior
management for their mainstream transport.
Finally, there are the 'heavyweight' 4x4s, including Chrysler Jeep's
Cherokee, Isuzu's Trooper, Land Rover's Discovery and Range Rover,
Mitsubishi's Shogun and Vauxhall's recently introduced Monterey. These
models are moving to centre stage in the executive car market, with the
result that sales have increased substantially and more manufacturers have
entered the sector.
At first glance it is somewhat puzzling why this should be so. After all,
executives are associated with smart suits, briefcases and travel between
one company car park and another, rather than country garb, bales of straw
and the need to cross rough terrain. The apparent absurdity is compounded by
the terms of business-user insurance policies, many of which forbid off-road
use. There are, however, two compelling reasons why 4x4s have become so
favoured as executive transport.
First, fleet managers, finance directors and proprietors of small businesses
are looking with increasing favour towards 4x4s, because of their high
residual values. Mitsubishi, for example, states that the Shogun loses only
about 15 per cent of its value in the first two years. In contrast, a
typical executive car may lose half of its original purchase price during
the same period.
Second, latest versions of 4x4s incorporate many of the characteristics and
features of large luxury cars - such as ABS braking, airbags, air
conditioning, automatic transmission and leather seats. They drive and feel
like a car, and have comparable performance, while many users appreciate the
commanding position high above the traffic and the feeling of safety which
this brings. Moreover, there are a variety of additional attributes, ranging
from high load-carrying capacity and the ability to travel with assurance
during inclement weather.
According to the leading suppliers of heavyweight 4x4s, typical buyers are
business and professional people in their late 30s or early 40s, who have an
active lifestyle. Although the vehicles rarely - if ever - leave a made-up
surface, quite a number are fitted with a tow-hook, which suggests that some
owners use them to pull equipment such as boats, gliders and horseboxes.
Evidence from the marketplace indicates that a fairly wide range of cars is
being traded in for 4x4s. Buyers of Land Rover's Discovery, for example,
tend to have had large estate cars, whereas Range Rover buyers are trading
in marques such as BMW, Jaguar and Lexus.
Land Rover is the market leader by a wide margin, thanks to its legendary
Range Rover and highly successful Discovery. The latter was launched towards
the end of 1989, since when more than 125,000 have been produced, of which
around 65 per cent have been exported to 50 markets, making the model
Britain's main contribution to the global 4x4 leisure market.
The Discovery is distributed in Japan through two channels - Rover Japan and
Honda's Verno network, where it is sold as the Honda Crossroad. In an
important move, the model was launched in American during April 1994. Land
Rover sells around 5,000 Range Rovers a year in this market, and expects to
see the Discovery achieve double that number.
Prospects have been enhanced following the introduction of the 1995 model
version (in March 1994). This has a new interior and manual gearbox,
together with a reworked engine which provides greater refinement.
Mitsubishi has established a loyal following with its Shogun model, which is
the world's best seller in the 4x4 off-road car sector. Since its launch in
1983, the company has produced more than 1m units, and annual sales
currently amount to around 180,000. In the UK, though, the figure is below
4,000 - representing 25 per cent of Mitsubishi's import quota - and is
unlikely to rise significantly in the short term, due to continued
restrictions on Japanese imports. In the absence of this constraint, sales
would undoubtedly be noticeably higher. Mitsubishi reports growing interest
on the part of executive buyers for the Shogun, particularly during the past
year.
Chrysler Jeep's experience, since its debut in the UK at the beginning of
1993, provides a good indication of the 4x4 market's buoyancy. A first-year
sales target of 2,000 turned into actual sales of 4,000 units, of which
3,500 were Cherokee models bought principally by business people. The target
for 1994 is 5,000 sales, including 4,500 Cherokees. Chrysler Jeep reports
that the majority of trade-ins are quality saloon and estate cars with few
4x4s. At the moment, only petrol-engined versions are available, but a
turbo-diesel is scheduled to arrive later in the year.
Vauxhall is another recent entrant, following the introduction of the
Monterey in May 1994. The company is targeting the model (which is made by
Isuzu in Japan) at executive-car buyers who are on the verge of trying
something different. The sales target for 1994 is 2,000 units, of which 70
per cent are expected to be the long wheelbase 5-door version.
The future of the executive 4WD sector looks good, as more people in the
position to afford heavyweight 4x4s recognise their characteristics. Recent
changes to company-car taxation - whereby scale charges are assessed on
purchase price, rather than engine size - may help the sector's development,
since many of the models feature large engines in the 3-4 litre range and
were unduly penalised under the previous system.
In addition, as tax scale charges are notched up to reflect more closely the
monetary benefit of having a company car, executives are more likely to
choose the model they really desire, rather than some identikit executive
saloon. Under these circumstances, maybe the greatest threat will come from
the growing ranks of multi-purpose vehicles - another alternative sector.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (6): Clean air is
important, but so are jobs - Switzerland's Big Three sense growing sympathy
from a public worried about the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officially, this is Responsible Care year in Switzerland.
The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is making a special effort to
inform the public about the strategies and programmes it has adopted to
ensure that the impact of its operations on the environment is minimised.
But in reality, when the Swiss people think of their huge chemical and
pharmaceutical companies these days, they have much more pressing concerns
than environmental ones.
Mostly, they want to know how Ciba, Roche and Sandoz are coping with the
pressures brought on by health care reform in many countries. And how many
of the companies' operations are likely to be moved away from Switzerland to
other countries in the near future? How many jobs are likely to be lost?
This represents a substantial change from the past few years when
environmental concerns were foremost in people's minds, especially in Basle
where all three companies are based.
Relations between the companies and the people were badly damaged after
Sandoz suffered a major environmental accident in 1986.
The word Schweizerhalle still reverberates among chemical industry leaders
and environmentalists everywhere. It is the name of a small town a few miles
up the Rhine from Basle where Sandoz, one of three giant chemical and
pharmaceutical groups based in the city, has a large chemical warehouse.
In the early morning of November 1, 1986, a fire broke out in the warehouse,
tripping sirens all over Basle and sending clouds of acrid smoke over the
city.
That was alarming enough for the residents, but it soon became apparent that
an environmental disaster was occurring. As firemen pumped water on to the
fire in the warehouse, it mixed with the chemicals. Something like 30 tonnes
of dangerous agricultural chemicals, including 200kg of mercury, washed into
the Rhine.
A great deal of marine life, especially eels, was killed. Although no human
life was lost, the fire could have led to widespread deaths through a
release of phosgene.
Investigations did not reveal any negligence on the part of Sandoz. Rather,
the conclusion was that holding tanks should be installed around chemical
warehouses to contain toxic liquids created by firefighting.
No one had thought of the need for such tanks before, but they have since
become standard installations throughout the world.
Nevertheless, following the accident, relations between Basle residents and
all three big companies deteriorated, and any projects they put forward for
planning permission were subject to severe criticism and long delays.
The companies quickly realised they were in trouble and set about
reassessing their public affairs policies and programmes. They have put ever
increasing efforts into educating the local public about their activities
and listening to comments and suggestions from neighbours.
Initially nervous about publishing data about their operations, they now
release a blizzard of information. Ciba is probably the most aggressive.
Last September, it published a brochure entitled Risks of the Basle Works,
in which it listed the volumes of various chemicals it produced and the many
nasty raw materials it consumed.
The companies have become much quicker and more professional in responding
to reports of accidents. For example, last December several containers
slipped off a freighter in the North Sea during a storm, taking with them
thousands of packets of Ciba's Apron Plus DS pesticide events.
Ciba was immediately active in helping to recover the packets and warning
Dutch and German authorities that some might wash up on their coasts. When a
month later, some packets started appearing on the coast and the accident
became public knowledge, Ciba was ready to reassure people that the chemical
degraded quickly, so there was no danger to humans and very little impact on
the environment.
Similarly, Roche moved quickly to refute fresh charges by a European
parliamentarian that toxic residues from its accident in Seveso, Italy, in
1976 had been deposited in a dump in Germany. Last year, all three companies
for the first time published separate corporate environmental reports,
explaining their programmes and measuring their progress in considerable
detail.
The companies have also joined various international programmes, such as the
Business Charter for Sustainable Development launched by the International
Chamber of Commerce and the World Industry Council for the Environment,
established by the environmental summit at Rio de Janeiro, as well as the
Responsible Care Programme.
In the context of the Responsible Care year in Switzerland, the big
companies are helping smaller ones to set up environmental protection
programmes and showing them how to carry out audits. Sandoz is also running
a two day course for secondary school teachers on the Responsible Care
concept.
These and other efforts, along with the passage of time, appear finally to
have succeeded in healing the wounds of Schweizerhalle. This spring, for the
first time since the accident, the chairmen of Ciba and Sandoz felt they
could address shareholders at their annual general meetings without even
mentioning environmental issues. 'We face other issues now. Media inquiries
on environmental issues are back to the level of the early 1980s,' an
official at one of the companies says.
That does not mean that the companies will give environmental issues less
priority. Their spending for environmental protection continues to rise, and
they are all working on new processes that eliminate potential environmental
hazards at source.
Perhaps the final expiation of Schweizerhalle will come in the first half of
next year when Ciba will open a SFr120m special waste burning facility in
Basle. The project, initiated in the late 1980s, only got planning
permission in 1991 from a then hostile community. Now it is hailed as a
model of its kind.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (7): High-risk
neighbourhood - Ian Hamilton Fazey studies Cheshire fire brigade's emergency
drill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheshire's Fire and Emergency Service has to live with more risk than most
others. The county has one of Britain's most intense concentrations of
chemical and petrochemical industries in its area, in particular a necklace
of large sites along the south bank of Manchester Ship Canal from Runcorn to
Ellesmere Port.
There have been three big incidents in the last five years and several
lesser ones. All have successfully tested the effectiveness of emergency
plans and, in some cases, the courage of fire crews.
In 1989, a pipeline ruptured, spilling thick Venezuelan crude oil into the
Mersey between Birkenhead and Shell's Stanlow refinery at Ellesmere Port.
The same year, a chlorine leak from ICI's plant at Runcorn caused an
emergency as the gas formed a cloud. This year, a big fire at Associated
Octel - which makes additives for petrol - alarmed Ellesmere Port residents
and prompted calls for a public inquiry which are still being made.
Generally, no one faults the response of the emergency services to any
incident. Modern communications have made for ever-faster response, while
companies take a 'better safe than sorry' approach towards raising an alarm.
Mr Dennis Davis, Cheshire's chief officer, says plans to anticipate and deal
with emergencies are comprehensive, although not too detailed. 'You can't
predict everything that might happen,' he says. 'It is important to build in
flexibility so you can alter your response to any situation you find, or
which develops.'
This means ensuring thorough knowledge of what is being done where, or
stored in any factory, so firefighters will know what they might expect.
Liaison with chemical plant management and staff is therefore on-going, with
all companies taking their own responsibilities seriously.
Where a new climate is developing, however, is in public relations. The
chemical industry and the emergency services are finding new, more
questioning, public attitudes emerging, with less trust, more suspicion and
a greater demand for information.
Industry and emergency services say they not only welcome this, but they
want to take a lead. This is partly defensive. Public consciousness has been
raised by the increasing politicisation of environmental issues: people
generally want to know more, while pressure groups and green activists are
likely to control the agenda if unchallenged by those they criticise.
'It's a matter of trying to encourage people to be realistic,' says Mr
Edward Brady, head of public affairs for ICI's cluster of plant and offices
at Runcorn. 'Perspective is important. Most incidents are brought under
control quickly by a plant's own emergency staff. The problem comes when
people start asking 'What if .?' and extrapolating towards the unrealistic.'
Sensational media reporting encourages this - as does entirely reasonable
reporting.
In the Octel fire, for example, the blaze near one reaction vessel was
brought under control after one hour and 40 minutes. The vessel was encased
in a safety coating with a guaranteed two-hour fire resistance.
While chemical engineers saw this as evidence of the protective coating
doing its job, media reporting understandably took a '20 minutes from
disaster' line. The question to Mr Davis was: 'What if the two hours were
up? Would you have withdrawn your men and left the tank to explode?'
In fact, two hours' fire resistance was the minimum rating for the coating's
integrity. Not only could it reasonably have been expected to last longer,
it did not even have to push the limit of the least it was supposed to do.
The mistake was to give the two-hour figure,' says one PR professional
unconnected with the incident. 'It led to inevitable questions which then
raised an unrealistic level of public alarm.'
Mr Davis says the best approach is to ensure the widest local public
knowledge of what is going on in any chemical plant - and what is the best
thing to do if anything goes wrong.
'The first policy is shelter, not evacuation,' he says. 'But many people
assume there will be mass evacuations and want to know why we are not going
ahead getting them out. The safest thing to do, however, is to stay indoors,
shut the windows and doors, and listen to the local radio.'
He points out that a policy of evacuation could make things worse, adding to
congestion and requiring management time that could be more crucially
deployed against the emergency. 'We want people to be safe. Sheltering in
their homes will usually be safer than leaving them. If a need develops to
evacuate people, we will then get them out,' Mr Davis says.
Under a code called CIMAH - the control of industrial major accidents and
hazards - all owners of potentially dangerous plant are required to write
every few years to all people living within 1,500 metres of a plant telling
them what is stored at the plant and what they should do in an emergency -
which is to shelter indoors in the way Mr Davis advises unless told to do
otherwise.
Emergencies are signalled by siren. 'If you can't hear the siren, you're
almost certainly far enough away not to be in any danger,' Mr Brady says.
The question is if, and when, to sound the siren, especially at night, and
especially since most potential problems are nipped in the bud.
No one wants to cry wolf. In one instance there was confusion when a small
leak at ICI was quickly contained, but a warning to stay indoors had already
been sent out for radio broadcast. Not all the radio stations broadcast the
warning - but one that did broadcast it failed to send the all clear.
Cheshire's chemicals companies are talking about working together better,
jointly publishing information and making more concerted attempts to better
inform the public at large. Mr Davis also wants a more informed media corps.
Knowledge and understanding are seen as the principal tools for achieving
this. This also includes understanding that the right thing to do in some
emergencies is nothing - as with spilt oil that can often be left to break
down naturally. Mr Davis says uninformed exhortations to 'do something' can
add to the problem.
Both he and Mr Brady also think that calls for relocation of plant or
rehousing of people near them have to be debated on reasonable assumptions
of risk.
Fair debate, however, depends on disseminating enough information to promote
wider knowledge and understanding. Responsibility for this lies with the
industry.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (7): Perks are curbed - UK company
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ways in which companies allocate executive cars not only give an
indication of the general health of UK companies but also provide an idea of
the difficulties that they may have in recruiting and holding senior people.
The latest clutch of surveys about the company car market suggest that,
while the UK economy is improving, there is no shortage of talent available
and that corporations can be less generous in their car allocation policies.
For example, Lex Vehicle Leasing, in its latest Report on Motoring, draws
the conclusion that business confidence in Britain is on the rise, because
the average age of the company car went down from 2.8 years in 1992 to 2.5
years in 1993. This reverses a three-year trend. Moreover, Lex points out
that the number of company cars on Britain's roads rose slightly last year,
from 2.65m in 1992 to 2.7m.
'Companies make investment decisions, like replacing company vehicles, when
they are confident that the business climate is improving. I think these
results indicate a turn-round in business outlook,' says Mr Jon Walden, Lex
Vehicle Leasing's managing director.
However, a survey by William M. Mercer, the consulting actuarial group,
suggests that those companies making or contemplating changes to their
company car policies are gearing up to be less generous and more
restrictive.
For example, nearly half of the surveyed companies that have made changes
extended their replacement criteria, as 16 per cent of those contemplating
changes intend to do. 'Replacement of a company car at over 75,000 miles is
now almost as common as replacement between 60,000 and 75,000 miles.
Replacement at over three years and up to four is now more common than at
over two years and up to three,' Mercer reports.
Its survey also shows that a higher percentage of organisations employing
fewer than 5,000 are restricting the number of people eligible for company
cars. The main reason given by companies making such changes was 'cost
containment'.
Mercer gives an indication of typical company-car costs, as at June last
year, for various management groups. The median average salary for directors
and partners in the companies surveyed was Pounds 60,000, and the purchase
price for their company cars was Pounds 25,000. Senior managers' median
average salary was Pounds 40,000, and their car purchase price was Pounds
19,000. The finding for middle managers was a median average salary of
Pounds 28,000 and a median average car price of Pounds 15,500. For the
junior management/specialist, the salary was Pounds 20,000, and the car
price was Pounds 12,800.
Monks' Guide to Company Car Policy, published in collaboration with Lease
Plan UK, gives an indication of the cash limits - that is, the maximum
permitted outlay - for company cars. It suggests the median cash limit for
chief executives was Pounds 30,500; for other directors it was Pounds
26,000; for senior managers the limit was Pounds 22,000; while for area
sales managers it was Pounds 14,000.
And what do executives choose for their money? According to Monks, a
remuneration consultancy, 22 per cent of company chairman want a Jaguar and
16 per cent a Mercedes. Rover comes a distant third in the desirability
stakes at 7 per cent.
Jaguars are also the choice of 32 per cent of chief executives, followed by
BMW and Mercedes (17 and 15 per cent). Some 8 per cent of chief executives
choose Rover.
'Other directors' put BMW top of their list of choices in a close-run race.
Some 18 per cent choose BMW, 15 per cent Jaguar, 12 per cent Rover, 11 per
cent Ford and 10 per cent Mercedes. Senior managers put Rover and Ford neck
and neck with 19 per cent each, followed by Vauxhall, with 17 per cent, and
BMW, 13 per cent.
Vauxhall moves to the top of the popularity poll with area sales managers,
being the choice of 30 per cent, followed by Ford, with 22 per cent, and
Rover, 15 per cent.
Monks' research tells a similar story to Mercer's. It says: 'Although the
majority of directors and senior managers are permitted the choice of any
car, subject to a price limit, a matched sample of comparison shows that an
increasing percentage are being restricted to a defined list of models. In
the important area of sales, an increasing number of companies are either
permitting sales representatives no choice or no longer permitting the
choice of any car.'
Companies are also attempting to cut the provision of fuel for private
motoring. Monks reports a 'marginal reduction' in the number of companies
providing this perk. 'The findings continue the trend observed in 1993 of an
increase in the percentage of companies offering no fuel and a decrease in
the number offering some,' it says. However, 'the more senior the employee,
the more likely he or she is to receive fuel for private motoring.'
And when are senior managers entitled to change their company cars? Monks
says 37 per cent of chief executives can replace their cars after three
years. A further 48 per cent keep their cars for more than three years. The
most popular mileage for a change is 60,000 (24 per cent) but 32 per cent of
companies do not specify a mileage limit for their chief executives.
The pattern is very similar for 'other directors,' with 38 per cent
exchanging cars at three years and a further 50 per cent keeping them for
more than three years. Once again, the most popular mileage limit was 60,000
(25 per cent) and 28 per cent of companies specified no mileage.
Another sign that companies want more value for money from their company
cars - no matter what the user might feel about it - comes when Monks
reports 'a continued increase in the number of companies choosing 80,000 as
a mileage limit (for all their cars), with four years now being the most
popular time period for replacement.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (6): No duds above the Pounds
15,000 level - See how they go: Stuart Marshall finds himself spoilt for
choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An honest motoring correspondent has to admit that sorting out the wheat
from the chaff among the current crop of new models is not easy. Why?
Because they are all good. Some are slightly better than others, though much
depends on what the user is looking for.
What one can say with confidence is that there is no such thing today as a
really dud car. Excutive-class motorists rightly take it for granted that a
car will be reliable, quiet, comfortable, adequately roomy, have
power-steering and ABS brakes and look nice. So, what else is there to take
into consideration?
Ignore for the moment the minority with individual requirements for sports
coupes or luxuriously appointed four-wheel-drive, on-off road vehicles as
company cars. It then comes down to a mix of personal taste and tax
liability, coupled with the finance director's thoughts on retained values.
Within these parameters, I reckon most executive users would be happy with
the performance of practically any four- or five-door priced over Pounds
15,000.
Petrol-engined cars of particular appeal to me in the lower price brackets -
say from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 18,000 - would be: a highly specified
Renault Laguna RXE 2.0, for its refinement; a limited edition Citroen XM
Premiere 2.0-litre turbo, for exceptional value and aclass-beating ride; a
Vauxhall Cavalier 2.5i V6 for large engined relaxation; a spacious Vauxhall
Omega 2.0i 16v; a quiet and elegant Rover 620i, with its traditional British
interior; and a comfortable yet sporty Saab 900 S 2.0i 5-door. All can have
automatic transmission; I would not consider an executive car without it.
Moving up the price scale, I could be seduced by the BMW 520i or a Mazda
Xedos 6 2.0i V6 for their multi-cylinder refinement. The 5-cylinder,
front-wheel driven Volvo 850 GLT 2.0 is equally fanciable. A Mercedes-Benz
C-180 Elegance has the timeless appeal of any car with the three-pointed
star.
In the Pounds 24,000 to Pounds 30,000 class there is an embarrassment of
riches, but saloon cars I have found particularly satisfying include the
Jaguar XJ6 Gold, Mazda Xedos 9, Toyota Camry V6 GX and Mercedes-Benz C-280.
Over the Pounds 30,000 mark, the BMW 5-Series with 3.0-litre or 4.0-litre V8
engines are as urbane as they are muscular, particularly with 5-speed
automatic transmission. The Lexus LS300 and LS400 have few rivals for sheer
silence.
Enter the sky-is-the-limit price level and, among large saloons, it is
really a Mercedes-Benz S-Class benefit. These exceedingly roomy and
comprehensively equipped cars set standards of safety, technology and -
surprisingly - driving joie de vivre that no other large luxury cars can
match. The Jaguar Daimler Double Six is beginning to show its age, but its
V12 engine's power delivery is Dom Perignon to a normal car's sparkling
blanc de blanc. And the Bentley Brooklands, for less than Pounds 100,000, is
the best value product Rolls-Royce has offered in years.
And what of the minority choices - the estate cars, sports models and on-off
road four-by-fours? Many an executive whose family includes a horse-mad
daughter and has to transport all the gear that goes with equestrianism opts
for an estate, such as a Volvo 940 or 960, Citroen XM, Ford Scorpio or
Mercedes-Benz 300T.
They offer saloon-car comfort with bulk carrying capacity. The Citroen's
height-adjustable, self-levelling suspension can be a boon. A new rival,
with petrol engines ranging from two to three litres, plus a 2.5-litre
6-cylinder BMW-sourced diesel, is the Vauxhall Omega. It is up among the
leaders for room, refinement, comfort and equipment at highly competitive
prices.
BMW's 5-Series Touring and the Audi 100 estates have a sporting demeanour
and carry bigger loads than a saloon, though they cannot match the large
Citroen, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Vauxhall or Volvo estates for sheer bulk load
capacity.
One of the best sports cars for an executive user-chooser is Ford's new
American-built Probe, V6 engined, very civilised to drive and able to take
four people when required.
Of the 4x4s, the Range Rover is still king, though the Mitsubishi Shogun
runs it close for status. Independent front suspension gives the Shogun a
better ride. The Land Rover Discovery offers practically all a Range Rover's
benefits at a much lower price, and posh versions of what used to be the
Isuzu Tropoper but is now the Vauxhall Monterey are equally pleasant on and
off road.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (5): Staying ahead
of the law - Case study - Rhone-Poulenc of France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, one of France's largest chemicals groups, has also been one
of the most ambitious with respect to environmental policy. In 1992, it set
itself a target of reducing emissions in water, air and solid waste by 50
per cent by 1995, taking 1990 as a base year, and by 65 per cent by the year
2000.
According to Mr Jean-Marc Bruel, vice chairman and head of the group's
environmental policies since the early 1980s, the setting of fixed targets
and the publication of the data represent the second major step in the field
of environmental protection. The first step dates back to 1981 when Mr Jean
Gandois, then chairman, appointed a manager to deal exclusively with
environmental issues.
Since then, Mr Bruel claims that Rhone-Poulenc, along with other French and
European chemicals companies, has made significant progress in reducing
pollution and protecting the environment. 'We have always been ahead of
legislation,' he says, citing the company's adoption of the responsible care
programme, a charter for environmental protection in the industry which was
first introduced in Canada. 'No other industry has made the kind of progress
that has been seen in Chemicals.'
He says that efforts in France to respond to the problems of environmental
pollution from the chemicals industry have been assisted by an
administrative system whereby regional government has the ability to fine
and to subsidise polluting industries.
Rhone-Poulenc is itself spending a substantial amount on reducing pollution
and increasing safety, despite the constraints of recession and the group's
debt burden. Over the past two years, the company has committed FFr3.6bn on
environmental and safety projects, the lion's share in France and the US.
But how effective has this expenditure been? The publication last month of
its annual environmental report shows a mixed result. 'We are on target with
respect to water pollution, for air emissions we are a little behind our
target, but we can make this up. It is solid waste has proved the problem,'
says Mr Bruel.
Mr Bruel's conclusions are drawn from a detailed series of pollution and
safety indices, audited by the accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and in line
with the format adopted by Cefic, the European chemicals industry
federation.
At the end of last year, according to these statistics, the index of water
pollution showed a 32 per cent decline from the base year of 1990. 'This
should enable the goal of a 50 per cent reduction by 1995 to be achieved,'
he says.
The air index improved last year year by 9.5 per cent, bringing the total
reduction since 1990 to 23 per cent. 'We are a little behind schedule, but I
think we can maintain the target because we will make a big push over the
next two years,' says Mr Bruel.
In the area of waste, however, hitting the target will be a harder
proposition. In 1993, the index remained static, showing just an 18 per cent
decline from 1990.
Part of the explanation, according to Mr Bruel, lies in a shift in emphasis,
since 1990, towards increased prevention and safety, rather than remedies.
'We have put more money into the prevention of accidents,' he says. 'Why?
because when you have an accident you have a pollution that is short in
timescale but very significant in its immediate effects.'
The stability of the waste index, however, also reflects the conflicts
between some of the group's environmental objectives and the priorities
attached to the various targets. 'We attach the greatest importance to
reducing emissions in water,' says Mr Bruel. 'But when you solve the problem
with water, generally you generate some waste.'
The stubbornness of solid waste pollution was magnified by the system used
by Rhone-Poulenc to calculate the various pollution indices. According to
this system, the various pollutants are assigned a coefficient which is
determined by their undesirability.
In air emissions, for example, nitrogen oxide is given a relatively high
coefficient of 5. In water, salt has a coefficient of a mere 0.001. In 1993,
the neutralisation of toxic waste at the company's Le Havre plant led to
landfill storage of inert residue from calcium sulfate. Because this has a
high coefficient of 10, the impact on the solid waste index was
correspondingly increased.
Despite the hiccough in the solid waste department, however, Mr Bruel is
confident that the objective of a 65 per cent improvement by 2000 is
attainable. 'The target of a 50 per cent reduction by 1995 will be delayed,
but a research programme for clean technologies is underway to correct this
trend,' the company says.
Clean technologies for the group's final products are also of growing
importance in the battle against pollution. According to Mr Bruel, the group
is developing an expanding number of products which reduce harmful waste and
emissions at every stage of their lifecycle. The Regent insecticide, for
example, which has been launched by the company, degrades without creating
toxins. The Nabion detergent, produced with sodium carbonate and sodium
silicate, is completely soluble in water and requires no treatment.
Internal efforts are, however, not the only considerations. The wider
economic situation also has a bearing on the levels of pollution produced by
Rhone-Poulenc's plants. According to the company's environmental report for
last year, the largest single factor behind the improvement in the water
index resulted from reduced business activity. The next most important
factor was technical progress, which accounted for 4.5 per cent of the
improvement.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (4): Once bitten,
twice shy - Japan earns high marks from OECD watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's chemicals industry can take some - but not all - of the credit for
the country's better than international average progress in curbing
pollution.
A recent study of Japanese environmental performance by the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development praises the country for its
'remarkable' achievement in reducing air pollution, from industrial plants,
cars and power stations.
'These successes have proved that environmental policies and economic
development can be mutually supportive,' says the study, one of the first
fruits of a 1991 OECD decision to run environmental checks on all its
members. Far from damaging industrial competitiveness, rigorous curbs on air
pollution have benefited car and pollution control equipment producers, says
the report. Yet the study gives Japan below average marks for its
performance on industrial waste, where the chemicals industry plays a larger
part than most, and dependence on agricultural chemicals.
Over the past 20 years, Japan has shown the highest average growth of any
member of the group of seven rich industrialised nations, even counting the
blow to its economic record inflicted by the recent recession.
Yet it has also over this period more than halved sulphur dioxide emissions
and nearly halved nitrous oxide pollution. That is the best performance of
any member of the OECD, says the study. Industrial processes account for
between 40 per cent and half of air pollution in Japan.
The OECD attributes this impressive track record to Japan's tough
regulations, such as those on car exhausts and factory chimneys, plus the
high technological standards of the water and air cleansing equipment
industries. This is the reward for the 3.4 per cent of total capital
formation that Japanese industry invests in pollution control, described by
the OECD as among the highest in the industrialised world.
Private companies account for the lion's share of this spending. Within
this, however, the chemicals industry spends far less than its foreign
competitors. Japan's chemical companies invested four per cent of annual
turnover on the environment in 1991, according to European chemicals
industry figures, compared with 10 per cent by their US counterparts and 12
per cent by European chemical producers.
Japanese companies also dump more industrial waste as a percentage of gross
domestic product than the OECD average, a mark of its relatively lax
industrial waste policy. It remains among the biggest users of agrochemicals
in the OECD, a mark of the need to maximise yield from scarce farmland.
That said, Japanese chemicals companies have made spectacular progress since
the traumatic environmental disasters of the 1950s and 1960s, which still
dog the industry's reputation.
Cases such as the Minamata disaster, where mercury was pumped into the sea
off southern Japan poisoning the people of a nearby fishing village, or the
Yokkaichi air pollution scandal, in which residents of an industrial town in
central Japan were made ill by air pollution from chemical plants, spurred
industry and government into action faster and earlier than their western
counterparts.
Those disasters led to tough legal controls on water and air pollution and
also taught industry that the costs of compensating victims far outweigh the
cost of prevention.
Chisso, the chemical company responsible for Minamata, could have avoided
the mercury disaster, if it had spent Y100m annually on pollution control,
estimates the government's environmental protection agency. Instead, Chisso
is still faced with an annual compensation bill of Y11.9bn, 100 times the
cost of prevention, it says.
As a result of the post-Minamata lesson, chemical accidents or labour
injuries in the Japanese chemicals companies are today low by international
standards. The average number of lay-offs lasting more than a year, caused
by injury, was 0.5 per 1m working hours in 1992, according to the Japan
Chemical Industry Association.
While the record has been good over the past 20 years, Japanese
environmental policy has barely evolved since the post-Minamata period,
argue critics such as Mr Ian Austin, the Tokyo-based director of Japan
business development at Dames &amp; Moore, the US environmental consultancy.
The outstanding example is the fate last November of the environmental
protection bill, watered down in response to pressure from business lobbies,
unwilling to take on extra costs at a time when the yen's strength is
harming their competitiveness.
The bill contained a general commitment to a health environment. But the
government quietly shelved two controversial provisions, contained in early
drafts and supported by the environment agency, for a tax on carbon dioxide
emissions and obligatory environment reports on new industrial projects.
The ministries of international trade and industry, transport, and
construction ministries, successfully lobbied for the removal of those
clauses on the grounds that they would hamper investment in new plant and
further stimulate the already worrying shift of industrial production out of
Japan to cheaper foreign locations. A Miti advisory panel warned that a
carbon tax would provoke an 'international migration of industry'.
Instead, the new law calls on 'businesses to assess the environmental impact
of a project and take proper consideration to conserve the environment'. It
also says that the government should 'make efforts to obtain the
understanding and co-operation of the people' when it sees the need to
introduce a carbon tax.
Such a tax is certainly not on the agenda of the present government. This is
not surprising, since Japan has yet to recover from the most severe
recession in the period since the Minamata disaster produced its salutary
awakening of environmental policy. It could be a sign of how environmental
policies take second place to economic survival during tough times.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (5): Worse than its bite - The
impact of new tax rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It is too early to measure the impact of the UK's new system of taxing the
company car benefit, implemented on April 6, but it is unlikely to be
revolutionary.
The new system, which replaces the scale charges based on engine size and
price thresholds, with a tax based on the list price of the car, was first
set out by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, in his March 1993 Budget
and was aimed at ending distortions in the new car market.
Since the measure is meant to be 'revenue neutral', for every employee who
finds he faces a higher tax burden, there should in theory be another paying
less tax as a result.
A revolution is not expected because the high increases in scale charges
over the past few years have already forced many company car drivers to
rethink the utility of taking the company car.
Moreover, the 1991 Budget which ushered in the requirement for employers to
pay national insurance contributions on car provision as well as the
recession, has prompted many companies to review their attitude towards the
cost of providing cars for employees.
A recent report by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, the employee benefits
consultancy, found that the proportion of employees earning between Pounds
15,000 and Pounds 25,000 and receiving a car dropped from 70 per cent in
1992 to 60 per cent in 1993. The trend was also noticeable, though less
marked, among those earning more than Pounds 25,000: 93.4 per cent received
a company car in 1993 compared to 94.5 per cent a year earlier.
The new taxation system has the virtue of relative simplicity. The employee
pays tax at his marginal rate, on 35 per cent of the list price of the car
the day before it was registered. This price must include VAT, delivery
charges, and accessories of Pounds 100 and over.
The status of personalised number plates, which had been in dispute, has
recently been clarified by the Inland Revenue which has decided that they do
not count as an accessory.
The list price is capped at Pounds 80,000 - more expensive cars are taxed as
though the price had been Pounds 80,000. Drivers covering 2,500-17,999
business miles are allowed a reduction of a third on their assessment, while
those covering more than 18,000 receive a discount of two-thirds.
There are also reductions for the age of the car. If the company car is four
or more years old at the end of the tax year, there is a further one-third
reduction on top of the deductions for business mileage.
The rules differ for classic cars or those without a list price. If a car is
15 years old or more at the end of the tax year, or has a market value of
Pounds 15,000 or more (which is higher than the manufacturer's list price
when the car was first registered), the price for tax purposes will be the
open market value of the car and its accessories.
Fuel provided for private use is taxed on the basis of the car's engine size
and whether it is petrol or diesel-powered. But there is no tax if the
employee pays for private motoring fuel himself.
So who are the winners and losers under the new system? A survey released
earlier this year by WF Corroon, an actuarial and benefits consultancy,
found that middle managers driving mostly Fords, Vauxhalls and Rovers
costing between Pounds 16,000 and Pounds 23,600 would lose the most under
the new system, with some paying as much as Pounds 600 extra tax. In
general, the losers are drivers who chose cars at the top of the old bands.
Sedgwick Noble Lowndes says that as a result of the new taxation system, it
expects to see 'a move to the more basic financially beneficial models,
without the tax-hungry extras, as long-overdue renewal dates are reached.'
It also believes that the trend 'may be particularly pronounced in companies
where a 'trade-down' option is provided and if employee demand for this
facility intensifies, then increasingly schemes must become more flexible to
include the choice to trade down or up.'
The new tax system is also expected to encourage more emp- loyers to provide
a cash alternative with a concomitant increase in the take-up of such
offers. However, Mr Paul Wigham of Price Waterhouse says: 'In our
experience, only a very small proportion of employees have opted for the
cash alternative although it is growing in popularity as companies are
offering slightly more.'
Take-up has been low because unless employers can make savings, they do not
want to be more generous than they have to be. Mr Wigham says: 'In general,
employers are pitching the cash alternative at about Pounds 1,000 to Pounds
1,500 less than the car would have cost them.'
It can be difficult to judge whether the amount of cash on offer is a good
offer or even a fair one. Mr Wigham suggests that: 'As a rule of thumb you
should calculate your annual mileage and check what the cost will be (the AA
and RAC publish mileage costs guides which take depreciation, insurance and
tax into account) and compare that with the after-tax increase in salary
being offered.'
However, the calculation is complicated by the difficulty of putting a price
on the convenience factor of driving a company car. Many employees find the
luxury of foregoing the hassle of arranging a replacement car or negotiating
with the insurance company after an accident, not to mention the convenience
of not having to shoulder the burden of an increased premium due to an
accident, an invaluable benefit.
In general however, those who are most likely to benefit by taking the cash
alternative are employees with business mileage of under 2,500 miles - the
pure 'perks' drivers. They will pay proportionately the largest amount of
tax, since they will not benefit from the mileage discounts. They are most
likely to see savings if they take the cash offer and then buy a cheaper car
for their personal use than the one they would have been offered by the
company.
Alternatively they could combine a smaller salary increase with an
interest-free loan from the employer to help with the purchase of a car. If
the car being bought is the company's, it would have to be purchased at
market value to avoid further tax. The loan benefit would not be taxed so
long as the loan is for a maximum of Pounds 5,000 and there are no other
outstanding loans from the employer.
The new tax system does not herald the demise of the company car, according
to Sedgwick Noble Lowndes: 'The wholesale removal of the company car as a
benefit is unlikely to become a widespread reality. As long as the car does
not become a financially unattractive proposition to the majority of
employees, it will still remain a benefit option in most organisations to
aid in attracting and retaining senior staff, even though the cost to
employers has significantly increased since mid-1992 due to the introduction
of national insurance contributions.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (2): 'Isolation is not strength' /
Charting a change of strategy among Europe's top manufacturers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The joint venture announced earlier this year between Mercedes-Benz, the
German luxury carmaker and SMH, the Swiss pioneer of cheap watches, to
develop a micro compact car is a dramatic sign of the radical changes of
strategy that are being embarked upon by Europe's executive carmakers.
Mercedes-Benz, perhaps the world's leading producer of executive and luxury
cars, is taking one of the most adventurous routes, as it maps out a future
as a maker of a full range of cars from flagship limousines to two-seater
micro city cars.
BMW, its arch rival, has previously built its reputation on a fierce
independence and a reluctance to enter alliances with any other automaker.
In a departure from corporate tradition, just as stunning as that of
Mercedes-Benz, it has moved recently to broaden substantially its industrial
base with the takeover of Rover group from British Aerospace.
Through the Pounds 800m acquisition of the leading UK vehicle maker it is
doubling its production capacity and has become the foremost European maker
of four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicles with Land Rover. It has acquired
several new brand-names - most importantly Rover and MG as well as Land
Rover - along with a position in the European market for small and
medium-sized front-wheel drive cars, and a complex ready-made relationship
with Honda, the Japanese carmaker.
With the marketplace fragmenting, BMW has accepted that it must move into
new segments to add to its niche of high-performance executive and luxury
cars. It could have continued to go it alone and develop the necessary
products itself, but that would have taken time and been much more
expensive. Instead, it has chosen the riskier fast track of acquisition.
It believes that with Rover it has also found a viable way of entering the
small car market without diluting its own precious brand image. Rover is to
be its centre for small car development. This will ensure BMW a presence in
this marketplace but will not put at risk the BMW brand name, says Mr Bernd
Pischetsrieder, management board chairman.
Volvo of Sweden, in the meantime, has been forced by rebellious shareholders
and reluctant senior management to forsake the merger route as its chosen
path towards future survival.
Its alliance with Renault, the French state-owned carmaker, was so
well-heralded that the final move to a complete merger had been taken for
granted. Much to the discomfiture of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, then Volvo
chairman, the alliance failed late last year, when it became clear that
leading Volvo shareholders would refuse to approve a merger.
The new board's strategy is to develop Volvo into a 'streamlined' company.
Non-core activities in food and pharmaceuticals are to be sold off to make
the automotive operations 'financially stable'.
Full-scale merger appears to have been ruled out by the Renault debacle but
according to Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo president, specific co-operative ventures
'will be natural elements of our operations.' Despite the failure of the
alliance, he says that it is still the case that 'in the automotive industry
isolation is not strength.'
Mr Gyll says that Volvo must 'intensify its efforts to find partners' in the
areas in which it operates, not least because the process of renewing its
product range 'must occur more rapidly than it has in the past'.
Amid all this turmoil in Europe the most surprising change of direction has
come from Mercedes-Benz, whose tradition had appeared to make it the least
flexible of the world's leading prestige carmakers and the most unlikely
candidate for re-thinking so radically the whole way it does business.
Mercedes-Benz has embarked on a far- reaching re-alignment of its product
strategy. It has decided to transform itself from 'a car manufacturer with a
long tradition in the luxury class' into 'an exclusive full-line
manufacturer offering high quality vehicles in all segments of the market.'
With astonishing frankness, it has accepted the unpalatable truth that its
luxury cars were 'over-engineered' and that if the company persisted with
that policy in developing new models, it would end up being 'priced out' of
world markets.
Mercedes-Benz's new strategy means that by the late 1990s it will have
launched a series of vehicles into new segments of the world market
including:
a multi-purpose vehicle, to rival models such as the Renault Espace,
a modern four-wheel drive sport/utility vehicle that will be assembled in a
new plant in the US,
a small family car sized between a Volkswagen Golf and a Ford Fiesta, and
a micro compact car, a two-seater for urban commuting, that it is developing
in the joint venture with SMH, the Swatch watchmaker.
Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, says of the so-called
'Swatchmobile': 'We intend to create a market segment which has hitherto not
existed in this form yet provides substantial growth potential . . . The
micro compact car is ideally suitable to re-define urban mobility.'
The car is being conceived partly as a second or third car for traditional
customers, but Mercedes-Benz also wants 'to appeal to new customer groups
which were not open for us in the past'.
In addition to the new product strategy Mercedes-Benz has embarked on a
'radical rethinking' of its production structure, says Mr Werner. It plans
to increase the share of its car production outside Germany to 10 per cent
in the medium term from only 2 per cent at present, with production growing
in such countries as the US, Mexico, South Korea and India.
It is cutting vertical integration - the level of in-house manufacturing -
from 45 to under 40 per cent by 1998 by making greater use of outside
components suppliers, and it is also ready to enter more co-operative
ventures with other vehicle makers and suppliers.
Mercedes passenger vehicle production is likely to jump to about 1m a year
by the late 1990s with the addition of the new vehicle ranges, from 482,000
last year. Its car production peaked at 598,000 in 1987.

 -Japanese feel the pressures of competition

<TEXT>
Life used to be straightforward for Japan's luxury car makers.
Merely by making highly reliable cars that exuded wealth they could keep
their wealthy customers happy and eager to order replacements every few
years.
But as the Japanese car market has matured, and economic and social changes
have affected customer tastes and market conditions, the environment for the
country's executive car makers has become considerably more demanding.
'In the past, a luxury car was known as the danna's, or master's, car,'
explains Mr Hajime Nanno, head of the domestic market forecast group at
Toyota. 'People who ordered executive cars just wanted the very best and
would buy the most expensive car from a catalogue without even seeing it.
They would just say give me the best car you have.
'Nowadays, people are more demanding,' Mr Nanno says. Rather than being
attracted simply by the trappings of wealth, such as leather-bound seats,
buyers of luxury cars in Japan are looking for a wider range of qualities
such as safety, comfort and ease of driving.
At the same time, Japanese consumers are becoming more demanding in terms of
price, forcing luxury car makers to rethink their pricing strategy.
The luxury car maket has not been unaffected by the cost-consciousness that
has pervaded buying habits in Japan since the years of asset inflation came
abruptly to an end.
Unlike the days when manufacturers could safely raise prices significantly
every year, in today's low-growth economy 'prices will have to be reasonably
set because incomes won't rise that much any more,' Mr Nanno says.
On both fronts, Japanese car makers face greater competition at home from
foreign car makers, which have started to become a growing force in Japan's
once protected domestic market.
Japanese car makers, which differentiated their luxury cars from those of
many western competitors by offering high quality luxury cars at lower
prices, are finding their strategy unravelling in the face of the high yen
and the aggressive pricing strategies of competitors in the sector.
German luxury car makers, for example, are able to appeal to Japanese
consumers' growing preference for cars which offer ease of driving, safety
and comfort due to their strong reputation for just those qualities.
Their prices, meanwhile, are falling to levels that bring them more directly
into competition with the luxury cars of domestic companies such as Toyota
and Nissan, due largely to the yen's rise. Many foreign car makers have also
adopted a strategy of taking advantage of Japan's low interest environment
to offer lower-interest loans.
'A new development in the luxury car market is the popularity of imported
cars due to the yen's rise,' Mr Nanno notes.
Neither is the challenge restricted to the home market. In the US, where
Japanese car makers made tremendous efforts to build up the image of their
luxury car lines as providing superior quality over established cars but at
lower prices, the yen's rise has dealt a significant blow.
As a result of the yen's rise, coupled with the German car makers' strategy
of lowering prices, a typical car from Toyota's luxury Lexus channel has
gone from Dollars 40,000 in the US to Dollars 50,000, while a comparable BMW
or Mercedes has gone the other way - from Dollars 60,000 or Dollars 70,000
to Dollars 50,000, Toyota says.
Japanese luxury car makers are full-line manufacturers which set out to win
over the owner-driver in search of a high quality car at a reasonable price,
rather than to target niche luxury markets.
'Our executives don't want to focus on high-profit low- volume cars. We
don't think of ourselves as competing directly with Mercedes-Benz or BMW,'
says Mr Nanno. But he admits, that as market conditions have changed, 'in
effect . . . we have to compete with them'.
The road ahead may seem bleak for Japan's luxury car makers. However, the
industry is confident that there are still great opportunities.
For one thing, while demand for luxury cars has declined amid Japan's car
market slump, the fall for luxury cars has not been particularly sharp when
compared with that for cars overall. The monthly average has fallen from a
peak of 124,000 in 1990 to 95,000 last year but remains well above the
75,000 average in 1987.
Moreover, the market share of luxury and large cars has grown steadily over
the past decade, from 28 per cent of the entire car market in the early
1980s to a peak of about 35 per cent in 1990, falling only moderately last
year to 33 per cent.
Toyota's Mr Nanno explains that people who buy executive cars in Japan tend
to be self-employed executives of companies who can charge the cost to
corporate expenses. Whereas corporations and self-employed executives make
up only about a quarter of the entire car market customer base, as a group
they comprise 55 per cent of the luxury car market, he points out.
As Japanese society ages, and as people come to expect a higher standard of
living, the chances are that the luxury car market will grow, rather than
shrink. 'More people will want to drive large cars that are spacious and
safe,' Mr Nanno says.
That may very well be the case. But it is also certain that competition for
a slice of that growing cake will be heated as more foreign car makers
target the Japanese market.
Both Mercedes-Benz and BMW are building their dealer networks in Japan,
while US car companies are also showing a greater eagerness than ever to
penetrate the Japanese market.
At the same time, Japanese luxury car makers face a difficult environment
overseas as the yen's strong rise has weakened the cost advantage that they
had in the US.
In order to maintain their reputation for offering high quality luxury cars
at reasonable prices, they will have to put greater efforts into reducing
the costs of the vehicles they manufacture in Japan, where labour costs are
among the highest in the world.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (4): The Revenue gnashes its teeth
/ An examination of UK suppliers' changing price strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car makers were uneasy two years ago when the Inland Revenue unveiled its
proposals for a new company car tax regime, based on a simple percentage of
cars' list prices.
In previous years considerable effort had gone into producing 'tax break
specials' under the old tax regime, which heavily favoured high-earning
executives compared with lower-paid essential users of company cars.
The old system, based on price and engine capacity bands, meant that an
executive driving a highly-specified 'perk' car of fractionally under 2
litres and Pounds 19,250 paid only the same personal tax on his company car
as an essential user of a utilitarian vehicle of just over 1.4 litres,
provided their marginal tax rates were the same.
Under the new system, effective from April 6, the same executive would have
to swap his Pounds 19,000 car for a model costing a mere Pounds 12,500 so
that the tax bill would be the same. Car makers feared that many executives
would be tempted to downsize and downprice, thus sapping revenue from one of
the most profitable sectors of the new car market. Vehicles with many
executive 'extras' provide disproportionately higher profit per unit
compared with mainstream fleet cars.
It will take two or three years before the effect of the new system, in
terms of vehicle choice, can be fully assessed. Nevertheless, there is
little sign so far of executives opting for less tax-burdensome cars,
according to Mr Michael Banner, Vauxhall's director of fleet sales, and
researchers at Henley Management College who have studied the executive and
fleet car market on Vauxhall's behalf.
While some preference is being shown for smaller cars - but only ones
equipped to executive standards - there is only a very slight trend towards
downpricing, the researchers maintain.
Mr Banner observes that 'the typical executive driving a car priced at the
old Pounds 19,250 tax threshold has looked at the changes, realised that his
current car is going to cost him only another Pounds 20 or Pounds 30 a month
and has decided 'I'll cope'.'
Similar views are being voiced by other manufacturers. But that does not
mean that significant changes in manufacturers' model mixes and marketing
policies are not under way. One major effect of the new tax system was to
eliminate entirely the engine capacity bands which previously had
discriminated severely against larger units.
Particularly badly hit under the old system was the diesel engine. Though
likely to be favoured by many fleet managers because of its one-third
greater fuel economy compared with a petrol unit, it typically reqires
larger capacity to provide comparable on-road performance.
The new tax system is already seeing the introduction of new versions of
mainstream business cars with larger, high-performing V6 engines of 2.5
litres, as well as giving a further boost to the buoyant diesel car sector,
sales of which in the first four months of this year were running 60 per
cent higher than in the same period of 1993.
The diesel sales go on despite two learned reports in the UK, which argue
that diesel exhaust emissions - including particulates suspected of causing
cancer - could contaminate the air in cities if the diesel car population
continues to expand.
One in four new cars sold in the UK is now a diesel. Business car users and
fleet managers, increasingly impressed by the cost advantages, appear to be
taking comfort from the fact that commercial vehicles - many of them elderly
buses - account for at least two-thirds of the diesel exhaust pollution
being created in urban areas.
It is not only at the Pounds 19,250 tax break point that the tax system
changes are having an effect. The scrapping of the second threshold of
Pounds 29,000, above which an executive's personal tax on his company car
rose sharply, has eliminated model range 'bunching' around the breakpoint
while the capping of the new system at a Pounds 60,000 list price means that
the expensive car makers such as Rolls-Royce and Aston Martin are not
significantly disadvantaged.
It is in pricing structures and strategies that the new tax system has had
some of its most notable effects - at least in terms of the notional prices
which are paid for executives' cars. Traditional UK pricing policies - with
a few exceptions such as Mercedes and BMW - have been based on a relatively
high list price which few customers in the business sector actually pay.
There are widespread discounts - 30 per cent or more in a few notorious
deals to particularly large fleet operators. The new list price-based tax
regime makes such policies untenable because they would maximise an
executive's personal tax burden. So manufacturers have been cutting the
profit margins they allow their dealers. Once typically 15-16.5 per cent,
plus the chance of cash bonuses from manufacturers for meeting sales
targets, these 'official' margins have been cut to 10 per cent and in some
cases - over the past few weeks in the executive sector - to 5 per cent.
Indeed, Vauxhall's new Omega executive car range was launched with a 5 per
cent margin. In a few cases, the margin has been dispended with altogther in
favour of a fixed 'handling' charge payable to the dealer. Some Renault and
Volvo models fall into this category. So do some of the cheapest Rover 800
models with a Pounds 500 fee, while Ford is allowing a Pounds 1,500 handling
fee on its US-built Probe coupe and is giving only a token margin on its
Granada/Scorpio executive cars.
The changes have been accompanied by much trumpeting about lower prices.
This is convenient in view of the pan-EU car price comparisons now published
twice a year at the behest of the European Commission, which wants to see
price convergence between EU new car markets and tends to regard the UK as a
high-priced market.
But transaction prices have not changed a lot because dealers were already
giving away much of their official margin and relying on incentive bonuses
from manufacturers to make a return on mainstream executive cars. They now
merely have less room to haggle.
The approach does mean a lower company car tax burden for executives - and a
lower tax take for the Inland Revenue. At the moment, the Revenue can only
stand by gnashing its teeth. How it might react, in the longer term, to an
entrenched system of zero profit margins and 'handling charges' is another
matter altogether.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (3): Disclosure is
the best policy - How greater candour can win public trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE WARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago, Bryan Sanderson, BP Chemicals chief executive, told his
executives to earn the public's trust so that the company could keep its
licence to operate.
Similar messages have gone out in other parts of the chemical industry, with
companies telling employees, neighbours, customers and other influential
groups about the safety aspects of their operations.
International chemical companies now routinely reveal their progress in
improving environmental performances. Most publish annual environmental
performance reports although no common format for the industry exists.
Indeed, the glossy brochures and reports that have emerged so far have been
of varying scope and detail.
BP Chemicals publishes an annual report which details all its emissions from
its leading sites in the US and Europe. ICI sens every shareholder and
employee an annual corporate environment report, which contains total ICI
emissions, although specific emissions are available on request, while each
site is encouraged to local report for its neighbours.
'The site reports are very important indeed. They are  .. a fundamental part
of the environmental communications programme,' says Dr Richard Robson.
It can also help win support from some unexpected quarters. Friends of the
Earth campaigner Guy Linley-Adams, commenting on ICI's Teesside report which
revealed a 57 per cent cut in the site's emissions, told a local newspaper:
'All companies should produce reports like this. ICI is ahead of the game in
that respect.'
Others prefer to use indices developed by the French multinational
Rhone-Poulenc and adopted by the UK Chemical Industries Association to
demonstrate an aggregate UK industry performance. They are used to identify
trends rather than detail actual volumes of waste emissions.
Critics of this system claim that it can mask serious problems.
Rhone-Poulenc, however, believes that they can give managers an efficient
measure of how well environmental management is being carried out. In the
base year, all emissions are considered by the nature of the hazard and
method of disposal, then each year the environmental impact of waste in that
year can be compared as a percentage of the base year.
Ironically, despite the large sums spent by some companies on producing
attractive reports, it is surprising how few bother to find out whether they
are providing what the public wants.
Last year, ICI asked readers what they thought of its corporate
environmental report and then tailored the subsequent report according to
their replies. 'The messages were clear: keep it simple, keep it short, make
it easy to understand, put detailed data into appendices at the back, and
don't make it too glossy,' Robson says.
Listening to the audience is a key part of the communication process, says
Claude Fussler, vice president for environment, health and safety at Dow
Europe, adding that Responsible Care 'is first and foremost a
performance-driven programme. it is not a public relations exercise. Our
efforts to engage the public in dialogue are an attempt to gain an
outside-in perspective of our company and its performance.'
Dow has imported into Europe the Community Advisory Panel (CAP) concept from
the US. These are volunteer advisory groups comprising citizens from
communities neighbouring a facility. They tend to meet regularly to discuss
plant operations, community involvement, emergency preparedness,
environmental issues and other subjects related to the site.
Dow Europe's first advisory panel was set up at its German site in
Rheinmunster. Stade, also in Germany , has also followed suit forming a CAP
last year, while its sites in Barry, South Wales, and Tessenderlo, Belgium,
are members of joint public panels in their respective communities.
CAPs can be useful allies, notes John Bishop, BP Chemicals general manager
communications. 'A CAP at our Lima site in the US called on the US
environmental protection agency to grant the company a licence to operate
one particular process that was under investigation.'
But even without CAPs, the company has been able to win support from the
communities surrounding its sites. A survey commissioned by BP Chemicals and
conducted by independent pollsters found that 74 per cent of the company's
neighbours in Grangemouth regarded the company as trustworthy. This compares
very well with surveys of the industry's public acceptability in the US and
the UK.
Despite these efforts chemical companies still have an image problem,
although it seems to be improving, according to surveys canvassed recently
by the US Chemical Manufacturers Association and Britain's Chemical
Industries Association.
A survey conducted by US pollster Roper Starch Worldwide late last year
suggested that US public concern for the environment may have peaked and
that enthusiasm for regulating business may be waning. The pollsters found
that 44 per cent of those surveyed had a favourable view of the chemical
industry - up 7 points from an all time low rating in 1992.
A similar trend may be occurring in the UK. According to a survey by
pollsters Mori on behalf of the Chemical Industries Association, more
British people say they have a favourable impression of the chemical
industry rather than an unfavourable one. Mori reports that the 29 per cent
of those polled gave a favourable view of the chemical industry, eight
points more than in 1992, while 28 per cent harboured an unfavourable
attitude, 2 per cent increase on the previous year.
In 1991, only 18 per cent viewed the British chemical industry favourably,
while 27 per cent said they had an unfavourable impression. Although the
industry might be pleased at the companies may be able (it was the first
time since 1988 that favourable replies were in the majority) has its
standing is well below 1979 when approvals reached received almost 50 per
cent.
The European chemical industry spends more than Pounds 2bn, or 12 per cent
of its total capital expenditure , on the environment. British companies
spend 16 per cent. However, many UK executives wonder what else they must do
to win public approval.
The leaders believe the answer lies in better communications, although, as
the CIA advises its members, 'good communications can never compensate for a
poor environmental or health and safety performance'.
Industry executives believe that the better ratings are due to the
industry's candour. However, some companies believe the industry's story
would be more credible if it could be verified by independent third parties.
But while the industry agrees on the need for Responsible Care, there are
differences about eco-audits and verification.
Dow Europe's Fussler and Norsk Hydro's public affairs director Stein Iver
Aarsaether support third party verification of the environmental reports,
but not at any cost. 'It is important to have credibility and consider how
best to achieve that cost effectively,' says Aarsaether.
Fussler says: 'Despite all the built-in controls, including supervision by
the authorities, validation by a competent outside firm may provide an
additional layer of confidence for the reader.'
Louis Jourdan, senior director, technical affairs at Cefic, the European
Chemical Industry Council, says that the European Commission is keen to go
beyond the voluntary efforts of the industry.
'In the EU we will have third party verification either through voluntary
acceptance of the Commission's eco-management and audit scheme or by
certification of an environment management system standard.'
Cefic is trying to encourage all its members to establish systems that will
allow them to join the EU's environmental management and auditing scheme
(EMAS). Many companies appear more amenable to have certification of the
methods they use to conduct their own environmental audits than to having
third parties repeating the process through an audit. Says one industry
executive: 'Anyone who is responsible and providing the information would
not knowingly provide data that are wrong.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (2): Touchstone of
an industrial revolution - Responsible Care, born in Canada, is turning into
a world-wide code of practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE WARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Win over the workforce and you will have done much of the hard work on
implementing Responsible Care, the industry's international code of practice
on environmental protection.
That's the advice of Ray Grainger, the UK Chemical Industries Association
director of Responsible Care and sector businesses. He adds: 'While there
are a number of important target audiences for the Responsible Care message
of improved environmental performance, the employees can be a company's best
ambassadors and advocates.'
It is hardly surprising that, as a North American creation, it is the
Canadian and US industries that are blazing the trail to Responsible Care.
Initiated in Canada in the mid-1980s and embraced by the US in 1988,
Responsible Care is now catching on throughout the rest of the world, South
Africa being the latest to join the converts.
Canada has in place all its codes of management practice, and clearly most
US companies are in the advanced stages of implementing the programme.
Indeed, the US Chemical Manufacturers Association is pushing ahead with
third party verification of management systems and has said the companies
that fail to implement the programme properly would eventually be candidates
for expulsion from the Association.
Responsible Care reflects a cultural revolution that has taken place within
the chemical industry.
The glossy environmental brochures that are now being published by the major
chemical companies would not have been possible five to 10 years ago. Some
chemical companies shied away from providing what they regarded as sensitive
information, others argued that regulatory compliance was enough, while
others said the information would be far too technical to broadcast.
However, it soon became clear to the most far sighted industry executives
that there was a danger that companies could lose their licence to operate
if they did not demonstrate a commitment to improving environmental
performances. Consequently, the concept of Responsible Care was developed to
provide a framework for companies to achieve policies of self improvement in
key areas of safety, health and the environment.
Success, however, requires support from all in the company and this is not
so easy to achieve. Some sections of the chemical company are regarded as
more difficult to convince of the merits of Responsible Care.
'It is easier to convince chief executives and those involved in direct
implementation such as those workers in production. More difficult is the
middle management which tends to be more conservative than other sections of
the workforce,' an industry executive noted.
Surveys done by the US Chemical Manufacturers Association and others in the
US are sending out confused signals. A poll conducted by the CMA of
shopfloor workers suggested that half those polled actually doubted the
industry's commitment to Responsible Care and that one third claimed to be
unfamiliar with Responsible Care.
Yet a poll of top executives conducted by Chemical Week and Andersen
Consulting came up with greater support for the programme. More than two
thirds of executives polled said that meeting Responsible Care objectives
will make a significant contribution to company success, and that their
companies would meet or surpass those objectives.
Just over half the sample agreed that Responsible Care was having an impact
on the company's environmental performance and the public image with
neighbours had improved. Only one in 10 executives said they believed that
Responsible Care would be more effective if enforced by regulations, with
almost three quarters opposing the view.
Part of the problem may be that employees are aware of the good practices
associated with Responsible Care. It's just that they haven't got used to
the label yet. 'Responsible Care is consistent with what we do. It might not
be clear what the codes are called but the workers do recognise that there
has been a sea change of working practices and know what to do,' explains
Charles Keene, of the Swiss multinational Ciba.
'Years ago people thought environmental management was something to do with
the environment department but now it's all embracing and influences all
decisions throughout the company.'
This view is supported by Math Heynens, head of DSM's corporate
environmental department. 'At the manual level there are still some people
that haven't made the link between our safety, health and environment
practices and Responsible Care. Although there are plenty of Responsible
Care themes in our own care system we are looking at both to see where there
are parallels.'
John Bishop at BP Chemicals believes that staff education and training is
one answer to Responsible Care recognition. In the most recent employee
attitude survey, 74 per cent of staff agreed with the statement that BP
Chemicals has a clear environment policy - with 10 per cent disagreeing. On
the question of awareness of Responsible Care, 55 per cent of BP staff
claimed to be aware of the programme to at least some extent.
'I was pleased with how high the awareness is. The process of linking
health, safety and the environment with responsible care has been going for
some years and we are now explicitly trying to make that connection.'
Full success, however, will require that connection to be made. Cefic senior
director Louis Jourdan believes that industry's commitment to Responsible
Care is borne out by the support it has in spite of the recession.
'Responsible Care, even in the recessionary times of the past few years, has
been maintained as a high priority. It has not been relegated to the
backburner.'
He concedes, however, that the speed of implementation in Europe is
variable. The UK is way ahead of the rest of Europe with the Chemical
Industries Association taking a very active role in promoting the programme
both within its membership and in public.
Although still in its early days, Federchimica, the Italian Chemical
Industries Association, has managed to get a great deal of media coverage
for the programme.
France's trade association, UIC, on the other hand, is taking a more timid
approach, while VCI, the German association, considers Responsible Care to
be an internal matter for companies and has not been too public in its own
pronouncements.
Dow Europe's Claude Fussler believes that continental Europeans find it
harder to embrace the basic tenets of a voluntary system that seeks
continual improvement than the North Americans and British. 'The
Anglo-Saxons are able to capture the mood for such continual improvement
more easily.'
Fussler is clearly a vocal advocate of Responsible Care and is seeking to
introduce the concept to Dow Europe's customers.
'Our programme Responsible Care in action has been designed to help our
customers assess their environmental performance and develop plans for
continuous improvement,' he says. Among the areas targeted for improvement
are product stewardship and pollution prevention.
Responsible Care is not without its critics. Dr Michael Braungart of the
Hamburg Environment Institute believes the chemical industry is missing a
great opportunity to show what a valuable contribution chemists can make to
society. 'Responsible Care is almost a religion to companies they are
addicted to it yet all it will do is shore up old products. What society
needs is new products that are greener.'
He suggests that companies developing technologies for plastics recycling
are wasting the talents of their scientists and their money.
'They are investing in high tech solutions for low tech products.' Clean
technologies, he says, must embrace a new business approach. Focus should be
on providing services rather than selling products. 'With Responsible Care
there is no incentive for companies to produce better products.'
He cites as an example the use of chromium in leather tanning. In the last
century, leather was tanned using oak extracts and the shoes were
recyclable. Use of chromium means recycling is not possible unless expensive
chromium extraction procedures are employed.
Rather than investing in such recovery technology, Braungart thinks a more
sustainable solution would be to make a synthetic chemical that mimics the
action of the oak extract, provide better quality shoes that can be easily
recycled. 'The chemical industry has the potential to provide many
solutions.'
In a bid to explore the potential of clean technologies, waste minimisation
projects and other pollution prevention schemes, Cefic has been acting as a
catalyst in the establishment of research and development consortia in the
areas of sustainable technology.
So far, Cefic's Dr David Bricknell has managed to get companies to agree in
principle to the idea of cooperating with other companies and academic
researchers in pre-competitive R&amp;D and select some potential areas for work.
Possible projects that could emerge from this Sustech programme include
waste minimisation technologies embracing internal process recycling, new
process technologies based on biotechnology and the development of tools for
environmental management such as product design, life cycle assessment and
improvement.
'Introduction of product stewardship measures - that is, the management of
safety, health and environmental impact of products from their development,
production and use to disposal - is one of the most difficult features of
Responsible Care. 'We have to know more about what happens when customers
dispose of our products after they have finished with them,' explains Ciba's
Keene.
Responsible Care could, however, come to grief at the hands of the
Commission's competition directorate, DG IV. 'We have been informed recently
that DG IV is against voluntary proposals because they are worried they may
have anti-trust implications. A voluntary industry/government initiative in
Denmark on volatile organic compound emissions is now being investigated by
DG IV officials. It is possible that Responsible Care could suffer the same
fate,' Jourdan warned.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (1): Traditional concept challenged
 -Sales could dip as executives opt for smaller, more flexible - but still
well-equipped - cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's executive car industry has entered a new age of uncertainty.
Even the traditional concept of the 'executive' car, as being a large,
well-equipped, swift and silent saloon carrying up to five people on
business, is under challenge.
If predictions by the Economist Intelligence Unit, DRI McGraw Hill and other
forecasters prove correct, sales of this category of vehicle in Europe will
decline by up to one-fifth between now and the end of the century.
In unit terms that would mean a sales drop of more than 130,000 units
annually from the nearly 840,000 sold last year - a considerable blow to
specialists in the sector such as Germany's Mercedes-Benz.
In this scenario, part of the decline will be caused by
environmentally-motivated taxation and other legislation encouraging users
to opt for smaller - but still well-equipped - cars.
Yet more will be accounted for by users opting for different types of
vehicle. They will still be capable of performing the same basic function.
But they will allow greater flexibility of use, or simply allow a user or
owner to make a more overt 'statement' about his or her lifestyle.
Within these categories, by far the fastest growth is forecast for the
'MPVs' (multi-purpose vehicles) which most of the leading car makers are
rushing to bring to market.
Typified by the Renault Espace in Europe and Ford's new Windstar and
Chrysler's Voyager in North America, they have seven or eight seats but
drive like cars and can be as well-equipped as any saloon. The EIU's own
forecast is that their European sales will more than triple to well over
half-a-million by the end of the decade, compared with 142,000 last year.
Peugeot and Fiat are launching a joint venture vehicle in the sector, as are
Ford and Volkswagen.
Four-wheel-drive 'lifestyle' leisure vehicles such as Land Rover's Discovery
are also providing an acceptable alternative to the conventional executive
car, although there is much more caution among forecasters as to whether, by
the late 1990s, they may turn out to have proved a relatively short-term
'cult.' Both types of vehicle reflect the breaking up of the world's vehicle
market into an ever-growing number of niches made possible by flexible
manufacturing systems and working processes.
But the industry's uncertainty is being caused by other, no less important
factors than consumer preference for its products:
For the big Japanese car makers such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda, whose
executive and luxury car brands - Lexus, Infiniti and Acura, respectively -
are produced entirely in Japan, the strength of the yen is causing severe
pricing difficulties in overseas markets, particularly North America, which
absorbs more executive and luxury cars than anywhere else in the world. Even
little more than a year ago, many industry analysts believed the Japanese
makers' advance into the executive and luxury sectors would prove all but
unstoppable. Not only has the advance been slowed for hard financial
reasons; some analysts are starting to maintain that the Japanese industry
is running out of impetus in the key areas of design and development - 'some
Japanese companies seem to be in trouble, not just financially but in their
ability consistently to design new models which customers find really
attractive,' maintain Booz Allen consultants Mark Snowdon and Norbert
Wittemann in a new paper on the future of automotive innovation.
Japan's problems have coincided with a resurgence of North America's
industry which has occurred with a rapidity and strength that few would have
predicted at the start of the 1990s.
At that time Chrysler was nearly bankrupt and General Motors was in crisis
resolved only by a boardroom coup. This year the collective earnings of
Chrysler, GM and Ford are likely to top Dollars 10bn and with a highly
competitive dollar, they are looking for direct exports in the executive
sector as well as supplying the market with products made by their European
subsidiaries. Ford, for example, is tapping Europe's growing executive coupe
market with the US-designed and built Probe.
With a growing array of sophisticated vehicles like the Lincoln Town Car,
the indigenous US car makers are recapturing ground previously lost to the
prestige Japanese makes. Sales of prestigious European marques like Mercedes
and BMW have begun a recovery in North America.
'The Japanese under-estimated the speed and ability of US companies to
respond to their problems. Meanwhile, their own responses to the high yen
and years of depressed financial performance have been inadequate, leaving
them vulnerable to further inroads once American producers modernise their
cars,' according to Ms Maryann Keller, a well-known motor industry analyst
with Furman Selz.
Despite their revived fortunes, the US 'big three' insist that they will not
rest on their laurels and that much must still be done if they are not once
again to be left behind as Japan's economic fortunes recover and the
challenge from other Asian countries grows.
Some of the actions in train are set to have a structural impact on the
European industry. Ford, in one of the biggest reorganisations in its
history, is forming itself into several global product divisions. Ultimate
responsibility for the design and development of large cars, for example, is
to rest in the US, while European operations will lead small and medium car
development.
Thus, while Ford chairman Mr Alex Trotman promises that Jaguars will be
designed mainly in the UK, it has nevetheless become part of the 'world'
large cars division.
The landscape of the executive car industry in Europe has changed in other
ways in recent months. Mercedes, already seeking to escape Germany's high
costs with car and four-wheel-drive plants in the US and Mexico, is further
developing its plans to enter the small cars sector with a luxury
'supermini,' and in a radical new joint venture to produce cheap city cars
with the Swiss Swatch concern.
BMW, in a bold move which turned it, at a stroke, into a 1m units-plus a
year group with instant access to wholly complementary front-wheel-drive and
four-wheel-drive sectors, has bought up the UK's Rover Group to the chagrin
of Rover's Japanese partner, Honda.
Now that emotions have calmed, there is talk of possible three-way
collaboration between the groups - a development with as yet incalculable
potential impact on the shape of the executive car industry.
The acquisition provided ammunition for industry analysts who argue that
there is a much rationalisation yet to come in the European industry, and
that it still has too many players. The collapse of the planned merger
between Swedish executive car maker Volvo and Renault of France at the start
of this year shows that such a process is likely to be slow and painful. And
some of the players, despite heavy losses, make plain that they have no
intention of giving up.
Fiat, for example, will shortly begin a big relaunch of its Alfa Romeo
marque throughout Europe, through an expanded dealer network and with an
extensive array of new products. In September it will also be launching an
entirely new Lancia executive car, also the precursor to a complete renewal
of the Lancia range. If, as some industry analysts maintain, they represent
a 'last throw of the dice' to maintain Fiat's long term survival in the
executive car industry, then it is a very expensive one. The total
investment programmes total more than L40,000bn (Dollars 24.95bn).
On car prices, meanwhile, there is pressure from the EU Commission for
greater price harmonisation within Europe, as well as a growing awareness by
consumers - as highlighted in a study of Japanese, US and European market
prices by the Euromotor consultancy - that European prices overall are high
compared with other developed markets.
The suspicion is growing that consumers are having to foot excessive bills
for a European car manufacturing industry still struggling for global
competitiveness.
It will not easily be allayed.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (1): The day of the
lawyers has arrived - After decades of assaults by lobbyists, chemical
companies' biggest headache is now the mass of laws curbing their operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fear is an important factor in the chemicals industry's management of
environmental matters. Industry leaders and their companies can face vast
liability suits if there is an accident. Even everyday operations can become
bad publicity.
Some of these fears have begun to fade in the mid-1990s. In their place is
the spectre of being overwhelmed by national and international legislation.
Chemicals companies already employ thousands of people in the environmental
monitoring and control of plant and processes. Yet the pace of introduction
of new laws is undiminished. Executives are caught between the need to
demonstrate that they are cleaning up their businesses and the desire to
limit the administrative burden that this requires.
A decade ago, the agenda was set by the lobby and pressure groups such as
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. They dogged chemicals manufacturers,
pointing an accusing finger at smokestacks, dumped by-products and river
discharges.
Although the industry was jolted, its solution was in the end simple: create
a department whose job it was to fight back in the propaganda war.
The result was a whole series of initiatives ranging from case studies of
substances once dumped but now used productively, to the creation of the
'Responsible Care' movement - a voluntary programme covering health, safety
and the environment - now embraced by virtually the entire European
chemicals industry. 'We initially resented the obligation for publicity,'
says Mr Michael LaGraff, general manager for health, safety and environment
at BP Chemicals. 'But now we can demonstrate our progress.'
The old publicity machine still requires oiling. But individual feel-good
stories have become the environmental equivalent of motherhood and apple
pie, and everyone has them.
Most large companies can point to impressive track records in cutting
emissions and recycling waste, and they publicise them in glossily produced
reports.
But today the departments devoted to generating a response to pressure
groups have largely gone. The teams of specialists have been dispersed.
Managing emissions has become an everyday part of general management.
The pressure groups' legacy is the determination of politicians to legislate
and regulate the industry. That means that chemicals companies are
increasingly turning for help to lawyers and government affairs experts
rather than public relations executives.
At the top of the European list of priorities is a proposed directive from
the European Commission largely based on the UK's 1990 Environment
Protection Act (EPA).
The UK is the model because the EPA introduced the concept of integrated
pollution control, the notion that it is not enough to legislate for the
reduction of emissions of one kind or another. If airborne emissions are cut
but at the same time water discharges increase, the object of pollution
control legislation is not achieved. The solution is to integrate the
monitoring control of chemicals plants, rather than to look at each
substance produced individually.
Under UK law, 'you have to formalise your systems with regard to the
environment,' says Mr Neil Budworth, safety officer at the UK operations of
German chemicals company Bayer. 'You have to take into account all
emissions, where they go, how they are controlled, what the management
systems are and what the history of complaints is.'
The company compiles a report that includes not only these details but
carefully thought out proposals for controlling the emissions. The report is
submitted to the UK government for the proposals to be approved, or
otherwise. Once authorisation is secured, it must be followed by quarterly
monitoring of the plant and the deposition of information for public
inspection.
The task is enormously complex, says Mr Lindsay Fortune, head of health,
safety and the environment at chemicals company Courtaulds. 'You are right
at the fringes of science. Sometimes the legislation requires you to do work
that there is no science for.'
He gives several examples of questions whose answers have yet to be
clarified fully. How should emission limits relate to the quality of the
environment? How should trigger points change with local population density?
If discharges are to be made into rivers, how should limits vary according
to the capacity of the river to carry the effluent away? In air emissions,
how should limits vary according to the way hill and mountain ranges and
climate conspire to concentrate or disperse materials?
The industry's concerns about how such legislation works are not limited to
the scientific. The costs involved are of increasing concern: chemicals
companies already spend up to seven per cent of sales on health, safety and
environmental matters.
'There are more than 300 environmental directives or laws already at the EU
level alone. Between one and two per cent of the workforce in chemicals
companies is concerned with the regulations now,' says Mr Louis Jourdan,
director of technical affairs at the Brussels-based European industry
organisation, Cefic.
Rising costs are more than a matter of the quantity of laws enacted. In the
UK, companies should control emissions using the 'best available technology
not entailing excessive cost', says Ms Tamar Posner, executive director
responsible for health, safety and the environment regulation at the UK
Chemical Industries Association. But the proposed European directive does
not specify that or say how costs should be considered, she says.
'This is the biggest issue in the European directive', says Courtaulds' Mr
Fortune. Conforming to the rules in the UK is expensive enough. Even
compiling a report for the UK government 'takes of the order of six
man-months to prepare. Each site typically needs 10,' he says.
Yet this concern over costs sits awkwardly with the chemicals industry's
acknowledgement that laws are needed. 'These laws are not in principle a bad
idea,' says the Chemical Industries Association's Ms Posner. 'But what's
happening is too much. The laws are not wrong, undesirable or unnecessary.
But they are coming at such a pace that it makes it difficult to regulate
and implement them. In 1993 alone there were about 40 EU instruments being
adopted or going through development.'
This view is underlined at the European level. Mr Jourdan of Cefic says 'We
like the (proposed) directive. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with it.
But it is too detailed. There are provisions for the classification of
substances produced in very small amounts for research and development -
they are not going to be spread over fields and rivers.'
The alternative, according to Cefic, is a voluntary scheme along the lines
of the Responsible Care programme. 'Ninety per cent of actions in a chemical
plant will remain unregulated anyway,' says Mr Jourdan. 'We want to replace,
pilot or complement regulations with a voluntary agreement.'
Nevertheless, the industry and its representative bodies know that they will
probably not get their way. The laws are more likely to get tougher and more
complicated than simpler. One of their greatest fears is that the European
Commission will look favourably on the US systems of a Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI), in which every company provides exhaustive details of
substances released.
Whatever ends up in the directive, the industry sees it as the start of yet
more work. 'The next stage will be implementing the whole thing,' says Mr
Fortune.
The industry is determined to lobby Brussels in its attempt to limit or at
least delay the impact of the next wave of regulation, but it is preparing
for a sharp increase in its workload anyway.
The lobbying will continue because companies face the need to allocate
responsibilities, define practices, identify procedures and find the
resources for implementing and maintaining environmental management, says Mr
Jourdan. 'All of this needs a structure. We are asking for a pause in the
production of legislation. Our job used to be easy, it was about emission
limits. Now it is about standards and principles.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Zeneca upbeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca advanced 10 to 722p ahead of a significant
presentation of one of its new products and a broker recommendation.
Zeneca announced shortly before the market closed that it was holding a
presentation to leading psychiatrists on the results of clinical trials for
its new schizophrenia treatment Seroquel. In the announcement the company
said the drug was an important addition to treatment in an area of 'high
unmet medical needs'.
Stockbroker Greig Middleton also published a note recommending the stock.
Analyst Ms Julia Dickson said: 'There are good drugs for treating this
disease but they all have side effects. It looks as if this is efficacious
and does not have side effects.'
She added that last week's figures from chemicals group BTP had indicated
that recessionary conditions were over 'in every geographical area'.
Greig Middleton advises a switch out of Wellcome, which it sees as
overvalued by more than 100p. It believes suggestions that Wellcome has a
take-out price of around 900p a share are vastly optimistic. 'The recent
acquisition of Syntex by Roche was priced at 2.5 times historic sales; an
equivalent multiple would value Wellcome at only 589p,' said the
stockbroker. Wellcome ended 6 higher at 617p
Elsewhere, leading pharmaceuticals were driven higher by a strong
performance in the futures market. Glaxo added 10 at 553p and SmithKline
Beecham 'A' 9 at 409p.
Stocks with a heavy profile in the US market resisted the weakness in the US
dollar yesterday as they were supported by technical trading. Reuters
Holdings, the news and electronic information agency, shed just a penny to
438p.
The regional electricity stocks made further rapid progress as the market
continued to respond to the recent and more positive shift in expectations
about the forthcoming distribution review and the latest excellent dividend
announcements in the sector.
Eastern Electricity forged ahead 27 to 614p after the 19.8 per cent increase
in the dividend, which was well in excess of market forecasts, while
Northern, which lifted its dividend payment by 15.8 per cent, rose the same
amount to 670p. Other recs were also heavily supported, with South Western,
reporting this morning, up 17 at 601p.
Newspaper shares marked time as the selling prompted by the recent cuts in
cover prices dried up and marketmakers sat back to wait for the next set of
circulation figures.
June sales figures are expected at the end of next week and will give an
indication of whether newspapers, especially the mid-market tabloids which
have resisted the cuts, have held their ground.
However, the figures will represent only 10 days of the new regime and
analysts said the market would probably await the next set of figures in
early August before the price war is ratcheted up to a new intensity.
Telegraph shares dipped 6 to 379p, but Daily Mail and General Trust 'A' held
at 913p, United Newspapers, owner of the Daily Express, added 8 at 511p and
Mirror Group Newspapers firmed a penny to 127p.
Property shares powered ahead as the market latched on to the recent
upgrades in forecasts for commercial property values. With added support
from a strong gilts market, British Land was the sector's star performer as
the shares climbed 20 to 389p. Land Securities advanced 14 to 622p and
Brixton Estates 8 to 193p.
Positive sentiment for property stocks helped boost transport and property
group P&amp;O. The shares gained 18 to 640p.
Industrial group Charter was one of the day's best performing stocks. The
company announced it was paying Pounds 260m for Esab Group, the Swedish
welding equipment producer. The shares jumped 51 to 714p as the market
celebrated the purchase, which is to be partly funded by a one-for-four
convertible rights issue at 560p a unit. Mr Andrew Mitchell at Smith New
Court said the acquisition was 'made at the right time in the cycle and it
will be earnings enhancing'.
Insurance broker Lloyd Thompson fell 45 to 185p as the firm warned that
profits would be hit by lower interest rates and the fall in government
bonds over the past quarter.
Conglomerate Tomkins eased a penny to 214p on speculation that it might
launch a bid for food manufacturer Northern Foods, which appreciated 6 to
208p. Tomkins already owns baker RHM.
Broker recommendations in the US helped British Airways rise 9 to 376p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel underperformed the market, firming only a
penny to 272p, on reports that the Eurostar passenger train service which is
due to start at the end of this month will be delayed until the autumn.
Rolls-Royce gained 7 1/2 at 177p after Henderson Crosthwaite urged investors
to buy the stock, citing the prospect of a Saudi engine order in the near
term. TI eased 3 to 357p in volume of 2.8m. SG Warburg, the company's
broker, was said to have been a seller.

FT  30 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil group buys bid stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of Lasmo reached fever pitch when it emerged that
Enterprise Oil had bought 9.8 per cent of Lasmo via two purchases. The first
was 86.8m shares purchased at 169p and the second was 7.77m shares bought at
161p. The big market purchases drove turnover in Lasmo up to a very heavy
195m shares.
Many brokers were outraged at the way Enterprise had picked up the shares.
'There were no bids in the market at 169p; the best bid marketmakers saw was
148p,' said one oil specialist.
It was suggested that Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management had sold the block of
86.8m shares to Enterprise's brokers and advisers, James Capel and SG
Warburg, at 169p a share. The other big purchase, 7.77m shares , or 1.5 per
cent. was bought for 161p apiece.
Following the day's events, Lasmo shares were up 2 to 143p, still well below
the bid price, but those of Enterprise fell heavily, closing 26 lower at
382p, as the market took the view that Enterprise would only move to buy
shares in Lasmo if it felt it were close to winning the bid battle.
'It is still very close, but the feeling is that the balance is starting to
swing towards Enterprise,' said one broker. He also pointed out that
criticisms of Enterprise's methods of buying the near 10 per cent stake were
not dissimilar to those carried out by Lasmo itself when it won control of
Ultramar.

FT  30 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong gains as equities ignore
dollar's setback - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance by UK government bonds set the stage for further,
solid, recovery in share prices in London yesterday. Weakness in the US
dollar failed to upset bond markets in Europe and turnover in UK equities
was boosted by a heavy buying programme from a leading US investment bank.
The closure of trading books for the second quarter of 1994 opened the way
for fund managers to enter the market again.
Encouraged at the close by a 27- point gain on the Dow Average as New York
opened the new session, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 37.3 points up at
2,946.3, only a shade under the best of the day. Even the market's dollar
stocks brushed off the fall in the US currency and there were widespread
gains in domestically orientated shares.
The stronger tone in equities reflected increasing confidence in the
recovery in the UK economy. The upgrading of economic growth forecasts and
downgrading of inflation predictions by the UK Treasury this week has helped
to offset tensions caused by the dollar's fall.
Shares opened lower following Wall Street's overnight fall and the continued
setback in the US currency. But the London market quickly drew heart from
stock index futures and then from a highly successful outcome to the auction
of Pounds 2bn of floating rate UK government securities. A steadier bond
market has long been identified as the necessary base for a recovery in
equities.
The ability of London and other European bond markets to brush off the
weakness in US Federal bonds overnight played a leading role in
strengthening the equity market.
A modest reduction in money market repo rates by the Bundesbank also served
to strengthen confidence. Markets appeared to be resigned to the fall in the
dollar, which deepened when the appointment of a Socialist prime minister in
Japan cast clouds over prospects for the US-Japan trade talks, but seemed
more sanguine on the dangers of higher US interest rates.
The strength of dollar stocks in London was confirmed by signs of a large
buying programme from the US. Trading volume, slow at first, increased
smartly in the second half of the session and the final Seaq figure of
764.9m shares compared with only 729.1m on Tuesday, when retail, or
customer, business worth Pounds 1.23bn maintained average levels.
Around 63 per cent of yesterday's business was in non-Footsie stocks,
indicating that buying was fully spread across the market. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index, which incorporates a wide range of second line issues, rose 31 points
to 3,415.2.
Trading volume was also swollen by hectic activity in the oil sector as
Friday's deadline for the Enterprise Oil bid for Lasmo drew nearer. Turnover
in Lasmo exploded when Enterprise mounted a buying raid, suggesting that it
was hopeful of success.
Almost every sector of the stock market joined in the general advance.
Utilities continued to display optimism on the regulatory pricing outlook.
Banks strengthened as the recovery in UK securities markets augured well for
their customers' loan problems.
Consumer sectors, such as breweries and food retailers, looked for benefit
as the recovery in the UK economy feeds through to their customers' pockets.
There were also widespread gains across the general manufacturing,
engineering and chemical sectors which are major players in the UK economy.

FT  30 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures were boosted by the strong rally in bonds that followed
the successful UK gilts auction, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening in the September contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,913 was better
than many traders had anticipated.
But for a very brief pause as a large sell order was executed, September
moved steadily ahead during the morning in line with the performance in
bonds and a squeeze in the cash market.
The firm opening on Wall Street brought another bout of active buying of the
contract which sent it to the day's high of 2,967. Profit-taking in the
dying minutes of the session saw it end at 2,961, up 50 from its previous
close, at a strong premium to the underlying market and some two points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 13 points. Volume remained
modest, at 14,997 lots. Further buying in after-hours' trading brought
September to a close of 2,963.
Traded options remained dull and turnover fell to 19,536, against Tuesday's
24,862 contracts. However, volume in the FT-SE 100 showed an improvement on
the previous day's total, reaching 9,500.
Marks and Spencer stood out among the stock options with the biggest
turnover at 4,023 lots. It was followed by Guinness, which traded 1,700
contracts.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retraces its steps after
initial advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip shares receded yesterday afternoon after an early advance, but
broader indices maintained mild firmness as investors shrugged off the
dollar's continued weakness, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a net 2.59 lower at 3,667.05, but the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.56 ahead at 447.63. Advancing issues on the New
York SE had a three-to-two edge over decliners. In the secondary markets,
the American SE composite was up 0.81 at 423.48 and the Nasdaq composite
added 1.96 at 704.01.
A modest 263m shares were traded on the Big Board, with many investors
inactive in the run-up to the long Independence Day weekend and a keenly
awaited Federal Reserve policy-making session early next week. But there was
extra activity generated by money managers adjusting their books a day ahead
of the final trading session of the second quarter.
For the second day running, the blue chips shifted direction during the
mid-afternoon. At the opening, stocks picked up where they had left off the
previous session. Share prices moved steadily higher, building on Tuesday's
late rally, which had whittled down a 45-point Dow deficit to just 15 points
by the close.
The dollar remained a concern but stocks appeared to have broken step with
its fluctuations. Yesterday the greenback continued to slide against the
Japanese currency, but investors took the news in their stride. Later, when
stocks lost their forward momentum, the flagging currency served as an
obvious scapegoat, but it never was a big factor.
In the fixed-rate markets, traders also seemed resigned to the dollar's
latest stumble, giving equities some breathing room. Bonds inched forward in
spite of an upward revision of the government's estimate of first-quarter
gross domestic product to 3.4 per cent. Economists were expecting no change
in the earlier estimate of 3.0 per cent.
But investors discounted the relevance of the first three months of the year
to the Fed's current thinking. The report was not expected to influence the
outcome of next week's policy session.
If it were not for a fresh setback for strike-bound Caterpillar, the Dow
industrials would have showed a gain. In the event, the issue shed a further
Dollars 2 to Dollars 102 1/8 . International Paper gave back Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 67.
The banking sector was generally improved as stocks tracked the course
struck by bonds. NationsBank climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 and
First Interstate appreciated Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 76 5/8 . Citicorp added
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39 7/8 as Kidder Peabody initiated coverage of the
issue with an 'outperform' rating.
On the Nasdaq, Novell gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 17 and led the most
active list with 9.7m shares traded. At least two securities houses -
Wertheim Schroder and UBS - had lifted their ratings on the issue.
Snapple Beverages firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 1/8 after the company
told analysts of its success in the fast-growing market for bottled fruit
juices.
Canada
The Toronto market strengthened as investors began to look ahead to the
release of second-quarter earnings results next month.
The TSE 300 composite index finished 31.4 up at 4,028.2 and advances
outpaced declines by 422 to 293 after volume of 57.9m shares valued at
CDollars 637.7m.
Mexico
Mexican shares opened higher, helped by reports that Mr Alfredo Harp Helu,
the kidnapped financier, had been released by his kidnappers, as well as by
gains on Wall Street. The IPC index was up 24.2, or 1.1 per cent, at
2,256.93.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo had gained a further 5.5 per cent in local currency
terms by midsession as domestic investors in particular took positions
before the introduction of the new currency, the real, tomorrow. The Bovespa
index was 1,949 stronger at 37,585.
The financial markets will be closed tomorrow as the changeover in the
currency takes place.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (South Africa): Johannesburg unable to
make fresh headway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South African shares slipped further, ignoring the stronger showing in
Europe and Wall Street's firmer opening. Trading was very quiet, with the
market still nervous that inflationary fears could lead to higher foreign
interest rates.
The overall index fell 66 to 5,421 as industrial shares traded lower and a
softer bullion price took gold shares down. Industrials finished 77 off at
6,281 and golds slipped 16 to 2,068.
Among key issues, De Beers, the diamond producer, retreated R2 to R107.50 in
spite of the release of first-half sales figures from its Central Selling
Organisation which were only slightly below expectations. CSO sales were up
1.5 per cent to Dollars 2.58bn in the first six months.
Anglo American, the mining conglomerate, weakened R4.25 to R226, but
Barlows, the heavy engineering group, was unchanged at R34. South African
Breweries fell R4 to R85.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Caution over yen's rise
leaves Nikkei lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
Caution over the yen's rise left the Nikkei 225 average lower on arbitrage
selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 158.23 at 20,481.00 after opening at the day's high of
20,559.12 and hitting a low of 20,420.48 in the first hour of trading, just
after the yen climbed to a record Y99.50 against the dollar.
Traders said the political situation had little effect on confidence.
Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda, general manager of Daiwa Securities' stock division,
said the 20,000 level was likely to be a first floor for the market. He
added that domestic institutions had started to buy shares. 'Financial
institutions, including public funds, bought a total Y50bn on Friday last
week and Monday,' he said.
Yesterday's activity, however, centred around technical trading by
arbitrageurs and volume totalled 317m shares, against 385m. The Topix index
of all first section stocks slipped 5.62 to 1,666.62 and the Nikkei 300
eased 0.54 to 303.46. Falls led rises by 648 to 334, with 192 issues
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 6.35 to 1,348.19.
Telecommunication-related stocks gained popularity on hopes of an enlarging
portable telephone market. DDI, a telecom group, rose Y330,000 to Y9.53m on
the second section. Kyocera, DDI's leading shareholder, gained Y190 at
Y7,450.
Nippon Comsys, the telecom engineering company, was the day's most active
issue, adding Y30 at Y1,530. Ushio, also a DDI shareholder and involved in
technology applicable to the handy-phone, moved forward Y50 to Y1,150.
Banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Bank of Tokyo declined Y40 to Y1,560.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 69.32 to 23,633.63 in volume of 15.2m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, was the most active issue, advancing
Y150 to Y7,050.
Roundup
Window dressing by firms closing half-yearly accounts provided impetus in
some of the Pacific Rim markets.
BANGKOK rebounded after falling for seven straight days, the SET index
closing 19.84, or 1.6 per cent, up at 1,272.77 in low turnover of Bt3.85bn.
Most of the buying came from local funds, which have to calculate net asset
values of their unit trusts at the half year.
HONG KONG was easier but recouped almost all its earlier losses ahead of the
close on futures related business, with political developments largely
ignored. The Hang Seng index ended 33.18 off at 8,640.31, having fallen to
8,461.61 during the morning.
HSBC finished steady at HKDollars 83, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell HKDollars
1.25 to HKDollars 43.25 and Hutchison Whampoa dipped 25 cents to HKDollars
31.25.
SEOUL was spurred ahead by a late round of institutional buying which took
the composite index 10.35 ahead to 933.96.
News of the agreement to hold summit talks between the presidents of the two
Koreas next month briefly helped the market in the morning. Low-priced
construction and trading companies with interests in expanded north-south
trade gained momentum.
TAIPEI encountered some demand for industrials, but the mood remained
cautious amid expectations that the market's consolidation would continue.
The weighted index closed 58.59, or 1 per cent, firmer at 5,933.15 in
TDollars 41.23bn turnover.
SYDNEY edged marginally ahead, with losses in the resources sector offset by
gains in industrials. The All Ordinaries index finished 0.7 points higher at
1,975.1 in volume of 273.3m shares.
BHP and CRA each fell 34 cents to ADollars 17.86 and ADollars 17.76
respectively, their lowest levels in six weeks. Western Mining receded 8
cents to ADollars 7.26.
Among banks, NAB closed 18 cents stronger at ADollars 10.86, while Westpac
rose 13 cents to ADollars 4.44 after BankWatch said it had assigned
Westpac's senior debt at AA-minus.
SINGAPORE closed off lows after late bargain hunting of index stocks
emerged. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 9.19 at 2,218.41.
Kim Eng Holdings gained 10 cents at SDollars 2.83 on market expectations of
good earnings. Parkway Holdings added 20 cents at SDollars 3.02 on talk of a
third hospital being set up in Indonesia and rumours of a listing of its
Gleneagles Hospital at the end of this year.
KUALA LUMPUR was helped higher by late buying of blue chips, although the
broader market fell in response to Wall Street's drop. The composite Index
put on 3.19 at 1,010.11.
WELLINGTON gave up much of its early gains to end a quiet and thinly traded
session little changed ahead of today's budget. The NZSE-40 Capital index
closed 3.16 up at 1,982.27 in volume of NZDollars 27m.
BOMBAY fell after an early advance, the BSE 30-share index finishing 53.41
down at 4,158.42 ahead of today's end of the account.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Modified approach to cyclicals
mooted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As investors began counting the costs of their commitments at the end of the
second quarter, there were more murmurings in favour of bond markets
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
In equities, there were arguments for a modified approach to cyclicals,
already voiced by Merrill Lynch in London. Mr Bert Jansen, European
strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, said that of 56 major cyclicals, 32
were overvalued and 24 undervalued; and that implied prices for Thyssen,
Pechiney, Acerinox, Peugeot and Preussag, based on peak earnings forecasts,
and peak p/e ratios, were almost double their present level.
FRANKFURT, according to some reports, mounted a cynical exercise to lift the
Dax index before the end of June. Traders noted that an illiquid Dax stock,
Lufthasa, rose DM8.50, or 4.6 per cent, to DM192.50, while Deutsche Bank
gained only DM1.70, or 0.25 per cent, at DM679.50 as the Dax itself closed
28.04 higher at 2,046.30.
Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok, head of research at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt,
could not see the sense of this. 'I strongly doubt whether the banks have
been active,' he said, 'since they have been losing significant money on the
bond market.' Foreigners continued to be net sellers, so insurance
companies, by deduction, were the most likely buyers - and insurance funds
would not worry about the level of stocks at the end of a given quarter.
Mr Wodniok noted that good quality German cyclicals had outperformed over
the past two weeks. Among them, Preussag rose another DM10 to DM447.
Turnover increased from DM7.1bn to DM7.25bn.
PARIS rallied further after Tuesday's promising performance, helped by
additional firmness in the bond market. The CAC-40 index put on 10.57 at
1,936.33 but turnover was below FFr3bn.
Hopes were raised that the Bank of France might be encouraged to lower
interest rates today following an easing in the German repo, but most
analysts considered this unlikely.
Merrill Lynch joined other brokers which have underweighted the French
equity market, although it said that it expected the CAC-40 index to target
the 2,250 to 2,350 range over the next six months. It favoured cyclicals and
was particularly interested in those stocks which had 'consumer exposure'.
AMSTERDAM finished moderately higher after moving in a narrow range. The AEX
index closed 1.08 up at 382.30.
High volume was seen in Philips once again, the shares adding 40 cents at Fl
51.00, while switching was noted in the chemicals sector, DSM rising Fl 2.40
to Fl 127.00 at the expense of Akzo, down Fl 2.00 at Fl 188.80.
KLM continued to benefit, climbing 50 cents to Fl 48.40, bringing its gain
on the week so far to 7 per cent, as the group reaped the benefits of a
number of positive analysts' notes in recent days.
ZURICH moved ahead in active trade, the SMI index rising 26.8 to 2,631.2,
with the market's resilience over the last difficult week adding to the
improved sentiment.
Banks remained firm, CS Holding appreciating SFr12 to SFr559, while insurers
succumbed to profit-taking.
Chemicals put aside worries about the weak dollar. Ciba bounced SFr25, or
3.2 per cent, higher to SFr805, while Roche certificates also gained SFr25,
at SFr6,410.
Holderbank fell SFr14 to SFr875 on a large sell order from one domestic
institution. The fall wiped out Tuesday's gain which followed news that the
cement group planned a FFr842m offer for a French group.
MILAN continued to play a waiting game in the absence of decisive government
action on the budget deficit, and the Comit index lost 2.94 at 698.03 in low
turnover. Hopes that the successful privatisation of Ina would provide a
spur to trading proved unfounded: the offer closed three days early on
Tuesday night.
Montedison gave up an early advance to finish a net L8 lower at L1,495 in
spite of its announcement that it had boosted operating profits by 33 per
cent in the first five months of the year and expected to cut debt to
L9,500bn by the end of the year.
Against the trend, Ferruzzi, the holding company, appreciated L25 to L2,050
ahead of today's shareholder assembly. Some analysts suggested that the
company could be poised for a turnround, but others remained doubtful.
COPENHAGEN featured a number of positive corporate stories as turnover
climbed from DKr481m to DKr697m, and the KFX index moved up 1.51 to 102.88.
Danske Bank finished DKr10 higher at DKr338, partly on news of an option on
a 23 per cent stake in Baltica Forsikring, the insurer, which might open a
way to the sale of Danke's existing shareholding.
Danisco was up DKr20 at DKr920 ahead of a progress report due today, and FLS
Industries by DKr20 at DKr530 on news of a Polish order worth DKr700m.

The dollar fell yesterday to a post-war low of Y98.55 against the yen amid
uncertainties about the policy implications of a new Japanese prime
minister, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency closed slightly above that level in London at Y98.675, from
Y100.210 on Tuesday, and at DM1.5825 from DM1.5849. In New York it finished
at Y98.75 and DM1.5870.
Traders said sentiment towards the dollar remained bearish, but trade was
patchy. 'Wimbledon is providing much more interest than the market,'
commented one observer.
European currencies again took a back seat to the dollar, with the features
being a weaker lira and firmer peseta. The Belgian central bank cut its
central rate to 4.95 per cent from 5 per cent, while the Bundesbank trimmed
its repo rate to 4.96 per cent from 5 per cent.
Sterling ended little changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.547 from
Dollars 1.5466, and was slightly down against the D-Mark at DM2.4482 from
DM2.4513.
There was little news for dollar bulls to cheer about, save for the
overnight comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury Secretary. He told
a New York audience: 'We believe a stronger dollar is better for our economy
and better for the world economy.'
He added: 'The dollar is not a tool of our trade policy.' This was the
strongest position yet articulated by the US administration. In early May Mr
Bentsen said that the US 'saw no advantage in an undervalued currency'.
Mr David Cocker, economic analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said that
'verbal intervention needs to be at least one leg of any currency
intervention that takes place'.
He added that, to be credible, it needed to be repeated 'from a wide number
of sources from within the administration'. Conflicting messages from other
senior officials would undermine the good work.
Confusing the picture was the political change in Japan which saw the
election of a Socialist prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama. Analysts said
the market was very ambivalent about this move.
One concern includes the greater sympathy of the Socialists for North Korea,
while the market was also trying to sift through what the implications might
be for progress in the trade talks.
Some observers also believe that Mr Murayama's victory will complicate
efforts to pass tax reform legislation.
Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said
the dollar would be in a lot of trouble if the Fed did not move to raise
interest rates soon. The key, he added, was that it should not be seen to be
panicking.
'As long as the Fed can place a monetary policy tightening in terms of what
it has been doing already to fight inflation, I think it will be OK,' he
said.
Yesterday the September Eurodollar future was trading at 94.70, discounting
three-month money at 5.30 per cent, compared to the current level of about
4.8 per cent.
Mr Cocker said the dollar needed US short-term rates to move above those in
Germany. The US federal funds rate is currently 4.25 per cent, against the
German repo rate of 4.96 per cent.
TIn Europe the lira weakened further, closing at L990.6 from L986.9 per
D-Mark. Analysts were at odds about the explanation for why the Italian
currency is approaching L1,000 for the third time since early 1993, but said
it was more than a case simply of generalised D-Mark strength.
Some said the market was unsure about whether the government had the ability
to curb the budget deficit. But Mr Giorgio Radaelli, economist at Lehman
Brothers in London, said this explanation was incompatible with the recent
strength of the Italian bond market.
He said the weakness of the lira was probably attributable to technical
trading. 'I do not see any reason why the lira should move at odds with bond
prices,' added Mr Radaelli.
Elsewhere in Europe, the peseta continued its recovery, closing at Pta82.15
from Pta82.42 against the D-Mark. Mr Gunner of Chase said currency strength
was based on a recovery in the bond market that had restored faith in
Spanish assets in general.
The Belgian franc ended unchanged at BFr20.60 against the D-Mark, although
there was some concern about the implications of allowing interest rates to
fall below those in Germany. Traders noted, however, that there was no
fundamental reason for D-Mark strength, which is more a function of dollar
weakness.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 720m liquidity to the UK money markets
after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 700m. Overnight money traded between
4 and 5 per cent.
German call money traded at the 6 per cent Lombard rate after the Bundesbank
unexpectedly drained DM2.8bn in the weekly repo.
Sentiment in the interest rate futures markets was more positive, but trade
was fairly light. The December Euromark contract saw nearly 27,000 lots
dealt and finished six basis points firmer at 94.94. The December
Eurosterling contract settled at 93.77 from 93.76.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cornish tin mine seeks Pounds
1m lifeline as debts forgiven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, DAVID OWEN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An emotional appeal to investors to provide at least Pounds 1m and up to
Pounds 1.8m to save the last operating tin mine in Cornwall - where tin
mining has taken place for more than 2,500 years - was made yesterday by Mr
Kevin Ross, managing director of South Crofty, until recently known as
Carnon Consolidated.
'Since the collapse of the tin price in 1985, most of the world's producers
have faced enormous difficulties and many have closed. But South Crofty has
survived through tenacity, dedication and ingenuity. On many occasions
commentators have predicted that closure of the mine was imminent - but we
are still here and, with your help, we intend to stay here,' he says in a
letter accompanying the prospectus carrying details of an offer of South
Crofty shares.
This reveals that, if South Crofty can raise Pounds 1m to ensure its
survival for another 18 months, the UK government will waive loans to South
Crofty made since 1985 totalling Pounds 23.4m. The European Commission,
which approved the loans, has agreed they can now be written off.
The government last night confirmed it would waive repayment of the loans.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said in a parliamentary
written answer that the low price of tin meant there was no longer any
realistic prospect of repayment.
He said the conditional waiver was 'intended to permit Carnon the
opportunity to raise fresh funding to continue its operations'.
Mr Heseltine said the waiver was conditional on the company successfully
raising the minimum subscription and on MPs not objecting to it before the
closing date on August 4.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, which sold South Crofty and its
sister mine Wheal Jane to management and employees in 1985, will also
forgive its loan of Pounds 7.7m. RTZ wrote off this loan in 1986.
Mr Ross is asking for minimum individual offers for Pounds 200-worth of
shares. He points out that investment in the company is far from a 'safe
bet'. South Crofty needs a tin price of about Pounds 4,000 a tonne to make a
decent profit. The price peaked at Pounds 10,021 in February 1985 and fell
to a 20-year low of Pounds 2,946 in September 1993. At present the price is
about Pounds 3,600 a tonne.
The prospectus makes no forecasts but shows South Crofty reported a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 42,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.5m for last year, compared
with a profit of Pounds 79,000 on Pounds 6m of sales in 1992.
South Crofty employs 260 people and has about three years of demonstrated
reserves and at least ten years of identified reserves. Annual output has
been 2,200 tonnes of tin in concentrate.
Ore is trucked from the South Crofty mine 12 miles to the Wheal Jane mill -
'one of the world's most efficient tin concentrators' - for processing. All
concentrate is shipped for refining to the DKS smelter in Malaysia.
Annual demand for tin could rise by over 20 per cent in five years as new
products come on to the market, according to Mr Bres Barry, director of the
International Tin Research Institute, reports Reuter.
He said products pioneered by the ITRI could add 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes to
annual consumption. Projects under way included a new tin-zinc alloy for
plating car components. Copies of the South Crofty prospectus are available
from Mr Howard Midwinter, South Crofty Plc - Share Issue, South Crofty Mine,
Pool, Redruth, Cornwall TR15 3QH.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peanut power could beef up
South American forage - A wild legume that offers a wide range of benefits
to farmers on the savannas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A wild peanut, used in parts of South America as a forage for animals, may
play an important role in raising the productivity of pasture land, and also
help to protect the continent's disappearing forests.
Scientists at the Colombia-based Cali International Centre for Tropical
Agriculture, a research station, say that when the wild peanut is planted
with improved grasses on acidic savanna land, it sharply increases the
productivity of the land.
Indigenous to Brazil, the wild peanut is called Arachis Pintoi, and looks
like a clover with yellow flowers. It has edible pods similar to the common
peanut. Scientists describe it as a perennial legume, or forage peanut
legume, which is unusually versatile.
'It's a vigorous pioneer,' says Mr Myles Fisher, a Ciat scientist, '. . . it
tolerates infertile, acid soils, produces lots of seeds and withstands heavy
grazing.'
The grazing quality of this peanut legume is now attracting the interest of
farmers on the vast savanna lands of South America, which cover more
than200m hectares, about the area under crops in sub-Saharan Africa.
In Colombia's Eastern Plains, seeds of the legume were given to several
farmers in late 1992. Results were dramatic. Cows grazed on a land where the
legume was growing with improved grasses gained more than 400kg in a year,
compared with only 30kg on native grasses. Milk production was also higher
when the legume was planted.
'This grass-legume pasture is more productive than any other combination we
have tried', says Mr Carlos Lascano, a ruminant nutritionist at Ciat.
Peanut legumes help to improve the soil's fertility by recycling large
amounts of nutrients between plants and soil, 'which, in turn maintains
productive pastures', says Mr Gerard Ketter-Grein, a tropical pastures
agronomist.
Cattle like the taste of an improved grass-legume and eat more of it than
they eat of a grass-only pasture.
Savanna farmers producing beef and milk and with good access to markets are
expected to gain most from planting the peanut legume. Scientists believe
that it may help to rejuvenate lost agricultural land, bringing it back into
production, and ease the pressure for cutting forests.
Farmers with unproductive savanna lands that provide only a meagre income
often move into forest areas to chop down trees and give themselves more
land for pasture. More productive savannas may help to prevent this.
'If we can stabilise pastures at a high level of productivity', says Mr
Peter Jones, an agricultural geographer at Ciat. 'There will be no incentive
for people to cut more forest. And let's face it, cutting a few hectares of
Amazon forest is no fun'.
Tempted by the prospect of more productive pastures, however, some farmers
may still resort to chopping down more forest to increase their land
holdings.
While legislation to protect forests exists in most South American
countries, it goes often unenforced. Mr Jones believes that if the economy
of the savannas is improved, 'there would be a better chance of
enforcement'.
The peanut legume has other qualities that farmers find attractive. It
absorbs nitrogen from the air and this acts as a free fertiliser, says soil
specialist Mr Richard Thomas. He estimates that it effectively provides
between 40kg and 80kg of nitrogen a hectare a year.
By using the legume, savanna farmers are therefore able to further improve
their profitability by reducing purchases of nitrogen fertiliser.
By spreading on grassland like a clover, the legume helps to control weeds.
And it is 'a highly nutritious forage for animals', says Mr Peter Kerridge,
leader of Ciat's tropical forages programme.
Farmers could face problems, however, getting hold of the seeds. Mr John
Ferguson, an agronomist, points out that although arachis pintoi has been
used in Australia for more than 10 years, under the name Amarillo, there is
little seed production in Colombia. A small Bolivian company, SEFO, is
exporting seeds of the legume to other South American countries.
The peanut legume is now being used by coffee farmers, not least because it
substitutes for nitrogen fertiliser, which has to be purchased. 'In coffee
plantations on the Colombian hillsides, arachis pintoi cuts fertiliser costs
and improves weed control', says Mr Senen Suarez of Cenicafe, Colombia's
coffee research centre.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Continuing frost fears drive US
coffee futures to 8-year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New York coffee futures powered to eight-year highs yesterday after the
close of the London market as traders continued to react to fears about
frost damage to the Brazilian crop. The gains were pared back in late
trading but analysts thought the bull run still had farther to go.
'Prices are sky-rocketing,' said Ms Judy Ganes, softs analyst at Merrill
Lynch in New York, as the September arabica futures contract at the Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange reached Dollars 2 a pound.
In London trading, the market had revived to finish close to its high point
of the day. The September futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange
rose by Dollars 97 a tonne to close at Dollars 3,100 a tonne.
Trading in London was cautious and the market lost some of its early gains
by midday. But it was pushed higher again by a strong opening to the New
York trading day.
Estimates of the damage to Brazil's coffee trees put losses for the 1995-96
crop at between 5m and 9m bags out of a total expected harvest of 24m bags -
a quarter of world output. 'That's a pretty hefty sum,' said Ms Ganes.
She said that few roasting companies were willing to part with beans, which
was forcing many speculators to scramble to cover short positions. Traders
fear a shortfall in coffee output while consumption continues to rise.
Ms Ganes believes that New York prices could easily go up by another 50
cents a pound as a result of the recent damage, with nearby London futures
reaching Dollars 3,600 to Dollars 3,700 a tonne.
Latin American producers meet in Brasilia next week, where they could
discuss releasing stocks to help alleviate the market tightness. But
producer-held stocks are at their lowest level for 14 years, according to
trading house ED &amp; F. Man, with 65 per cent of them in the hands of Brazil
and Colombia.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers expected to keep brake
on diamond sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers, the South African group whose London-based Central Selling
Organisation accounts for at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough
diamonds, gave a clear hint yesterday that it might have given the market
indigestion while chalking up record first-half sales of USDollars 2.58bn.
It described the performance - 1.5 per cent higher than in the same months
last year - as 'encouraging' but said it cut supplies to the market in the
second quarter because of 'a build-up of stocks in the (diamond) cutting
centres and continued concerns in respect of cutting-centre profitability'.
'There was good demand for some of the larger sizes but evidence of
over-production in certain categories of small stones. So sights (sales)
were reined in in the second quarter.'
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'There is no
question that demand for diamonds is recovering. But De Beers has been
pushing the market too hard. From all parts of the trade we hear complaints
about there being too many diamonds and too many diamonds of the wrong sort.
There are not enough stones from which the trade can make a profit.'
Like some other analysts, he suggested that De Beers would continue to
restrict supplies so that its second half sales would be well below those in
the first six months. The 1994 full-year total therefore would be not much
different from last year's Dollars 4.366bn. De Beers' profits from diamonds
would remain low, he added, and its total earnings would consequently 'not
be that buoyant'.
De Beers yesterday acknowledged that its big customers, who cut and polish
gem diamonds, were complaining that their profit margins had been squeezed
so hard during the past two years that they were now practically
non-existent. The CSO is to meet a delegation to discuss these problems.
A spokesman pointed out that the long recession had also been painful for De
Beers, which had cut production, made 25 per cent of employees at its
diamond mines redundant, cut the dividend to shareholders and was having to
finance stocks that had risen to Dollars 4bn. The international promotional
budget had also been lifted from Dollars 150m to more than Dollars 170m.
The group increased rough diamond prices by 1.5 per cent in February last
year, the first rise since 1990. Producers were also asked to cut deliveries
from previously-agreed levels and De Beers made it clear yesterday that
deliveries would remain unchanged at 85 per cent.
De Beers said that in the first half demand for retail diamond jewellery
remained stable in the US but was weak in Japan, which vies with the States
as the biggest diamond retail market. Demand in other east Asian markets was
high but it was weak in Europe. There were signs, however, that the
economies of both Japan and Europe had 'bottomed out'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries inch forward despite fall in
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds inched forward in quiet trading yesterday as traders tried
to ignore the plight of the dollar.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/32 better
at 85 5/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.505 per cent. The two-year note
was unchanged at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.101 per cent.
Activity was sluggish as most retail accounts chose to remain on the
sidelines until stability returned to the foreign exchange markets.
Throughout the session, the dollar established a series of record lows
against the yen. The election of Mr Tomiichi Murayama as Japanese prime
minister appeared to have little impact on sentiment in either the bond or
currency markets.
There was some expectation that the Federal Reserve and other central banks
would attempt to prop up the dollar, but the intervention never
materialised.
The sense of anticipation, which kept trading to a minimum, also reflected
the approach of the Fed's policy-setting meeting next week. Analysts were
uncertain if the session would result in the year's fifth rate increase.
The day's economic news was surely not favourable for those betting against
such a move, but it was probably irrelevant to the Fed's current thinking.
In a surprise, the Commerce Department revised its estimate of first-quarter
gross domestic product from 3.0 per cent to 3.4 per cent.
European bond markets moved cautiously higher in thin trade, in spite of
further weakness in the US dollar.
However, sentiment remained fragile, with attention turning towards next
week's Bundesbank, US Federal Open Market Committee and G7 meetings for
signs of official intervention to protect the embattled US currency.
'The dollar is having less of an impact on European bond markets than
anticipated,' said Mr Kirit Shah, of First Chicago. 'The markets are testing
the upside but are encountering resistance, climbing two steps higher then
being forced to take one step backwards.'
UK gilts resumed the better performance seen earlier in the week, with
tentative signs that a more optimistic mood is returning to the market.
The Bank of England's auction of Pounds 2bn of floating-rate gilts due 1999
was a success. It was covered 2.72 times, with a lowest accepted price of
99.75 and a tail of 1 basis point - the difference between the average and
lowest accepted bid.
'I have some conviction that we have seen the worst of the gilt selling,'
said Mr Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS. 'The success of the auction
was a sign that background sentiment is healthy, rather than something which
moved the market higher,' he said.
'Gilts have benefited from a variety of players over the last few days,'
said Mr Shah, 'such as hedge funds and Japanese buyers, and the findings of
the government's white paper on pension reform has helped.'
But he doubted whether the bottom of the market had been reached. 'The bears
are resting. It is difficult for them to make money at the moment as well,'
he said.
The market's attention will now be on the release tomorrow of the US June
NAPM report. The September long gilt future on Liffe was up  13/16 points in
late trading at 101 3/4 .
German government bonds lost some of their gains in late trading but
remained ahead, helped by firmer US government bonds.
The Bundesbank announced that it had allocated 14-day securities repurchase
funds at this week's tender at a lowest rate of 4.96 per cent, down from
last week's rate of 5 per cent and broadly in line with expectations.
There was some disappointment in the market at the outcome of the issue by
the Treuhand, the German privatisation agency, of DM2.01bn of 6.375 per cent
five-year bonds, with an average yield of 6.46 per cent and a weighted
average price of 99.63.
The low price and the fact that the Bundesbank withheld DM1.99bn of the
total DM4bn issue for market-tending purposes demonstrated that demand is
still weak, analysts said.
But Mr Huw Roberts, assistant bond strategist at NatWest Markets, said:
'Normally this would have been a bad outcome but it is really quite a
success after the recent supply problems.'
Bunds rose in early trading due to a technical short squeeze. They came off
slightly on the strong US data.
'There are some signs that the market is beginning to bottom,' said Mr
Roberts. 'If people had wanted to sell off in the last couple of days then
were opportunities for them to do so. It is a favourable sign that they did
not.'
The German September government bond contract on Liffe was up 0.32 points at
92.84 in late trading.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Luoyang Glass HK listing only
just subscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Luoyang Glass, China's biggest manufacturer of float glass and the first of
the second wave of Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong, has had its
HKDollars 912.5m issue subscribed just 1.02 times.
The company is the 10th China enterprise (H share) to come to the Hong Kong
stock market. Like Tianjin Bohai, a HKDollars 408m offering which was barely
subscribed last month, it has suffered from a general souring of investor
sentiment towards China.
On top of this, the scarcity value which ensured that earlier H share issues
were heavily oversubscribed no longer applies, prompting potential
applicants to pay closer attention to investment fundamentals.
'Luoyang is just a victim of sentiment. This year will be very critical to
China because of the macro-economic situation. There are many uncertainties,
and so people are downgrading H shares and giving bigger discounts,' said
one analyst.
In an effort to counter poor demand, advisers to H share companies in the
second batch are pricing the shares at a sharp discount to their
predecessors.
Luoyang's shares were sold at a price-earnings ratio of 10.5 times 1994
earnings, compared with ratios of around 13 times and upwards for the bulk
of H shares listed last year.
Tsingtao Brewery, which became the first ever H share when it listed last
July, was offered on a p/e of 17.9 times 1993 earnings.
The company, benefiting from China frenzy, brand recognition and rarity
value, saw its issue more than 110 times subscribed.
Ms Dora Hung, analyst with Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, says price and
fundamentals will be crucial for those coming in the wake of Luoyang Glass.
'The trend going forward will be lower prices. There was a lot of scarcity
value attached to Tsingtao's initial public offer, but now the supply has
become more balanced,' she says.
Based on prevailing market evaluations, she reckons those launching their
IPOs in the wake of Luoyang will aim for p/e ratios of between 10 and 13
times, depending upon the industry sector.
For those making basic materials and chemicals, margins are expected to be
volatile as the Chinese government seeks to control prices as a means of
curbing inflation.
However, certain stocks - of which Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway is likely to
be one - may achieve higher pricing.
Luoyang had also scaled back its issue, offering 250m shares against earlier
plans for 300m.
It is believed the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the mainland
securities watchdog, may have had a hand in this decision.
In all, 22 companies have been selected this year for an overseas listing
and at least five of those are aiming for New York.
Shanghai Haixing Shipping is likely to be among the next to list, while
Shandong Huaneng Power Development Company is now leading the race to secure
a New York listing.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Portugal increases global FRN in
response to strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first global offering of D-Mark floating-rate notes, launched by the
Republic of Portugal yesterday, met strong demand from international
investors, prompting an increase in the size of the transaction from an
initial DM2bn to DM2.5bn.
The five-year issue, arranged by Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and UBS, was
priced to offer a discounted margin of 10 basis points above the London
interbank offered rate (Libor).
Dealers said that the pricing of the deal was attractive because FRNs priced
at a margin above Libor are still relatively rare.
'The lesson of this year has been that Libor-plus deals go well and
sub-Libor deals don't work,' said one trader. Banks like to buy FRNs priced
above Libor because banks can fund themselves at a lower level.
Around 15 per cent of the transaction was placed in the US, according to one
lead manager and, given that the deal was not denominated in dollars, the
proportion of US placement was considered respectable.
'Some people had expected it to be a lot less. At that level, it is
certainly worth making it a global deal,' said one underwriter, adding that
similar levels had been achieved for some dollar offerings.
The deal was quoted at its reoffer price of 99.834 towards the end of the
day's trading.
Mr Manuel Pinho, director general of the Portuguese Treasury, said that the
deal virtually completes Portugal's Es400bn foreign borrowing programme for
1994.
The proceeds have not been swapped. 'We do not need the funds immediately,
as we have a large cash position,' said Mr Pinho.
Meanwhile, Fannie Mae's recent debut global bond offering will be followed
shortly by two more global deals by US government agencies.
Freddie Mac's Dollars 1.5bn five-year global issue, currently roadshowing in
Asia, is likely to be launched in mid-July, with market participants
suggesting a launch spread of around 18 basis points over the five-year
Treasury yield.
In addition, the Federal Home Loan Bank System will kick off its is expected
Dollars 5bn global debt programme with a global bond offering, likely to
total around Dollars 1bn, arranged by Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley.
Elsewhere, Finland is considering launching a deal in the international
markets, though a currency and maturity have yet to be chosen.
Credit Foncier de France has launched an Ecu250m five-year revolving credit
facility, arranged by JP Morgan. The facility will be used to back up its
recent Ecu750m euro-commercial paper programme.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Successful Lasmo bid may boost
UK warrants sector - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Enterprise Oil's Pounds 1.7bn (Dollars 2.58bn) hostile bid for Lasmo, its
fellow UK oil explorer, proves successful, one spin-off will be the creation
of the third largest issue in the developing UK warrants market. The
all-paper offer of shares and warrants would, if the bid goes through,
create Pounds 105m worth of warrants, on underlying shares worth Pounds
612m.
So far this year, the amount of warrants issued on UK company shares has
totalled Dollars 8.5bn equivalent, not far behind last year's Dollars 9bn
total and far ahead of the Dollars 2bn-odd volume recorded in 1991 and 1992,
according to Euromoney Bondware. But the UK sector still lags behind the
much larger German market, where warrants worth Dollars 24bn have been
issued so far this year, compared with Dollars 27.5bn last year.
In essence, these warrants are little different from options: they give the
holder the option to buy shares in a particular company at a pre-determined
price, within a certain period. But warrants differ from listed options,
traded on exchanges, and over-the-counter options, which are specially
negotiated bilateral agreements, in several ways.
One raison d'etre for the market is that for some fund managers, warrants
are 'qualified assets' - that is, they are allowed to buy them - while
options are not. This is because warrants are classified as securities,
since they are bearer, freely-transferable instruments which can be cleared
either through Euroclear or Cedel, the two main European clearing houses, or
through domestic clearing systems. Warrants also tend to be long-dated, and
to be priced far out-of-the-money (that is, the exercise price is not set
close to the current share price).
Within the warrants market itself, the largest issues, such as those by
Hanson and BTR in the UK, are launched by the companies themselves. In
addition, banks and securities houses often issue 'covered' warrants -
warrants on individual company stocks, which already exist. They can do this
subject to investor demand, provided they have the approval of the company
concerned.
A retail investor looking for, say, Nestle warrants may not care which type
he buys, but there are often price disparities. In particular, because
covered warrants are often only traded only by the issuing house, the
investor is extremely dependent on that firm's commitment to making a
secondary market. Because only one house may be trading that issue, it is
also inadvisable to go 'short' - because it may be extremely difficult to
get hold of the warrants later.
Due to its somewhat esoteric qualities, the market often behaves rather
strangely. 'Warrants often become cheap when the market rallies; at the
moment they are quite expensive because the UK stock market has fallen,'
says Mr Richard Burns, vice-president, equity derivatives sales, at Salomon
Brothers. 'Prices tend to be slow to react.'
The market's liquidity has come in for considerable criticism over the
years. 'Some banks have issued warrants at the wrong price and have not
taken care of their deals in the secondary market and that has given the
market a bad name,' admitted one warrants trader.
There have also been accusations that some houses issue warrants in order to
achieve an impressive position in the league tables, and may not alway be
able to place the warrants subsequently.
Nevertheless, the market's continued growth shows it remains attractive for
some investors. Individual warrant issues, for example, may be more liquid
than the traded options on an individual stock. 'If you want to get exposure
to Spain, you could buy stock index warrants: the warrants won't be more
liquid than the future, but, if you want a more defensive position than the
future, they may be more liquid than the options,' said one trader.
In addition, there is what one trader called 'operational arbitrage' - more
simply, 'people like to just write one ticket'. For some investors, the
process of buying a warrant is attractive simply because it is more
straightforward.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Spanish financier in write-off
move to avoid lawsuits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Spanish financier being sued by the Kuwait
Investment Office in connection with the collapse of Grupo Torras, the KIO's
Spanish holding company, is to write off his domestic business interests in
an attempt to ward off a fresh round of threatened lawsuits.
The lawsuits are being brought by minority shareholders in Mr de la Rosa's
loss-making Barcelona investment holding company, Grand Tibidabo.
The write-offs, to be unveiled at Tibidabo's general meeting today, are
viewed in Madrid as the final chapter in Mr de la Rosa's extraordinary
career - a career marked by acquisitions on behalf of the KIO and by a
spreading web of investments that turned the 47-year-old businessman into
one of the richest men in Spain.
Mr de la Rosa, who resigned as Grand Tibidabo's chairman in May amid growing
shareholder hostility, is to sell his 26 per cent equity in the company back
to Tibidabo for a token one peseta, allowing a capital reduction that will
help Tibidabo clean up its balance sheet.
Mr de la Rosa's stake represents Pta4.1bn (Dollars 31.6m) on the basis of
the nominal value of the company's shares.
Tibidabo lost Pta10.9bn last year, a shortfall that took into account
provisions for outstanding loans to Mr de la Rosa of some Pta4.3bn. Under
the chairmanship of Mr de la Rosa, the had company declared a 1993 loss of
Pta319m. The dramatically increased deficit followed an audit by Ernst &amp;
Young following Mr de la Rosa's resignation.
Tibidabo was created in 1991 by Mr de la Rosa to serve as his own investment
vehicle at a time when he was deputy chairman of Grupo Torras. The following
year Mr de la Rosa severed his relations with the KIO and Grupo Torras.
In spite of Mr de la Rosa's write-off at Tibidabo, lawyers representing the
company's 9,000 small shareholders are understood to be considering legal
action against the former chairman after today's annual meeting.
Mr de la Rosa, together with other senior Grupo Torras executives, is
already facing lawsuits in Madrid and London brought by the KIO alleging
fraud and mismanagement. He is also being investigated by Spain's fiscal
authorities in connection with alleged unpaid taxes.

<TEXT>
Burns Philp, the Australian company which has been concentrating on building
up its food ingredients division, is buying a 49 per cent stake in the
Indian Yeast Company from Shaw Wallace for an undisclosed sum.
The Indian company has two plants in Calcutta and Bombay, and claims to be
the market leader in the country.
Burns said the purchase consideration was small, but that the business
augmented its strong presence in the Asia-Pacific yeast market. Burns Philp
has a 40 per cent market share in the region.
Rank Commercial, the privately-owned New Zealand-based company which is
bidding ADollars 500m (USDollars 384.6m) for Foodland Associated, the
Western Australian grocery group, will not lodge formal offer documents
until a hearing on the Trade Practices Commission's request for an
injunction takes place. This is scheduled for July 6.
The TPC, Australia's competition watchdog, is concerned about the
involvement of Coles Myers, one of Australia's largest retailers, in the
bid. Coles has an option to acquire Foodland's Australian assets for around
ADollars 250m if the Rank offer is successful.

Amcor, the Australian paper group, has bought the 51 per cent interest which
it did not own in Willander Holdings, the UK-based corrugated box
manufacturer.
The UK company was originally privately owned by three partners. Amcor
acquired a 49 per cent interest in March 1991, and has subsequently expanded
operations significantly - adding a second corrugator at its Coalville plant
in 1993.
Amcor did not disclose details of the latest purchase, but said its total
investment was around ADollars 40m (USDollars 30.7m).
Edels Music, the New South Wales-based music group, has made an 11th-hour
bid to acquire Brash Holdings, the Australian electronic goods retailer
which called in the administrators last month.
Last week, the administrators announced the planned sale of Brash's main
assets to companies associated with Mr Ong Beng Seng, the Singaporean
businessman, although creditors have yet to give final approval.
Edels said its deal would give creditors a higher return than the earlier
offer.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Political crosswinds catch
Cathay Pacific - Operating problems are putting profit margins under
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For an airline which is the envy of its peers as one of the few
international carriers still making a profit, Cathay Pacific is carrying a
lot of troublesome baggage.
Its pilots are agitating for more pay. Spiralling costs and growing
competition are squeezing returns. And the airline has been caught in a
political row between China and Taiwan, resulting in a reduction of flights
and forcing Cathay to publicly denounce adverse speculation about its future
as Hong Kong's de facto flag carrier.
Last month, amid mounting stock market concern about Cathay's role under its
present ownership after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control, Mr Peter
Sutch, chairman, took the unusual step of circulating a letter from the
chairman of John Swire, largest shareholder of Cathay's owner Swire Pacific,
which instructed him to 'kill this fantasy'.
There is a growing suspicion among analysts that after 1997 Cathay will have
to take on influential Chinese shareholders. At present the airline is
controlled by Swire Pacific, a conglomerate whose credentials are impeccably
British.
Swire Pacific owns 51.8 per cent of Cathay. Citic Pacific, the Hong
Kong-listed subsidiary of Beijing's investment agency, has 12.8 per cent:
and China Travel Services and China National Aviation Corporation have 5 per
cent each.
Unfortunately for Cathay, it will take more than an open letter - however
strongly worded - to dispel its operating problems. 'The airline industry is
such a terrible one to be involved with. There are so many factors that are
out of the management's control, and airlines are so susceptible to downturn
in demand,' says Mr Gary Baker, research head at Smith New Court in Hong
Kong.
Cathay is hoping to exercise greater control over wage costs, although
inflation and union pressure appear to be eroding its efforts. The threat of
industrial action is blinking on the horizon as management attempts to
thrash out an agreement with pilots.
At issue are pay and productivity. Cathay wants to increase the hours worked
by pilots to 700 a year, up from the present 648. Cathay claims it is
getting an average of slightly less than 600 hours a year out of its pilots.
The pilots are themselves disgruntled, and fighting for more money. The
airline's highest paid pilots, with around 20 years' experience, receive
packages worth a shade under HKDollars 4m (USDollars 517,000) a year - among
the highest in the world - but newcomers, joining on the 'B scale' salaries
introduced last April, are earning almost half that of the older hands.
The problem with alienating staff - as Cathay found to its cost last year,
after 15 days of industrial action shaved some HKDollars 240m off profits -
is that in the service sector clients remember surly faces and cynical
voices.
But the biggest threat to profit margins is spiralling costs. The airline
has taken steps to defray operating costs by despatching computer and
accounts processing operations to Sydney and Guangzhou.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, has warned that the airline's financial
performance this year is unlikely to be much better than in 1993, when
profits fell 23.8 per cent to HKDollars 2.29bn.
In the longer term, airline deregulation in Asia is an obvious threat,
clearing the way for more competition. So too is the greater capacity
afforded by the colony's pending new airport. The recently launched Virgin
Atlantic service between Hong Kong and London is just the tip of the iceberg
 -the expanding Asia-Pacific is a market most airlines will want to
penetrate.
Elsewhere, the airline has been more a victim of circumstance. When the
Taiwanese government imposed a ban on tours to the mainland in March -
following the murder of 24 Taiwanese on a cruise of Qiandao Lake - Hong Kong
was badly affected. The ban on direct Taiwan-China flights means that the
colony is the main point of entry for Taiwanese visiting the mainland.
The Taiwanese government lifted its veto in May, although package tours
taking in 'high risk' locations remain under boycott. Cathay Pacific has
been forced to axe 46 flights.
According to Ms Eisha Cheng, aviation analyst with Lehman Brothers in Hong
Kong, the cost to Cathay was HKDollars 1m in lost revenue for each flight.
However, Cathay sends some 4,680 flights a year between Hong Kong and
Taiwan. The real hit will only come if in some way the Taiwanese become
afraid to travel to China, forcing Cathay to continue cancelling flights.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Camdev, the surviving company from the 1991-92 collapse and restructuring of
Mr Robert Campeau's property and US retailing empire, has posted its first
quarterly profit.
Camdev remains a substantial owner of office buildings and land in Ottawa
and Toronto. It reported net profit of CDollars 237,000 (USDollars 170,921),
or 4 cents a share, for the three months ended April 30, against a loss of
CDollars 211,000, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were little changed
at CDollars 20m.
However, chairman Mr Stanley Hartt warned the profit was mainly due to a
CDollars 1.5m dividend received from a minority-owned California supermarket
chain. He said the chain needed to reinvest its cash, and Camdev hoped to
sell its 12.8 per cent interest.
For the year ended January 1994, Camdev lost CDollars 1.5m, or 24 cents,
against a loss of CDollars 13.7m, or CDollars 2.16, a year earlier.
Mr Hartt said Camdev wanted to expand its property management and
development activities through a new subsidiary, Finreal Properties.

<TEXT>
J. P. Morgan has taken a minority stake in a recently formed Indian fund
management venture, signalling its intention to gain a greater presence in
the country's fast-growing capital markets.
The US bank has acquired a 40 per cent interest in the investment management
arm of Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a privately
owned development bank.
The fund management company was set up last year following deregulation of
the Indian mutual fund industry to allow private-sector companies to compete
for investments.
The joint venture company will initially sell mutual funds (or unit trusts)
to individual investors in India, although investment in the funds will also
be open to non-resident Indians and foreign institutions who are registered
with the local authorities.
Morgan said that this represented the first step in a long-term strategy to
become a strong domestic money manager in India.
Morgan and ICICI already have an investment banking joint venture, which was
launched last year.

National Medical Enterprises, a Santa Monica-based hospital chain, has
agreed to plead guilty to making illegal payments to secure patient
referrals and pay Dollars 379m in settlement of civil and criminal charges.
The settlement, which follows a three-year federal investigation of NME's
psychiatric hospitals, was announced yesterday by Ms Janet Reno, the US
attorney-general.
As part of the settlement, the group's NME Psychiatric Hospitals subsidiary
is expected to plead guilty to six counts of illegal payments to secure
referral of Medicare patients to its hospitals, and one count of conspiracy
to make such payments.
The agreement, which is subject to approval by a federal judge, would be the
US's biggest healthcare fraud settlement. Previously, the highest healthcare
fraud settlement was against National Health Laboratories, which agreed to
pay Dollars 111m in 1992.
'This settlement will signify that NME is is taking full responsibility for
its past conduct in certain of its businesses,' said Mr Jeffrey Barbakow,
chief executive officer. It is not expected to cover individual fraud
charges against the company's employees, the company said.
On Monday, Mr Peter Alexis, former NME regional vice-president, pleaded
guilty in Dallas to arranging up to Dollars 40m in payments for patient
referrals. Justice Department officials said yesterday NME would co-operate
with continuing investigations.
The department said some of NME's patients had been hospitalised more than
was necessary, maximising insurance premium payments to the company. In some
cases, that overstay amounted to years rather than months.
National Medical said earlier this year it had set aside Dollars 375m to
cover a preliminary agreement with the Federal government, and talks have
continued since then on finalising the details.
The company had previously announced that, as part of the settlement, it was
divesting its psychiatric hospitals business to 'refocus' on its core
business of acute care. It has agreed to try to complete the divestiture
within the next 90 days. NME says it has undertaken an ethics and compliance
overhaul since the fraud was uncovered.
The Clinton healthcare plan, and its congressional variants, put great
stress on cutting US healthcare costs by eliminating fraud and waste. The
administration is likely to point to settlement of the NME case as a
significant success.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nasdaq in trial reform of short
sale regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The second-biggest US stock market has changed its rules for a trial period
to make companies less vulnerable to so-called 'bear raids', in which a
company's share price is driven down by speculators seeking to make a quick
profit.
The National Association of Securities Dealers, the authority which runs the
Nasdaq stock market, said yesterday it had received approval from the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the rule change.
The reform would in effect prevent dealers from engaging in the sort of
short sales that can force a company's share price into a downward spiral.
A short sale involves a dealer selling shares it does not own in the hope of
buying them later at a lower price.
If several dealers all sell short a company whose shares are already under
pressure, it can lead to a sharp fall in the price.
Under the NASD's new rule, which will be in force for a trial period of 18
months, dealers will not be able to engage in a short sale at a lower price
than the previous bid price quoted on Nasdaq screens.
In effect, this echoes the 'down-tick' rule applied by the New York Stock
Exchange for stocks traded on its market.

A management dispute at Tatra, the troubled Czech truck maker, has eased
after the company's main share-holders expressed support for its
American-led rescue team.
A statement issued after a board meeting yesterday said the Czech investment
funds which control 60 per cent of Tatra's equity 'expect to reach agreement
with (the American management team) for continued involvement with Tatra'.
Shareholders met on Tuesday to iron out disagreements over management style.
The team comprises Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-president of Chrysler,
the US carmaker, and Mr Jack Rutherford and Mr David Shelby, two former
executives of International Harvester. They were offered a 15 per cent stake
in the loss-making truck company last year in return for help in returning
it to profit.
Some Czech directors were critical of the management team's commitment to
Tatra. They complained it did not spend enough time at the company to
justify its continued involvement and its reported Dollars 120,000 a month
retainer. Mr Greenwald rejected the criticism, saying the team expected to
fulfil its contract, which continues until next March.

senior Czech management 'for a transition of operating responsibility', the
statement said.
Tatra also said yesterday it had asked the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development to prepare a financial restructuring package. The company
has debts of Kcs3.7bn (Dollars 132m) and has plunged into losses since its
traditional markets in eastern Europe collapsed after the break-up of
Comecon, the former communist trading bloc.

service

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BellSouth, the regional telephone company serving the south-eastern US,
announced plans for a trial of new interactive multimedia video services to
12,000 homes in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, starting next year.
BellSouth has lagged several other large regional US telephone companies in
setting up multimedia trials. However, the plan it announced this week will
have one novel element: it will combine existing analog cable television
services with more advanced digital video services over a shared network.
The use of analog technology means that customers in the trial area can opt
to subscribe to BellSouth's cable television service over their existing
cable operator without having to buy the new set-top box required to receive
the interactive digital services.
Customers will be able to choose between a 60-channel cable television
service and possibly more than 300 digital channels offering services such
as games and movies.
'We believe our proposal represents the fastest, most economical and fairest
way to make these services a reality,' said Mr William Reddersen, a senior
BellSouth executive.
Telephone companies like BellSouth are forbidden by law from providing cable
programming within their own local service region. The company, therefore,
plans to lease the cable channels it is setting up to Vanguard Cable, a
subsidiary of a Texas-based cable company called Prime II Management.
BellSouth is acquiring a stake in another Prime subsidiary.
BellSouth has selected Hewlett-Packard, the computer and instrumentation
group, to provide interactive video servers for the field trial.
In January, Pacific Telesis, the California telephone company, announced it
had selected HP's servers for commercial deployment in four California
markets.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Caterpillar recovery hits a snag
 -A union row is hampering the machinery group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caterpillar, the US heavy equipment and machinery company, has been
returning to strength on the back of the US economic recovery, with sales
and the share price rising steadily since 1992. It is profiting from global
expansion in the mining, trucking, construction, and farm sectors, where it
has its biggest customers.
However, now that Caterpillar's chronic US labour problems have blown up
into a full-scale strike, the company's customers may find themselves
looking for other suppliers. Komatsu of Japan, Caterpillar's main competitor
in equipment, stands to benefit.
Morgan Stanley analyst Mr John Mackin says although the strike 'doesn't
affect the long-term outlook' for Caterpillar, it is bad business for
everyone involved.
The company earned Dollars 345m on sales of Dollars 11.2bn in 1993, a big
improvement over the previous year's losses. In the first quarter of this
year, it reported earnings of Dollars 192m, five times higher than in the
same 1993 quarter.
Wall Street analysts quickly upgraded their earnings estimates, noting that
a 20 per cent gain in first-quarter sales reflected not only the sharp
upturn in US demand, but an unexpected surge in orders overseas.
Caterpillar, they said, could easily earn Dollars 7.50 a share this year,
and as much as Dollars 9 in 1995. The company's share price, which has
trebled from its 1991 low, is forecast to reach Dollars 1.40 by the end of
1995. Although rising interest rates have flattened recent share
appreciation, they have not dampened Wall Street's enthusiasm for the
company.
However, the strike could hit the company's bottom line. The 14,000 United
Autoworkers Union (UAW) members who walked off the job last week had been
working without a contract since April 1992, when Caterpillar ended a bitter
163-day strike by threatening to hire permanent replacements.
Animosity between the union and the company has grown in the intervening
months, with the union building up a strike fund, rumoured to be close to
Dollars 1bn.
'This is a classic labour-management struggle and, with no talks planned,
its just a question of who blinks first,' said Mr John Stark, whose
newsletters track the transportation and machinery industries.
The strike was no surprise to the financial community. 'We built labour
unrest into our credit rating for the company, because they had not been
getting along for quite some time,' says Mr Tom Carroll, a fixed-income
analyst for Duff and Phelps in Chicago. 'Now it's just a question of how
long it lasts.'
Mr Stark says the most immediate problem for Caterpillar is how to honour
long-term supply contracts for its diesel engines.
The company is the second-largest North American supplier of heavy-duty
truck engines, and the heavy truck industry is in the middle of its biggest
rebound, heading toward annual North American production of 200,000 units.
Caterpillar, so far, has managed to maintain production at its key
Mossville, Illinois, diesel engine plant by manning it with salaried
employees and newly-hired workers.
The company has taken on 1,000 employees since September in response to
upbeat production schedules, and has accelerated hiring since the strike.
The company also claims 3,000 employees, or about 20 per cent of
union-affiliated workers, had crossed the picket lines as of Monday. The UAW
strongly disputes those figures.
Mr Jeff Hawkinson of Caterpillar says the diesel engine plant is running at
full production, and the company is 'revising production schedules based on
customer demand' in other product areas.
In some of its big machinery lines, Caterpillar could be in a tight spot.
The company was struggling to keep up with surging demand long before the
strike, putting many products on 'allocation', so they would go directly to
a buyer rather than sit in dealers' inventories.
One more expensive option would be to use its plants in Europe and Japan to
meet US demand. 'We have that ability,' said Mr Hawkinson, 'A lot of
machines we make here (in Peoria, Illinois) are also made in Belgium, and
the excavators we make in Aurora (also in Illinois) are the same as those we
produce in Japan.'

Corning, the US manufacturing group, beat market expectations with strong
sales growth in its second quarter, writes Richard Waters in New York.
The group lifted post-tax profits to Dollars 111.4m, or 54 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 89.8m, or 47 cents a share, in the same period in
1993.
Revenues in the three months to June 19 were Dollars 1.1bn, up 22 per cent
from a year before.
However, around half of the growth stemmed from the acquisition last year of
Damon, a medical testing company.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Camdev posts first quarterly
profit

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Camdev, the surviving company from the 1991-92 collapse and restructuring of
Mr Robert Campeau's property and US retailing empire, has posted its first
quarterly profit.
Camdev remains a substantial owner of office buildings and land in Ottawa
and Toronto. It reported net profit of CDollars 237,000 (USDollars 170,921),
or 4 cents a share, for the three months ended April 30, against a loss of
CDollars 211,000, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were little changed
at CDollars 20m.
However, chairman Mr Stanley Hartt, who was a lawyer and chief-of-staff to
former prime minister Mr Brian Mulroney, warned the profit was mainly due to
a CDollars 1.5m dividend received from a minority-owned California
supermarket chain. He said the chain needed to reinvest its cash, and Camdev
hoped to sell its 12.8 per cent interest.
For the year ended January 1994, Camdev lost CDollars 1.5m, or 24 cents,
against a loss of CDollars 13.7m, or CDollars 2.16, a year earlier.
Mr Hartt said Camdev wanted to expand its property management and
development activities through a new subsidiary, Finreal Properties.
Finreal will buy distressed real estate and manage and develop properties
for sale. It will finance its acquisitions through the capital markets and
eventually be taken public, with Camdev retaining a minority interest.
Earlier this year, the Liechtenstein supreme court dismissed an appeal by
Camdev to seize Mr Campeau's Austrian chateau. The company has other
litigation outstanding, concerning money it says is owed by Mr Campeau.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trizec's senior creditors have threatened to seize the Canadian property
developer's assets unless a group of recalcitrant junior debenture holders
drops its opposition to a CDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 937.5m) debt
restructuring plan.
The junior debenture holders, led by three large US investment funds, are
the only group holding up the proposed recapitalisation. However, even if
they vote against the plan, their objections may be brushed aside by an
Alberta court, whose approval is required for implementation.
Under the plan, control of Trizec would pass from Toronto's Bronfman family
to Horsham, the holding company controlled by Canadian entrepreneur Mr Peter
Munk, and Argo Partnership, a limited partnership managed by New York
financier Mr Gerald O'Connor.
Horsham and Argo will together inject as much as CDollars 1bn into the
company. Much of this will be used to provide a cash payment to creditors
unwilling to accept Trizec securities.
The senior debenture holders, led by Union Bank of Switzerland and including
other European investors, noted in a court affidavit that, despite receiving
less than all the principal and interest due to them, they had agreed to
allow more than CDollars 100m to be distributed to junior debt holders.
Votes on the restructuring plan are scheduled for next Tuesday and
Wednesday.
The senior debt-holders said they planned to enforce their security as
quickly as possible, 'in the event that any class of stakeholders does not
approve the plan by the requisite majority'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Daimler faces cultural upheaval
 -Schrempp's Dasa initiatives could follow him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Jurgen Schrempp walks through the front door of Daimler-Benz's
Stuttgart headquarters next May to take over as chairman, he is likely to
provoke a cultural revolution inside Germany's biggest industrial group, as
he has done during the past five years at its aerospace subsidiary, Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa).
The chain-smoking, 49-year-old head of Dasa was always seen as a front
runner in the race to succeed Mr Edzard Reuter as chairman of Daimler. He
was regarded as Mr Reuter's favourite since he was chosen in 1989 to lead
Daimler's risky expansion into the aerospace business.
The only other serious contender for the top job was Mr Helmut Werner, 57,
the head of Mercedes-Benz, the vehicle subsidiary.
From the beginning, Mr Schrempp brought to Dasa a tough, no-nonsense US
management style coupled with a high political profile. This helped him
negotiate concessions from unions, lobby his country's political
establishment at a time of growing uncertainty over Germany's commitment to
new military programmes, and launch a series of international alliances,
joint ventures and acquisitions to restore Dasa, and Germany, to the
forefront of the international aerospace industry.
Unlike many Stuttgart-based Daimler top executives, he has made a point of
communicating with his workforce and outsiders in a frank and open way. On
Tuesday, he managed to win union agreement for another 10,300 job cuts and
six plant closures at Dasa.
Mr Schrempp has never been frightened to speak his mind. At Dasa he would
regularly discuss the problems of the industry and his group with his
workers over a beer. Before he was asked by Mr Reuter to lead Daimler's role
in restructuring the German aerospace industry, he ruffled feathers at
Stuttgart when, as head of Daimler's South African operations, he opposed
the company's discriminatory employment policies.
Mr Schrempp has always regarded his time in South Africa as one of his most
successful achievements at Daimler, which he joined in 1967. Before being
given the daunting task of running Dasa, he had spent his career in the
group's motor vehicle operations, rising to become number two at the truck
division. He also had a stint in the US in charge of a Daimler commercial
vehicle subsidiary in Cleveland, Ohio, which he restructured and sold off.
But Dasa has undoubtedly been both Mr Schrempp's and Mr Reuter's biggest
industrial gamble. In five years, Mr Schrempp managed to restructure at
breakneck speed the various components of the German aerospace industry
absorbed by Daimler into a coherent group which is Europe's biggest
aerospace company and the world's number three.
Convinced that collaboration and consolidation was the only way ahead for
the aerospace industry, Mr Schrempp forged a strategic alliance with Pratt &amp;
Whitney of the US in the aero-engine sector. He also combined his helicopter
business with those of Aerospatiale of France to create Eurocopter, brought
some Airbus final assembly to Hamburg, and acquired a majority in Fokker,
the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, to give Dasa leadership in the European
regional jet business. He is now discussing space and missiles alliances
with Aerospatiale.
Mr Schrempp was instrumental in getting the Airbus partners to open
discussions with Boeing on jointly developing a superjumbo airliner capable
of carrying 800 passengers or more.
But Daimler's drive into the aerospace business to turn Germany, in Mr
Schrempp's own words, into 'an equal partner with the world leaders and no
longer a junior partner,' has come at a high cost. When he took over at
Dasa, the aerospace industry was flying high with record orders for
commercial aircraft and a strong defence market. But within a year, both the
civil and defence markets slumped into the worst downturn in the industry
since the second world war.
Mr Schrempp found himself in the hot seat. Not only did he have to pursue
Germany's expansionary ambitions in aerospace, but also restructure the
business to adapt to the new difficult circumstances facing the industry.
If there has been a reassessment in Germany and within Daimler of its
adventure into aerospace, it has not changed both Mr Reuter's and Mr
Schrempp's long-term strategic vision. 'I am comfortable with the strategy
but the market is very difficult,' Mr Schrempp said a few months ago.

Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products,
yesterday announced it had agreed to acquire the diagnostic imaging business
of US-based Sterling Winthrop from Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group,
for Dollars 450m.
The acquisition, the largest by a Norwegian group, represents a significant
step for the company in its ambitions to become the world's leading producer
of contrast media, which are used to improve X-ray images.
Hafslund estimates the contrast media market will be worth NKr20bn (Dollars
2.89bn) next year. The deal would give Hafslund a 45 per cent share of the
US market, where its main competitors are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering
of Germany.
'Through this acquisition, Hafslund has achieved its strategic goal of
establishing a presence in its own right in the US pharmaceutical market,
which is the largest in the world, and will thus retain a larger share of
the total added value on its products,' said Mr Svein Aaser, Hafslund
president and chief executive.
The sale also represents an important part of Sanofi's programme of
disposals to help finance its Dollars 1.68bn acquisition of the prescription
pharmaceuticals business of Sterling Winthrop, the healthcare subsidiary of
Eastman Kodak.
Announcing the acquisition of Sterling Winthrop last week, Mr Jean-Francois
Dehecq, Sanofi chairman, indicated some Sterling Winthrop businesses were
not central to Sanofi's strategy and would be sold.
Sanofi said that the specific nature of the diagnostic imaging business,
which involved the production and sale of contrast agents, meant it would
not be part of its strategy. The French company said, however, that it would
retain the sub-licence in Japan for Omnipaque, one of the diagnostic imaging
agents.
Following the deal, Sanofi said the effective price of its US acquisition
had been reduced to Dollars 1.23bn, supporting its forecast that the
purchase of Sterling Winthrop's prescription drugs businesses would raise
earnings per share by up to 15 per cent next year.
In 1993 Sterling's contrast media business generated sales of Dollars 480m.
Hafslund expects to realise annual synergies from the acquisition of up to
Dollars 80m.

Ford-Werke, the German subsidiary of the US motor group, said it would move
out of the red and make at least DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) profit this year,
but warned that the German car market was making only a tentative recovery.
Mr Albert Caspers, chief executive, said new registrations in Germany were
likely to increase by just 2 per cent compared with very bad figures the
year before.
Ford-Werke is the largest subsidiary of the US group. It exports to 60
countries and lost DM132m last year compared with a loss of DM469m in 1992,
but says it made a first-half profit this year.
Mr Caspers blamed the 1993 losses on lower sales and foreign exchange
losses. Turnover in 1993 fell 3.7 per cent to DM21.2bn.
Ford increased its share of the European car market in 1993 to 11.5 per
cent, from 11.2, and maintained a German market share of 9.3 per cent.

<TEXT>
Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, is poised to take control of
Baltica, the country's largest insurance company, following the failure of
the bank and Goldman Sachs, the international investment bank, to find an
alternative buyer.
Danske Bank already has a 32 per cent stake in Baltica and yesterday
announced it has been given an option to acquire a further 23 per cent,
currently owned by Gefion. Until last year Gefion was the parent company to
Baltica operating as Baltica Holding.
Danske said that the intended sale of Baltica had been stopped following a
judgment by the Danish Supreme Court late last year. The judgment appears to
mean that Baltica cannot draw a dividend from its life assurance and pension
savings arm, Danica.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Volvo head says failed merger
hit development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo's vehicle development programme was set back by more than six months
when its plan to merge with France's Renault failed, according to Mr
Bert-Olof Svanholm, chairman of the Swedish vehicle manufacturer.
But he signalled that the restructured company, now concentrating on its
core car and truck making operations, planned to look for acquisitions and
partnerships.
'We have certainly lost more than a half-year in the development of Volvo's
new model programme through the broken merger with Renault. Now we must
raise the tempo,' Mr Svanholm told the Swedish business newspaper Dagens
Industri.
Under Mr Svanholm, who succeeded Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar after Volvo's
withdrawal from the proposed merger last December, Volvo has started selling
off its portfolio of non-motor industry interests.
By the end of 1996, Volvo could raise up to Dollars 5bn, strengthening its
equity-to-assets ratio to 50 per cent and giving it the financial muscle to
develop new models - and look for acquisition opportunities. 'Acquisition of
companies can become a reality for all the companies within Volvo's core
operations,' Mr Svanholm said.
In a veiled criticism of the Gyllenhammar strategy, Mr Svanholm said the
SKr16bn (Dollars 2.1bn) Volvo spent on developing its 850-series car was an
'immense' sum. 'That can hardly be repeated,' he said. The huge cost of
developing new models was one of the reasons cited in the pursuit of the
merger with Renault.
Mr Svanholm said new partnerships and co-operation alliances were under
discussion 'the whole time'. But he said these must be developed by
individual divisions of the company, not the board. 'The more I learn about
alliances and mergers, the more I understand that they must grow from
below,' he added.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch reduces interim
loss to DM50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second-largest steelmaker, yesterday said it lost
DM50m (Dollars 30.6m) in the first six months of this year, compared with a
loss of DM324m in the same period the year before, but remained confident it
would break even this year.
The Essen-based group lost DM590m last year, dragged down by a DM780m loss
in the steel division and a small loss at the engineering unit.
Most of the half-year losses came from the steel division, the only one of
the group's six divisions not making a profit, but the company said these
losses would be 'considerably lower' for the full year.
Orders in the first five months were up 12 per cent on the previous year,
and sales had increased by 5 per cent over the same period, Mr Gerhard
Cromme, chief executive, told the annual meeting.
As part of ongoing restructuring, the steel division, which represented
about 35 per cent of 1993 sales, was last week broken up into four separate
companies, each focusing on different steel products.

FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Montedison chief upbeat on
recovery prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Montedison, the Italian agro-industrial, chemicals and energy group, has
begun to overcome the heavy legacy of debt and alleged mismanagement which
brought it to its knees last year, according to its board.
That was the cautious message given to shareholders yesterday by Mr Guido
Rossi, the group's chairman, and Mr Enrico Bondi, managing director.
It was at last year's shareholder meeting that Montedison revealed
mysterious losses at offshore subsidiaries, and told shareholders that group
losses were 35 per cent higher than originally announced.
The L435bn 'hole' in Montedison's 1992 accounts increased the 1992 group
loss to L1,679bn and triggered a series of judicial and financial
investigations which are still continuing.
For 1993, Montedison announced a net loss of L1,366bn (Dollars 873m) after
extraordinary charges of L1,004bn, including L327bn of writedowns on
overvalued real estate.
Mr Bondi said yesterday that the group's net operating profit had increased
by 33 per cent in the first five months of 1994, compared with the same
period last year, making it possible that Montedison will break even this
year.
He and Mr Rossi, who took over as managing director and chairman immediately
after last year's meeting, also said divestments and restructuring would cut
the group's net financial debt to just under L9,500bn by the end of the
year, compared with L15,841bn at December 31 1993.
Mr Rossi thanked the banks which agreed a rescue plan for Montedison and its
parent, Ferruzzi-Finanziaria (Ferfin), with a L5,400bn refinancing package.
Mr Rossi described the plan, in his letter to shareholders, as 'the largest
out-of-court financial restructuring in history, in terms of the scale of
the indebtedness rescheduled, its geographic dimensions and the number of
parties involved'.
'Without the participation of the banking system, this group would have gone
bankrupt,' Mr Rossi told shareholders yesterday.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: SG Warburg still top analysts - Top houses
seek ways to differentiate services, says Extel survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg Securities is the top rated City research house for the fourth
year running in the annual Extel survey of research analysts. However, its
winning margin was smaller than a year ago.
James Capel, the winner from 1980 to 1990, was the biggest loser, falling
back from second to fourth. It was displaced by NatWest Securities, up from
third to second, and BZW which rose from fifth to third.
Overall, the top houses are becoming more closely bunched, said Mr Geoffrey
Osmint, founder and consulting editor of the survey. This is forcing them to
find ways to differentiate their services to institutional investors.
The investors surveyed perceived, for example, that Warburg devoted more of
its research than other brokers to corporate finance activities. Smith New
Court used much of its analysis for marketmaking while Capel was oriented to
its institutional clients.
Investors remained critical of the high volume and sometimes inadequate
quality of research landing on their desk, according to the survey of 112
institutions with some Pounds 850bn of funds under management.
It was the 21st annual survey and the first since the Financial Times
acquired Extel.
Half the investors said they read only a quarter of the material they
received and most of the other respondents read less than half.
They were particularly critical of the fundamental analysis of companies'
accounts, accounting techniques and financial structure. One third of
managers believed that less than a quarter of the research they received
provided satisfactory analysis in those areas.
The demand for research was growing, with 56 per cent of large fund managers
and 36 per cent of smaller ones expecting to increase their use of
information this year. They wanted, for example, more data on emerging
markets.
However, a growing number of institutions were turning to in-house research.
The trend was strongest among mid-sized managers with Pounds 10bn to Pounds
20bn of funds. Some 60 per cent of them said they planned to do more
research themselves.
There was also a sharp increase in the number of meetings between investors
and company managements.
Fund managers were using more derivatives, typically for tactical asset
allocation. But in general derivatives were being used by only 25 per cent
of the managers surveyed.
In the opinion of institutions surveyed, the best team of analysts was
NatWest's integrated oil group led by Mr Fergus MacLeod.
Second was Kleinwort Benson's water team led by Mr Peter Hyde followed by
Smith New Court's chemicals team led by Mr Charles Lambert.
Mr MacLeod was also the top rated individual analyst, followed by Mr John
Spicer, the breweries analyst at Warburg, and Mr Jamie Stevenson, the
construction and building materials analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
The best single piece of research was 'A profits pathology' written by Mr
Paul Walton and his team at Capel.
Overall, NatWest received the most votes for the content of its research and
Capel and NatWest were rated top for presentation.

Heavitree Brewery reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 507,000 for the six
months to April 30, a rise of 26 per cent on the comparable Pounds 401,000.
The outcome, achieved on turnover of Pounds 3.92m (Pounds 3.85m), was struck
after losses of Pounds 64,000 (profit of Pounds 26,000) on the sale of
properties and lower interest charges of Pounds 154,000 (Pounds 197,000).
Despite its name, the USM-traded group ceased brewing activities in 1970 to
concentrate on operating public houses. Mr William Tucker, chairman, said
the 'good progress' should continue into the second half 'but at a reduced
percentage rate.'
The interim dividend goes up to 1p (0.6p), payable from earnings of 3.8p
(3.2p) per share.

At the same time, Bolton is calling for Pounds 1.2m net by a 1-for-1

The result, on sales of Pounds 2.85m, compared with a Pounds 76,000 deficit
previously on sales of Pounds 2.11m.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 0.2p, payable from earnings
per share of 0.87p (1.73p losses).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On turnover down from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 15.9m John Foster &amp; Son, the
mohair topmaking, worsted and spinning concern, reduced pre-tax losses to
Pounds 1.74m for the year to February 28, against Pounds 5.1m.
Directors stated that difficult trading conditions had continued into the
current year with turnover levels down, but in line with budget.
Accordingly, and as last year, it is not proposed to pay a dividend.
Losses per share were reduced to 15.5p, compared with 45.7p. Net borrowings
fell by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 1.6m.
The directors said the implementation of plans laid 18 months ago for the
company's recovery were almost complete, 'and although we can at last see
light at the end of the tunnel we still expect another difficult year'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Ideal Hardware poised for debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ideal Hardware's crowded sales floor in its south London headquarters looks
more like a foreign exchange trading room than a computer hardware
distribution centre.
In this hot-house atmosphere clusters of salesmen - paid on commission  -
sit in front of computer screens and cut deals on the telephone with
customers for data storage peripherals such as hard disks and optical
storage devices.
The company, founded in 1987 by Mr James Wickes, managing director and Mr
Konrad Goess-Saurau, chairman, has grown into one of the UK's largest
independent distributors of data storage products and is coming to market
via a placing which is expected to value the group at between Pounds 40m and
Pounds 50m.
The data storage market is one of the more secure areas of the fast growing
computer market. According to Dataquest, the market research concern, the UK
data storage market supplied by distributors will be worth more than Dollars
400m (Pounds 263m) this year, increasing to Dollars 700m in 1997. Ideal has
between a 10 and 15 per cent share of the domestic market.
Mr Wickes attributes the market growth to the increase in personal computer
systems, the wider range and complexity of software products, processing
performance gains and the growth of multimedia.
By focusing on the data storage market and emphasising a high level of
customer service - including providing its 2,500 customers with a
CD-Rom-based interactive sales catalogue - Ideal has managed to build itself
a strong market position.
Its supplier list includes Toshiba, IBM, Digital, Compaq, Fujitsu and Conner
while customers fall into three main groups - value-added resellers who
build systems for large corporate clients, corporate resellers and systems
integrators.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 1.58m) in the year to
April 30 on turnover ahead 58 per cent to Pounds 71.8m (Pounds 45.5m).
Operating profits increased almost threefold, bolstered by an improvement in
net margins to almost 6 per cent.
With Pounds 9.35m of cash in the balance sheet and no borrowings at the end
of April, Ideal has no immediate need to raise substantial additional funds,
although the new capital will strengthen a balance sheet which shows net
assets of just Pounds 3m.
However, the stock market debut will provide Mr Goess-Saurau, who owns a
26.2 per cent stake, with an exit. Ideal's three executive directors will
retain more than half the expanded capital after flotation.
The company plans to move to larger premises and expand its current
38-strong sales force substantially.
The placing is sponsored by Charterhouse Tilney Securities. The issue will
be priced on July 14.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Oriel to raise Pounds 4m for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oriel Group, the USM-quoted insurance broker, is raising a net Pounds 4m by
way of a rights issue to pay for expansion. It is also acquiring David
Shapiro and Insurance Administration Consultants for a total of Pounds 3m.
It is offering 4.15m shares at 105p on a 2-for-11 basis. Commitments to
accept in respect of 7.1 per cent of the offer have been received and the
balance has been underwritten. The shares were unchanged at 112p.
The company said that following its acquisition of Warranty Holdings last
year, which was partially funded by debt, it was in a period of rapid growth
which was being hindered by debt levels.
Of the consideration for the purchases Pounds 1.5m will be paid on
completion with the balance paid a year later. The total consideration will
be satisfied by Pounds 2m cash and shares.
Oriel also announced that Mr Richard Hill, recently chairman of Insurance
Service, a Royal Insurance subsidiary, is joining the board and becoming
chief executive of CGA Direct (Insurance Brokers), an Oriel offshoot.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: North West Water's Pounds 672,000 pay-out
to former executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Thian, the former chief executive of North West Water who left the
company abruptly in November last year, has been awarded a compensation
package worth Pounds 672,095.
The pay-off, details of which are given in the company's annual report,
consists of Pounds 398,400 - which includes Pounds 60,000 relating to his
pension arrangements - plus an option on 157,000 shares.
Mr Thian was granted 143,750 shares at 278p on January 30 1990 and a further
13,250 at 315.5p on December 3 1990.
The shares closed at 467p yesterday.
At the time of Mr Thian's resignation, the company said he had left over a
'difference in management styles' between the chief executive and the board.
It was widely believed that the relationship between Mr Thian and Sir
Desmond Pitcher, the chairman, was particularly strained.
Sir Desmond has been awarded a pay package worth Pounds 338,000, a 42 per
cent increase over the package paid to the previous chairman, Mr Dennis
Grove.
Mr Thian joined the privatised water utility in January 1990 and was the
architect of its international water and waste water business.
He had a three-year rolling contract.
Mr Thian was succeeded earlier this year by Mr Brian Staples, former head of
Tarmac's contracting businesss.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Deal marks latest step in rejig of
Wallenberg empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Incentive's sale yesterday of its controlling stake in Esab to Charter is
the latest step in a significant post-recession rejig within itskey
industrial holdings by Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family.
At the same time, Charter's move is the biggest foreign takeover of a
Swedish company since the purchase last year of Nobel Industries by Akzo of
the Netherlands.
Such foreign acquisitions are still rare in Sweden - and were blighted by
the shareholder revolt that last December scuppered Volvo's plan to merge
its vehicle manufacturing with France's Renault.
But Esab, which like Volvo is based in Gothenburg, appeared confident
yesterday that reaction would be positive, as it was when Akzo swallowed
Nobel. The deal certainly went down well with investors in Incentive, who
pushed up the B shares by SKr5 to SKr245 (Pounds 20.77) in an otherwise
nervous market.
The disposal of Esab follows the completion earlier this month of
Incentive's SKr8.4bn acquisition of Cardo, formerly a Volvo offshoot. Both
deals were part of a move by Incentive to reshape its holdings, which form
the main hands-on industrial arm of the Wallenberg empire.
Its activities include power generation, materials handling, and the
Hasselblad camera making operation. It bought Cardo chiefly to get hold of
Gambro, a large medical technology company, to establish Incentive in the
health care industry.
The remnants of Cardo are to be sold off or refloated. The disposal of Esab
leaves Incentive with two main 'misfits' - its holdings in Asea, the Swedish
co-owner of Asea Brown Boveri, the engineering giant, and Electrolux.
Both Asea and Electrolux are core Wallenberg blue chip holdings - but no
longer sit comfortably within an Incentive group concentrating on wholly
owned industrial operations.
Meanwhile, Investor, the main vehicle for the Wallenberg blue-chip
investment portfolio, holds 100 per cent of Saab Scania, the vehicle and
aircraft maker. This has led to much speculation that a larger re-shuffle is
likely between Investor and Incentive to rationalise their holdings.
Investor has itself made a number of dis-posals over the past two years to
cope with a heavy debt burden, but is now signalling a return to a more
offensive phase, looking for new investments overseas. So far, however, the
firm line from Investor is that it has no plans for radical changes in its
existing portfolio.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Charter welds on fourth leg: Andrew Bolger
reports on the offer for Esab, a long-awaited deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was with obvious relief that Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive of
Charter, was able yesterday to unveil the kind of large acquisition which
the market has been waiting for him to make.
The offer for Esab, the Swedish welding company, will more than double the
size of the UK group, which in recent years had been focused into three
areas - building materials, coal and rail track equipment.
Unscrambling Charter's links with Johnson Matthey and Minorco gave the group
its independence - but also the problem of how best to utilise the Pounds
156m in cash left after ending the South African connection.
Mr Herbert said that Charter's market share in its existing niche businesses
was high, so it was difficult to invest more in them - hence the need to
acquire a fourth leg.
The Swedish group fitted perfectly his oft-rehearsed acquisition criteria -
being international, with market leadership and industrial customers in
mature markets, which offer scope for growth and adding value.
According to Charter, Esab is the world market leader in welding products,
and is either number one or two in five of the G7 countries.
Growth prospects partly come from the economic cycle. The level of welding
activity closely tracks GDP growth, and the chart illustrates the forecast
upturn in the market.
Weakened competitors are also a factor. Mr Herbert said US rivals had
expanded rapidly in Europe in the late 1980s 'just the wrong time' and had
withdrawn 'having had their fingers badly burned'.
Charter claims that Lincoln, the US company which is number two to Esab in
world market share, incurred losses of Dollars 134m (Pounds 88.1m) in Europe
from 1990-93 and now has a heavily geared balance sheet.
Esab also suffered in the recession. Operating profits have collapsed from
Pounds 40m in 1989 to Pounds 7m last year. However, the company forecasts
operating profits of Pounds 27m in the current year, and analysts expect at
least Pounds 40m next year.
Mr Herbert said Esab was not any kind of basket case, and he did not see
this as a turnround.
Welding consumables, such as rods and fluxes, which comprise 55 per cent of
turnover, remained profitable throughout the recent downturn. The welding
equipment division, which accounts for 28 per cent of sales, had been losing
money but was 'now turning'.
Esab has spent Pounds 20m over the last three years in restructuring. It has
reduced its western European workforce by 35 per cent and embarked on a
product rationalisation programme.
Charter believes this process can be pushed further. Mr Herbert said Esab's
management was very competent 'but we focus on cash and margin management -
they're not so good on that'.
The UK group runs a lean organisation, with only 30 people in its London
head office. Charter said a direct comparison with the 300 who work at
Esab's head office in Gothenburg would be unfair, since they carried out a
wider range of tasks, but there will clearly be scope for reductions.
Mr Herbert is a firm believer in functional, vertical management on the
Anglo-Saxon model, with executives taking direct responsibility for defined
operations. The Swedish company's matrix management system seems unlikely to
survive for long in the enlarged group. However, Mr Lars Westerberg, who has
been Esab's chief executive since 1990, would remain with the group.
Charter is also keen to discover how transportable Esab products are. The
Swedish group has 16 production units located in Europe, North and South
America and south-east Asia.
Mr Herbert will examine the scope to utilise excess production capacity in
low-cost areas, such as eastern Europe, where Esab has a dominant position.
The quality of output from the eastern European plants was high, he said, so
it might be possible to use some of it in more high-cost economies.
Charter would also want to develop Esab's activities in new markets, such as
Latin America and east Asia, particularly China. The group has a strong
position in Brazil, but so far no presence in China, where it is likely to
go for joint ventures.
Mr Herbert said: 'We've had the time and access for extensive research and
due diligence. As a result I'm convinced this is a business we can grip.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson shares hit by warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market value of Lloyd Thompson fell by about 20 per cent yesterday after
the insurance and reinsurance broker issued a profits warning.
Lloyd, one of the fastest growing and most profitable London brokers in
recent years, said it expected pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 of at
least Pounds 18m.
Analysts had been expecting more than Pounds 19m but the group said
investment income would be substantially lower than anticipated owing to
sharp falls in the value of fixed interest securities and lower interest
rates.
Investment income was expected to be at least Pounds 3.8m, compared with
Pounds 6m last year. Growth in income from core brokerage would be similar
to the 3 per cent reported at the interim stage.
The market reacted by marking the shares down 45p to 185p, a drop of nearly
50 per cent since last summer.
The group also announced the purchase of a 49 per cent stake in Triangle
Holdings, a Bermuda-based broker, in a deal worth up to Dollars 5.39m
(Pounds 3.54m). It has an option, exercisable during the second half of
1997, to acquire the remainder as well as the outstanding minority interests
in Triangle's two subsidiaries
Lloyd will pay an initial Dollars 3m in cash with a further profit-related
consideration of up to Dollars 2.39m.
Triangle's main subsidiary, Triangle Brokerage, specialises in liability
business. Brokerage for the year to December 31 amounted to Dollars 2.1m.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 18% growth at Asprey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions helped Asprey, the jewellery retailer which also owns Garrard
and Mappin &amp; Webb, raise pre-tax profits by almost 18 per cent to Pounds
25.4m in the 12 months to March 31.
Although the Asprey business continued to contribute more than 75 per cent
of profits and 55 per cent of sales, acquisitions made during the past two
years contributed Pounds 18.6m to turnover, helping to push the total up by
almost 30 per cent, from Pounds 144.7m to Pounds 187.6m.
On a year-on-year basis sales rose by 16.8 per cent.
Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, said: 'Margins are under pressure and we
are steadily developing cash-generative businesses to offset our other
operations.'
He said he intended to pursue organic growth by opening more high-street
outlets for Watches of Switzerland and Mappin &amp; Webb.
'Our customer base must be widened so that the effect of future recessions
will not be so severe,' he said.
Mr Attallah added that since acquiring Watches of Switzerland in June 1992
the total number of outlets has been increased to 32.
In the last financial year a new trading name, Zeus, was launched, aimed at
a younger client base and offering a lower price range than Watches of
Switzerland.
A Mappin &amp; Webb shop will be launched in Prague in October. An Asprey office
had been opened in Hong Kong and the Asprey and Garrard operations were
seeking new markets, especially overseas, although the company has for the
time being abandoned plans to open an Asprey store in Shanghai.
Asprey was also considering expanding Les Ambassadeurs, the watch and
jewellery retail chain acquired last year. It also bought Ronald A Lee, an
antique clocks and furniture retailer.
The company has set up a Pounds 20m revolving credit facility with the Bank
of Scotland. At the year end net cash was unchanged at Pounds 13m.
Asprey shares moved from the USM to the Official List last July after Sears,
the retail group, sold its 25 per cent stake in the company.
A final dividend of 4.8p is recommended, making a total of 6.05p (5.1p) for
the year.
Earnings per share jumped to 21.12p (14.44p), after an 'abnormally low tax
charge', due to an over-provision last time.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Float values Exco at Pounds 215m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exco, the money broking group, will be valued at Pounds 215.5m at the
flotation price of 175p announced yesterday.
The price has been set at 9.5 times last year's earnings with a notional
historic dividend yield of 6 per cent.
Mr Ron Sandler, chief executive, said that despite difficult conditions in
the new issue market the response from institutions had been good. 'We had
to spend more time than most companies explaining the business but everyone
wanted to see us.'
About 43 per cent of Exco's shares are being sold with the administrator of
British &amp; Commonwealth disposing of its final 40 per cent holding. Funds by
Gartmore and Robert Fleming are releasing about a quarter of their holdings
and a few shares are being sold by staff. There is no new money being raised
by the company.
Just over 53m shares are being placed with investors by NM Rothschild.
COMMENT
Exco has forecast a jump in profits to Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 21.4m) for the
six months to June prompting analysts to predict up to Pounds 49m for the
full year. That puts the shares at the issue price on a multiple of just 8.
Exco has clearly failed completely to change the idea that money brokers are
highly cyclical businesses, with a reputation for corporate disasters whose
assets can walk out the door. Yet the geographic and product diversity of
the big four has improved the quality of earnings while the increasing
importance of global operations has raised the barriers to entry. Securities
broking may go through a sticky patch in the short-term and there are longer
term pressures in foreign exchange. But there are enough new opportunities
in areas such as derivatives to compensate. Exco looks set for its second
successful flotation.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: United Breweries planning financial
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
United Breweries, controlled by Mr Vijay Mallya, yesterday told its AGM that
it had tabled new financial restructuring proposals to its bankers.
In April UB, formerly Wiltshire Brewery, announced that it had breached bank
lending agreements after a Pounds 7.2m write-down of the value of its
77-strong pub estate.
Guinness Mahon, its adviser, has led the talks with the banks. They include
Allied Irish Bank which sold 37 pubs to Wiltshire Brewery in 1992, National
Home Loans and Allied Trust Bank. The banks' exposure is less than Pounds
10m.
Details of the restructuring plan were not disclosed but they were believed
to include at least one proposed UB acquisition.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring and new products elevate TGI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHTI JEETUN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TGI, the designer and manufacturer of loudspeaker products, reported a surge
in pre-tax profits - from Pounds 409,000 to Pounds 1.25m - in the year to
March 31.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 35.8m (Pounds 34m). Operating profit
expanded to Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 587,000) and retained profit rose to Pounds
694,000 (Pounds 278,000), helping reduce the deficit in the profit and loss
account.
TGI said the improved performance resulted from the introduction of new
products and the benefits of restructuring. Earnings per share expanded 86
per cent to 5.2p (2.8p) while the total dividend is lifted to 2p (1.5p) via
an increased final of 1.4p.
Exports increased to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 22m) and accounted for 69 per cent
of total sales.
Future prospects were said to be good in the light of the substantial
investment made in new products and manufacturing improvements as well as
some Pounds 1.27m spent on research and development. TGI is also considering
strategic acquisitions.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity falls slightly to
Pounds 177m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity said yesterday it was seeking permission from
shareholders to buy back up to 14.9 per cent of its shares as it announced a
3.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits.
Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said this would give the company greater
flexibility but it had not yet decided whether to buy back more shares on
top of the 5 per cent already bought.
In the year to March 31 profits were Pounds 177m (Pounds 186m) after
exceptional costs of Pounds 48.3m (Pounds 1.5m credit), of which Pounds
38.3m (Pounds 13.7m) related to restructuring costs and Pounds 26.8m to a
premium on repurchasing government debt offset by regulatory income from
previous years of Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 15.2m).
Mr Eric Anstee, finance director, said the restruc-turing and bond
exceptionals would both enhance future earnings.
The underlying profit was Pounds 225m (Pounds 182m), he said. This had been
achieved through rigorous cutting of costs, which were down by 11 per cent.
Some 640 staff left the electricity business during the year, leaving the
total at 5,539. The company expects several hundred more to go this year.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.92bn to Pounds 1.85bn. The board is
recommending a final dividend of 16.4p, bringing the total to 23p (19.2p),
up 20 per cent.
There was net cash at the year end of Pounds 55.5m, compared with borrowings
of Pounds 143.2m, which gave gearing of 17 per cent.
The company is also considering changing its name to Eastern Group to
reflect better the widening range of activities.
COMMENT
Once considered the sector dullard, Eastern's star has risen rapidly in the
past 18 months as the management belatedly followed others in cutting costs.
Taking the most obvious available measure, the company has cut 30 per cent
of core jobs since privatisation, probably slightly more than the average
rec in spite of the late start. The market also appears to approve the fancy
footwork shown by Mr Anstee, finance director since the end of last year, in
redeeming government debt, arranging bond issues and implementing share
buy-backs. Assuming a 13 per cent dividend rise this year, yesterday's 27p
price rise to 614p puts the shares on a prospective yield of 5.3 per cent,
near the top of the recs' rating table. Nonetheless, some investment houses
feel that in implementing so much change ahead of the regulatory review the
company may struggle to impress after it is concluded. Others may be playing
a cannier game by holding back the best.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: James Finlay shares dip after profits
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in James Finlay, the overseas trading and financial services group,
fell sharply to 65p in early trading yesterday following a warning that
profits from tea production in Kenya would decline more than expected.
However, the shares later recovered to close at 75p, still down 5p on the
day.
Mr Richard Muir, chairman, blamed the effect of drought in the first four
months of the year, coupled with in- flation and other currency factors.
The group is expecting a tea crop of about 20m kg, compared with an
exceptional 22.3m kg last year.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: HTV signs local cable TV programme deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the west, has signed a deal to make 500
hours of local programmes annually for 140,000 cable homes throughout the
Avon cable franchise area.
The two-hour daily programme, described as 'local info-tainment,' is almost
certainly the most extensive programming relationship between an ITV company
and the cable television industry.
Mr David Treadway, managing director of United Artists Communications, which
commissioned the new programme, said yesterday its success would open new
opportunities for other local programming ventures.
The project will be produced by Hybrid TV, a six strong-team of young media
graduates hired by HTV.
HTV plans to set up two more of the graduate units - one based at Bristol
and the other at HTV's Cardiff centre.
The programme deal follows the decision by Flextech, controlled by TCI of
Denver, the largest cable company in the US, to take a 20 per cent stake in
HTV for about Pounds 27m.
In another example of new local cable programming, Associated Newspapers
plans to launch a 24-hour cable channel, largely based on news, called
Channel One.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tring Intl scores 56% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tring International, the music group which was floated in February,
yesterday ann-ounced a 56 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds
5.2m.
The figure for the year to March 31 compared with Pounds 5.1m forecast in
the flotation prospectus and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.3m in 1992-93.
The group said it was negotiating with several supermarket chains to stock
its low-priced compact discs.
The arrangement with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra had also been expanded
and the RPO would now record 125 albums on the Tring label, rather than the
50 originally agreed.
The group said it had reached an agreement with JVC, the Japanese
electronics company, to distribute its products in China.
Mr Mark Frey, joint chief executive, said legal action against Tring by
music companies PolyGram, MCA and K-Tel International was continuing. The
three companies are suing Tring for alleged copyright violations.
Mr Frey said settlements of previous disputes had shown that any damages
were likely to be small. Tring had indemnities, allowing it to claim any
damages and costs awarded against it from the licensors of the music
concerned.
Mr Frey said he believed there would continue to be a significant price
difference between CDs sold by large companies and by Tring. Tring's CDs
retail at Pounds 3.99 or less.
Turnover in the 12 months rose by 35 per cent to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds
16.5m). Earnings increased to 8.46p (5.47p). As flotation only took place in
February, no dividend is declared. The first dividend will be an interim for
the first half of the current year.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Northern Electric rises 16% and promises
cut in price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Electric, which supplies electricity to the north-east of England,
promised its customers a price reduction later this year after announcing a
16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits.
The exact size of the cut would depend on the outcome of the regulatory
price review, Mr David Morris, chairman, said yesterday. But part of the
money will be due to customers anyway because the official price formula
overestimated the rate of inflation last year.
For the year to March 31 profits rose from Pounds 111.4m to Pounds 128.7m.
The after-tax result was Pounds 98.3m (Pounds 85.3m), equivalent to earnings
per share of 79.8p (69.3p). A recommended final dividend of 17.45p brings
the total for the year to 24.85p (21.45p), a rise of 16 per cent, with
earnings cover unchanged at 3.2.
Turnover rose from Pounds 882.7m to Pounds 1.03bn, with most of the increase
coming from Northern's aggressive move into supplying large customers
outside its area. It now has 9 per cent of this market, including large
contracts with Marks and Spencer, C&amp;A and British Rail. Supply profit was
Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.7m) and the company sees this rising to Pounds 11m
next year because of the effects of the price review and further market
gains. The improved profits were helped by cost-cutting. Staff numbers were
down by 200 over the year, and reductions of that order are foreseen in the
years ahead.
Profits from non-regulated businesses also improved, including retailing and
North Sea gas which Northern recently entered in partnership with Neste, the
Finnish oil company. Mr Morris described diversification ventures as
'important pegs in the ground to secure future growth'.
COMMENT
Northern has never been a City darling, and this was, by its own admission,
an average result. But it bears closer scrutiny. The company has made the
strongest pitch among the recs for the supply market, and is viewed by its
competitors as a ferocious price cutter. So the fact that it is forecasting
a near doubling of supply profits this year suggests that market share is
not being bought at the expense of earnings. It has also gone furthest into
gas exploration and production, and is building an integrated gas supply
business which will be worth watching. However, the recent strength of the
share price owes as much to speculation about a Scots bid as it does to
profit expectations. The prospective yield on a 28p dividend after
yesterday's 23p gain in the share price to 670p is 4.2 per cent, which is
about the average for the sector.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Victory parade or a retreat . . . - The
closing hours of the hostile bid for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 1pm tomorrow Lasmo's defence committee of senior executives and directors
should be able to discard the trappings of a company under siege.
The 'secure' paper shredder, fax and photocopier - the main modern-day
weapons of a company defending itself against a hostile takeover bid - can
be unplugged after two months of steady frontline service. Down can come the
notices dotted around the company's Broadgate headquarters warning staff not
to ' . . .discuss any Lasmo business in lifts, lobbies or any public
places'.
Also due to depart will be a small army of City advisers, who will walk away
in the best traditions of mercenary soldiers with Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m
of shareholders' cash regardless of whether Lasmo is successful or not in
defending against Enterprise Oil's Pounds 1.6bn all-paper bid.
The only question is whether the departures will take the form of a victory
parade or a retreat. And that will depend on the actions over the next 30
hours or so of a relatively small number of UK and US fund managers.
Last night the Lasmo defence team was locked in a 'council of war' to assess
the damage from Enterprise's stock market raid yesterday afternoon, in which
it snapped up about 10 per cent of Lasmo shares - the maximum that
Enterprise was allowed to buy in the market.
The defence committee also had to decide on a course of action for today,
when it makes its final presentations to institutions.
The raid, in which Phillips and Drew Fund Management, Lasmo's biggest
shareholder, sold about half its holding in the company, will be certain to
influence many institutions which have found precious little guidance from
the arguments put forward by the Lasmo and Enterprise camps during the
contest.
'No side has hit home with the killer blow,' said one fund manager yesterday
just before the raid on Lasmo shares.
Enterprise has clung to its original position that there is a sound
industrial case behind the takeover attempt. But it suffered badly from a
clumsy start to the campaign and its initial reluctance to spell out the
benefits in detail.
Many analysts dismiss Enterprise claims that the asset mix of a combined
company would be complementary. Some also challenge the claim that Lasmo
will be unable, in spite of its recent rights issue, to fund all its
promising development opportunities - especially in Algeria and Colombia
where it has recently announced new discoveries.
What is not disputed is the fact that Enterprise would benefit from the
inclusion of Lasmo assets. In the medium term they would bolster cash flow,
improve the balance sheet and add a safety margin to the company's ability
to pay dividends. The broader asset base would also enhance Enterprise's
well-regarded ability to swap and trade assets. That ability was cited
yesterday by one of Lasmo's smaller institutional shareholders as one of the
reasons for supporting the Enterprise bid.
Lasmo has counter-attacked on a number of issues, ranging from Enterprise's
accounting standards, dividend policy and record in international
exploration. But none appears to have had a decisive effect on shareholders.
One UK shareholder which decided yesterday to back Lasmo said it was not so
much its defence that swayed them, as much as a failure on the part of
Enterprise to 'make its case'.
Lasmo's gearing to higher oil prices was another factor cited by some
investors as a reason to stick with the company. The argument that Lasmo's
restructured management team has begun to turn the company's fortunes around
also found some favour with investors.
'It is difficult for the acquirer to convince investors that it will do
something more than what the refurbished Lasmo management team can do,' said
one institutional shareholder. Another, however, found little reason to
support the continuing existence of two large exploration and production
companies. 'Lasmo as a company has had its chance,' he said.
But much of the talk among shareholders before yesterday's raid centred on
cash, or the lack of it. Enterprise claimed that its carefully constructed
all-paper final offer of 36 Enterprise A shares and 13 warrants for every 88
Lasmo shares took into account the concerns of large shareholders in both
companies.
A British investor, however, noted that the 'missing ingredient is cash . .
.that would have led to a much clearer debate'.
That view was shared among investors in the US who up until yesterday held
more than 20 per cent of Lasmo shares. One US investor said before the raid:
"We've told them from day one - cash talks. If they want to put some cash
into the bid, fine. If not, we'll take our chances with Lasmo. Unless they
want to pull a dawn raid, they're out of time.'
It appears from yesterday's events that Enterprise took heed of that
warning. But it remains to be seen whether the effects of the single foray
they are allowed to make in the market will be enough to swing sentiment
behind them.

As foreshadowed at the annual meeting last month, Bluebird Toys is
graduating from the USM to the main market. Dealings in the ordinary shares
and convertible loan stock will commence on July 4.
The directors, headed by Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, have already forecast
a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.99m to not less than Pounds 6.5m for
the first half of 1994.
Earlier this week Mr Norman disposed of 275,000 ordinary shares via a
private placing through Smith New Court Securities.
The sale followed the appointment of Mr Chris Burgin as group chief
executive and Mr Norman's relinquishment of that role.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Pension fund in talks to buy NCP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Parking Corporation, the secretive private company that owns
National Car Parks, is in talks which could lead to its sale for more than
Pounds 700m. It is thought a UK pension fund is proposing to buy the group
from founders Sir Donald Gosling and Mr Ronald Hobson and float it within
three or four years.
National Parking yesterday issued a statement to the Stock Exchange which
said: 'The company has received an approach which may or may not lead to an
offer for all the shares in the company. This approach is being considered
by the board, and shareholders will be notified as soon as there is anything
to report.'
More than half the shares are owned by Sir Donald, 65, and Mr Hobson, who
started the company in 1949 by charging customers 1s 6d a day for parking on
a London bomb site. In 1986 they sold 28 per cent of the shares to City
institutions including Ensign Trust and Royal Insurance.
It is understood they have received approaches in the past two years and
there has been speculation that Mr Hobson in particular might want to take a
less active role.
Sir Donald, thought to be one of the 50 wealthiest people in the UK and a
generous donor to Conservative party funds, has a passion for large yachts.
He has just proposed that a consortium of British businessmen contribute
Pounds 5m each to fund a replacement for the royal yacht Britannia, and has
already pledged his Pounds 5m.
One of the UK's largest private companies, National Parking is not listed on
the stock exchange but its shares are traded under Rule 535 (2). S. J.
Jenkins, which makes a market in the stock, was quoting a price of 550p to
650p after the announcement. The last trade, recorded at 450p, valued the
company at Pounds 529m.
The largest private operator of car parks in the UK, the group also owns the
National Breakdown vehicle recovery service and has a property trading
portfolio which was valued at Pounds 50m last year. The group made a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 53.3m on turnover of Pounds 233.5m in the year to March
1993.
Last year Mr Gordon Layton, group chief executive, was acquitted of
conspiring to defraud rival Europarks. National Car Parks carried out a
three-year campaign of industrial espionage against Europarks to acquire
confidential information. But the defence argued the operation was legal and
was intended to find out whether Europarks was getting leaked information
from National Car Parks.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Third force emerges in high-risk world: Richard Lapper
explains why reinsurers are clubbing together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Re and Cologne Re, respectively the world's fifth and fourth biggest
reinsurance companies, have been circumspect in their comments on this
week's proposed deal which gives the American company majority control of
its erstwhile German rival.
Few financial details have been provided, although analysts estimate the
deal's value at DM2bn (Pounds 800m), and the structure is complex. General
Re will own a majority and Colonia Konzern, Cologne Re's German parent, a
minority of a new Netherlands-based holding company, which in turn will
control Cologne Re.
But the long-term implications are much clearer. The deal creates a powerful
'third force' in the global reinsurance industry, which will challenge the
leadership of Germany's Munich Re and Switzerland's Swiss Re. It also
signals further consolidation in an industry where the growing scale of
risks, faced by insurance buyers and insurance companies alike, underlines
the importance of size and financial strength.
The new venture makes strategic sense for both parties. Cologne Re was
unlikely to obtain the capital it needed to sustain growth from Colonia, now
part of Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurance company.
General Re, which obtains about 85 per cent of its income from the highly
developed North American market, has been exploring the possibility of
expansion in Europe for several years. In 1991 the group entered ultimately
unsuccessful negotiations to acquire the reinsurance business of Royal
Insurance, for example.
Cologne Re, which obtains about 75 per cent of its income from Europe,
shares General Re's approach to reinsurance, concentrating on both
underwriting profitability and technical proficiency. In addition both
companies specialise in relatively high margin 'non-proportional' and
'facultative' business, in which reinsurers have control over premium rates.
Both Munich Re and Swiss Re remain heavily biased towards 'proportional'
business, in which the reinsurer agrees to accept a set portion of the
original premium in return for reinsuring the same proportion of the
original risks, less commission. In non-proportional business the reinsurer
agrees to cover a slice of risk, with payments under the policy triggered
when losses reach a pre-determined level.
In facultative business the reinsurer provides cover for a single large risk
 -such as a chemicals plant or an oil rig - which is simply too big for a
direct insurance company. Both types of business demand a higher level of
technical proficiency, in areas such as risk assessment and surveying, than
is typical in the proportional market.
The transaction also makes sense in view of trends in the broader
reinsurance industry. The position of smaller and medium-sized reinsurance
companies has become less sustainable in recent years. This is because of
increases in both the scale of risks - claims arising out of natural
catastrophes, for instance - and the size of the reinsurer's customers,
since rationalisation in the insurance industry has created bigger
companies.
In London many smaller reinsurance companies and Lloyd's syndicates have
been overwhelmed by a string of catastrophe losses since the late 1980s. The
growing size of these losses, highlighted by hurricane Andrew in 1992 which
inflicted the biggest ever loss on the US insurance industry, has led some
reinsurers to grow in order to diversify their exposure to large-scale
losses. This in turn can reduce the cost of their own reinsurance
protections, purchased in the so-called retrocession (reinsurance of
reinsurance) market.
At the same time, reinsurance brokers have become reluctant to place
business with companies which have less than Pounds 50m in capital, forcing
the survivors to seek mergers or other alliances. 'The bigger and stronger
companies are able to point to their balance sheets and that gives comfort
to the customer,' says one London reinsurance broker.
This has led to consolidation within the reinsurance market. Takeovers have
included this month's purchase of Abeille Re, the reinsurance subsidiary of
the Victoire group, by SCOR, the growing French reinsurance company. The
deal was worth more than FFr2.1bn (Pounds 240m).
Other companies have reduced the size of their reinsurance operations or
withdrawn. In the Lloyd's market the number of reinsurance underwriters has
fallen sharply in recent years and the UK's domestically owned reinsurance
industry has shrunk since the late 1980s. Legal &amp; General sold its
reinsurance arm, Victory Re, to the Dutch group, NRG, in July 1990, while
other British companies such as M&amp;G Re, owned by the Prudential, and Royal
Re have virtually withdrawn from general reinsurance.
As one industry analyst says, 'there has been a sorting out of the industry,
with those companies that offer size, security and capacity coming out on
top. The top seven or eight are playing a different game to the rest.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Dividend up 20% at Eastern Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in UK regional power companies moved ahead for a third day yesterday
as Eastern Electricity, Ipswich-based power distributor, announced a near 20
per cent rise in full-year dividend payments, the highest in the sector so
far this year.
Eastern said the dividend reflected the effects of buying back shares as
well as a successful year, and should not be interpreted as a pointer to
future dividend policy.
However, the increase, together with a 15.85 per cent rise at Northern
Electric, did nothing to dent the growing perception in the market that the
companies' regulatory review would be less severe than feared.
In common with other regional companies, Eastern and Northern would say
nothing about the contents of a 30-page letter they received from Professor
Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, at the weekend. It is thought the
regulator has assuaged some of their worst fears. Most analysts believe that
cuts in distribution prices of as much as 20 per cent from April are now
less likely. These charges account for some 25 per cent of consumers'
electricity bills.
Eastern's 19.8 per cent dividend rise for 1993-94 came in spite of a fall in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 176.8m, from Pounds 193.4m. However, underlying
profit growth, before exceptional charges of Pounds 48.3m, was 24 per cent.
Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said that because Eastern had bought back
shares, the dividend bill of Pounds 59.6m was only 15 per cent ahead of
1992-93, in line with other recs. The company has bought back 5 per cent of
its equity, and is seeking shareholder permission to buy back a further 14.9
per cent. It also announced a Pounds 6 rebate for domestic and small
business customers.
At Northern Electric, the dividend rise was in line with profits, which
increased 15.5 per cent to Pounds 128.7m before tax. Mr David Morris,
chairman, said the Newcastle-based electricity distributor was financially
strong 'and we have every confidence that with further cost reductions we
can continue to pay real dividend increases'. Northern also said it would be
cutting prices to customers this year, but would wait until the regulatory
review before deciding by how much.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Swedish buy doubles Charter's size: UK group offers Pounds
390m for Esab - Shares jump / Rights issue to raise Pounds 93m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Charter jumped 51p to 714p after the UK diversified industrial
group made a recommended offer worth Pounds 390m for Esab, the Swedish
company that makes welding products.
The acquisition, which would more than double the size of the UK group, is
the culmination of a restructuring by Charter, which last year unwound its
links with Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining group.
Charter is offering Pounds 260m in cash for Esab and will assume Pounds 130m
in debt. The offer is being funded from Charter's cash pile of Pounds 156m,
plus the Pounds 93m proceeds of one-for-four rights issue at 560p per share.
The UK's group's offer has already been accepted by Incentive, the
industrial and investment group controlled by the Sweden's powerful
Wallenberg family. Incentive owns 43 per cent of Esab's shares and 49 per
cent of its voting rights. The sale is the latest step in an extensive
reshuffle of the Wallenberg industrial holdings.
Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive of Charter, said: 'I understand that the
other shareholders think it is a reasonable bid.'
Esab, founded in 1904, has annual sales of Pounds 600m and employs 7,000
people in 27 countries. Charter said it was the world market leader in
welding products, with a strong presence in all major industrial countries
except Japan.
Although recession has cut Esab's operating profits from Pounds 40m in 1989
to Pounds 7m last year, they are forecast to recover to Pounds 27m this year
and Pounds 40m in 1995.
Mr JeffreyHerbert said the acquisition would be earnings enhancing for
Charter. This was partly because the investment offered a better return on
the cash that Charter accumulated last year, after it won its independence
by selling its stake in Johnson Matthey and then buying out Minorco's
holding.
Charter said the consumption of welding products closely followed the
economic cycle, and the market was forecast to grow significantly over the
next few years.
Esab has reduced its west European workforce by 35 per cent over the past
three years, and embarked on a product rationalisation programme.
The UK group is likely to continue the restructuring, as well as looking at
ways of using more of Esab's low-cost production capacity in Eastern Europe.
Charter made the rights issue to bolster its balance sheet, given the
assumption of Esab's debt and a Pounds 190m goodwill write-off.
Post-acquisition, it will have gearing of about 49 per cent.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Virgin makes sale to Blockbuster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Blockbuster Entertainment, the US video rental group which owns 19.9 per
cent of Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE), a British video software
developer, is to take control of the company by buying a further 55 per cent
stake from Mr Richard Branson, owner of the Virgin group, and other
shareholders.
Blockbuster said yesterday it intended to sell its entire VIE stake on to
Spelling Entertainment, the Hollywood film production company in which it
has a majority stake, in return for Spelling shares valued at Dollars 165m.
This will boost its stake in Spelling from 70.5 to 77 per cent.
Virgin will get around Dollars 125m in cash from the deal and retain a 10
per cent stake in VIE. Hasbro, the toy manufacturer, holds the remaining 15
per cent.
VIE, with sales this year of around Dollars 200m, develops, publishes and
distributes video games for leading consumer hardware systems, including
Nintendo, Sega and CD-ROM. Its titles include The Seventh Guest - a hit
CD-ROM game last year - and it is also releasing games based on Walt Disney
cartoons.
Blockbuster is diversifying from video retailing into a broad-based
entertainment conglomerate. It bought its initial 19.9 per cent stake in VIE
in January, when the British group was contemplating a flotation in the US.
Mr Robert Devereux, who will continue to head VIE under its new ownership,
said Virgin had decided to sell a majority stake, rather than float, partly
because of poor stock market conditions but mainly because of its view of
the future of the games industry.
Virgin believes that the next two or three years will sort out 'the
companies that dominate the business for the next 10 years'. An alliance
with Blockbuster, with its marketing and distribution strength, would help
secure VIE's position.
Blockbuster has 4,250 retail outlets around the world. Spelling produces
television shows, such as the teenage soap opera Beverly Hills 90210, and
also has a film and television library which could be used in interactive
games. Blockbuster and Virgin already have a joint venture to build music
megastores.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Earnings gap for men now 'widest this century'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wages gap between the best and worst paid male workers in Britain is now
bigger than at any time this century, according to a study by the Institute
for Fiscal Studies.
The institute found the pay gap had widened rapidly since 1977. It says
that, in real terms, hourly wages for men in the bottom tenth of the
earnings league are now below their 1975 level. Wages of the top 10 per cent
are more than 50 per cent higher.
The report, entitled What Has Happened To Wages?, produces new evidence
linking wage levels with education. In 1978 the education 'mark-up' - the
percentage difference in wages between men with some post-school education
and men who left school at the minimum age - was 41 per cent. By 1990 it had
increased to 66 per cent.
However, the study, finds the workforce is becoming significantly better
educated. Almost 20 per cent of workers born after 1957 had some post-school
education, compared with 13 per cent born before 1935.
The study also finds that the rise in inequality cannot simply be explained
in terms of skill and educational differences.
Among men aged 20 to 28 with no post-school education, wages showed
significant variation between 1978 and 1992. Wages for the top 10 per cent
increased 25 per cent while for the bottom 10 per cent wages (in 1994
prices) fell from Pounds 3.64 an hour in 1978 to Pounds 2.95 an hour in
1992.
Overall, 50 per cent of male workers in their 20s earned less per hour in
1992 than the median wage of similar workers in 1978.
The report suggests that a minimum wage or job subsidies should be examined.
It also notes that several countries - including the US, Canada and France -
still have a wider pay disparity than Britain.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Channel tunnel express train service faces further delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel tunnel has been hit by yet another delay with the announcement
yesterday that long-distance passenger rail services will not start before
September at the earliest.
The British, French and Belgian railways said the latest hold-up had been
caused by the complexity of the testing and commissioning programme for the
Eurostar trains, costing Pounds 24m each, to be used on the service between
London, Paris and Brussels. They can run on three different national
electrical power systems and four signalling systems.
Passenger services had been expected to start next month. Freight shuttle
services were launched in May and long-distance container services started
this month.
Jean-Francois Benard, managing director of SNCF, the French railway, said:
'The three networks concluded that there could be no Eurostar opening during
their summer schedules. It won't happen before the last Sunday in
September.'
Tests have been carried out in the three countries but there has been no
intensive testing through the tunnel. 'We need to do a lot of continuous
running between the city centres,' European Passenger Services (EPS), the
British partner in the three-nation rail consortium, said. 'We have got to
get the miles on the trains and ensure they are reliable.'
Eurotunnel, which owns and operates the tunnel, said the Folkestone-Calais
shuttle would not suffer as long a delay, and the setback to long-distance
passenger services would not have a significant impact on revenues.
'The contract between us and the railway companies provides for us to seek
penalties and covers at least part of the losses,' it said.
However, Eurotunnel will have to further revise the financial projections,
most recently updated for its Pounds 858m rights issue earlier this month.
The launch of passenger services still depends on Eurotunnel obtaining
government approval for the tunnel and its operating systems. It hopes to
get it by mid-July.
According to French railway officials, the failure to obtain government
clearance for passenger services was a factor in the delay.

tax evasion concerning his yacht.
The police swooped on Mr Tapie's Paris mansion at 6.05am, five minutes after
the earliest time at which they are allowed to enter private houses, and
were greeted by a string of obscenities by Mr Tapie, whose French
parliamentary immunity against prosecution in this case was removed by the
National Assembly on Tuesday evening.
After being charged with 'insulting representatives of the law', Mr Tapie
appeared before Mrs Eva Joly, an investigating magistrate. She placed him
formally under investigation and released him after impounding his passport
and identity card and confining him to France until July 18.
This is the day before Mr Tapie is due to be sworn as a new Euro-MP,
granting him fresh parliamentary protection. Mrs Joly is understood to have
feared that Mr Tapie might leave the country until July 19 to cover his
temporary lack of immunity.
The latest allegations against Mr Tapie relate to ACT, a company ostensibly
set up to manage his four-masted yacht, the Phocea, as a commercial
enterprise. Investigators allege that Mr Tapie systematically failed to bill
ACT properly for his use of the yacht, thereby artificially increasing ACT's
deficits which Mr Tapie used to decrease his own tax liability. As a result,
the French tax authorities accuse Mr Tapie of underpaying his 1989-91 taxes
by FFr12.4m (Pounds 1.46m).
The other main allegation concerns a FFr80m loan by a Credit Lyonnais
subsidiary in 1992 to ACT, of which FFr55m is said to have been funnelled to
other Tapie companies, with FFr9m going to increase Mr Tapie's stake in the
Olympique-Marseille football club.
On Tuesday, Mr Tapie went before the National Assembly to deny 'any
deliberate action on my part' to defraud the French tax authorities. But
French deputies voted massively, by 462 and 465 votes to 10, to remove his
parliamentary immunity on the two charges.
The vote came after Mr Tapie sought to raise the political stakes as high as
he could. Warning his colleagues of a backlash from the nearly 2.5m people
who had voted for his 'Energie Radicale' list in the June 12 European
election, the leftwing populist politician said that 'if you agree to remove
my immunity, it is to some extent your own immunity that you would be
removing'.
French deputies are only covered by immunity during parliamentary sessions,
and the assembly's regular summer session ends today. But European
parliamentary immunity is full-time, once it starts. However, the Strasbourg
assembly's lawyers admit there is a 'grey zone' about when this immunity
begins.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Dollar hits yen low on Japanese political uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar slipped to a post-1945 low of Y98.55 yesterday amid market
uncertainty about the implications of the appointment of a socialist prime
minister in Japan.
Traders were unsure how Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the new Japanese prime
minister, would handle the US-Japan trade talks. Concern was also expressed
about the Social Democratic party's more sympathetic attitude towards North
Korea.
However, European bond and stock markets stood firm in the face of dollar
weakness.
The fall in the dollar came in spite of an earlier fillip from overnight
comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, saying the US would not
use the dollar as a tool of trade policy.
In the most forthright defence yet of a strong dollar from a senior
administration official, Mr Bentsen told a New York audience: 'A stronger
dollar is better for our economy and better for the world's economy.'
Analysts said it was important that that message was should be repeated by a
broad range of senior administration officials, but emphasised that it was
only one component of a successful defence of the dollar.
Most agree that the Federal Reserve will also have to raise US short-term
interest rates.
Although the US currency remained weak, trade was not particularly heavy.
Confused market conditions have driven many participants to the sidelines,
and there are few signs of heavy speculation against the dollar.
The dollar closed in London at Y98.765 from Y100.210 on Tuesday. Against the
D-Mark it finished at DM1.5825 from DM1.5849.
In London the September long gilt future, helped by a successful
floating-rate note auction, was nearly  3/4 of a point higher. The FT-SE 100
Index closed 37.3 higher at 2946.3.
In France, the CAC Index rose 10.57 to 1936.33 while in Germany, the DAX
jumped 28.04 to 2046.30. Government bonds made modest gains in both
countries.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Bonn sets out EU presidency agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday set out a modest
programme for the country's six-month presidency of the European Union,
which begins tomorrow, insisting that it went no further than what was
agreed by all other member states.
'We will do everything in our power to promote the cause of Europe in this
limited period,' he told the German Bundestag in Bonn.
But he added: 'The German image of Europe is identical with that of our
partners.'
Mr Kinkel's conciliatory comments came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the British
foreign secretary, sought to draw a line under the row between London and
its partners over the Commission presidency by suggesting that 'five or six'
new names were now being discussed as an alternative to Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene.
All were 'broadly acceptable' to the UK, said Mr Hurd.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, took the same tack by stressing Britain's
decision to veto the appointment of the Belgian prime minister did not
foreshadow a decisive shift in Britain's commitment to the EU.
Mr Clarke, in a speech that angered Tory Euro-sceptics, emphasised his
personal support for the eventual goal of economic and monetary union and
said the government was prepared to see a successor to Mr Jacques Delors
committed to deepening as well as widening the European Union.
Diplomats in Brussels are mentioning three names in particular for the
presidency: Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco
Silva, his Portuguese counterpart, and Mr Giulano Amato, the former prime
minister of Italy.
Meanwhile, in a further effort to ensure that Anglo-German relations do not
suffer protracted damage as a result of the clash at Corfu, Mr Kinkel denied
that there was any link between Germany's moves this week to ban British
beef imports and Britain's veto of Mr Dehaene.

The striking aspect about yesterday's dollar fall is that the effect did not
spill over into bond and equity markets. This may be partly because the main
movement was against the yen, and can be considered a spe-cific response to
Japan's political crisis.
But it also looks as though fears that the US may raise interest rates
sharply to defend the dollar are abating, despite the upward revision to
first-quarter growth. It would be unlikely, though, for the problem to go
away as easily as that. The pressures which brought about last week's
turbulence will have to be addressed eventually.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest uptick in the gilts market, some bullish forecasts for commercial
property values, and the purchase of a big City office block by a German
investment fund have breathed some life into property shares. Leading
property companies yesterday outstripped the FT-SE 100 index with British
Land climbing 5 per cent. After a sluggish performance all year, it would be
tempting to assume that property shares may run some more - especially now
that most companies have returned to discounts to net asset values.
This year, rising bond yields have diminished property's appeal by narrowing
the comparative yield. Higher long-term interest rates have also deterred
investors from buying bricks and mortar direct. But at some point, such
arguments will lose their force.
If rising gilts yields really do presage the return of inflation then rents
should rise more quickly. That in turn promises income growth for property
companies, which is the ultimate reason for buying property shares. The
theory is fine; the practice may be somewhat different. Many property
companies own buildings where tenants pay more than open-market rents. Such
portfolios may still not produce income growth for several years.

FT  30 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By the yardsticks used to measure the performance of chairmen of quoted
companies, at least outside Germany, Mr Edzard Reuter's tenure at
Daimler-Benz has not been a success. Daimler-Benz's shares have dropped by
nearly 40 per cent since their historic high point in late 1986 (when Mr
Reuter was still finance director), while the DAX index of Germany's 30
leading shares has risen by 35 per cent. Diversification over that period
has yet to produce shareholder value. Following a spate of acquisitions,
turnover climbed from DM65.5bn in 1986 to DM97.7bn last year, while pre-tax
profits plunged from nearly DM6bn to a loss of DM1.8bn.
This is the background against which Mr Reuter will step down from the
management board next May. His successor is to be Mr Jurgen Schrempp,
currently the chairman of Daimler's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary. He is the
continuity candidate at a time when a fresh approach might have been more
welcome.
Although Mr Schrempp is an enthusiastic cost-cutter himself, he is closely
identified with the strategy of creating an 'integrated technology group'.
By end of the century, Dasa may well be making a profit to rival the
contribution of Mercedes, but the diversification strategy is still a
question of 'jam tomorrow'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Charter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is always pleasing to see a company delivering on promises. By buying a
market-leading position in welding equipment, Charter has deployed its cash
pile in a manner wholly consistent with its stated strategy. A multiple of
around 15 times this year's forecast earnings looks a reasonable price to
pay for a manufacturing business close to its cyclical floor in profits.
Since the acquisition of Esab is being funded with a mixture of surplus cash
and a rights issue priced at a similar multiple, the benefit to earnings per
share should be immediate.
Yet yesterday's 7 per cent rise in Charter's shares suggest that investors
are taking a lot on trust. The group is doubling its sales at a stroke but
has no track record of digesting such large prey. Contrasting management
styles will have to be reconciled without creating damaging waves. And while
Charter has examined Esab in detail, investors were offered little by way of
segmental information yesterday.
For Charter to justify its new premium rating, Esab's operating margins will
have to be restored to double digits within a couple of years. With the
economic cycle moving in its favour - and allowing for some rationalisation
benefits - that is not an impossible task. But Charter must deliver
handsomely on its promise to satisfy the City's high expectations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise's bid for Lasmo would have looked half-hearted if the company had
not been prepared to buy at least some shares for cash in the final stages.
It has not delivered a knock-out blow, though. The gulf between Lasmo's
share price and the value of Enterprise's bid has narrowed but it is still
wide. The fall in Enterprise's share price may well reflect fears that it
could now end up having spent Pounds 159m on a minority stake in Lasmo which
will bring few benefits. Indeed, PDFM, the lucky investor which sold half
its large stake for cash, looks to have come away best of all.
Doubtless other investors, particularly in the US, will complain that they
did not have a similar opportunity to put up their holdings for cash. Had
Enterprise wanted to be strictly fair it could have spread its cash around
and added a 16p cash payment to its paper bid. But that would hardly have
been a winning stroke and the rules of the UK game allow fire power to be
concentrated in this way. Normally that does at least allow the bidder to
pick off the waverers.
Supporters of Enterprise argue that PDFM was a natural port of call since it
is the largest shareholder in Lasmo and since market purchases have to be
carried out quickly. But Enterprise's task would have been easier if PDFM
had been willing to indicate support for the paper offer. The cash could
then have been spent on other investors. There are still a lot to convince,
and it remains an uphill task.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Aux armes capitalists: Russian industry must restructure if
the second phase of privatisation is to attract foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian privatisation is at the end of its beginning: its first phase will
be deemed complete today, its second starts tomorrow when a new tranche of
enterprises is offered for sale to the public and, equally important, to
foreign investors.
The first stage of the privatisation process has, in the 18 months since it
began, put 70-80 per cent of small businesses and shops into private hands;
privatised 15,000 medium and large-scale enterprises, largely by giving
vouchers to the entire population which could be exchanged for shares; made
50m Russians shareholders; transferred nearly two-thirds of the labour force
out of the state sector; created more than 600 mutual, or voucher investment
funds with 40m shareholders.
'We have,' says Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of
privatisation, 'broken the back of the old system. We have created a broad
base of shareholders who have an economic interest in the success of
reform.'
But the speed, and the explicitly political endeavour to create a bourgeois
class much as the Bolsheviks strove to create a working class as their base,
has left many problems unanswered - as critics such as Stanislav Shatalin,
the veteran radical economist, and even participants in the reform process,
agree.
'We can already say that the aims of the privatisation programme have
failed,' says Shatalin, 'mainly because a large part of the companies have
not the financial and material resources to carry through any kind of a
production programme.'
Maxim Boycko, head of the Russian Privatisation Centre, wrote in a harshly
realistic assessment made with Andrei Shleifer, the Harvard economist who
has assisted the privatisation process, that 'most enterprises continue to
be run unchallenged by old management teams, which often lack the human
capital and interest to initiate significant restructuring . . . enterprises
that do want to restructure often lack the capital to move aggressively . .
. private markets have not succeeded in delivering capital to privatised
firms.'
The programme moved so fast because it cut with the grain of
just-post-Soviet society, where the workers and the managers possessed a
huge passive power to block initiatives from the top. They did this
throughout Mikhail Gorbachev's flailing efforts to improve the economy, and
they mean to continue to fight any measures which threaten their jobs. Thus
privatisation was skewed towards the insiders - the workers and the managers
 -giving them, in the option chosen by some 80 per cent of the enterprises,
the right to own 51 per cent of the shares for nothing or for nominal sums.
According to Professor Yevgeny Yasin, head of a council of economic experts
which advises President Boris Yeltsin, the insiders own on average some 70
per cent of the privatised enterprises, 'and want to keep it that way for
what they see as their own security'.
For these reasons, the next stage is, as Chubais puts it, 'the stage of
strategic investment'. It is, or should be, the time when both Russian and
foreign investors come forward with cash, not vouchers, and come into their
rights of ownership. Such rights include changing management, cutting jobs,
shaping up the companies for domestic and foreign competition. Chubais has
fought legions of enemies, especially in the old Russian Supreme Soviet, who
attempted to keep some kind of state control of industry. He has beaten most
of them back, but to keep his shaky initiative he needs Russia's new
capitalists to act as if they know they are capitalists.
The plans which he has presented, approved by the government this week but
which have not yet received presidential approval, are for a programme which
reduces insiders' privileges. Investors will be able to buy, at most, 25 per
cent of the company at favourable - but much less favourable than in the
first privatisation wave - rates. The rest of the shares will be sold for
cash. Regional authorities will be given more powers over the process, which
is a dangerous matter, as Chubais and his colleagues realise, since many are
commanded by anti-reformists. But it is politically necessary.
Chubais' obsession in this second round is to empower the shareholders with
vague rights of which they are mainly unaware. He points to some successes:
his figures show that in 10 per cent of privatised companies, managements
have been changed by shareholders' meetings. But he acknowledges that, for
example, the present bureaucratic approach to bankruptcies means that the
state and not the nominal owners of the enterprises has the final say on
closing a company down.
Further, Chubais wants to make sure that enterprises can buy outright the
land on which they are situated; that agricultural land can be sold easily
(a process which he believes will be lengthy); that a securities market
should be encouraged to emerge; and that most attention be focused on
separating out the enterprises' production functions from their social roles
as providers of everything from cheap food, flats and kindergartens. The
latter would mean a vast shift of responsibility onto the shoulders of
regional and local administrations.
A significant part of Chubais' strategy - though it is touchy, even
inflammatory, in Russia's nationalist-tending political arenas - is to
attract foreign businesses. These have not been wholly absent from the first
phase of privatisation. There have been a number of quiet purchases of
substantial blocks of shares, usually in the secondary market from workers
who wished to sell.
David Pitt-Watson of the Braxton Consulting Group, an international
strategic consultancy, says: 'These will be like a massive win on the
roulette wheel in many cases, because they were so cheap: but it will
probably take around 10 years to collect.'
Now, however, both Russian and foreign financiers are being wooed in earnest
 -at least by some members of a still-divided Russian administration. The
government's view is, as President Yeltsin said on Tuesday, that Russia is
now 'more politically stable than it has been for years'.
Top business people are divided. Says Pyotr Aven, a former trade minister
under Yegor Gaidar, head of the political party Russia's Choice and former
acting prime minister, and now chairman of Alpha Bank, part of the finance
group Alpha Capital, says that 'we are now ready to invest'. He cites cement
plants as one area where his group's capital is already placed, ready to
reap the rewards of the already surging private housing market.
But Vladimir Goussinsky, a prominent Moscow businessman, is more cautious,
and thus more likely to continue to make much of his investment abroad.
Mentioning the project to launch the new-generation Tupolov 204 airliner
with advanced avionics and Rolls-Royce engines, he says that government
persuasion of him and his fellow financiers to support the project has not
worked. He says this is because he does not believe that US and European
aircraft manufacturers will allow it into their viciously-fought markets,
nor that the Russian government has the clout to promote it abroad. Yet
aircraft - or at least airframe - manufacture is one of the few areas where
Russian technology is competitive. If no investment here, then where?
The answer is probably in more humble areas, such as cement plants. Foreign
companies have bought dominant positions in breweries, printing ink
companies, perfume factories, food-processing plants and some engineering
concerns. Though they have invested, in the past six years, less than
Dollars 3bn, they are expected (at least by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
Russian prime minister) to jack that up to Dollars 10bn a year before the
end of the decade.
Some foreigners are enthusiastic: Percy Barnevik, head of ABB Brown Boveri,
the Swedish-Swiss power plant and engineering company has 16 joint ventures
and 3,000 workers in Russia. Barnevik preaches an interactive learning
process between foreigners and Russians, critically learning to trust each
others' long-term commitments. 'The key turning point in our Petersburg
plant Nevski Zavod,' says Barnevik, 'was when we said we would teach 100
managers to speak English. Then they said, 'these foreigners are not just
here for the quick buck'.'
Others are sceptical, like the increasingly bad-tempered oil companies,
battered by taxation, bad or non-existent legislation, the hostility of the
Russian oil barons and, now, organised crime rackets. The latter are losing
their inhibitions about approaching foreign companies for protection money
and prey upon the relatively highly paid, vulnerable Russian employees.
If this is the end of the beginning, the beginning of the end is very far
away. Restructuring, which means shedding management and workers who have
tried to use the first phase as a shield against attack, will be harder than
what has gone before.
'We are not accustomed to seeing ourselves in the world,' says Mr Sergei
Dubynin, the acting finance minister, 'but now we have to compete with other
former Soviet states, and with more successful countries like Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic. Investment has a wide choice.'
Choosing Russia - on the part of Russians as well as foreigners - will be
the critical decision of the rest of this decade.

Angstrem is among the most successful companies in Russia. It epitomises, in
almost textbook form, what privatisation is supposed to do - although it
owes its progress to more than privatisation alone, writes John Lloyd.
Founded in the 1960s, Angstrem was a leader in the Soviet Union's belated
efforts to catch up with the US in micro-technology for space and defence
programmes. It was the leading centre in the 'silicon valley' town of
Zelenograd, 25 miles from Moscow, with more than 6,000 scientists and
researchers working in the fabrication plant and an associated institute.
Two years ago, it became clear to Valery Dshkhunyan, the director, that its
days as a protected state enterprise were numbered. Before privatisation got
under way, he began seeking new markets - in an exercise of initiative rare
for a Soviet-era director.
Moreover, he was prepared to shift production from the most sophisticated
technologies used in space and defence programmes to those better suited to
the consumer market. The stereotypical military plant director, on the other
hand, is a man scornful of making useful tools when he could be making
useless advanced weapons. Dshkhunyan acknowledges that 'certainly, we have
had to move down to a second level of quality'; but he adds that, 'once we
secure niche markets there and get new technology, we can move back up'.
He has also reduced the number of staff by about one-third to a little over
4,000. In part, this reflects a fall in output. But it has also resulted
because 'some people wanted to use their skills to found small businesses of
their own, and others could not adapt to the new circumstances'. Here again,
Dshkhunyan's outlook is atypical: most directors from the old Soviet era
have retained staff, even if many are doing little or no work.
His plant is one of the last to go through the first stage of the
privatisation process; the voucher auctions end today. Though his fellow
managers and the workforce will end up owning about 50 per cent of the
company, he worries that an outside investor will snap up a big stake and
attempt to gain control of the company. 'Many who are now investing want
very quick returns, and that would be bad for this kind of company,' he
says.
It is a very tempting morsel. Its nominal value at privatisation is no more
than Dollars 8m - even though it now exports half its production to hard
currency markets, mainly in South East Asia, and is completing a Dollars 70m
investment in a new facility with the latest available technology.
It is a dramatic example of the undervaluation of Russian assets which the
privatisation process has forced on many companies - although in the case of
many other companies, almost any valuation is too high.
Mr Dshkhunyan needs, above all, a foreign partner - and, with the aid of
Credit Suisse First Boston, he is readying himself for one. He needs a joint
venture in high-quality semiconductors and if he is to be able to put up the
funds to complete the new plant. Moreover, he must have one if he is to open
up new markets and extend the already impressive expertise he himself has
built up in marketing. And he needs constant access to world-class
technology so that the company remains a top Russian producer of
microelectronic products and gadgetry.
He seems a little sad at the passing of the old era but he does not mourn
it. 'We realise that a foreign partner would have little interest in an
association with a state company, and so we must privatise,' he says.
Despite the sacrifices and a certain feeling of loss, Mr Dshkhunyan is
taking the long view, and getting on with it.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Leading Article: A watershed for Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With yesterday's vote to approve Mr Chris Patten's political reforms, Hong
Kong's Legislative Council has begun the final chapter of Britain's tenure.
Elections this year and in 1995 will have the degree of freedom and fairness
sought by the governor. But China promises to reverse the reforms. So we
will not know until after it resumes sovereignty on July 1 1997, whether Mr
Patten's contribution to Hong Kong's political structure will be lasting.
Nevertheless, Mr Patten's role has been positive in several respects. The
very fact that an impassioned and lengthy debate on democratic reform took
place at all in LegCo reflects greater political maturity in Hong Kong for
which the governor can take credit.
He has forced open discussion of issues which many - whether in Hong Kong,
China or Britain - did not want to face. China has had to consider, and to
make clearer, what it means by 'one country, two systems'. Politicians in
Hong Kong have had to stand and be counted on an issue central to its
future. As a result, the transition to Chinese rule is likely to be less of
a voyage into the unknown.
Although the vote did not go as China wanted, the way should now be clear
for important practical aspects of the handover to be dealt with. There have
been welcome indications from Beijing that it is willing to set
disagreements on politics to one side and make progress on other issues. It
is to be hoped that agreements will soon be reached on defence lands and on
financing for the airport, and that progress can be made on topics such as
air services and the many necessary legal changes.
Democratic franchise
Also on the positive side, the reforms themselves broaden the democratic
franchise of indirectly-elected seats, and make voting arrangements fairer,
though leaving Hong Kong a long way from full democracy. This is a modest
advance, which should help to strengthen the underpinnings of Hong Kong's
economic success. However, it will have been of little value, and possibly
counter-productive, if it lasts for only two years - the LegCo elected in
1995 is supposed to last until 1999.
China will have noticed that most LegCo members who gained their seats by
contested election voted for Mr Patten's reforms, and most who were
appointed to their seats voted against them. But it will also see that the
vote nearly went its way in spite of the governor's lobbying efforts.
New elections
Beijing's instinct will naturally be to carry out its promise in 1997 and
arrange new elections to secure a more compliant legislative body. But it
can await the results of the 1995 elections, and the subsequent behaviour of
LegCo, before deciding whether to do so. Even if LegCo, and in particular
some of its members, are objectionable to China, there would seem little
need to disband it if its make-up were broadly acceptable. It should be
remembered that China remains committed to the Basic Law, which sets out
steps towards a fully directly-elected LegCo.
Thus Mr Patten's reforms may not be reversed. Even so, the overall result of
his exercise is to leave Hong Kong in an unfortunate limbo.
It may be that this uncertainty was unavoidable and that it will make little
difference to people in Hong Kong, especially in business, who have long
adapted themselves to the prospect of Chinese sovereignty. But that the
uncertainty exists results from Mr Patten's failure to achieve his original
goals: to improve relations with China and to reach an agreement on the
electoral arrangements. If his up-front approach to China had really paid
off, everybody would be able to view Hong Kong's future with optimism.
Yet these remaining reservations do not prove correct the British
ex-diplomats who would prefer Britain to have settled, on a quiet afternoon
in Beijing, for the best electoral arrangements it could get. The last such
effort to accommodate Beijing before Mr Patten's appointment, an agreement
on the airport secured through a visit to Beijing by Mr John Major, hardly
proved definitive: China then delayed approval for the project's financing
terms in an effort to derail the governor.
Mr Patten's victory at least clarifies the range of options, even if it is
not known which of them Beijing will take.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Healthy effect of league tables
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two striking results emerge from the publication yesterday of hospital
performance league tables for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first
is the marked improvement over the last year in average performance against
many of the 23 indicators used. The second is the enormous variation that
remains between the performance of individual hospitals. The discipline of
league tables must have played a significant role in the first achievement
and should spur progress on the second by encouraging the worst performers
to raise their standards to the level of the best.
It is the variations between different hospitals that should give the most
cause for concern. There are often good reasons why some hospitals do worse
than others in, for example, reducing waiting times for operations. The
distribution of resources is never perfect, and some hospitals have
inherited years of neglect that will take time to remedy. But it is hard to
see any reason why some hospitals should be able to treat virtually all
patients within a year - and most within three months - while others find it
hard to treat more than half their patients in a year. Raising all hospitals
to the average of the top quartile would mean a significant improvement in
the standard of the health service in many parts of the country.
Day surgery
Similar variations can be seen in the use of day surgery. Day surgery is not
the right approach in all cases, since some patients will need to stay in
hospital to recuperate from even the most sophisticated of modern surgical
procedures. But it is hard to fathom why one hospital should be able to
extract all cataracts without an overnight stay while another requires all
such patients to be hospitalised. Prima facie, this suggests an unacceptable
waste of scarce resources in the form of hospital beds.
Even the much criticised punctuality targets are revealing in their
variations. Hospitals that see barely half their outpatients within 30
minutes of the appointed time are still organising themselves for the
benefit of their staff rather than their customers. The best performers are
able to see all or nearly all their outpatients within the 30-minute target
time. Those that cannot achieve this need to put a higher premium on meeting
their patients' needs.
Undesirable outcomes
There is, however, a danger that needs to be guarded against in focusing on
a narrow range of performance indicators. Almost any target can be met if it
is pursued single-mindedly, though the result may be to produce undesirable
outcomes. At the most absurd level, a hospital could score well in the
league tables by discharging patients earlier than is good for their health.
To that extent, those who oppose the publication of league tables have a
point when they say that there are no targets on clinical performance.
That is not an argument against league tables, however, but one for more
appropriate performance indicators. Information on clinical matters such as
death rates while under the scalpel and reinfection rates among discharged
patients is available. In the US, such data are routinely published in
comparable form and highlight unacceptable variations. A priority for the UK
health service is to complement the existing service targets with equally
robust clinical targets to illuminate quality of treatment.
However, the best should not be allowed to become the enemy of the good.
Positive results from publishing comparative information can be seen already
in the improvement in hospital performance since last year. Similar
improvements have also been recorded in school performance, where league
tables are now into their third year.
In that context, the Labour party needs to be more explicit about its plans
for using such information to improve public services. Party spokesmen say
that they are in favour of providing much more data on performance, but are
cagey about whether they would compile league tables. This sounds like a
recipe for a deluge of data that will swamp the customer and offer no basis
for comparison. The greatest improvement in performance will come by
publishing a limited range of indicators in tables that allow easy
comparisons and then making managers accountable for the results.

Fresh evidence of the declining influence of Britain's trade unions: the

to the government's consultative panel on badgers and bovine tuberculosis
this year. Agriculture minister Gillian Shephard says that only those
organisations with a clear and direct concern in the problem need to be

Nice to see Geoffrey Maddrell, chairman of ProShare, add another

Distilleries the official supplier of malt whisky to the Observer column,
but it is one of the dwindling band of companies where some shareholders

As Maddrell is chairman of a pressure group which champions the cause of
little shareholders, Observer will be most upset if he doesn't get rid of
this iniquity in time for next year's agm. If he doesn't, Observer may have

The London Stock Exchange's regulatory news service is always being blamed

announced the name of Edzard Reuter's successor at Daimler-Benz a few
minutes before it should have done. Despite everyone knowing that Jurgen
Schrempp was going to get the job, the stock exchange was forced to cancel
its earlier announcement because the decision on the successor 'had not yet
been agreed'. Twenty-one minutes later, Schrempp got the job. Those Germans
move fast when they have to.

Brazil's army has taken to the streets again, but the troops and armoured
cars on display are this time guarding the country's new currency rather
than planning another coup.
The currency, the Real, comes into force tomorrow and the Central Bank has
called in the army to ride shotgun as it distributes the newly minted notes
and coins to state and private banks. The exercise has proved to be one of
the country's biggest security exercises since Brazil's criminals specialise
in mass hold-ups of armoured cars.
Although the changeover has gone reasonably smoothly, the army may still be
asked to restore public order next Monday when many Brazilians will have
their first chance to change their old notes for new. The problem is that
the banks, the stock exchange and indeed the whole country will close in the
afternoon because that's when Brazil is playing in the next round of the
World Cup.

Grzegorz Kolodko, Poland's energetic new finance minister is slap in the
middle of a major reshuffle designed to bring new blood into the economic
ministries.
Still, he found time to squeeze in a snack this week with George Soros, the
peripatetic philanthropist and financier. Oddly enough, also present was
Jerzy Osiatynski, himself a former finance minister - from the Freedom Union
party, which led the last government - even though his party, now in
opposition, poured scorn on Kolodko's strategy in a parliamentary debate.
Osiatynski may simply have been putting in a good word for Wojciech Misiag,
the hirsute deputy finance minister, whom Kolodko has just sacked.
Misiag has a reputation for being the only person in Poland able to put
together a budget, handle subsequent probing from the International Monetary
Fund, and keep the state purse strings firmly closed against hectoring
politicians desperately seeking funds for their constituencies.
Misiag served five finance ministers including Osiatynski; all of them felt
him indispensable - except Kolodko. Maybe Kolodko was preaching the virtues
of Misiag to Soros, who - apart from his philanthropy in central and eastern
Europe - has seen his Quantum fund recently invest Dollars 133m in the area.
Or maybe Kolodko himself was after a job . . .

<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Denis Alexander (Letters, June 25/26) lacks historical perspective.
The church's persecution and censorship of Copernicus, Galileo, Servetus and
Descartes, hardly adds up to a 'powerful impetus . . . to the emergence of
modern science'. Just to add balance to a one-sided account, Calvin burnt
Servetus when he was on the point of discovering the circulation of blood
and kept him roasting alive for two hours. Bruno was burnt at the stake by
the Inquisition. The Inquisition sentenced Galileo to house arrest for life
and commanded him publicly to renounce Copernicanism.
The 17th century is better described as the time that science liberated
itself from theology. The church fought a rear-guard action right into the
19th century. Darwin delayed publication of the Origin of Species for 20
years, castigating himself as 'The Devil's Chaplain'. The humiliation of
Bishop Wilberforce and the triumph of Huxley's Royal Society marked the
ascendancy of a scientific world view in the eyes of British society.
Over the past half a millennium, religion has retreated from the centre of
an explanation of all that exists to the periphery - it is to science that
one looks first.

<TEXT>
Sir, I thought you might be interested in an experience illustrating the
fame of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. During a brief
stay in London, I tried to look up a friend at the EBRD. Having lost his
card, with the bank's address and telephone number, I took the tube to
Moorgate and asked an underground employee for EBRD's whereabouts.
Understandably, perhaps, he could not help me, but sensibly sent me to ask
at the closest branch of National Westminster Bank.
They would surely know. Alas, the lady at the information desk looked
mystified: 'European Bank - for what? Well, let's look at our handbook.' She
reached for a professional register of London banks. Her assurance swiftly
waned as she looked at me doubtfully. 'Your European bank is not here.'
Becoming impatient, I begged her to look in a normal London telephone
directory. She disappeared, returning after a lengthy delay with the yellow
pages. I already guessed her response: there was no European bank under
'banks and financial institutions'.
At this point, I tried the normal telephone directory information service.
One short call and I had my number. So it is not that the EBRD is completely
unknown in London: it is just no bank. . . ]

FT  30 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cost arguments no way to nuclear
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BECK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Smith's article, 'Future of Sizewell C rests on 3.7p claim'
(June 21), leaves me with the fear that the UK nuclear review will
degenerate into a battle of numbers. Results of cost calculations for large
projects depend on a host of assumptions, with many having a big effect on
the outcome. By the choice of a judicious mixture of assumptions, all within
the plausible range, one can get any result one wishes. We are left with all
parties claiming that their numbers are correct and the others' wrong.
Rather than such a battle, which usually generates much heat but little
light, there are many fundamental issues surrounding nuclear energy which
need debate. Just to mention two:
Whether justified or not, there is a considerable public opposition to
nuclear energy. In other countries (Germany, US, Sweden) this has led to
political parties taking different views, resulting in near-paralysis. Can
one have a successful nuclear industry in a democracy unless there is a
degree of consensus, such as exists in France and Japan, and is this
achievable in the UK?
A highly competitive market structure of many players, which appears to be
the aim of present government thinking, tends to lead away from long-term
strategic decisions to greater emphasis on short-term profit maximisation.
It is not clear how expansion of nuclear energy with its large unit
investment, long delay between decision and start-up and its many political
risks, can fit into such a model unless government decides to affect
commercial decisions by reducing commercial risks. And that raises the issue
of government role. Can investment in electricity be left to the play of
short-term market forces or is there need for a strategic steer? If the
latter, who, except government, can/should provide it?
There are strong differences of views on such points. Their debate will be
more illuminating about the future role of nuclear power in the UK and how
to achieve it than arcane arguments about relative cost advantages of
hypothetical power plants during the first 30 years of the next century.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Recovery alone is not enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The golden rule for economic forecasters is: forecast what has already
happened and stay at the cautious end. The British Treasury's summer
economic forecast obeys both these rules; like other forecasts it tells us
more about the present and the recent past than about the future.
Growth has turned out slightly faster and inflation lower than in the
official forecast late last autumn when the unified Budget was introduced.
These developments have occurred not just in one country but in most
principal western economies.
As a result the Treasury has cautiously raised its 1994 forecast from a
growth rate of 2 1/2 per cent to 2 3/4 per cent, these numbers both being
1/4 per cent lower if North Sea oil output is excluded. Next year the growth
rate is expected to remain at 2 3/4 per cent with or without the North Sea
element. The forecast for the inflation rate has been adjusted rather more.
It is expected to remain at 2 1/2 per cent (excluding mortgage interest
payments) in the final quarter of 1994 and rise only to 2 3/4 per cent next
year - well within the government's 1-4 per cent target range. The Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement projection has accordingly been trimmed back by
Pounds 2bn a year, nearly all due to higher revenue estimates.
The Treasury insists that inflation tends to fall when the output gap - the
difference between actual and potential levels of gross domestic product -
is sufficiently high. Officials are confident that there is still a sizeable
margin of excess capacity and that there will therefore be considerable
further downward pressure on inflation in the medium term. The outbreak of
price competition among British newspapers may tell us more about the
changed economic climate than the spurt in commodity prices or the fall in
bonds.
Indeed it is important for the government not to be panicked by the bond
markets into premature restrictive measures. No one country can resist these
pressures on its own. But they are something that the finance ministers from
the Group of Seven leading industrial countries should tackle together,
preferably at meetings where central bank governors are also present rather
than at the 'summit' to be staged next week as a media event by heads of
government in Naples.
In the UK growth has, quite naturally, been consumer-led. Nevertheless the
forecast current balance of payment deficit is expected to fall slightly, as
a proportion of GDP, to reach 1 1/4 per cent by 1995. This is the one place
where the Treasury is prepared to be more optimistic than its Panel of
Independent Forecasters. Indeed import growth is expected to be 'slower than
usual in relation to the expected growth of demand'. Cost competitiveness is
put at about 15 per cent better than in the second quarter of 1992, before
sterling left the exchange rate mechanism. It is also better than in nearly
all of the past 15 years. The need is thus not to achieve 'competitiveness'
but to keep it and exploit it.
Pay and jobs
As usual, the most interesting aspect of the Treasury forecast lies not in
the predictions but in the observations made en route. For instance
officials admit that employment has yet to show a strong recovery. 'The
implication is that falling participation in the labour market has made some
contribution to the decline in unemployment.' Increased participation in
further and higher education is one reason for diminished participation
rates, but is far from the only one.
Indeed the biggest problem of modern western economies is not the growth
rate but the inter-related ones of low pay and unemployment. For the
market-clearing pay rates for the less well-off have been squeezed
everywhere, showing itself directly in the US and in the form of high and
rising unemployment on the continent of Europe. In Britain, the pay squeeze
is becoming evident well ahead of the job improvement aspects.
Some new evidence of the extent of the squeeze in low pay has been published
by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in a new paper, What Has Happened To
Wages? The summarised conclusion is stark and is illustrated in the
accompanying chart. British workers half-way up the income distribution
(normally called by statisticians the 'median' or '50th percentile')
received a total real pay increase of 35 per cent between 1978 to 1992.
Those 90 per cent of the way up the income distribution (the '90th
percentile') received a pay increase of 50 per cent. On the other hand
workers 10 per cent up from the bottom (the '10th percentile') have not even
recovered from the real pay cut they took under the Labour government's pay
ceilings of 1975-76. (The figures relate to full-time male workers to avoid
the complication caused by increased female participation rates.)
The relative position of workers at the bottom was at its worst since
records began in 1886. The IFS exaggerates the contrast between Britain and
continental Europe. For the position of the low paid is being squeezed in
most countries; and Britain is simply ahead of the others in its move to
more flexible labour markets. The IFS explains the disparities partly in
terms of high returns to skill and education. But this begs the question of
whether these are genuine returns or whether employers are using the
educational system as a quality filter to help choose recruits. In any case
income disparities have increased even within similar educational groups. So
other qualities, such as work attitudes, personal traits and even luck have
also become more important.
The British government has been approaching the problem from the angle of
structural unemployment. At the moment attention is concentrated on the Job
Seekers' allowance, which is to replace both Unemployment Benefit and Income
Support. Valuable time has been frittered away on a turf battle between the
Department of Employment and the Department of Social Security about who is
to administer the new benefit; predictably they are both to have a hand.
A more substantial discussion has been going on about the definition of
'availability for work'. The guiding principle is likely to be a review of
the recipient's attempts to find work - a development of Lord Young's
Restart scheme. A less 'Gradgrind' aspect is to carry further the
reintegration of the employment services and benefit offices. It is
suggested that the same official who places somebody in a job should also
explain to him how to apply for the top-up benefit for low earners known in
the UK as Family Credit.
Another constructive idea is Prof Dennis Snower's, for the transferability
of benefit for a limited period to employers willing to make a net addition
to their labour force. A couple of pilot projects have been launched, but
the DoE is regarded in the rest of Whitehall as dragging its feet in this
regard. All such schemes must have some effect in reducing wages - the whole
idea is to encourage employers to price more people into work without the
workers concerned being forced into poverty.
There is no escaping the changes in the labour market, which confront some
workers with the choice of no pay or low pay. But if they are to choose the
latter without being forced onto unacceptably low standards of living, the
solution would have to be a significant extension of the UK Family Credit
system. This has been advocated by Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, who
is no dewy-eyed sentimentalist.
At present Family Credit does not apply to single people or families without
children. An extension to these groups is now estimated to cost up to Pounds
1bn a year. Although this is real money, it would be a low price to pay for
combining the advantages of a US-style labour market with a European
approach to poverty. Of course, reform should go further and ease some of
the other conditions for drawing this benefit. But it is quite remarkable
that no social security secretary within the past few years has as much as
asked the Treasury for this particular extension.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Books: Cock-a-hoop about the single market - Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN UNION: Creating the Single Market By Lord Cockfield Wiley
Chancery Law Pounds 9.99 185 pages
The single European market programme, once more popularly known as '1992',
has been arguably the most significant advance in the development of the
European Community in recent years. And since Lord Cockfield was the chief
architect of that programme, as senior British commissioner in the first
Delors Commission of 1985-1989, a book by him on this subject is worth
reading.
It has to be said right away Lord Cockfield does not err towards modesty
about his performance in Brussels; on the contrary he inclines to a brisk
and self-satisfied style of autobiography reminiscent of Field Marshal
Bernard Montgomery: 'The prime minister instructed me to move my forces to
the north. I decided to move them south. And of course events proved me
completely right. I won a great victory.'
Here's Lord Cockfield on the drafting of the single market white paper:
'Much of the white paper on the internal market I wrote myself by hand and
indeed I had started drafting before I even came to Brussels. Having been
written originally in English, the white paper is an eminently readable
document.' So there]
Lord Cockfield is as forthright in depicting his battle to maximise his
power base in the new Commission. 'It was, I said, impossible for me, if I
was to complete the job properly and quickly, to be put in the position of
having to argue with other commissioners and their officials. I would
produce the programme; I would consult in such detail as I thought
necessary; I would present the programme to the Commission; they could then
accept it, modify it or reject it. But I was not prepared to get bogged down
in a bureaucratic mess. I was, I said, not simply or primarily a politician;
I had run a major British company and I had run it successfully; this was
that sort of job and that was the way I wanted to run it.'
As the tone of these quotations suggests, Lord Cockfield is not pitching for
a readership of technical experts. If anyone hopes to find an in-depth
explanation of the single market programme and its 300 legislative
proposals, he or she will be disappointed.
Apart from a cursory classification of the barriers between member states -
physical, technical and fiscal - there is simply no detail about the
programme. What we mainly get is a forceful exegesis of Lord Cockfield's
broad strategic objectives, and a touchingly one-sided account of his
complete success in bludgeoning his way through the bureaucratic and
political undergrowth.
But the real subject of the book is the long and counter-productive conflict
between Britain and its partners. One thing the British have the greatest
difficulty understanding, says Cockfield, is that the European Community has
an in-built tendency towards integration. 'The Community always goes
forward; never backward,' he writes. 'At times progress may be slow to the
point where it appears almost to have stopped: but in due time progress will
be resumed. If what has happened in recent years is anything to go by,
people in this country - with distinguished exceptions - simply did not
understand this. They thought they had a tabula rasa on which they could
write anything that took their fancy. They did not; and they could not.'
But Lord Cockfield reserves his special scorn for Mrs Thatcher's
uncomprehending hostility to Europe. 'Deep down Mrs Thatcher was throughout
opposed to the Community,' he says. 'She never understood the Community,
neither its philosophy, its motivation, nor indeed its actual policies and
legal provisions . . . Her support for the internal market programme was
largely based on a misunderstanding. She was convinced throughout that the
Community was simply a free trade area with one or two additions such as the
Common Agricultural Policy, to which she strongly objected . . . She never
seemed to realise that the internal market programme meant that all 12
member states had to conform to a common set of rules and this meant in turn
that the rules had to be embodied in legislation.'
What emerges clearly from Lord Cockfield's account is that Mrs Thatcher was
not really familiar with the Community's basic texts, such as the Treaty of
Rome. He had a difficult meeting with her on the subject of the
harmonisation of VAT rates in Europe (see box).
Lord Cockfield implies Mrs Thatcher must also have been unaware that the
Community was committed to the objectives of economic and monetary union and
of a European social policy, through the Stuttgart Declaration of 1983 and
the Single European Act of 1987, both of which she had signed.
But in this respect, perhaps, Mrs Thatcher was only too representative of
her compatriots. Here is Cockfield on the general attitude of British
politicians to the Community: 'They recall little of its history, know
nothing of its philosophy; and even more striking is the virtually complete
absence of hard, factual knowledge. Perhaps the most trenchant criticism of
all is that they were and remain unaware of these deficiencies.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Lower' gas prices may not seem that
way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN POWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In their vision of lower prices for all gas consumers (Letters, June
24), Mr Ted Trafford and his six colleagues attribute a contrary view, that
there will be 'winners and losers' to the opponents of competition. It is
actually a view held by supporters of competition, including the Gas
Consumers Council and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The latter's
1993 gas report said 'some groups may be worse off than at present', a theme
acknowledged by Ofgas, the industry regulator, and the Department of Trade
and Industry in their joint consultation document's emphasis on the need to
avoid 'unacceptably abrupt price movements for particular groups of
consumers'.
A common objective for the GCC, the DTI and Ofgas, in their support of
competition, must be to minimise or, better still, avoid price increases
during transition from monopoly to competition. British Gas has only until
April 1996 to follow government policy by re-balancing its monopoly tariffs
to the cost-reflective basis which will allow competition to thrive. The
question is whether today's cross-subsidies, which enable British Gas to
supply millions of customers at below cost, are of such a size that their
removal will cause significant price rises for those who use little gas or
live far away from North Sea terminals.
Mr Trafford's prophecy stands a good chance of fulfilment, but if the
promised 'lower' prices are initially higher for many people than they pay
today, those consumers may not see the point of the whole exercise.

<TEXT>
Sir, Thank heaven for Alastair Ross Goobey and his colleagues at PosTel
('PosTel vote threatens top company directors', June 27). It is high time
that all institutions tackled the scandal of executive pay and perks.
Reasoned arguments are ignored; only massive votes at AGMs will serve.
If more institutions follow the PosTel lead they will deserve the full
support of private shareholders who are otherwise easily ignored. I suggest
that any such should solicit proxies to drive home the point that executives
can no longer decide their own terms and conditions without accountability
to the owners at large.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Arts: 'Fiddler on the Roof' revived - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any musical whose first three numbers are 'Tradition', 'Matchmaker,
matchmaker' and 'If I were a rich man' is unstoppably airborne from curtain
up. For its first half at least, Fiddler on the Roof is an example of that
apparent oxymoron, a great musical. Like some of my colleagues, I believe
that serious subjects should be treated as opera or stay as spoken theatre;
anything in between tends to turn out shallow and bathetic. But throughout
Act 1 of this classic 1964 show, currently revived at the London Palladium,
the impetus of words and music are enough to quieten doubts; even to
overcome the occasional hint of under-rehearsed dance or over-relaxed star.
For Topol is back in the town which launched his international fame in this
role. As noted in the Manchester revival half a dozen years ago, his
familiarity with the part of Tevye the milkman has led to effortless
mastery. He can express more with eyes wordlessly widened in mock-modest
amazement than most other actors do by tearing a passion to tatters.
Although he still begins 'If I were a rich man' with rapt, pent-up glee (is
it lese-majeste to see a line of descent from Fagin's 'I'm reviewing the
situation', another sinuously rambling wishful fantasy, in Bart's Oliver?),
his relationship with God (still situated in the gallery, house left) has
grown more casual with the years. The respectful man-to-man tone of Tevye's
grumbles, queries and gentle reproofs to the deity has taken on a genially
hectoring note that suggests he might withdraw his allegiance if pushed too
far. Whose show is it anyway?
Ultimately Shalom Aleichem's, of course. His short stories about the Jewish
communities in small-town Tsarist Russia provided the basis for Joseph
Stein's book and Sheldon Harnick's lyrics; a cultural framework that enables
Jerry Bock's music to tap a rich mine of musical reference in eastern
European modes, oriental rhythms, a touch of the gypsy; a ready-made idiom
that combines gaiety with minor-key melancholy and the constant possibility
of tribulation.
The first act's strength lies in its consistency. In Act 2 Broadway comes to
Anatevka: a number like 'Now I have everything' could belong anywhere on the
Great White Way. And for a while the piece shows its padding; the plot by
now is episodic, no more than the story of how Tevye's daughters find
unsuitable attachments, one after the other. But Tevye's unforgiving
attitude to Chava's love for a goy adds grit to the soft centre; and this
production (Sammy Dallas Bayes, reproducing Jerome Robbins' Broadway
original) gains from excellent casting that differentiates between the girls
 -the timidly proud eagerness of Jacquelyn Yorke's love for her
poverty-stricken little tailor, Jo John's sturdy determination to join her
student radical in Siberia, the bookish quietness of Adi Topol-Margalith's
Chava.
Admirable support, among others, from two ex-Royal National Theatre players:
Peter Darling, whose militant young idealist is a trial run for the
Chekhovian eternal student, and Sara Kestelman, beautifully restrained and
touching as Tevye's sharp-tongued, loyal wife. And only the most rigidly
orthodox will object to casting, as the butcher, an actor called Bacon . . .
The set bears Boris Aronson's name, as in the original production, but looks
rather more like a Christmas card than the Chagall it once evoked. Small
quibbles apart, the show is confirmed as simply one of the best Broadway
musicals, with a courageous ending that makes West Side Story look
sickly-sweet in comparison. The Jews are expelled again. The coloured
backdrop is blank, suddenly abstract. Matchmaker Yente cheerfully decides to
aim for the Holy Land: 'Next year in Jerusalem'. Others go to America. Some
make for Cracow and Warsaw, perhaps westernised Germany. Are they the lucky
ones? Fiddler on the Roof offers no easy comfort for what may lie in the
years ahead.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Arts: Charles bares his soul to the nation - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I blame Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue. It is their American chat shows,
both screened in Britain, which have set the trend for on-screen
self-analysis - for letting it all hang out. Prince Charles, always one for
a pretty trend, has now fallen for this one and came before the nation on
ITV last night in Charles, The Private Man, The Public Role, pouring out his
feelings like one of Donahue's transvestites or Oprah's food-bingers.
He thinks he's 'quite a sort of private person' and also 'one of those
people who searches'. He was interested in 'pursuing the path through the
thicket'. He happens to be one of those people, he can't help it, who 'feel
very strongly and deeply about things'.
Judged as a piece of television it was stunningly long winded (two and a
half hours) and, throughout many of its travelogue sequences,
narcoleptically dull. If there is anything less interesting in the world
than standing in a desert or on a podium making diplomatic speeches, it is
surely watching somebody else's home movies of the event afterwards, even if
Philip Bonham-Carter's photography was as good as ever.
But of course this was not simply a piece of television, this was the big
push in the charm offensive aimed at winning back ground after the hugely
successful PR campaign staged by Charles' estranged wife, the Princess of
Wales. Will it work? Hard to be sure, but if you consider it as a piece of
modern marketing, aimed at promoting a career, you would have to say that
the film makers faced a tough job.
Their subject, judging from this programme, is a man who on the one hand is
keen to take on the top appointment with all its power and riches, not to
mention a degree of kow-towing from those around him which looks positively
medieval. On the other hand he loathes the limelight, detests the mass media
(accusations of prurience crop up twice in this context) and sulks when
asked to take on public responsibilities which he does not fancy.
Furthermore he manages to combine reticence bordering on modesty in some
respects with remarkable conceit in others. His account of his own
supposedly admirable behaviour after the fatal Klosters accident was
squirm-making.
Boil it all down and there was little that was really new to be learned from
this programme. Prince Charles would rather be defender of all faiths than
one. Yes he was unfaithful to his wife, though we still do not know the
precise ins and outs of the Camilla Parker Bowles story. He favours some
form of national service, military or otherwise, sees nothing wrong in being
a super arms salesman for Britain, and would indeed go further and run the
British armed forces as Global Mercenaries plc.
Those were the revelations, but the significance of the programme lies
elsewhere. This was the latest in a sequence which began in 1953 when the
royals overruled the politicians and allowed the cameras into Westminster
Abbey so that the public could watch the crowning of Charles' mother. The
entire saga might be called 'Monarchy On The Box' or perhaps 'WestEnders'.
It has proceeded via the famous 1969 film Royal Family, and increasingly
'intimate' Christmas broadcasts and other documentaries, to yesterday's
programme.
For nearly four decades the received wisdom, shared by the present writer,
was that the Windsors were masters of the medium, brilliantly exploiting
modern mass communications to extend one of the world's most ancient
monarchies into the 21st century by way of popular acclaim. Yesterday's
monumental commercial must cast deep doubt on that idea.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Arts: Russian drama in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARKADY OSTROVSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's first big season in Paris was in 1909, with Diaghilev's Ballet
Russe. Now, Theatre De L' Europe Odeon in Paris has decided to revive the
tradition. It has announced a Russian season, this time of drama, and
invited two directors - Lev Dodin, the well-known artistic director of the
famous Maly Theatre from Petersburg; and the completely unknown 25-year-old
Ivan Popovskii, director of the new Studio of Petr Fomenko.
'This was a huge risk', says the Odeon's director, Borja Sitja, 'but we
wanted to give a chance to a young Russian company'. For the young Russian
company, however, touring in the west is not just a chance to show their
work to the world, but also the only way to survive economically; Lev
Dodin's company, for example, spends more time abroad than in Russia -
prompting the Russian critic Anatoly Smelyanskii to remark: 'It will soon be
necessary to set up a Russian season in Moscow, not in Paris'. But the young
actors of Fomenko Studio realise the primary importance of their work in
Russia.
For the Russian season in Paris, Ivan Popovskii did not just chose a
'typically Russian play' but one which interested him artistically:
Aleksandr Blok's The Show-Booth, or Baraque de Foire, which is little-known
in the west and rarely done in Russia. Written in 1906 and originally not
intended for theatre, this 'lyric drama', as Blok called it, was produced
the same year by the great Vsevolod Meyerkhold and was seen as a sign of a
new century.
In this symbolistic drama, mysticism and death are confronted with the
life-enhancing theatre element in the form of commedia del' arte characters.
Pierrot, Colombina and Harlequino break through the boundaries of their
stories and start living lives of their own. Death turns into Colombina;
masks conceal facelessness; Harlequino breaks through the window made out of
paper and the whole world turns out to be just a dream.
Ivan Popovskii's production lacks any tragic atmosphere. This young director
is not interested in linking his work to the modern history; his imagination
is occupied with theatrical effects. Although not the most deep, it is
certainly one of the most beautiful productions done by a Russian company in
recent years. The scenery, designed by Vladimir Maximov, plays a role of its
own.
The production turns into a series of beautiful pictures, full of
breathtaking, almost cinematographical, effects. In the last scene all the
characters walk out through the white walls of an irregularly shaped room,
made out of paper, leaving man-size dark holes. The wind makes the scraps of
paper tremble and a draught brings into the room a strange woman in black
who goes through the lighted aisle of the auditorium and disappears in
darkness.
This strange, dark figure comes from another play by Blok, The Unknown, or
L' Inconnue, a play about vulgarity, a poet and his illusions. Here
Popovskii has given the poet the opportunity to meet his double from
Show-Booth - Pierrot. These two romantics, one in black, the other in white,
go through the series of Popovskii's tableaux like two Picasso figures,
never looking at each other but as if connected by an invisible string.
Popovskii's production reminds one that besides everything else, theatre can
be beautiful and rich in its visual effects. The main problem of this
production in Paris, however, is that the lighting, scenery and sound
effects take the priority and leave little space to actors and the author.
Popovskii gets carried away by theatre facilities that are not available in
Russia. Like someone who has not eaten properly for a long time, he falls
upon the cakes and forgets about the meat.
The Show-Booth tours France next year.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Arts: The angels who fell to earth - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Angels fly about the air in Faraway, So Close, Wim Wenders' 'sequel' to
Wings Of Desire, seeking landing strips on a troubled Earth. Beguiling and
maddening in equal measure, this film about a state of crisis in modern
Europe embodies the state of crisis in modern European cinema. Where can
those angels we call movie-makers - messengers from one zone of wisdom to
another - land in the new chaos of dissolving cultures? And how do you
achieve touchdown when air traffic control is run from the Tower of Babel?
Tremble at the mixed-nation cast. Germany's Otto Sander and Bruno Ganz play
the volunteer 'fallen' angels who try to help the lives and loves of
post-unification Berliners. Russia's Mikhail Gorbachev guests through as
himself, musing about peace, political harmony and the 'sense of existence.'
And from America Peter Falk and singer Lou Reed play themselves while Willem
Dafoe snarls suavely as a symbolic Mephistopheles figure called Emit Flesti
(spell it backwards).
When Icarus, mythology's most famous 'angel', flew too near the sun he
burned his wings and fell to earth in a Brueghel painting. Much the same is
happening today to Wenders. With this film following Until The End Of The
World, Germany's finest living director strives to soar but instead tends to
achieve a series of bizarre, offshore splashdowns.
Faraway, So Close starts with intimations of mortality and ends with
imitations of Alastair McLean. We begin with angel Otto Sander taking human
form to help the needy in conflict-ridden Berlin: where the Wall's fall has
unified a polis but not a people. Then the film marches on towards its
jaw-droppingly dotty last act. A raid on an arms vault by an army of trapeze
artists; a hi-jacked barge; a mid-air shoot-out; and dear Horst (The
Magnificent Seven) Buchholz brought out of seclusion to play chief baddie.
Two-and-a-half hours is a long time in European movie-watching. We have
metaphysical warblings about time and memory. We have a swell of subplots
touching on motherhood, bereavement, Nazi guilt. And via Reed and Falk, we
have Wenders re-airing his love-hate feelings about American pop culture.
The movie's aim is to be a massive fable about detente. But what is its
effect? With all this multi-thematic flying about, the characters seem less
like angels in action, more like bees dementedly sipping at every pollen
source in the geo-cultural garden. Next time round, the director of Alice In
The Cities, Kings Of The Road and Paris, Texas should surely give us once
more a film in which we feel the terra firma of a unified theme and story
and a set of believable, terrestrial people.
But summer madness is hitting everyone. Like Wenders, Spain's Pedro
Almodovar has fallen in love with his own repertory troupe - and repertory
tropes. Kika is another tale of sex, murder and runaway production design
from the director of High Heels and Women On The Verge Of A Nervous
Breakdown.
Lollipop colours scream from the walls as the well-known divas flit through
the excuse for a plot. Victoria Abril is the camera-helmeted,
Gaultier-dressed reporter from a TV true crimes show; Rossy De Palma is the
lesbian maid; and Veronique Forque is the freelance scatterbrain who
undergoes the marathon rape scene which is this film's claim to notoriety.
(Every Almodovar movie must have one.)
Newcomer Peter Coyote looks confused as the hero, an American writer dubbed
into Spanish. But then what chance does any fresh acting face have in the
oeuvre of a man whose work has come to resemble one long
blood-and-sperm-spattered fashion show? No need to look for the guilty
person in any of these plots. The director did it, aided by his designers.
For a superior example of New Spanish Cinema, try Bigas Luna's Golden Balls.
This too has a sex scene every five minutes; this too is shot as if by a
contortionist with a craze for primary colours. But unlike Luna's last film,
the inchoate hymn to machismo Jamon Jamon, this movie is choate and even
anti-macho. A young man (Javier Bardem) longs to build tall buildings, to
match his vaunting virility. But in a tale of funny, fateful symbolic eclat
 -watch out for the eggs and lobsters - he is undone by his own dreams and
by the sharply-characterised women in his life. Commended.
Modern dietary wisdom tells us that all food that is good for you tastes
awful and vice versa. Cinema is the same. Newest addition to the revisionist
Western trend that has given us such flavourless PC epics as Dances With
Wolves and The Ballad Of Little Jo is Bad Girls. This shows what happens
when four saloon prostitutes decide they have had enough of male
exploitation and hit the then little-developed highway known as Old Feminist
Trail.
Madeleine Stowe ties on a holster to sort out bandit and ex-flame James
Russo. Mary Stuart Masterson eggs the girls on towards Oregon where she has
a land claim. (But gosh-damn the MCP lawmakers] She learns she cannot claim
it without a husband.) Andie MacDowell escapes from jail and thinks of
setting herself up on a farm. And Drew Barrymore has a score to settle with
some men in her life.
And then there is the dialogue. 'If your laws don't include me, then they
don't apply to me either.' We had that line in Little Jo: will it be
compulsory in every feminist western? And, as the four women sit round a
camp-fire dreaming of owning a sawmill: 'We sell our bodies - why can't we
sell wood?'
They certainly spend most of the film selling old saws. It took five people
to write the story and script for Bad Girls: four to type, presumably, while
the other fished around in old fortune-cookie wrappings for moral quips and
mottoes. Jonathan Kaplan directs, as if he had never made a good feminist
movie like The Accused and Heart Like A Wheel.
The Getaway wins the Pointless Remake of the Year award. The 1972 Peckinpah
film with McQueen and McGraw was no masterpiece; but at least its tale of a
hoodlum couple zigzagging across the West with a bundle of bank loot and an
unholy alliance of pursuers (FBI posse, rival hoodlum) allowed us two hours
of harmless disbelief-suspension.
The new film defies credibility. Alec Baldwin, expert at citified spivs, is
the runabout open-air anti-hero. Kim Basinger, she of the lymphatic pout and
'Take your time, dear' acting talent, is expected to provide the
hair-trigger reaction shots. Between them, as they pound across Arizona/New
Mexico in a gas-guzzling script by Walter Hill and Amy Jones (based on Jim
Thompson's novel), this couple has all the outlaw charisma of a pair of
runaway tax-dodgers seeking a night at a Days Inn.
You may as well shrug off hope for better American things and see Lightnin'
Jack. This hit-and-miss comedy Western about a man, a young black
hostage-turned-sidekick (Cuba Gooding Jr) and an unreconstructed saloon girl
(Beverly D'Angelo) has never heard of political correctness. But it has
heard of charm and jokes. And it brings back Paul 'Crocodile Dundee' Hogan
as writer-star, never letting too many minutes go by without putting another
quip on the barby.

What on earth is happening to the world of classical music? Ever since it
originated in the Third Programme, the home of classical music on BBC radio,
now called Radio 3, has been regarded as the last redoubt of highbrow taste.
But if you told BBC mandarins that it was mad not to run a popular classical
network, they muttered about turning Bach into aural wallpaper. Then
commercial radio launched Classic FM, which took millions of listeners from
the BBC. Their Evening Concert (8.00) tended to offer the sort of lollipops
that made Radio 3 men wince. But now what do you find? At 7.30 today,
pre-empting the Classic FM concert by half an hour, Radio 3 broadcasts the
BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra playing Tchaikovsky's Capriccio Italien and
then Rachmaninov's second piano concerto (yes, Brief Encounter) with pianist
Dmitri Alexeev. And the Classic concert? Today it features contemporary
British music including the broadcast premiere of George Lloyd's Symphonic
Mass performed by the Brighton Festival Chorus and the Bournemouth Symphony
Orchestra. Just who is stealing whose clothes?

FT  30 JUN 94 / Technology: Life after linseed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waste straw left over from farmers' linseed harvest could be put to use
making biodegradable matting for soaking up oil spills. This was one finding
from a project to investigate industrial uses for fibre crops.
The Pounds 1.9m Fibrelin project, co-ordinated by the Silsoe Research
Institute in Bedford, is looking at new ways of using the straw which is
normally discarded after the harvest of the bright blue linseed crop. The
crop is grown for its oilseed which is used in animal feed and industrial
processes.
'It will add significant value for farmers by creating a new market for
another part of the crop,' says David Bruce, project co-ordinator. The
government is partly funding the three-year project to find non-food
applications for farm crops. Demand for natural fibres from the fashion
industry is currently high, but Bruce is looking at more stable industrial
markets for their long-term potential.
The linseed fibres can be made into non-woven textiles for use in matting
such as carpet underlay. Biodegradable mats can also be used to stop erosion
on newly-disturbed soil, eventually decaying and leaving no residue.
It is the absorbency of the matting that makes it suitable for soaking up
oil spills. Bruce says the National Rivers Authority is looking at the
potential of the fibre mats for use in pollution control.
A decorticator machine which separates and combs out the fibres from the
linseed straw will enable commercial production of the mats. The machine, to
be in use by September, also separates the central woody core which can then
be used to make boarding.
The Fibrelin project
comprises five industrial companies and five research institutes. It is also
investigating the potential of other crops such as nettles.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Technology: Pill caps get smart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARJORIE SHAFFER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If people with epilepsy or severe high blood pressure forget to take their
medicine they can become very ill and land in hospital. Some people with
tuberculosis have developed new strains of the virus resistant to all known
antibiotics, simply because they forgot to take their pills.
Non-compliance, medical jargon for failing to follow doctors' prescriptions,
is a common problem. Researchers have estimated that some l0 per cent of
hospital admissions among the elderly are related to this failure. According
to some US surveys, non-compliance adds billions of dollars each year to
hospitalisation costs.
A small company called Aprex in California's Silicon Valley has come up with
a novel approach to the problem - a computer chip in the cap of a bottle
that records each time the bottle is opened. The cap looks like the face of
a digital watch, showing the time and date and telling patients how long it
has been since they last opened the bottle. In some models an alarm will
ring when it is time for a pill to be taken.
Data from the smart-bottle technology, dubbed Medication Management System
or Mems, can be transferred to doctors' computers. 'This technology offers
doctors another diagnostic tool,' says Janice Wohltmann, who heads Aprex.
'When patients aren't getting better, doctors can assess whether that is due
to non-compliance.'
Some 50 pharmaceutical companies worldwide have used Mems in clinical trials
of new medicines, to see if patients followed drug regimens. Data is fed
through the Mems system to the drug companies.
The companies are being pressed to show that their pills are cost-effective.
John Urquhart, a co-founder of Aprex, believes that smart bottles may be
just what they need to show that taking medicine on time can save money.

FT  30 JUN 94 / People: New broom sweeps through Macdonald Martin
Distilleries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Geoffrey Maddrell, aged 57, chairman of ProShare, succeeded David Macdonald
as chairman of Macdonald Martin Distilleries yesterday.
At the same time, Macdonald Martin - best known for Glenmorangie single malt
whisky - announced that Neil McKerrow, the group's 49-year-old managing
director, had resigned from the board.
McKerrow, whose resignation was a surprise, joined the group in 1975 as
sales and marketing director and took over as managing director in 1987. He
is credited with the building of the Glenmorangie brand.
The new chairman paid tribute to McKerrow for developing 'a sound platform
for the strategic development of the company in the UK and international
markets'. However, Maddrell said he had decided that the company now needed
'a different approach' and added that he felt 'it was the right time to make
a change'. He said the parting was amicable.
McKerrow was employed on a three-year contract and Maddrell acknowledged
yesterday that there will be some form of compensation payment but that this
was now 'the subject of negotiation'.
Maddrell is a former chief executive of the Tootal textiles group which was
taken over by Coats Viyella in 1991 and joined the Macdonald Martin board as
an independent director in January.
One of his first tasks as chairman will be to establish the next phase of
development for Macdonald Martin and appoint a new managing director  - a
process he hopes to complete over the next few months.
Macdonald, who remains on the board as a non-executive director, retired as
chairman after reaching 60 and having served the company for 43 years.

FT  30 JUN 94 / People: Global task for NatWest's Jaskel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Jaskel, 48, a former gilts salesman, has been given the job of
welding National Westminster Bank's various trade finance operations into a
single global business.
Jaskel, who joined NatWest in 1990 after a career with various City
stockbrokers, has been appointed to the new post of managing director,
global trade and banking services. He will be responsible for co-ordinating
the development of the international trade activities of the bank's four
main operations - NatWest Markets, UK branch business, NatWest Bancorp and
international - and will have a staff of around 1,800. He will report to
Roger Byatt, deputy chief executive of NatWest Markets.
Jaskel's new post is a result of a three-month project he carried out for
Derek Wanless, NatWest's group chief executive. Wanless wanted a more
focused trade finance operation which could be expanded on a global basis
and would utilise the synergies that exist within the group. As part of the
change, two new businesses are being created: structured trade finance,
concentrating on large corporates' specialised needs; and a banking
institutions group, responsible for marketing high value-added products.
Jaskel is not being replaced as director, global marketing in NatWest
Treasury, and his responsibilities will taken on by the three regional
directors.
Michael Kershaw, 42, head of project finance at British Telecommunications,
has joined Samuel Montagu to head its new project advisory and finance unit.
The new unit, part of Montagu's specialised financing division, will
concentrate on advising and arranging finance for projects in the UK and
continental Europe. Kershaw's background is in the utilities and
construction industries. Before joining BT, he worked for Balfour Beatty and
Hawker Siddeley.

Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge University is to become the 15th ASTRONOMER
ROYAL. The Queen has appointed him to succeed Arnold Wolfendale of Durham
University next January to a post created by Charles II in 1675.
The Astronomer Royal lost his responsibilities in 1972, when the position
was detached from the directorship of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Now
it is purely honorary, carrying no stipend and no duties beyond a general
obligation to act as an ambassador for astronomy.
Rees, 52, is a distinguished cosmologist who already devotes a lot of energy
to popularising the subject. 'The Astronomer Royal is now rather like the
Poet Laureate,' he says. 'There is no analogous post for the other sciences
 -no Chemist Royal or Master of the Queen's Physics - so one should take
every opportunity to speak up not only for astronomy but for science as a
whole.'
Rees will have plenty of opportunity to do that next year, when he will also
be President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.
Wolfendale, 67, has spoken out not only for astronomy but also for
scientific Christianity during his three years in the post. He made a
notable contribution to BBC Television's Songs of Praise broadcast from
Durham Cathedral last November, using the building's great rose window as an
analogy for the history of the universe after the Big Bang.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Agencies called to
account - Surprising findings come from a new survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertising budgets in many UK companies were scrutinised and then slashed
during the recession. Since then, it is often said, there has been a
profound shift in attitudes at the top of organisations.
The claim is that it is no longer possible - as it often was in the past -
to justify an advertising budget by looking at what has been spent
historically and adding a dollop for good measure. There has been a
permanent shift to 'below-the-line' activity such as sales promotions, while
agencies are increasingly being called to account for their effectiveness.
The truth of these claims is largely borne out by a survey of the largest
advertisers conducted jointly for the Financial Times and the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising*. Market researchers Audience Selection
interviewed 156 chief executives, finance directors and marketing directors
about attitudes to advertising, as well as wider marketing issues.
However, while there has been a sharpening of scrutiny and more demand for
accountability, there appears to have been no weakening in the long-term
importance of advertising. The IPA concludes that 'despite (advertising)
industry loss of self-confidence, this study serves to reconfirm the value
and status of effective advertising among mainstream advertisers'.
Forty-five per cent of the sample considered that advertising was becoming
more important to their companies, while a further 50 per cent thought there
had been no change. More than three-quarters of the sample disagreed that it
was difficult to argue for an increased budget, although half felt the
pressure was always on ways to reduce spending levels. Over three-quarters
agreed that 'the recession has taught us to question marketing spending more
than we used to'.
Other findings include:
A move to setting advertising budgets on a 'task-related' basis - in other
words, according to the job in hand - rather than principally on historical
precedent. Finance directors, not surprisingly, felt particularly strongly
that this was how budgets should be set: 66 per cent of them, compared with
58 per cent of the overall sample, said task was more important that
precedent. Finance directors were a little more likely than respondents
overall to view advertising as a cost rather than an investment.
Almost universal agreement that highly creative advertising can add value to
a brand and multiply the value of buying airtime and advertising space.
However, there is dissatisfaction with measures used to judge the
effectiveness of an advertising campaign: 18 per cent of the sample (and 26
per cent of finance directors) felt their companies were not measuring
effectiveness competently.
An unwillingness to worship at the advertising altar. Overall, about a
quarter - rising to more than half of finance directors - agreed with the
statement that 'the advertising agency is just another supplier'. This is
not particularly good news for advertising agencies that see themselves as
partners with clients, or hope to reinvent themselves as all-round marketing
consultancies. About two-thirds of the sample disagreed with the comment
that 'some of the best marketing brains are to be found in advertising
agencies'.
Confirmation of the growing power of retailers. More than half agreed that
retailers were becoming a more important focus for marketing activity than
consumers, rising to 61 per cent among marketing directors.
Overwhelming agreement that advertising remains the best tool for long-term
brand building. 'Below-the-line' activity, such as promotions, was seen by
two-thirds as more effective at generating short-term sales gains.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Soccer scores in
Japan - The craze for football has spawned a huge consumer market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yukari Akasaka, a 35-year-old housewife living in Shizuoka, central Japan,
does not want to think about how much her family has spent on soccer. Since
Japan's professional soccer league kicked off in May last year, the Akasakas
have spent Y3m (Pounds 19,000) on a van to transport the family of five to
local club games, bought Y80,000 of team jerseys and other paraphernalia,
and spent more than Y40,000 a month on tickets. 'We would be rich if we
saved all we spent,' she says.
The Akasakas are among the 17m Japanese caught up in the recent craze
stirred by the J-League, now in its second year. In spite of the national
team's failure to win a place in this year's World Cup, spectators have
continued to crowd the stadiums. A huge consumer market has evolved.
Hopeful that the popularity of the league will rub off on them,
manufacturers have adorned their products with the J-League logo. Products
so emblazoned include beer, cornflakes and electronic pagers, while on
television soccer players are advertising men's wigs, curry and mosquito
repellent.
The J-League market, with merchandise revenue estimated at Y56bn,
advertising totalling Y20bn, sponsor fees at Y19.5bn, is thought to have
totalled Y140m in its first year. Some analysts are anticipating direct and
indirect spending to total around Y500m. The popularity of soccer has even
prompted the government to consider a soccer pools scheme.
A large part of the league's commercial success is down to astute marketing
and campaigning by leading advertising agency Hakuhodo. After a range of
feasibility studies and market research (until then used only for consumer
goods marketing), the agency launched a Y200m media campaign in 1991.
Unlike Japan's fragmented baseball league, J-League controls the design,
marketing and sales of items related to its 12 member teams, and splits
revenue from the goods, advertising and television sponsorship fees equally
among them.
The success of the J-League is also due to the way it has filled a vacuum
created by waning support for baseball and sumo, which embody traditional
Japanese values. The younger generation, more individualistic and
westernised, are bored by the stoicism of sumo players and shun the
collective effort of baseball in favour of the Japanese style of soccer
which focuses on the star players.
It is the glitzy image of the fashion-conscious stars and their un-Japanese
displays of emotion - hugging, kissing and dancing after goals, or wailing
and ranting after lost games - that have captured the hearts of young
Japanese. Wearing team jerseys and colourful face paint, the fans cheer
their role models on, chanting, dancing and hooting horns throughout the
games.
The many foreign stars have added to the international appeal of soccer.
Most of the league's leading players are not Japanese and many of the
coaches and team staff are also imported. Baseball, however, still treats
foreign players as outsiders, while sumo is still queasy about awarding
champion status to foreigners.
Another ingredient in J-League's success has been the corporate support
achieved during the late 1980s. Kazuki Sasaki, spokesman for the league,
says that when it first approached companies in 1989 it indicated that a
team would need up to Y1bn in corporate contributions a year. Most companies
had extra cash and were eager to contribute to philanthropic causes and
community-based activities. 'We wouldn't have been able to pull it off if it
had been a few years later,' he says.
Even amid the current slump in earnings, sponsor companies remain happy with
the long-term investment. Nissan, the car maker which owns a Yokohama-based
club, says the returns justify the costs. It says owning the team also
helped the company to communicate with its employees in Sunderland, in the
UK, and consumers in other countries.
The league's insistence upon local involvement has also boosted support. The
soccer clubs have provided entertainment for the culturally barren
provinces, and have instilled a sense of pride and camaraderie in the
communities. 'Until now there has been nothing to represent Shizuoka,' says
Akasaka, whose family has made friends with fellow fans.
The main question for J-League officials, corporate sponsors and the players
is what happens next. Companies initially pledged financial commitment for
10 years or more, ensuring long-term financial support for the teams.
Officials hope for further commercial expansion of the league when two new
teams join next year.
But to sustain the current popularity, the standard of players must improve.
Investment is also needed in better soccer facilities, including stadiums
with capacity of more than 40,000 - existing stadiums hold only about
20,000.
It was beneficial that Japan failed to qualify for this year's World Cup
games, says Kuniaki Sasaki, director of Nissan's football club. He believes
the loss fuelled the fever. 'Fans will stay with soccer for the next four
years as they want to know how the national team will fare in the race for
the 1998 games.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Accountancy: Lawson lifts the veil on professional issues -
Andrew Jack talks to the new president of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years of bombardment by the headquarters bureaucrats at Moorgate Place
in London have clearly not yet had their full intended crushing effect on
the new president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales.
Chatting to the FT earlier this week while 'minded' by Andrew Colquhoun,
secretary and chief executive of the institute, Roger Lawson allowed his
official presidential veil to slip periodically - and without much forced
tugging.
It is not that Lawson has managed to entirely clear his agenda. Barely
settled into his office since starting in his role earlier this month, our
conversation was squeezed in between an interview with another journalist
and a lunch with John Redwood, the Welsh secretary.
Some of his presidential predecessors have certainly been known to succumb
to the ministerial 'red box' trick beloved of civil servants: drowning their
bosses beneath torrents of irrelevant paperwork.
Within the institute, there is the additional risk from the gallons of drink
at innumerable receptions and dinners, leaving little time to develop
personal visions - let alone be allowed the chance to implement them.
But Lawson is certainly willing to offer contentious views. 'It is entirely
appropriate that there should be greater transparency (from accountancy
firms) for buyers of services so they can be satisfied of the financial
strength or otherwise of the people with whom they are doing business,' he
says in a swipe at the firms' traditional refusal to disclose their
accounts.
'Of course any action along these lines would be up to the member firms
themselves to take,' Colquhoun hastily interjects. 'The institute would only
be involved in prescribing activities if there was a clear public interest
issue.'
On other topics, a more familiar institute line quickly emerges. 'The legal
claims against accountants are completely out of proportion,' Lawson says,
echoing standing policy which calls for lobbying to repeal company law to
allow auditors to cap their liability.
In the same vein, he says there is no tension between the 'dual roles' of
the institute: as both trade association for its members and regulator in
the public interest. 'These roles have co-existed for one hundred years,' he
says. 'I do hold the official line.'
The defensive barriers also go up on the institute's disastrous investment
in Accountancy Television, which fell into the hands of the receivers. 'It's
an unhappy episode,' Lawson says. 'We were trying to create a medium for our
own members and others. We believed it was the way education was going to
go.'
Soon, no doubt, there will be letters to newspapers and magazines (signed by
him though often penned by officials) taking the establishment line against
some attack or other on the reputation of the profession.
Asked about whether he is concerned about 'lowballing' or predatory pricing
as larger firms undercut their smaller rivals in tenders for work, for
example, he replies that it is something already considered by the chartered
accountants joint ethics committee.
Even so, there is a Lawson twist. 'It is an issue about which we remain
nervous,' he says. 'Any firm that puts in a price must demonstrate that it
does not compromise on quality or it could be subject to reprimand.'
Colquhoun adds that the committee would have preferred to take a stronger
line, but was held back at the insistence of the Office of Fair Trading,
which apparently claimed interference in pricing by the institute would have
interfered with competition.
Like all those before him, Lawson has a list of ideas for change during his
year in office. The first is restructuring the professional bodies -
reducing the existing six leading organisations to one, with regional and
functional arms. 'It was appropriate 25 years ago and it is still
appropriate,' he says.
He argues there may be a need to make the case for reform more clearly,
particularly to younger members. 'We've been unblushingly gentlemanly in our
approach so far. It would be a shame if we didn't grasp the opportunity. I
am sorry not to use more passionate, emotional words but this is a case
based upon logic.'
Lawson's second target is to improve the image of chartered accountancy.
'We've got to get the branding right, to make sure the public are aware of
the rigorous training of the qualification and distinguish it from
non-qualified people,' he says. This will involve publicity to students and
employers, and persuading local practitioners that they can provide 'added
value' to their clients.
His third aim is to review the technical provision of the institute: to
respond to changing issues, ensure that members remain competitive, and
support the role of the Research Board that funds academic work.
Finally, he talks about the need for internal changes to the institute to
understand its members' needs. 'We need to move from a Whitehall mentality
to being a more market-driven organisation,' he says as Colquhoun (an
ex-Foreign Office civil servant) sits quietly. 'I'll be tinkering at the
edges rather than carving the place up,' he adds reassuringly. 'Consensus
management is vital.'
None of these topics is perhaps as snappy as one of those of the president
before last, Ian Plaistowe: that on disciplinary matters, the institute
should be 'firm, fast and fair'. Such catchphrases can have the habit of
returning to haunt their authors. The jury is still out on whether this aim
has yet been achieved.
Lawson concedes that a recent defeat in the courts of the profession's joint
disciplinary scheme - which was attempting to investigate Price Waterhouse's
audit of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International - could spell the end
of self-regulation. On audit regulation too, he sees the need for 'a
slightly lighter touch' from inspectors.
One reason for his slightly unorthodox views is an unusual background. Until
the second world war, the by-laws of the institute expressly forbade a
chartered accountant outside public practice to take senior office. He is
now the fourth member from business to inherit the top seat.
During his year in office, he remains on the staff (indeed the
second-longest serving person after a secretary) as a director of 3i, the
venture capital company, which he says is 'fully supportive' of his
activities.
Equally important, Lawson is also the first president to have won his place
in a contested election. In the past, any list of contenders for the throne
was whittled down in smoke-filled rooms, before a single name was placed for
ratification in front of the institute's council.
'I think the election has given me a greater degree of confidence than I
otherwise would have had if I had arrived here because it was Buggins'
turn,' he says. 'I will stand up and say what I believe.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Labour districts press for review support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour district-council leaders yesterday stepped up their attempts to
ensure that the party backs local government reorganisation in England.
Their move, announced on the opening day of the cross-party Association of
District Councils' annual conference in Harrogate, follows calls by several
Labour-affiliated unions for the review to be abandoned.
Labour still officially supports replacing the two-tier system of local
government of counties and district councils with new all-purpose unitary
authorities.
However, Mr Jack Straw, the party's local-government spokesman, is
attempting to distance himself from the conduct of the review so far, which
has produced several controversial proposals for abolishing counties.
He has written to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, saying that
failure to make guarantees on start-up elections for new councils and on
transfer of staff 'could make for serious difficulties in the house'.
Mr Pat Doyle, leader of Hull City Council, published a campaign document
calling for unitary authorities to be created, and saying that Labour
district councillors should discuss reorganisation with their Labour MPs.
He said withdrawing support for the review would 'leave in place confusion
and duplication', 'weaken local government as a whole', and 'permit the
government to introduce compulsory competitive tendering more rapidly in the
shire counties'.
Labour's position on the review could be crucial: all proposals for
reorganisation must be passed by both houses of parliament and several
Conservative backbenchers are strongly opposed to changing the status quo.
The Local Government Commission for England, which is drawing up detailed
proposals for reorganisation, announced that it intends to publish a report
at the end of this year with suggestions on how problems with the two-tier
system could be improved if unitary councils are not introduced.
It will announce proposals for reorganisation in 16 counties next week and
the week after. Proposals will be published for Staffordshire on July 4;
Surrey, Hereford &amp; Worcester and Nottinghamshire on July 5; Warwickshire and
Wiltshire on July 6; Dorset on July 7; Devon and Essex on July 11; Durham,
East and West Sussex on July 12; Northumberland and Northamptonshire on July
13; and Norfolk and Suffolk on July 14.

FT  30 JUN 94 / McAvoy survives leftwing challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Doug McAvoy has been re-elected general secretary of the National Union
of Teachers, narrowly beating a far-left rival.
Mr McAvoy, generally regarded as a Labour moderate, will now run the union
for a further five years.
The strong vote for his rival, Mrs Mary Hufford, suggested that the union's
membership is continuing to shift to the left, following an annual
conference dominated by hard-left factions. The NUT's militant opposition to
the government's national curriculum tests seems unlikely to change.
Mrs Hufford polled 37,329 votes to Mr McAvoy's 38,881, giving him a majority
of 1,552. Turnout was 38.9 per cent. When elections were last held, the
rivals to Mr McAvoy polled just 25,600 between them on the same turnout.
Mrs Hufford had attacked Mr McAvoy for taking too moderate a stance on
national curriculum tests and other issues, and had publicly criticised him
for taking a salary of Pounds 67,000. She also said the union needed a
female figurehead, as most of its members are women.
The union will vote on a new deputy general secretary - who would be a
likely successor to Mr McAvoy - in September.
The winner is expected to be Mr Steve Sinnott, union president, who has said
that he will be seeking nominations. He is also perceived as being from the
union's 'broad left'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Major returns to the embrace of the right: Political
Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major heads a cabinet overwhelmingly of the Tory centre-left. He
leads a party at Westminster dominated increasingly by its right wing. He
was chosen four years ago by the right as the only acceptable successor to
Baroness Thatcher. Under the tutelage of Mr Chris Patten, now governor of
Hong Kong, he immediately chose the centre-left as his more natural
political home.
Now, after fighting them over Europe for most of the past three years, he
has once again embraced the right. His erstwhile enemies among the
Euro-sceptics are confident that the prime minister has at last ended up as
'One of Us'. But the message from cabinet big-hitters such as Mr Kenneth
Clarke is: don't believe a word of it.
No wonder Mr Major's party is confused. Where next? asked one senior
minister with more than a hint of distaste this week. There's no going back,
answered a rightwing colleague.
One or two things are clear. Mr Major's tilt to the right has left him
feeling more politically secure than he has been for some time. Talk of a
leadership challenge in the autumn has abated. He is in a stronger position
than he ever expected to be to carry out a radical reshaping of his cabinet.
Waving the Union Jack during the European election campaign elicited plenty
of unaccustomed plaudits from his party. Vetoing Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene's
presidency of the European Commission won him the sort of Commons cheers
that he has not received since the immediate aftermath of the 1992 general
election victory. Mr Major would not be human if he did not prefer applause
to cat-calls.
But the shift pre-dated the European poll. It started with the ill-fated
back-to-basics campaign at last autumn's party conference when the Tory
faithful were invited to parade their prejudices. The Conservatives need
enemies. The unions have been tamed; the Communist bloc dismantled. Single
mothers, DSS scroungers, criminals and Euro-federalists offer a convenient
substitute.
The slogan was obliterated by a spate of disclosures about ministerial
adultery. But the benefits to be gained in terms of shoring up his own
position did not escape Mr Major. The chattering classes may scoff, but the
Tory faithful are not alone in caring about crime, about standards in
schools and about the level of their taxes.
The Euro-sceptic mood in 10 Downing Street has its roots in the same
tactical manoeuvring. Back to basics saw off the possibility of a leadership
challenge last autumn. Threatening and then using the British veto in Europe
could do the same this year. The Tory right has, after all, proved itself
consistently a much more ruthless enemy than the centre-left.
There is no need to look further than the cabinet to see the consequences of
the shift. The week began with Mr Michael Portillo capitalising on the
reaction to the Corfu veto by setting out his minimalist vision of Europe's
future. Mr Major, whose dislike of the chief secretary to the Treasury is
one of Whitehall's worst-kept secrets, would once have been enraged. Now he
publicly praised Mr Portillo for delivering an excellent speech.
It was left to Mr Clarke to redress the balance with a typically unabashed
exposition of his pro-Europeanism. The message was unequivocal. The sceptics
may have put their tanks on Mr Major's lawn but they had better keep them
off the chancellor's patch. Mr Major's aides just about managed to keep a
straight face as they insisted the prime minister was fully in accord with
both Treasury ministers. The sceptics, predictably, fumed.
The political initiative remains for now with the right. As long as his
future is under threat Mr Major will feel more comfortable with Lady
Thatcher's acolytes than with a grumbling but not yet rebellious
centre-left. Other, more fundamental, forces are pushing him in the same
direction.
The prospect of a Labour party led by Mr Tony Blair will raise the pressure
on Mr Major to give more definition to his politics. He has failed to cast a
Tory centrist alternative to Thatcherism. His party's centre of gravity has
shifted back to the right. Re-inventing the Tories as the party of
nationalism is an attractive option.
Mr Douglas Hurd, as anxious as the prime minister to prevent the party from
fracturing along its European fault-line, will offer some bricks to build
the intellectual foundations for the new approach. He invented the
multi-speed, multi-track Europe which played so well with the Tory troops in
the elections for the Strasbourg assembly. We can expect now some more
elegant rhetoric to explain how a strong commitment to British nationhood
and to Europe can henceforth sit comfortably side by side.
It is not enough however, for Mr Hurd to stand between Mr Clarke and Mr
Portillo or between Mr Major and the Tory backbenches. The prime minister is
enjoying his sojourn on the Euro-sceptic right. But his party and cabinet
remain divided. Mr Major will find only temporary security in Lady
Thatcher's mantle.

unless action is taken to curb development of out-of-town shopping centres,
the Commons environment committee was told yesterday.
Mr Martin Chase, director of the Association of Town Centre Management, told
the committee - investigating shopping centres - that the problem was most
acute in larger towns and cities whose centres were given over largely to
retail activity. If more attractive shopping centres appeared nearby, these
could draw away substantial numbers of shoppers.
Gateshead, in north-east England; Dudley in the West Midlands, and towns
near the Lakeside centre in Essex were cited as examples of centres which
had already been severely affected by out-of-town developments.
Mr Chase said: 'One retailer estimates that 95 per cent of the business that
has been generated in Lakeside has come from business lost in other stores
within the Lakeside catchment.' He added that 'on present trends, 10 town
centres would become ghost towns in the next 10 years'.
Mr Chase said smaller market towns could also be 'devastated' by out-of-town
superstores, unless these were positioned to reinforce retailing activity in
the town centre rather than compete with it. He welcomed the government's
new planning guidelines emphasising the need to protect town centres, and
said it was vital they were put into practice.
The Royal Town Planning Institute told the committee that 'in seeking
sustainable forms of retail development, its distribution cannot be left to
the operation of market forces'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Times chief aims for rise to 750,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Circulation of The Times at 20p could rise to 750,000, double the sales of a
year ago, senior News International executives believe.
Since the second price cut last week, in response to Mr Conrad Black's
decision to cut the price of the weekday Daily Telegraph from 48p to 30p,
The Times has been selling at around the 600,000 mark and close to 620,000
on Satur-day.
'More people are trying the paper and more people are liking it and staying,
so therefore 750,000 is a reasonable target,' said Mr Peter Stothard, editor
of The Times. He emphasised, however, that he had not been set any
particular circulation figure.
'I have had one letter of complaint from a vicar who didn't think it (the
price cut) was right,' said Mr Stothard.
He expects The Times to sell more this Saturday once people realise that
there is now a 40p differential between The Times at 40p and the 80p Daily
Telegraph on Saturdays.
If The Times were to reach the 750,000 figure it would realise an old dream
of Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, owner of The Times.
Journalists who were at The Times when Mr Murdoch took over in 1981 remember
him saying on the newsfloor that he wanted to take the paper's circulation
to three quarters of a million.
Other national dailies including The Independent, The Guardian, the Daily
Mail and the Daily Express are estimated to have been affected by the price
wars between The Times and The Daily Telegraph, but not seriously.
Even at a circulation of 600,000 the 20p Times is almost certainly losing a
significant amount of money because 30p was a level where it was starting to
approach breakeven.
The company is believed to be paying around 15p of the 20p cover price to
the news trade - less than the 17.5p estimated by executives at the
Independent.
According to newspaper industry analysts The Times costs about 16p a copy to
produce. At May's circulation figure of 515,000 - which stirred Mr Black
into action - The Times would lose about Pounds 1.2m a month this year, it
is believed. The circulation has already risen beyond that figure and
pressure will mount on advertisers to start paying a higher rate to reflect
the new circulation.
'That will happen (higher advertising revenues) sooner rather than later,'
Mr Stothard forecast yesterday.

FT  30 JUN 94 / McDonald's accused of trying to silence critics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The McDonald's fast-food chain was yesterday accused of using the libel laws
to censor and silence its critics.
Mr Dave Morris and Ms Helen Steel, who have accused McDonald's of poisoning
its customers, exploiting third-world countries and employing cheap labour,
told the High Court in London that the world's biggest food-service
organisation threw writs at anyone who dared criticise it - no matter how
small.
McDonald's has sued Mr Morris and Ms Steel for libel over a 'malicious'
leaflet. The company's QC, Mr Richard Rampton, has told the court it was
'completely false in every material respect'.
Mr Morris and Ms Steel, members of the London Greenpeace group - which has
no connection with Greenpeace International - claim their allegations are
justified.
The unemployed campaigners are conducting their own defence. They told Mr
Justice Bell yesterday it was an 'outrage' that the company was prepared to
go to such lengths.
Mr Rampton has said it was completely untrue that McDonald's was involved in
'economic imperialism' or in 'wrecking the planet' by destroying rainforests
to provide packaging materials and create grazing for beef cattle.
The company had not seduced children into eating poisonous food and was not
responsible for the torture and barbaric deaths of animals to provide meat.
Nor had it paid low wages, got rid of pro-union workers, or exploited
disadvantaged groups.
Ms Steel said the company, in refusing to disclose documents, was engaged in
a 'massive cover-up'. McDonald's had taken so long to bring the action
because, in the wake of the leaflet, it took steps to 'polish up' its image.
Neither she nor Mr Morris was the author or printer of the leaflet. 'But we
do believe it is true, and that we have absolutely nothing to apologise for,
so we have no choice but to fight this action.'
The company's claim that it did not to use beef from rainforest countries
was an 'out-and-out lie', she said.
McDonald's was suing over the assertion that it used only a tiny percentage
of recycled paper in its packaging, and yet in the US in 1989 - at the time
of the alleged libel - its packaging contained just 7 per cent recycled
paper.
The company's own documents supported the assertion that its food was high
in fat, sugar and salt, which was linked by health education bodies with
cancer, Ms Steel said.
The hearing was adjourned until today.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Tribunals criticised for race cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commission for Racial Equality expressed anxiety yesterday at what it
regards as the lack of effectiveness of industrial tribunals in dealing with
racial discrimination cases.
Two out of every three complaints about racial discrimination were
employment-related last year, it revealed in its annual report. 'The
approach some tribunals take towards applicants alleging racial
discrimination - and the quality of some tribunal decisions - gives us cause
for concern,' said the commission.
'In recent years, cases of racial discrimination taken to the Employment
Appeals Tribunal have met with little success,' it added. 'There was a
worrying number of cases where the industrial tribunal found discrimination,
but this was then overturned at the EAT - in some cases because the tribunal
had issued a defective written decision.'
Half the appeals by employers made to the appeals tribunal were upheld last
year. In 1993 there were 1,630 applications to the commission for assistance
over discrimination cases - 1,160 of them in the employment field. Only 236
cases reached settlement last year - with 100 of those winning their case
after a full hearing.
The average level of settlements over racial discrimination cases fell to
Pounds 3,115 last year from Pounds 3,165 in 1992. From next Monday the legal
Pounds 11,000 ceiling is to be removed enabling tribunals and courts to
award whatever sum they believe appropriate in each case.
Yesterday the commission launched an advertising campaign with the public
relations firm Saatchi and Saatchi under the slogan: 'Uniting Britain For a
Just Society.' Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said that the
government was fully behind the campaign.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Gummer moots council housing change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities should not be expected automatically to provide permanent
accommodation for homeless people, Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, told the Commons yesterday.
After helping with an immediate crisis, he said, councils should be able to
take a 'considered view' about the proper allocation of available homes.
Mr Gummer again underlined the need for a single waiting list for
local-authority homes which ensured that real need and not 'technicalities'
determined priority. He said the results of the consultation on the
allocation of council accommodation would be published next month.
Mr Gummer accused Labour MPs of maintaining their 'deep-seated hatred'
against the private rented sector.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, attacked the 'failure' of the
government's housing policy, and highlighted the growth in the amount of
social security benefit which reached the pockets of private landlords. Much
of the rent rises in the private sector had been 'publicly subsidised'
through housing benefit.
Mr Straw said: 'We do not accept the role which the government has created
for the private rented sector.'
He also attacked the way in which the government had forced increases in the
rents charged by councils and housing associations, and warned that there
was a danger of 'welfare ghettos' being created.
Mr Straw renewed Labour's demand that local authorities should be able to
draw on the capital receipts obtained from the sale of council properties.
and which were being retained by the Treasury.
The money should be made available to finance a badly needed increase the
number of properties available to let and enable the unemployed in the
construction industry to return to work.
The government is to help people who bought council flats from their local
authority and cannot sell them, Sir George Young, the housing minister,
announced last night.
He told the Commons that a new scheme would enable councils to buy the
properties back as part of a deal to sell the owners another property.
Almost 165,000 public-sector flats have been sold under right-to-buy and
other sales schemes since 1979, with tenants becoming leaseholders of the
flats.
But some purchasers have found their properties difficult to sell,
particularly in large tower blacks where building societies have been
reluctant to offer mortgages.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Hospitals show wide quality differences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enormous differences in the quality of hospital services offered in
different parts of the UK are revealed in the first hospital performance
league tables published yesterday.
In some hospitals, barely half the patients needing the most common types of
treatment are operated on within a year of being diagnosed. Others manage to
treat all or almost all patients in that time.
Even larger variations are recorded in the numbers operated on within three
months of diagnosis. In oral surgery, the worst-performing hospital treats
less than one in 10 within three months. The best performers treat all such
patients in that time.
The league tables, covering 470 hospitals in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, are part of the government's drive to improve public services. They
contain information on how well NHS hospitals and the ambulance services are
meeting Patient's Charter targets.
The tables give no guidance on whether some hospitals are offering better
standards of medical treatment than others. Instead, they offer a range of
23 performance indicators about the way hospitals treat their patients.
In some hospitals barely half of outpatients are seen within 30 minutes of
their appointment. And fewer than half of arrivals in accident and emergency
departments in the worst-performing hospitals are assessed by a doctor or
nurse within five minutes of arrival.
In the best-performing hospitals, all outpatients are seen within the
30-minute target and all casualty arrivals assessed within five minutes of
arrival.
The league tables for ambulance services confirm the relatively poor
performance of the London Ambulance Service, which is answering only 62 per
cent of emergency calls within the target time of 14 minutes. Other urban
ambulance services are typically meeting the target on nine out of 10 calls.
Rural ambulance services have a target time of 19 minutes to reflect the
greater area they cover. Most are achieving this on 19 out of 20 calls.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday that the tables
showed improvements in overall health service performance. In accident and
emergency departments, 88 per cent of patients are now assessed within the
five-minute standard set in the Patient's Charter, compared with 72 per cent
a year ago.
For outpatients, 84 per cent are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment
time - a year ago it was 73 per cent. On waiting times, more than two-thirds
of patients in the gynaecology, general surgery and urology specialties are
waiting less than three months for treatment. The development of day surgery
enables people to go home sooner, with over half of arthroscopies and
laparoscopies carried out without an overnight stay.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Lib Dems set out Lit Dem challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday outlined some of the evidence they will be
bringing before the High Court this week in order to have the result of the
European parliamentary election in Devon and East Plymouth overturned.
The party - which failed to win the seat by 700 votes, after more than
10,000 people backed a candidate calling himself a Literal Democrat - will
today submit an electoral petition calling for the result to be declared
void and the election to be re-run.
Mr Graham Elson, Liberal Democrat general secretary, said that the party's
case had been backed by statements of protest from electors. He said 269
affidavits had been delivered to party offices in Devon, and a further 120
were expected.
The party is bringing the action under the Representation of the People Act
1983.
The petition will name Mr Frank Palmer, the election returning officer, who
accepted the nomination form of the Literal Democrat candidate, Mr Richard
Huggett. It will also name Mr Giles Chichester, the successful Tory
candidate, so that he can present his case.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Management controls criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Councils, health authorities and the National Health Service are spending
more than Pounds 120m a year on management consultants - but they are not
making adequate efforts to track expenditure or assess value for money, the
Audit Commission says today.
The public expenditure watchdog says a study of more than 200 projects found
that up to 60 per cent of consultants' recommendations were ignored; most
projects lacked incentives to complete the job successfully; a third of
projects were commissioned without drawing up any written agreement; and
most assignments in health provision were not put out to tender and had
inadequate briefs.
The commission's report echoes most of the criticisms made in a recently
leaked Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit report on consultants in the civil
service. This found that Whitehall departments and agencies could find
savings of only about Pounds 10m a year from expenditure on consultancy
running at more than Pounds 500m a year.
The Audit Commission says consultants can contribute much to change in the
public sector, especially by providing skills not available in-house. Many
of the reforms in health provision and local government could not have been
implemented so fast without their help, the report says.
However, building up in-house skills might be a cheaper solution in some
cases, the commission believes. There is also concern over the amount of
consultancy used and some of the fees being charged. The report says the
process of buying consultancy is badly managed and could be made much more
effective without adding greatly to the bureaucracy.
There was confusion over how projects should be put out to tender,
weaknesses in specifying the task, a failure to identify all the costs at
the outset, and poor management of the work, especially in monitoring
results.
Local authorities emerged from the study as better than the NHS and health
authorities in many aspects of commissioning consultancy work. Their
performance in choosing consultants and drawing up briefs reflected the
experience of compulsory competitive tendering for local government
services.
Health authorities were better at structuring projects to achieve and
evaluate results. But 70 per cent of health projects were assigned without
competition, the commission found.
The Management Consultancies Association reacted to the report by offering
training in how to get the best out of consultancy.
'When consultancy is purchased with knowledge and at the right level, a 95
per cent satisfaction level is achieved,' said Mr Brian O'Rorke, the
association's director.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Growth of 2.3% for 1995 forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic growth will slow and inflation will rise in 1995, according to the
latest forecast by the London Business School.
Prepared by Mr David Currie, a member of the Treasury's panel of independent
forecasters, and Mr Andrew Sentance, a former member, it is rather less
sanguine about 1995 than the Treasury forecast on Tuesday.
While the Treasury predicted 2.75 per cent gross domestic product growth in
1994 and 1995, LBS forecasts that growth will be 3.0 per cent this year,
slowing next year to 2.3 per cent. Tax increases will slow the recovery and
investment and exports will take up the running from consumer demand.
LBS predicts that interest rates will have to climb to combat an increase in
underlying inflation, which it expects to pick up to 3.5 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1995 (the Treasury forecast is 2.75 per cent). Base rates
will start to rise early next year and will peak at 7.5 per cent in early
1996, according to LBS, before falling ahead of the general election.
In an essay accompanying the forecast, Mr Currie and Mr Sentance argue that
one way in which the chancellor could avoid another 'boom and bust' cycle in
the UK is to give full responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of
England.
Meanwhile, the forecasting group of the Society of Business Economists also
predicts that underlying inflation will rise in 1995 - to 3.6 per cent, near
the top of the government's target range of between 1 per cent and 4 per
cent. Headline inflation, which includes mortgage interest payments, will
hit 4.3 per cent next year, according to the society.
On economic growth, the society predicts that GDP will rise by 2.8 per cent
this year and by 2.5 per cent in 1995.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Bottomley hails health 'milestone'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's hospital league tables, the first to be published by the
government, represented 'a milestone in the information revolution sweeping
the National Health Service', according to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary.
'Information is a lever for change and a spur to improvement,' she said.
'Performance tables are an established way of identifying strengths and
weaknesses and raising standards in our public services.'
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, attacked the tables as
incomplete and flawed. He said they dealt only with a small fraction of the
complex activities involved in running health services.
'It is a bit like an Egon Ronay guide to restaurants, except it doesn't deal
with the starter, doesn't deal with the main course, and makes highly
dubious judgments about the quality of the coffee,' he said.
Mr James Johnson, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association's
consultants committee, attacked attempts to 'pigeonhole the complexities of
hospital treatment into crude, simplistic star ratings which mean little or
nothing to patients'.
He added: 'Giving hospitals stars and placing them in league order based
purely on waiting times, tells patients nothing about the quality of care
they are likely to receive. I have grave doubts about a system which, for
example, gives points for not allowing hernia patients to stay in hospital
overnight.'
Professor Sir Norman Browse, chairman of the Joint Consultants Committee,
said patients must not assume that a hospital with a five-star grade
provided good clinical care or that one with a single star was a bad
hospital. In many cases the reverse might be true.
However, Mr Philip Hunt, director of the National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts, said that the performance indicators were useful in
guiding patients, GPs and health authority purchasers.
'Comparing performance is the touchstone of the health service,' he said.
'It is important that we develop the indicators so that more and more they
include quality of care and treatment outcomes.'
Whatever the doubts of the professional associations, hospitals which had
done well in the league tables were quick to acknowledge it. St George's
Healthcare, a London trust, was celebrating its 13 five-star awards in the
tables.
'Sheer hard work and a belief that our performance could be turned around
has resulted in this five-star rating today,' said Mr Andrew Dillon, chief
executive.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Printing industry recovery 'erratic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of Britain's printing industry accepts that there is an economic
recovery but is disappointed that it has not been stronger, says the latest
survey from the British Printing Industries Federation.
The majority of companies accept that 'the general state of trade is easier
than three months ago', according to the survey. They believe 'conditions
will improve or remain at least as favourable during the months to
September'.
However, the survey found that 'few regard the market as wholly
satisfactory, let alone buoyant, and some consider the general situation has
deteriorated'. It adds: 'The industry had hoped for more.'
The survey points to 'the erratic nature of the recovery'. It is also
worried about the rising cost of printing papers and about price increases
for board and plastic films used by printers.
The survey says that a significant number of larger companies have been
forced to cut their prices because of intensive competition while exporters
are finding it difficult to hold their position though they are maintaining
their markets.
Only half the smaller companies and a quarter of larger ones had been able
to pass on recent price rises for materials and labour.
Only 52 per cent had spare capacity but 30 per cent said their order books
were better than normal for the time of year while a further 57 per cent
said they were normal.
But the survey said that margins had been protected by a higher volume of
work and improvements in productivity helped by the job flexibility clauses
in this year's national industry agreement.
Most companies were confident that they could negotiate flexible working
arrangements with employees to offset this year's national basic pay
increases of about 3 per cent.

FT  30 JUN 94 / LBS sees growth falling to 2.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic growth will slow and inflation will rise in 1995, according to the
latest forecast by the London Business School.
Prepared by Mr David Currie, a member of the Treasury's panel of independent
forecasters, and Mr Andrew Sentance, a former member, it is rather less
sanguine about 1995 than the Treasury forecast on Tuesday.
While the Treasury predicted 2.75 per cent gross domestic product growth in
1994 and 1995, LBS forecasts that growth will be 3.0 per cent this year,
slowing next year to 2.3 per cent. Tax increases will slow the recovery and
investment and exports will take up the running from consumer demand.
LBS predicts that interest rates will have to climb to combat an increase in
underlying inflation, which it expects to pick up to 3.5 per cent in the
fourth quarter of 1995 (the Treasury forecast is 2.75 per cent). Base rates
will start to rise early next year and will peak at 7.5 per cent in early
1996, according to LBS, before falling ahead of the general election.
In an essay accompanying the forecast, Mr Currie and Mr Sentance argue that
one way in which the chancellor could avoid another 'boom and bust' cycle in
the UK is to give full responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of
England.
Meanwhile, the forecasting group of the Society of Business Economists also
predicts that underlying inflation will rise in 1995 - to 3.6 per cent, near
the top of the government's target range of between 1 per cent and 4 per
cent. Headline inflation, which includes mortgage interest payments, will
hit 4.3 per cent next year, according to the society.
On economic growth, the society predicts that GDP will rise by 2.8 per cent
this year and by 2.5 per cent in 1995.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Watchdog finds failures in consultancy projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Councils, local health authorities and the National Health Service are
spending more than Pounds 120m a year on management consultants - but they
are not making adequate efforts to track expenditure or assess value for
money, the Audit Commission says today.
The public expenditure watchdog says a study of more than 200 projects found
that up to 60 per cent of consultants' recommendations were ignored; most
projects lacked incentives to complete the job successfully; a third of
projects were commissioned without drawing up any written agreement; and the
majority of assignments in health provision were not put out to competitive
tender and had inadequate briefs.
The commission's report echoes most of the criticisms made in a recently
leaked Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit report on consultants in the civil
service. This found that Whitehall departments and agencies could find
savings of only around Pounds 10m a year from expenditure on consultancy
running at more than Pounds 500m a year.
The Audit Commission says consultants can contribute much to change in the
public sector, especially by providing skills not available in-house. Many
of the reforms in health provision and local government could not have been
implemented so fast without their help, the report says.
However, building up in-house skills might be a cheaper solution in some
cases, the commission believes. There is also concern over the amount of
consultancy used and some of the fees being charged. The report says the
process of buying consultancy is badly managed and could be made much more
effective without adding greatly to the bureaucracy.
There was confusion over how projects should be put out to tender,
weaknesses in specifying the task, a failure to identify all the costs at
the outset, and poor management of the work, especially in monitoring
results.
Local authorities emerged from the study as better than the NHS and health
authorities in many aspects of commissioning consultancy work. Their
performance in choosing consultants and drawing up briefs reflected the
experience of compulsory competitive tendering for local government
services.
Health authorities were better at structuring projects to achieve and
evaluate results. But 70 per cent of health projects were assigned without
competition, the commission found.
The Management Consultancies Association reacted to the report by offering
training in how to get the best out of consultancy.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Blair hints at detention changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, the favourite to succeed John Smith as Labour leader,
yesterday used a statement to the party's Irish Society to explain how he
thought Labour should overhaul the prevention of terrorism and emergency
provisions Acts.
Mr Blair listed three provisions the party was particularly concerned about:
The power to exclude individuals from Great Britain.
The 'possibility' of internment.
The power to extend detention without judicial review.
In October, the government used Prevention of Terrorism Act powers to ban Mr
Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, from entering
Britain.
Mr Blair said there should be no transfer of sovereignty without the consent
of a majority in Northern Ireland, but argued that London and Dublin must
'share the responsibility to develop an institutional framework for a
political settlement'.
Labour's 1992 general election manifesto committed the party to replacing
the 'counter-productive' Prevention of Terrorism Act with a 'more effective'
measure.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Life insurer moves early on disclosure: Equitable steals
march on rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equitable Life, one of the UK's largest life insurers, is to offer customers
fuller information about financial products, six months before disclosure
becomes compulsory.
The company believes it can gain a competitive advantage by being the first
to reveal details including charges and costs, although other life insurers
are sceptical.
Equitable says the new system, which it claims will show its costs are low
as a proportion of its premium income, will come into effect from tomorrow.
Equitable's move contrasts with general industry reluctance or opposition
towards regulatory efforts to ensure that sales agents volunteer better
information to customers.
Last July the Treasury ordered the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief watchdog, to produce regulations requiring all those selling
life insurance to give more information about their charges and products.
The SIB produced the final version of the detailed rules for the new regime
 -which will apply both to independent financial advisers and to sales
agents directly linked to a single life office - late in April. The new
regime will be introduced from January 1 and must be in place by August 1
next year.
From tomorrow Equitable sales agents will provide clients with:
A paper setting out the key features of the policy being sold.
Examples of how much it will yield, based on the life insurer's own charges
rather than an industry average.
A letter explaining why the advice to take out the policy has been given.
The surrender values at various points during the contract and a figure for
the cost of providing advice.
In the case of a 20-year pension plan sold to someone aged 45, for example,
with an annual premium of Pounds 1,000, and assuming a 9 per cent rate of
return, it shows that if the policy were given up at the end of five years,
the customer would receive Pounds 6,139, having paid Pounds 384 in
deductions.
On the same basis, the customer would have had Pounds 1,189 deducted in
charges at the end of 10 years, and would receive Pounds 15,371 if the
policy were surrendered then.
It also says that the cost of providing advice for this sort of policy
averaged Pounds 231 in 1993, and that this cost would rise proportionately
as the level of customer contribution increased.
Equitable specialises in pensions for the top end of the personal financial
market. Its relatively small direct sales force of 370 is salaried rather
than paid by commission, though staff can qualify for bonuses.
Mr Roy Ranson, managing director, said the cost of the move, including
strategic planning, systems design and development and planning, amounted to
less than Pounds 500,000.
The task has been more straightforward for Equitable than it will be for
many life offices. It sells only through the direct sales force and has
deliberately kept to a relatively simple range of products.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Fidelity drops exit charges on Peps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fidelity Investments, one of the top five providers of personal equity
plans, is to abolish withdrawal charges on its tax-free Pep unit trusts from
Monday.
It will instead raise the initial charge from 2 per cent to 3 per cent from
August 1, barely two years after introducing the new combined charging
structure into the UK. Annual charges will continue to be levied by the
underlying fund. Ms Mary Blair, executive director for product development,
said market research had shown that investors found withdrawal charges
confusing.
In June 1992, Fidelity cut the initial charge on all its unit trust Peps
from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent and introduced tapering exit charges over
three years. Other fund management groups followed.
In May, Gartmore said it would abandon withdrawal charges on its unit trust
Peps because of investor confusion over the charges and increase the initial
charge from 2 per cent to 3 per cent.
However, Gartmore and Fidelity said that the level of early redemptions on
the Peps has been very low, while Ms Blair said that the difference between
an initial charge of 2 per cent and 3 per cent was not great in investors'
eyes.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Pirate videos 'pay for terrorists'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Northern Ireland policeman warned yesterday that pirate videos are
an important source of funding for terrorists in Northern Ireland.
Det Chief Supt Derek Waites of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
anti-racketeering squad told a London conference that the terrorists - who
raised about Pounds 10.5m a year to fund their activities - took Pounds 1.5m
a year from pirate video sales.
'The reality is that the easy profit from video piracy turns a popular
entertainment into bullets and bombs,' said Mr Waites. He said the RUC had
already seized more than 100,000 illicit videos in Northern Ireland. Recent
co-ordinated seizures in the Irish Republic had involved a further 100,000.
The RUC experience was outlined at a conference organised by the Federation
Against Copyright Theft, an all-industry body designed to stamp out piracy.
Mr Nick Hill, the federation's chairman, said the video market in the UK for
sale and rental was now worth Pounds 1bn a year.
'What is not so well known is that the illegal video market is a major
source of funding for organised crime as well as costing our business in the
region of Pounds 250m a year,' said Mr Hill.
Raids have uncovered as many as 180 linked video machines capable of turning
out thousands of illicit copies a week - 20 per cent of them
non-certificated, illegal videos which have never been submitted to the
British Board of Film Censors.
Often the illicit cassettes are sold at car boot sales or at about 7,000
unregulated markets regularly held in the UK.
Mr David Groom, a barrister who has prosecuted a number of large-scale
piracy cases, said that in virtually every case there were links with
organised crime and pornography. Sometimes there were links with terrorism.
He believes that the present punishments under patents-and-designs copyright
legislation - a maximum of two years in prison - are inadequate given the
scale of the problem. He now uses the Forgeries Act, in cases where
counterfeit labels and packaging have been seized, to try to obtain stiffer
penalties.
Mr Reg Dixon, director-general of Fact, and a Metropolitan Police detective
for nearly 30 years, called for it to be made an offence to knowingly
purchase a counterfeit video.
At the moment it is an offence to buy a genuine video of Aladdin knowing it
to have been stolen but not to buy a cassette that you know has been
illegally copied.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Covent Garden's 18-year drama: Developments at the Royal
Opera House which have attracted criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High above the stage at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden,
technicians tread carefully around tangles of ropes, lights and cables in
the fly gallery, where systems for lifting scenery on and off the stage are
co-ordinated. A lot of the equipment has been operating since 1901.
'Bits and pieces are cobbled together all the time to keep us running,' said
Mr John Payne, head of external affairs for the ROH development office.
For the past 18 years, the opera house has been trying to secure public
funding and planning permission to modernise its facilities.
Tonight the opera house's latest redevelopment scheme - an estimated Pounds
150m reconstruction project to replace outdated equipment, improve public
access, and modernise the backstage and front-of-house facilities - will
come before a meeting of the planning and transport committee of Westminster
City Council.
It has been a drawn-out battle for the opera house, which has faced
strenuous objections from local groups and statutory bodies which believe
the plans do not suit the conservation status of Covent Garden. Since it
decided to overhaul the site, the opera house management has come up with at
least four 'masterplans' and has already received permission from
Westminster City Council for two previous proposals.
The scheme on the table tonight is a major revision of what has come before.
Most significantly, the highly controversial proposals to build commercial
offices to fund the project have been abandoned after Stanhope Properties
advised the opera house board that the plan was no longer attractive because
of the decline in the property market.
But the scheme does contain highly-contested proposals to demolish four
buildings on Russell Street, near the Covent Garden market piazza, and plans
to take down half of the cast-iron Floral Hall to build a new foyer.
The abandonment of commercial office space is being claimed as a victory by
some groups of objectors - but they are still unhappy with the design of the
latest proposal. 'We welcome the fact that at last we have a scheme which is
more akin to what we have been campaigning for all along,' said Mr Jim
Monahan, chairman of the Covent Garden Community Association planning
committee. 'But we are intensely depressed by the present design, which is
banal and does nothing for the area's conservation status.'
Save Britain's Heritage, the Georgian Group and the Royal Fine Art
Commission have reservations about the new scheme, though English Heritage
is supportive.
However, Westminster City Council planning officers have recommended that
planning permission for the revised scheme be granted. One, Mr Gordon Chard,
said: 'The changes are substantially for the better.'
The opera house believes the new plans, which will include 100 additional
seats and cost savings from more efficient equipment, will generate about
Pounds 7m a year in extra income. The scheme also contains changes in design
details, including a five-metre reduction in the new fly tower - which is
now to be 43 metres high - and improved disabled access.
The board plans to use extra revenues to make the opera more accessible to
people traditionally unable to afford tickets. It will also designate Pounds
2m for a sinking fund to maintain and replace new facilities.
Even if the opera house gets the go-ahead at tonight's meeting a start to
the work still depends on adequate funding. Some Pounds 60m could be
provided from retail units incorporated in the back of the building erected
in 1981.
Mr Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the Royal Opera House, hopes to obtain
some funding - about Pounds 50m - from the Millennium Fund, sponsored by the
National Lottery, although this is not assured.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Sinn Fein to hold special meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, is to hold a special delegate
conference - the first of its kind in 23 years - to finalise its response to
the Downing Street declaration amid growing optimism that the IRA will
announce an extended summer ceasefire.
The conference will be held 'within the next few weeks' and the party's
formal and definitive response to the Downing Street declaration will follow
immediately, the party said. The declaration offers a place at the
negotiating table to Sinn Fein if it formally and permanently renounces
violence.
Last week, the party published the findings of its Peace Commission, which
revealed that almost 40 per cent of 280 written and oral submissions
believed the party should encourage the IRA to call a unilateral ceasefire.
Mr Pat Doherty, the party's vice-president, said at the time that the
commission's findings would influence 'how we should proceed in the weeks
and months ahead'.
The only other occasion when a special Sinn Fein conference has been
convened was in 1971 to formalise the split between the provisional and
official Sinn Fein, and their respective military wings.
The 'officials' subsequently abandoned military action, as well as the Sinn
Fein title, and entered mainstream politics as a socialist party.
The present Sinn Fein leadership is anxious to avoid any further split and
is moving cautiously to avoid confrontation between moderates and hardliners
within its ranks. A temporary ceasefire is thus likely to be seen as the
best compromise in order to give a positive response without totally
accepting the Downing Street declaration.
In Sinn Fein's view, a temporary ceasefire would shift the political
pressure on to the Loyalist paramilitaries to suspend their military
activities.
It aims to refocus the political debate on to what it defines as key areas
of the conflict. These are that the Irish people as a whole have the right
to national self-determination; that the exercise of self-determination is a
matter for agreement between the people of Ireland; that the consent and
allegiance of unionists are essential ingredients if a lasting peace is to
be established; that the unionists cannot have a veto over constitutional
change; that the British government must join the persuaders (of the
unionists); and that London and Dublin have a responsibility to secure
political progress.
Several of these points are at odds with the Downing Street declaration.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Clarke enrages Tory Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful exposition by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, of his party's
pro-European credentials from yesterday enraged Tory Euro-sceptics.
Mr Clarke's reaffirmation of a personal commitment to a single European
currency and to further deepening of co-operation in the European Union came
as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, sought to head off a new outbreak
of party infighting.
The chancellor, speaking in Bonn, dismissed suggestions that the dispute
over the presidency of the commission marked a fundamental shift in British
policy. He called for Germany's Christian Democrats to join the
Conservatives in promoting a common agenda for Europe's future.
Mr Clarke's comments about a single currency kept just within the agreed
government line that any decision must be taken by parliament.
But the chancellor made no secret of his own view that Britain must be in a
position to join a single currency if and when the occasion arises. He
remarked that the government had twice signed up to the objective - when it
joined the then EEC in 1972 and when it signed the Single European Act in
1976.
He called on Britain and Germany to build on the intergovernmental
arrangements in the Maastricht treaty to strengthen co-operation on foreign
and defence policy. London and Bonn should also act together to promote
further enlargement of the union and to push an EU-wide agenda favouring
deregulation and liberalisation.
In spite of approval for the speech from Downing Street, leading Tory
Euro-sceptics responded with outrage. Accusing the chancellor of undermining
the prime minister, the sceptics said the speech had in effect ended Mr
Clarke's hopes of succeeding Mr Major.
For his part Mr Hurd sought to assure a meeting of pro-European Tories that
the government's decision to use its veto at the Corfu summit did not
represent a lurch into the arms of the Euro-sceptics.
Mr Hurd will use a speech later this week to develop the theme of a
multi-speed Europe.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Horton denies he plans to 'get tough' on signal strikers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack yesterday said it had no plans to get tough with striking signals
staff, saying that it hoped for a positive response to its offer when all
the details had sunk in. It also expects the strikers to start feeling the
affect of lost wages as the summer holiday period approached.
But with three days of lost rail services and the prospect of the dispute
intensifying in the weeks ahead, Railtrack may be starting to consider more
radical options.
A dispute which continued through the summer could make it more difficult to
privatise the railway network if Railtrack were shown to be incapable of
dealing effectively with its unions.
One proposal made yesterday by Mr Harry Greenway, Conservative MP for Ealing
North, was for Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, to emulate former US
President Ronald Reagan, who sacked air traffic control staff who would not
settle. Mr Horton said: 'I don't think it has really come to that at all. I
think reasonable people can sit down and sort this thing out.'
One drawback of such extreme action is that it would be likely to prompt
sympathy strikes by other rail workers. These are outlawed but rail staff
could defy their union's instructions or the union could find another issue
which could become the trigger for a dispute. Relations between management
and rail workers could be soured for many years.
If Railtrack did opt for this approach it would not be as difficult to find
replacement staff as is commonly supposed, some transport experts believe.
Signals staff play a vital role in ensuring the safety of railways but the
skill level required is not as great as has been suggested.
'It is a tedious, repetitive job, but not one requiring special skills,'
said one observer.
An alternative strategy for Railtrack might be to improve its terms to the
striking signalmen in the certain knowledge that new technology would remove
many of their jobs over the next few years.
Other recently privatised organisations such as British Telecommunications
have made considerable job cuts in recent years but avoided strikes by
improving the terms of conditions of the smaller numbers still employed.
The number of signalling staff has fallen from 8,900 to 4,600 over the past
seven years as manual signal boxes relying on visual supervision of
stretches of line have been replaced by automated signal boxes and computer
controls.
But there is still one signal worker for every 2 1/2 miles of track -
without taking account of shift working - and there are considerable
improvements which could be made to signalling systems.
Increasing wages of signals staff in the expectation that there will be far
fewer of them around in a few years time is also not without problems. An
improved offer now not met by immediate productivity improvements would
probably be regarded as breaching government guidelines.
In the short term Railtrack and the train operating companies will be hoping
they can minimise the impact of the strike using working signal staff in the
most effective way.
With about 1,600 trains running yesterday, up from 1,000 the week before and
500 the week before that, Railtrack has clearly been learning quickly.
But its best bet still remains negotiating a detailed formula acceptable to
the signal staff . . . and the government.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Beckett manifesto aimed at softening her image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett will today release a personal manifesto designed to
soften her image as the most leftwing of the three candidates to succeed
John Smith as Labour leader.
Mrs Beckett, the acting leader, is widely thought to be trailing Mr Tony
Blair, the modernist shadow home secretary, and Mr John Prescott, the
traditionalist employment spokesman.
Friends say the manifesto has been timed to coincide with the despatch of
voting papers to the 4.5m members of the party's electoral college. The
eight-page document contains little fresh policy but it presents Mrs Beckett
as a 'unification' candidate positioned between the party's modernist and
traditionalist extremes.
It also raises questions about the electoral appeal of the other candidates,
such as Mr Blair's ability to defend Labour's heartlands, and whether Mr
Prescott can win fresh support in the south.
As an example of Mrs Beckett's 'middle way' approach, the manifesto offers
full support for both Mr Blair's plans for welfare state reform and Mr
Prescott's demands for commitment to full employment.
Mrs Beckett says that the two policies are compatible because full
employment will be essential to provide sufficient tax revenues to finance
reformed social and health services.
A friend said: 'The intention is that it should give people a flavour of the
honest and inclusive style of leadership they can expect to see in a
Beckett-led Labour government.'
Mrs Beckett's move to moderate her image may have more impact in the contest
for the deputy leadership, in which she appears to be level with Mr
Prescott.
It may ease concern among supporters of Mr Blair that Mrs Beckett would be a
difficult deputy because of her strong links with the left.
Her attempt to massage her image will not be assisted by a caustic editorial
in the summer issue of Renewal, the quarterly journal of the Labour
Co-ordinating Committee, which backs Mr Blair for the leadership and Mr
Prescott for the deputy leadership.
The committee, which has the support of about 30 MPs, says that Mrs Beckett
has done a 'competent' job as interim leader. But it criticises her
'opportunistic career' and complains that she lacks 'ideological
distinctiveness'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Costs keep two unions out of Labour election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two unions affiliated to the Labour party will not participate in its
leadership election because they say they cannot afford the cost of holding
postal or workplace ballots, it was disclosed yesterday.
Labour's ruling national executive committee refused to allow the National
Union of Mineworkers and Ucatt, the construction union, to hold cheaper
branch ballots instead.
Officials said the decision was intended to send 'a powerful signal' to
union activists about the NEC's commitment to the one-member-one-vote
electoral system approved by last year's party conference.
Branch ballots are regarded with suspicion because they exclude members who
do not attend. They are also open to manipulation by union officials.
The decision followed a letter to the NEC from Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM
president, pleading that his once-mighty union has no money to spend on a
postal or workplace ballot for its 30,000 members.
The NEC urged Mr Scargill to reconsider. Party officials said pithead
ballots were traditional in the NUM and there was no reason why they should
not be used for the leadership election.
Mr Scargill yesterday voiced a desire for the union's levy-payers to take
part in the ballot - the NUM has nominated Mr John Prescott for leader and
Mrs Margaret Beckett for deputy leader.
The NEC also decided that Ucatt would not be able to participate in Labour's
leadership election.
Ucatt, which has serious financial problems, told the party it did not have
the money available to spend an estimated Pounds 70,000 on a postal ballot
of its 130,000 political levy-paying members. The NEC said it was not
acceptable for the union to distribute ballot papers through its branches.
Labour is insisting that all unions involved in the elections carry out a
ballot that gives members a secret vote. 'The vast majority of trade unions
are holding postal ballots,' the party said.
But it added: 'We have agreed in four cases that they can make different
arrangements as long as everybody entitled to vote is able to take part if
they wish to do so.'
The unions concerned are the print union GPMU, the pit deputies union
Nacods, the fire brigades' union and the bakers' union.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Treasury and MoD in row over cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior officials at the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury have failed to
finalise plans for cuts in military expenditure following a row over the way
in which compensation will be paid to service personnel who become
redundant, James Blitz writes.
Just two weeks before the announcement of large cuts in Britain's defence
programme, Treasury officials are insisting that redundancy payments for the
25,000 servicemen and women who will lose their jobs should come from the
MoD budget.
However, defence officials are refusing to bow to the Treasury's demand,
fearing that the payment of redundancy money would further deplete their
budget in future years. Total redundancy payments following next month's
review - called Front Line First - could total many millions of pounds.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has already had to find cuts of
Pounds 750m in the current financial year to meet the expenditure targets
set out in the last Budget. However it is understood that the Defence Cost
Studies programme, which is examining ways of reducing military support
services, has cut spending by much more than this.
Treasury officials, who are in the early stages of another tough public
spending round, argue that the excess savings are not for the defence
department to keep.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Rail union to decide on stepping up dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the RMT transport union will meet on Monday to decide whether to
escalate the dispute involving railway signal staff, who yesterday staged
their third one-day strike.
The following day, Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT general secretary, and Mr Bob
Horton, the Railtrack chairman, will give evidence to the Commons employment
committee on the dispute.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, faces a potentially embarrassing
grilling by the committee the following week on the government's
intervention in the rail pay negotiations.
The RMT executive meets against a background of continuing deadlock after
the collapse of peace talks earlier this week.
One option under serious consideration at the meeting will be to escalate
stoppages from one day a week to two days a week. A further 24-hour strike
is already planned for next Wednesday. The three 24-hour stoppages so far
have cost Railtrack about Pounds 30m in lost revenue.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, told delegates at the RMT's
annual conference in Liverpool yesterday that the signalling grades remained
solidly behind strike action.
'I regret the ongoing inconvenience to the public and I want to get my
members back to work with a just settlement,' he said. 'But I don't see
where an easy answer is going to come from at the moment.'
In a letter sent to the signalling staff last night he said they had
'already given more than enough' in efficiency improvements. 'Railtrack must
now pay the bill owed for past and present productivity.'
Mr Knapp said the union had spent the past four weeks trying to resolve the
dispute, and accused Railtrack of refusing to negotiate seriously. 'They
will not recognise the massive savings you have already given to the
railway,' he wrote.
'This debacle has shown management to be bungling, incompetent and out of
touch with your aspirations.'
A statement from the RMT said that Railtrack's latest package for the
signalling staff tabled at Acas, the conciliation service, had taken the
negotiations 'several steps backwards'. Three weeks ago, the union said, the
company had offered 5.7 per cent on basic rates - now it was offering
conditional average rises of 3.5 per cent in actual earnings.
The RMT said Railtrack was now demanding commitments from the union on
future productivity and restructuring that 'allowed no scope for negotiation
on principles and only restricted negotiation on detail'.
Mr Knapp told the RMT conference that he viewed 'with growing alarm' the use
of managers to operate the signalling system during the one-day strikes. 'We
are not operating a safe railway today,' he said.
Railtrack denied last night that safety had been put at risk on the
railways.
It said all staff operating signalling boxes during the strikes were either
non-union signalling staff or qualified supervisors and managers and that
staffing arrangements were in line with laid-down safety criteria.
Mr Greville Janner, the Labour chairman of the Commons employment committee,
said the government's role in the dispute would be 'one of the prime
questions' for Mr MacGregor to answer when he appeared before the committee.
'The purpose of this exercise is to try to find out what has gone wrong and
how it can be put right,' Mr Janner said. 'This is a strike that has vast
effects on the public, but all the efforts to solve it have been in
private.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Labour in eve-of-poll row over Monklands spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour campaign for the Monklands East by-election was thrown into chaos
on the eve of the poll yesterday as a leading Scottish Labour MP first
attacked the party's candidate over the crucial issue of Monklands District
Council, then made a hasty retraction.
The row broke just as Labour for the first time said it was poised to hold
the seat in the face of a strong challenge from the Scottish National party.
It is defending a majority of nearly 16,000.
Yesterday the Glasgow Evening Times published an article by Mr Jimmy Wray,
MP for Glasgow Provan, in which he challenged Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour
candidate, over her statement last week that Airdrie, the centre of
Monklands East, was discriminated against in allocations of capital spending
by Monklands council compared with neighbouring Coatbridge.
However two-and-half hours after the article appeared Mr Wray issued a
statement saying he had now examined the figures for council spending in
Airdrie and Coatbridge used by Mrs Liddell and said she was right.
Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish National party leader, said the entire Labour
line on the Monklands council issue was a fraud.

<TEXT>
Patrick, a 37-year-old divorcee, takes home Pounds 157 for an average
60-hour week as a security guard at a central London office.
He is one of those whose position was highlighted yesterday by the Institute
for Fiscal Studies, which said the gap between those who earn the most and
those who earn the least is at its highest this century and that the lowest
earners earn less than they did in 1975 in real terms.
Earning Pounds 4.16 an hour for a 12 hour day, Patrick says he is well paid
for a security guard - he knows some in the south-east on as little as
Pounds 3 an hour.
But he receives no sickness benefits and no pension, and has 15 days holiday
a year. Holiday pay is given after the holiday period. 'The company wants to
make sure you come back,' he says.
'It is the young married blokes that get hurt most by this job,' he says.
'They have to put in hours and hours of overtime to make a living wage.
There are so many divorces because the hours are very anti-social.'
Patrick's shift pattern is punishing. He works seven days on, five days off,
followed by seven nights on and three days off. 'It is not possible to have
a social life,' he says.
Patrick left school with no qualifications. He sees no career progression in
his present job and says he sees no point in trying to get any
qualifications. 'Look at all those graduates and skilled people on the
dole,' he says. 'Why bother?'

FT  30 JUN 94 / More trains running
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 1,600 trains ran on the Railtrack network yesterday, the best level of
service on a strike day during the present dispute, William Lewis writes.
British Rail, parent of the new train operating companies, said follow-on
disruption this morning was likely to be minimal.
'We have had trains running in every region of the country,' BR said. Ten
per cent of normal services ran yesterday, compared with 7 per cent a week
before and just over 3 per cent during the first 24-hour strike.
Trains which ran yesterday for the first time during the present series of
stoppages included some from London Paddington to Plymouth; Manchester
Airport to Manchester, Bolton, Preston, and Lancaster; Glasgow to Edinburgh
and Hull to Beverley and Bridlington.
Railtrack said it had been 'not at all a bad service' and that it had been
able to open 1,500 route miles for train operators.
Commuters to the south of London were worst hit with no trains running in or
out of London Waterloo. Problems were also caused when one of the routes
expected to have run normally - the Chiltern Line from London Marylebone to
Aylesbury and Banbury - had to be closed because of vandalism.
The AA motoring organisation reported extra-heavy traffic in the south-east
and London during the morning rush hour. By the afternoon there was a big
build-up of traffic in many cities including Manchester, Leeds and Glasgow.
The Department of Transport reported heavy usage of its special car parking
sites except in London's Docklands.
BR said its staff used the early morning yesterday to ensure that trains
were ready to run straightaway today. 'Railtrack were able to tell us which
signal boxes were likely to be open this time, so we were able to plan
around it,' it said.
There was some embarrassment for the Department of Transport when a special
river service from Gravesend to Charing Cross, which it announced on
Tuesday, turned out to have been booked by a group of pensioners.

After helping with an immediate crisis, he said, councils should be able to
take a 'considered view' about the proper allocation of available homes.
He said the results of consultation on the allocation of council
accommodation would be published next month.
Mr Gummer accused Labour MPs of maintaining their 'deep-seated hatred'
against the private rented sector.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, attacked the 'failure' of
housing policy, and highlighted the growth in the amount of social security
benefit which reached the pockets of private landlords. Much of the rent
rises in the private sector had been 'publicly subsidised' through housing
benefit.
Mr Straw renewed Labour's demand that local authorities should be able to
draw on the capital receipts obtained from the sale of council properties.
The money should be made available to increase the number of properties
available to let and enable the unemployed in the construction industry to
return to work.

FT  30 JUN 94 / The New Economic Order: Many teachers, not much teaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Education, most economists agree, has played a critical role in east Asia in
achieving economic growth and reducing wealth inequalities. Not so in Latin
America where in the last decade - partly because of budget stringency
following the debt crisis - school systems have deteriorated.
Latin America on average scores reasonably well in the resources it devotes
to education. In 1990, South Korea channeled 3.6 per cent of gross national
product to education, Singapore 3.4 per cent and Malaysia 6.9 per cent,
according to the United Nations Development Programme. That compares with
4.1 per cent in Venezuela and Mexico, 5.5 per cent in Panama and 4.6 per
cent in Brazil.
But the problem is not so much the amount of money spent, but the way it is
spent. All over Latin America, teachers are political appointees, many not
even meeting minimum standards of literacy. In Argentina, says Mr Juan
Llach, economic planning secretary, 'the number of people teaching is very
small compared with the number of teachers'.
Furthermore, while most economists argue that primary level education yields
the greatest economic and social benefit, the returns to politicians of
devoting large-scale resources to further education are often higher.
'The average quality of Latin America's primary education is very poor,'
said Mr Sebastian Edwards, the World Bank's chief Latin America economist,
in a report last year. One international comparative study of the reading
abilities of nine-year-olds found that Venezuelan students ranked last.
'This unhappy combination' of neglected primary education and heavily
subsidised higher education 'has had serious regressive distributive
effects, reducing the resources available to the poor, leaving illiteracy
rampant,' he said.
Venezuela's ministry of education is by far the country's largest employer.
Mr Gustavo Marquez, a professor at IESA, a private university in Caracas,
says that the share of the education budget spent on administration and
planning rose from just under 30 per cent in 1980 to 43 per cent in 1991.
Rising enrolment has usually not been matched by an increase in resources.
Spending per child in Latin America fell by an average 28 per cent in the
1980s, according to the World Bank. With spending on books, equipment and
teacher training also falling, many children drop out or retake classes -
giving Latin America the highest repetition rates in the world.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Former directors of BCCI sue Abu Dhabi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three former non-executive directors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International yesterday launched a legal action in the US against
Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholders, seeking damages of Dollars 100m
(Pounds 65m).
The suit marks a highly unusual attempt by directors to sue shareholders,
and is an attempt to respond to the damage they believe has been done to
their reputations by the collapse.
The three directors - Mr Alfred Hartmann, Mr Yves Lamarche and Mr Johan van
Oenen - have recently been sued in Luxembourg by BCCI's liquidators and in
Paris by the liquidators to the bank's French arm.
The action could give the directors access to millions of pages of internal
bank documents which recently arrived in the US. Lawyers for the three claim
these papers would give far more details of the BCCI fraud than have yet
emerged and would reveal the role of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, the
Gulf state's ruler, and of other officials in covering it up.
The US action, filed in a New York state court yesterday, is based largely
on published information. It alleges Sheikh Zayed - with his son, Sheikh
Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and other Abu Dhabi officials - knew of the
fraud in spring 1990, but hid this from the banking regulators and from
BCCI's auditors and non-executive directors. BCCI was not closed down until
July 1991.
Mr John Mitchell, a lawyer acting for the directors, conceded that the
exercise amounted to 'a fishing expedition', but said this was allowed in US
civil cases to give plaintiffs access to all the evidence they might need.
The directors claimed that the auditors, Price Waterhouse, had been
'manipulated and controlled by the shareholders', and the directors were
left uninformed for many months about the investigations into fraud that
were taking place. Price Waterhouse rejected these claims.
Abu Dhabi yesterday rejected the charges, many of which had been heard
before, it said.
The three directors taking the action are:
Mr Alfred Hartmann, a resident of Herrliberg, Switzerland, who joined BCCI's
board in 1982, having been general manager of the Union Bank of Switzerland,
managing director and deputy chairman of Hoffman-La Roche, and a director of
the Swiss operations of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of New York, Lavoro
Bank, Rothschild Bank and Banca del Gottardo.
Mr Yves Lamarche, a US citizen and resident of Paris, who joined BCCI's
board in 1975. He was senior vice-president of the Middle East Area Office
for the Bank of America, and then president and chief executive officer of
Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Investissement from 1980. Mr Johan Diderik
van Oenen, a Dutch citizen who lives in England and who joined BCCI's board
in 1978. He was a senior officer with Bank of America in 1960-73 and became
executive vice-president of the Bank of Montreal.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Private creditors file debt suit against Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian central bank has been named as a defendant in a suit by the
Dart family of the US, Brazil's largest private creditor.
The action, which was filed in New York on Tuesday, had been expected. It
stems from the Dollars 49bn (Pounds 32bn) restructuring of Brazil's
commercial bank debt in April.
The Dart family, which holds about Dollars 1.4bn of Brazilian debt, was the
only significant foreign creditor to reject the terms of the restructuring.
It had threatened legal action against the deal on several occasions.
The court papers show the Darts claiming Dollars 60m in interest payments
which they allege fell due when the restructuring was completed but remain
unpaid.
Brazil does not dispute that some arrears are owed, but is pushing to
negotiate further with the Darts and hopes they can be persuaded to join the
restructuring package.
The family is also seeking a court ruling of its right to 'accelerate'
repayment of the total Dollars 1.4bn it holds.
The Bank of Brazil, a commercial bank 51 per cent government-owned, was the
only other significant creditor not to accept the restructuring, in relation
to Dollars 1.6bn of debt.
The Darts are claiming that the Bank of Brazil, as a government-controlled
bank, is not an independent creditor. If the court agrees, the Darts will
hold the required 50 per cent of the outstanding debt needed to call for an
acceleration.
A Brazilian government spokesman said the latest of several attempts to
reach agreement with the Dart family over the restructuring had been made 15
days ago.
The spokesman said the Darts' action would be defended 'vigorously",
although the action did not imply that the latest offer would be withdrawn.
The Brazilian government has 60 days to respond to the action.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Raising Brazil's poorest - Education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The mayor of Aracati, a small town on Brazil's north-east coast, recently
took office, then closed a local school because its teacher had opposed his
election.
The political use of education is not new in Brazil's poor north-east. But
such interference, mixed with government mismanagement and corruption,
produces illiteracy and poor learning, and threatens to prolong greatly the
region's underdevelopment.
Brazil cut national illiteracy from 51 per cent to 18 per cent in 1950-1990
but, in the north-east, the rate remains at 39 per cent.
The federal government in Brazil is obliged by law to spend at least 18 per
cent of its budget on education, while states and municipalities have to
spend 25 per cent. So there should be ample funds to improve education
nationally.
The problem is less the amount of resources, rather what they are spent on.
Too many governments have used their budgets to recruit 'teachers' at
election time in return for votes or to award school building contracts to
political backers. As a result, too little money is left for what is needed,
long-term investment in the quality of teachers and education standards.
The poor quality of the state system is most visible in figures on children
having to repeat school years and on truancy. For the north-east in general,
less than half the children who start primary school complete the first-year
requirements and progress to the second level.
There is a further sharp shake-out between the fourth and fifth level, about
age 11, since many rural teachers are unable to teach the more demanding
syllabuses.
In Maranhao, only 10 per cent of children complete the eight levels of
primary school which are meant to be compulsory. Officials from the state's
education department say many rural teachers earn less than the equivalent
of Dollars 10 (Pounds 6.45) a month, hardly enough to buy basic food for a
week. One teacher in three has only completed primary school; some are
barely literate.
Faced by such problems, improvements will take many years. But at least two
states are attempting reforms and initial indications are encouraging. An
education ministry programme to improve management and teaching, which
includes Dollars 418m of World Bank money, will also help press states to
raise standards and reduce corruption.
In Piau, one of Brazil's poorest states, a five-year programme is under way
and has lifted spending on education to 33 per cent of the state budget,
well above the legal minimum.
The results are mixed so far - the programme only started in 1991. However,
in interior areas, pass rates have risen slightly and truancy is down. In
Teresina, the state capital, though, pass rates have fallen because of
teachers' strikes against government plans to introduce public examinations
for all teaching jobs.
In neighbouring Ceara state, rapidly developing a reputation for good - and
clean - government, public exams have also been reintroduced.
In previous administrations, teachers were appointed through patronage.
Ceara is also, with several other states, trying to decentralise primary
school administration to the municipalities, who have closer contact with
parents and children. But this will take many years, especially since poorer
municipalities cannot afford to increase education spending.
This article is the second in a series. The first article, Latin America:
Chance to break the cycle of sorrow, was published on June 24 1994.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The kidnapped Mexican financier Mr Alfredo Harp Helu was released on Tuesday
night, after his family had agreed to pay a ransom which his abductors said
was less than Dollars 30m.
Mr Harp, president of Banamex-Acival, Mexico's largest financial
institution, and one of the country's wealthiest men, was kidnapped on March
14 near his house in the south of Mexico City. His abduction sent Mexico's
stock market tumbling.
He is pictured right, in an AP photo, during his captivity and holding a
copy of a Mexican newspaper, dated June 19.
Several hundred rich Mexican businessmen have been kidnapped in recent
years, mostly in the provinces, but none was as prominent as Mr Harp.
In April, Mr Angel Losada, a wealthy retailer whose family controls Grupo
Gigante, was kidnapped in Mexico City, and it is believed that he is still
being held captive.
The families of kidnap victims generally do not co-operate with the police,
whom many suspect of being involved with the kidnapping gangs. In an effort
to combat organised crime, the Mexican government set up a new national
security agency in April, the day after Mr Losada was seized.

Nothing is likely to stop Argentina reaching the World Cup second round
today as top team in Group D. But coach Alfio Basile wants no slip-ups when
Argentina meet Bulgaria at the Cotton Bowl, Dallas. The reason? Argentina do
not want to play Italy in the second round.
Basile's team must overcome a Bulgarian side scrambling for a third-place
qualification spot.
The Argentine coach is forced to make one change. Defender Nestor Sensini
has a knee injury and will be replaced by Hernan Dias.

<TEXT>
A classic mis-match? Three-times world champions Brazil are expected to meet
the US in the second round of the World Cup in San Francisco next Monday -
July 4 - and are trying to appear, like, humble.
The Brazilians dot their comments about the American team with terms like
'much improved', 'very difficult' and 'respect.'
But it is easy to suspect that the lofty Brazilians are being diplomatic
about the World Cup hosts, who have reached the second round against most
expectations.
'It is an opponent we respect like all the others. If they reached the final
16, they did so on merit,' said Brazil's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dennis Bergkamp made sure the struggling Dutch squeezed into the second
round as Group F winners with a 2-1 win over Morocco in Orlando yesterday.
The Dutch avoided traveling by winning the group and next face Ireland in
the Citrus Bowl on Monday. Morocco, who lost all three of their group games,
were eliminated.
Playing slowly and with little cohesion against a makeshift Moroccan team,
the Dutch suffered badly in the heat, which peaked at 48`C (118`F).
Bergkamp scored the first goal in the 43rd minute and provided the vital
pass for fellow striker Bryan Roy to score the decider twelve minutes from
time. Earlier, the Dutch defence had been caught napping to allow Hassan
Nader to score early in the second half.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Players falling foul of Fifa's forcefulness -
The implications for the tournament of the increased numbers of yellow cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is not a trivial question. Apart from the fact that they sound as if
they were separated at birth, what do John Harkes and John Starks have in
common? Answer: they are both ignorant of the basic laws of the games which
they play.
Harkes is the gifted US mid-fielder who, in an act of supreme idiocy,
allowed himself to get a yellow card in the US match against Romania, not
for hacking someone down to prevent a goal but for refusing to retreat the
required 10 yards from a free kick.
It was his second yellow of the first round, meaning that he must miss the
next US match. The fact that he plays in the English premier league is no
excuse. Any red-blooded American, playing on the most successful soccer team
this country has yet produced, should give his eye-teeth to play in his
national colours - probably against Brazil - on July 4, of all weekends.
Harkes, unrepentant and savagely critical of a pair of team-mates who, on
and off the field, dared to criticise his foolishness, claimed ignorance of
the yellow card law. The fault, in his view, naturally lay with the evil
Carpathian, Gheorghe Hagi, whom, he charged, was 'a cheat,' and with Fifa,
for not disseminating the rules more widely.
If he had watched television or read a newspaper with his ears and eyes even
half open, which he could hardly not do over the last two weeks, because the
US team and the World Cup have been getting good play, he would have to
concede that his defence was ludicrous. Yellow cards, now averaging over
four a game, have been one of the stories of the tournament. In any case,
Fifa advised all teams of the rules as long ago as last December.
John Starks plays for the New York Knicks who play basketball, a sport one
of whose basic laws is that it is invariably a good idea to pass the ball to
the team-mate in the best position to put the ball into the basket.
The great Knicks team of a generation ago - some of whose members have gone
on to other fame and fortune, even, dubiously, the US senate - was
predicated on the principle of finding the 'open man.'
In last week's championship finale, Starks forgot the basic law. Assuming
that the game against the Houston Rockets was winnable only by his own
efforts - and it takes some nerve to believe that one man can beat five - he
neglected his fellow Knicks and hoisted hapless shot after hapless shot.
Houston won by seven points and, to give him the credit that Harkes does not
yet deserve, Starks was more or less contrite. But he was also dumb.
From a managerial or coaching point of view, team psychology, as Jeeves
might have put it, can be a factor. Jack Charlton, Ireland's manager, was
never about to back down in the face of obscure Fifa officials complaining
about his wandering of the touchline in the Ireland-Mexico match, even
though it cost him his perch in the Norway game.
Likewise, Earl Weaver, a great baseball manager, would berate umpires and
kick dirt all over their painted black shoes so as to inspire his Baltimore
Orioles to fly again.
Soccer has more than its share of sharp practice, which has not been
eliminated even by this most tightly policed of tournaments. Most tackles
get the dying swan treatment from the tackled; most goalkeepers fall down at
the slightest suggestion of halitosis from an attacker; and many goals are
appealed for offside even though half the defending team is camped on the
goal-line.
But the interesting thing is that sporting authorities, which make the law,
are starting to get tougher. Take ice hockey. Here is a sport, beloved by
Canadians with no teeth and by lots of eastern Europeans, which was falling
into serious disrepute because of its lack of observance of nominal law.
A shocking thing happened last year when the game came under a new
commissioner. In the play-offs, a Washington player reacted typically to a
Pittsburgh goal by sharply bringing down his stick on the scorer's wrist,
breaking it (the wrist, not the stick).
Old hockey would have puffed itself up and given the offender 10 minutes in
the penalty box. New hockey suspended him for the best part of half a
season, without pay. This year, the renaissance of the sport has been
astounding.
There is no way of knowing what thought processes and precedents passed
through Fifa's collective mind in laying down the law for this World Cup,
beyond the obvious: that it had half an eye on making the game attractive to
America.
But, having done what it has done and having seen its referees carry out
their mandates with some precision, no player can conceivably claim
ignorance of the new rules of the game.
Not all are new - no-one has been sent off yet for over-acting - and some,
like the limits on passing back to a goalkeeper, have been in use for some
time. The yellow card rules, likewise, were not clothed in legalese or
deliberately hidden from the players.
The simple lesson is this: those who know the law can bend it most
effectively; those in ignorance can only be caught by it, with heat of the
moment no mitigating excuse. Harkes and Starks, in their different ways,
need to go to law school. Come to think of it, Harkes and Starks has a nice
ring as a law firm.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Fairytale for Saudis as Belgium falter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Presumably it is all to be found somewhere in A Thousand and One Nights. But
Saudi Arabia, a team which by its own reckoning pulled off a minor miracle
merely in qualifying for the World Cup, performed an even greater one here
one yesterday by beating Belgium 1-0 and thus moving on to the next round
against Sweden.
The Saudi victory was no fluke. It was won by virtue of stout defence, fine
goalkeeping and the sort of goal that comes strictly from the realms of
fantasy.
In the fifth minute, Owairan moved forward from the centre circle. Before
him were deployed the Belgian back four and Michel Preud'homme in goal,
previously impregnable in the tournament. You could have got long odds
against him even reaching the penalty area.
In the sort of dribble that combined much skill and balance, plus a couple
of lucky bounces, he took on all four one at a time and left them for dead.
The coup de grace was perfect, a delicate chip over the head of the
advancing Preud'homme.
And then his teammates made it hold up, unlike last week when a similar
early lead against Holland was lost. The heads and legs of the back four -
Al-Jawad, Al-Khlaiwi, Zebermawi and, above all, Madani - frustrated attack
after attack.
Even so, a more imaginative team than plodding Belgium, with so much
possession, should surely have at least made it even. But Enzo Scifo, the
alleged mastermind, seemed to be under the impression that all his forwards
were eight feet tall, so often did he punt it high into the Saudi goalmouth.
Sure, chances were missed. Josip Weber, a half-time substitute, was the
prime culpit, high on two close headers and a volley all in the last 15
minutes. But Al-Deayea, now surely to be ranked alongside Preud'homme as the
best goalkeeper in the Cup, was not forced into a serious save after the
64th minute when he twisted to clutch a deflected shot from Philippe Albert.
When it was done, the paper confetti showered down from the upper seats and
thin Arabian horns punctuated the din. And here's the interesting thing;
Saudi Arabia did it without their best player, Fuad Amin, suspended after
picking up two earlier yellow cards.

FT  30 JUN 94 / US growth revised upwards to 3.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew more vigorously than previously thought in the first
quarter, at an annualised rate of 3.4 per cent in real terms, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday.
Personal consumption grew at an annualised rate of 5.2 per cent between the
fourth quarter and the first quarter, an acceleration from the growth
recorded in the second half of last year.
The growth in gross domestic product in the first quarter was initially
estimated at an annualised rate of 2.6 per cent and subsequently at 3.0 per
cent, before yesterday's revision to 3.4 per cent. Similar upward revisions
occurred in the fourth quarter when growth was finally put at 7 per cent, up
from an initial 5.9 per cent.
Employment growth figures have also been revised up in recent weeks.
The latest GDP revision is significant because it confirms the economy was
growing well above its long-run potential rate of expansion in the first
quarter, when output was artificially depressed by a severe winter and the
Californian earthquake. Despite the soft tone of recent figures for retail
spending and industrial production, many forecasters are projecting growth
at or above the first quarter rate in the present quarter, partly reflecting
a rebound of construction and other sectors affected by adverse weather.
If employment data next week are strong, hopes of a deceleration of growth
in the second half could begin to fade, putting renewed domestic pressure on
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said
the annualised growth rate was now probably about 4 per cent. Growth was
likely to remain above trend for the next two to four quarters, reflecting
lean corporate inventories, strong domestic demand for labour and economic
recovery in Europe and Japan.
He predicted the Fed would raise short-term rates by at least a quarter
point next week, possibly by half a point to 4.75 per cent.
The main upward revisions in the first quarter were for personal consumption
and business investment. Federal spending and exports were revised down
slightly.
Broad estimates of inflation were little changed: the 'fixed-weight' GDP
deflator rose at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent.
In the first quarter, GDP, personal consumption and non-residential fixed
investment stood 3.8 per cent, 4.4 per cent and 13.2 per cent above the same
period last year.

Amid the crush of sweating hacks in the media centre at Giants Stadium, New
Jersey, a surreal sight: two nuns seated at a desk, happily watching the
Brazil-Sweden game on TV.
Sisters Marie France and Mary Francesca normally help run a soup kitchen
from a mission in Spanish Harlem, and were not at the stadium to save the
lost souls of the press room, though they would help if asked.
The two French nuns are working as offical interpreters, mostly with
French-speaking supporters and journalists. 'We like to help,' says Sister
Marie.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Saudis shock Belgium to qualify with Holland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia produced one of the most unexpected results of the opening
round of the World Cup finals yesterday when they toppled previously
unbeaten Group F favourites Belgium 1-0.
Their winning goal came after only five minutes when Saeed Owairan burst
from an unmarked position in his own half to carve open the Belgian defence
with a spectacular run and emphatic finishing shot.
It was the first goal conceded by Belgium in the tournament and ensured that
the Saudis qualified for the second round.
In Orlando, Holland swept through, beating Morocco 2-1. Bryan Roy, who had
been on the pitch just 11 minutes, scored the winner in the 78th minute,
gratefully snapping up a chance provided by Dennis Bergkamp, who had earlier
scored the first Dutch goal.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Senate vote blocks move to streamline product liability
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweeping changes in US product liability law, which would have curbed
consumers' rights, foundered in the Senate yesterday when the bill's
supporters failed to break a filibuster.
The Product Liability Act was meant to set a national standard for the
treatment of lawsuits against manufacturers of products that have injured or
killed consumers, in place of the existing patchwork of state laws.
Its backers, led by Democratic Senator John D. Rockefeller, argued that
changes were vital to streamline the system, and prevent some of the
arbitrary or excessive awards against companies which, they claim, are made
under state law.
Fear of liability lawsuits was also damaging US competitiveness by
inhibiting product innovation, they argued.
Opponents included a wide range of consumer, women's and union groups, which
fought a tough campaign against the bill.
Its supporters yesterday fell three short of the 60 Senate votes needed to
halt debate on the issue, effectively killing the bill for this year.
The bill sought to:
promote non-trial alternatives to resolve liability disputes, such as
non-binding arbitration;
eliminate company liability for injuries caused by defective workplace
equipment more than 25 years old;
end the rule of joint and several responsibility whereby a victim of a
dangerous product may be able at present to seek full redress against, for
example, a manufacturer and its parts supplier;
provide an absolute protection against punitive damages for manufacturers of
government-approved drugs and medical devices.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Diplomatic Brazilians respectful of hosts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A classic mis-match? Three-times world champions Brazil are expected to meet
the US in the second round of the World Cup in San Francisco next Monday -
July 4 - and are trying to appear, like, humble.
The Brazilians dot their comments about the American team with terms like
'much improved', 'very difficult' and 'respect.' But it is easy to suspect
that the lofty Brazilians are being diplomatic about the World Cup hosts,
who have reached the second round against most expectations.
'It is an opponent we respect like all the others. If they reached the final
16, they did so on merit,' said Brazil's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira.
Brazil drew 1-1 with Sweden on Tuesday to top Group B in the first round.
The US team were third in Group A.
What exactly does Brazil respect about the Americans, Parreira was asked.
'They are very determined to win,' he replied. 'They have two or three fast
players up front.'
On the other hand, odds-makers have made Brazil cramped favourites to win
the title, and are quoting less than 2-1 against them in London, even though
four knock-out stages remain.
Brazil have won all five of their previous matches against the US. The last
time the US scored against Brazil - during a 4-3 loss in 1930 - Herbert
Hoover was in the White House.
Worse, the Americans will be without mid-fielder and playmaker John Harkes
(see story right), who got his second yellow card against Romania and will
sit out a compulsory one-game suspension.
The Brazilians still won't knock their hosts. 'They are a very difficult
team, despite their lack of soccer tradition,' says mid-fielder Dunga. 'They
are greatly improved, with players from Germany and England.'
Team-mate Mazinho also predicted a tough match 'even though we have superior
technique and tradition.'
After Mexico's 1-1 draw with Italy on Tuesday, securing a second-round spot,
two men died and many were hurt after celebrations in Mexico City led to
violence. Youths, many drunk, roamed streets, smashing windows.
Mexico's coach has pleaded with fans to celebrate peacefully.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Legislators hasten on healthcare bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senate and House committees, spurred on by a tour of Capitol Hill by Mrs
Hillary Rodham Clinton, yesterday scrambled to wrap up work on healthcare
reform legislation before Congress goes into recess at the end of the week
for the Independence Day holiday.
Administration officials are no longer worrying about the details of the
bills emerging from the five main committees with jurisdiction over
healthcare; they just want the committee phase finished, so that they can
move on to hammering out a bill on the floor of the two chambers.
The labour committees in both House and Senate have marked up bills closely
resembling the plan presented by President Bill Clinton. A third,
Congressman John Dingell's House energy and commerce committee, has given up
trying to reach agreement.
The House Ways and Means Committee, which holds sway over taxation and is
thus critically important to the financing mechanisms of any reform bill, is
expected to produce its version with a final vote today.
Congressman Sam Gibbons, who took over the chairmanship of Ways and Means
after the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, has succeeded in
holding together a Democratic majority on his committee, thanks in part to
resentment at the Republicans' tactical decision to oppose everything.
Mr Gibbons' bill would achieve Mr Clinton's goal of universal coverage by
expanding the existing Medicare programme to cover the unemployed and
employees of small businesses. It would also retain Mr Clinton's requirement
that employers pay 80 per cent of their workers' insurance costs - the most
controversial element of the reform and the issue on which Mr Dingell was
unable to reach an agreement.
That leaves the Senate finance committee which, as the last to mark up the
bill, is seen as holding the key to the ultimate passage of the reform.
The committee began detailed drafting yesterday on the basis of an outline
produced by its chairman, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mr Moynihan's
draft would only require employers to pay for health insurance if other
reforms to the insurance market failed to expand coverage to 96 per cent of
the population over the next five years. Even that delayed mandate, however,
is expected to be defeated when the committee votes.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, was yesterday due to unveil his
own modest reform proposal, in an effort to divert criticism of his party's
lack of constructive involvement.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South African wines have made an unexpectedly strong comeback in Canada
since trade sanctions against Pretoria were lifted six months ago. Canada
had vied with the UK as South Africa's biggest wine and spirits market
before the imposition of sanctions in 1986.
Government liquor boards, which control wine and spirits marketing in most
Canadian provinces, have yet to issue detailed sales figures for the past
few months. But an official at the Ontario board, the world's biggest liquor
retailer, confirmed that it has struggled to keep up with demand. 'There was
a fair bit of anticipation among wine enthusiasts for South African
products,' he said. Many retail outlets have run out of stocks.
Mr Michael Sainsbury, local agent for the South African Co-operative
Winegrowers' Association, 'conservatively' forecasts sales of South African
red wines in Ontario would reach 9,300 cases this year, only 13 per cent
short of volumes in 1985, the last full year before sanctions. He estimates
white wine sales this year at 8,000 cases, about two-thirds of 1985 volume.
Demand for brandy and other fortified wines has risen more slowly.
The strong performance of the South African products is ascribed partly to
competitive pricing and wine drinkers' past loyalties. But their
reappearance has also coincided with rising demand for wines from other
southern hemisphere countries, notably Australia and Chile.
A vigorous marketing campaign, including the formation of a wine society,
has accompanied the South African return.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Trade News: ECGD to step up support for UK exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Export Credit Guarantee Department yesterday announced changes to its
rules to improve support for British exporters participating in large
projects involving privatised enterprises, particularly in developing
countries.
The improvements are intended mainly to benefit British companies which
undertake and invest in long-term projects in industries such as oil and gas
production, power generation, construction and transportation.
The changes follow extensive consultations with leading British exporters,
which have complained that previous ECGD schemes were too restrictive to
provide adequate cover against the risks of selling to and investing in
privatised organisations in countries such as China, India and Russia.
Such business is growing rapidly, as privatisation spreads through the
developing world. By some estimates, British exporters and contractors stand
to win contracts worth about Pounds 9bn in China alone in the next five
years.
However, because national governments do not stand behind privatised
projects, their creditworthiness is assessed not on the basis of sovereign
risk but of their commercial viability and prospective cash flow.
The first change announced by the ECGD is to its hitherto little-used
project finance scheme, under which project cover was limited to 60 per cent
and a maximum of Pounds 70m.
In future, there will be no ceiling on the amount of cover, which will be
decided case by case on the basis of project size, financial commitment of
the parties involved, overall risk sharing and cover capacity for the export
market concerned.
Mr Brian Willott, chief executive of the ECGD, said the change would mean
the organisation would be more closely involved in evaluating prospective
project cash flows but would not reduce its risk standards.
The second change involves an expansion of the ECGD's overseas investment
insurance scheme to improve cover for British companies making equity
investments in privatised foreign enterprises. The change is expected to
cause the ECGD's exposure under the scheme, currently about Pounds 200m, to
increase several times in the next few years.

The Thai cabinet has decided that the Hongkong group Hopewell Holdings will
not have to run any of its 60km road and railway scheme underground in the
centre of Bangkok, William Barnes reports from Bangkok. But the cabinet
would still like nearly half of Tanayong's 22km elevated railway to go
underground following vigorous protests by local environmentalists; the Land
Traffic Management Committee has a fortnight to try to negotiate with the
Bangkok-based developer. Bangkok Land, which unlike Hopewell and Tanayong
has yet to sign a franchise agreement, has agreed to take much of its 20km
Skytrain project underground; receiving a maximum subsidy of Dollars 660m on
top the estimated original Dollars 2bn cost.

The European Commission's deputy director general for industry has warned
South Korea that pressure is mounting in Europe for a reduction of Korean
car imports unless Seoul opens its market to foreign competition, Reuter
reports from Seoul.
In 1993, South Korea exported about 100,000 passenger cars to Europe but
imported only 363 European cars. Foreign imports accounted for a mere 0.2
per cent of the total South Korean market of about 1m last year.

US farm subsidies and programmes will not be cut to make up for the
shortfall in government revenue caused by the Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, according to Mr Leon Panetta, outgoing
director of the budget office, Jeremy Kahn reports from Washington.
Mr Panetta made the pledge while speaking before a House agriculture
committee. The administration has yet to account for about 25 per cent, or
Dollars 3bn, of the tariff revenue that the US will lose under the Uruguay
Round. Mr Panetta's assurances to the House committee were intended to quell
rumours, circulated by Gatt opponents earlier in the week, that the
administration is planning to slash agricultural aid in order to cover the
lost revenue.

Chinese authorities yesterday raided a Beijing computer software distributor
and four outlets, AP-DJ reports from Beijing.
The Business Software Alliance, an industry-funded watchdog, nevertheless
pressed on with calls for the Clinton administration to apply Section 301 of
the US Trade Act to its dealings with Beijing. The decision whether to
proceed with a so-called 'special 301' investigation is due today. If the US
imposes 301 and carries out a probe into China's protection of intellectual
property, Washington could impose stiff trade sanctions. The alliance said
the raids by Beijing's Intellectual Property Tribunal were the first such
action waged against illegal software dealers in China.

FT  30 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Gentle man in search of a tough job -
Nancy Dunne interviews Rubens Ricupero, candidate to lead the World Trade
Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rubens Ricupero looks more like a friar than a finance minister -
particularly Brazil's finance minister on the eve of a potentially painful
currency conversion.
A fringe of white hair springs from his bald pate. His demeanour is gentle.
But the job he wants is one of the most formidable in the diplomatic world:
the director-generalship of the still-to-be-launched and not-yet-defined
World Trade Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Mr Ricupero first has an obstacle to overcome in his own hemisphere - the
now formalised candidacy of Mexican President Carlos Salinas. The Brazilian
has only complimentary things to say about Mr Salinas and stresses that his
own candidacy is based on 'different criteria' - an intimate, detailed
knowledge of world trading rules.
'I know the traditions, the history, the people. I could go to work there
tomorrow,' he said.
Mr Ricupero has been finance minister since April, after holding a
succession of increasingly visible diplomatic and political posts. He was
ambassador to Gatt (1987-1991), ambassador to the US (1991-1993), and
environment minister (1993).
During his time at Gatt he served as chairman of the Informal Group of
Developing Countries, the Committee on Trade and Development, the Gatt
Council and the Gatt Contracting Parties.
His candidacy springs from Geneva (where the Gatt secretariat is based),
rather than Brasilia, said one of his aides. 'He was asked to run; he did
not seek this and there are many other things he can do.'
Mr Ricupero's tact on the subject of Mr Salinas is remarkable considering
what Brazilians regard as unsportsmanlike behaviour on behalf of the Mexican
president at the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena, Colombia, two weeks
ago.
It was only after the Brazilians left early on hearing of the death of their
president's nephew that Mr Salinas' supporters moved and won an unofficial
endorsement of the Mexican president's candidature, the Brazilians say.
It caused a diplomatic incident with Argentina which has now backtracked and
supports Mr Ricupero.
Mr Ricupero's best shot could be as a compromise candidate from the
developing countries in the case of a stand-off between Mr Renato Ruggiero
of Italy, as the EU's candidate, and Mr Salinas, who may be regarded by some
as too close to the US.
Mr Ricupero's supporters have a long list of points in his favour: Brazil's
economy comprises 40 per cent of Latin America's gross domestic product;
Brazil was a founding member of the Gatt, which Mexico joined just eight
years ago; Mexico's trade is heavily dependent on the US while Brazil's is
truly multilateral - about 20 per cent of its trade is with Asia, 22 per
cent with the US, 30 per cent with Europe and 20 per cent with Latin
America.
Mr Ricupero's staff call him a 'Renaissance man', equally comfortable
discussing music, the arts, philosophy and religion. He still teaches two
courses at the University of Brasilia, where he started teaching in 1987 and
was appointed professor. There is the air of the pedagogue about him as he
dissects the pros and cons of trading blocs and concludes that they are
'building blocks' of liberalisation in which trading partners can more
easily make concessions.
'One of the aspirations of Brazil is to advance towards a South American
common market,' he said. Eventually the hemisphere would unite under the
banner of freer trade.
He sees little threat of a return to the protectionism of the 1930s. There
is no depression or scarcity of strong currencies to drive it, he said.
Instead of deepening political divisions - as between the fascists,
communists and democrats in the 1930s - there is now 'systemic convergence'.
He said the WTO, which still 'has only a paper existence', must be given
form and substance based on the rules agreed in Marrakesh. These rules must
be tested, he said.
He has definite ideas about what the WTO should not be - centralised, like
the other Bretton Woods institutions, a large bureaucracy, or ideological.
It must be more open to outsiders; special meetings could be called to give
access to non-governmental organisations.
As for the controversy over bringing workers' rights into the WTO, he called
for a 'step-by-step approach for confidence-building' among the warring
parties. Polarisation between north and south must be avoided. The issues
must be clarified by debate.
'There is a tremendous amount of distrust,' he said. 'We must avoid being
bogged down.'

FT  30 JUN 94 / Arafat's homecoming plan takes Israel by surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM, TUNIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, who took the Palestinian cause from an armed guerrilla
struggle to a negotiated peace with Israel, is to make a historic return to
his homeland on Saturday.
Mr Arafat's planned visit to the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip at the weekend
will be an emotional moment for the 2m Palestinians in Gaza and the West
Bank and the 4m in exile as refugees - symbolising the right of Palestinians
to return home and affirming the Palestinian aspiration to an independent
state.
In a surprise move characteristic of the veteran PLO leader's theatrical
style, Mr Arafat decided yesterday morning that he wanted to visit the Gaza
Strip for three days. The decision came after weeks of hesitation.
The hasty decision, made by Mr Arafat alone, left Israeli and PLO officials
in a state of shock.
Israel had long maintained that Mr Arafat should give two weeks' notice to
allow the Jewish state to take the necessary security precautions in the
face of possible violent disturbances from both Palestinian and Israeli
opponents. But late last night Israel decided to waive this requirement and
Mr Oded Ben-Ami, a spokesman for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, said:
'I can confirm the fact that the chairman will be coming on Saturday.'
Mr Ben-Ami said after a high-level government meeting that Mr Arafat had
wanted to begin his visit tomorrow but that Israel had insisted Saturday
would be the earliest feasible date to allow the Jewish state to take the
necessary security measures. He said Mr Arafat had agreed to the Saturday
date.
The PLO was also caught by surprise by Mr Arafat's decision. Several senior
PLO officials from Gaza and the West Bank were out of the country and were
reported to be scrambling to find flights home in time for Mr Arafat's
arrival.
In a PLO office in Tunis no more than 100 yards from Mr Arafat's residence,
the first one official knew of the trip was a telephone call from a local
journalist seeking confirmation. The official responded that he knew
nothing.
PLO officials said they believed the key to Mr Arafat's decision was a
message on Tuesday night from Mr Ahmed Qurei, economic minister in the
Palestinian self-rule authority, that agreement had been reached in
Washington on releasing more aid. Mr Qurei had apparently managed to
increase monthly dispersals from a special fund from Dollars 10m to Dollars
13m (Pounds 8.5m).
More than Dollars 720m has been pledged to the Palestinians for the first
year of self-rule, but the bulk of the aid is for specific development
projects and many donors have sought to prevent their contributions going
directly to the PLO.
Other PLO officials said Mr Arafat was confronted yesterday with an
international media review which made him look foolish for his indecision
over the visit.
In Israel news of Mr Arafat's impending arrival was greeted by virulent
criticism from the right-wing opposition. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of
the Likud party, said the visit was the height of national humiliation and
marked the capitulation of the government of Israel to the idea of a
Palestinian state.
Thousands of Israeli settlers were expected to demonstrate their opposition
to the visit. Leaders of Jewish settlers in the occupied Arab lands called
for mass demonstrations to oppose the visit and said they would seek to
bring Jerusalem to a standstill by civil disobedience.

Mr Brian Yuill, the former managing director of Spedley Securities, one of
the high-flying Australian investment banks of the 1980s, has had a
conviction for misusing company money quashed in the appeal courts, writes
Nikki Tait in Sydney.
He had previously been sentenced to eight years in prison, after a jury
found him guilty of seven offences under the state's companies code.
The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeals yesterday ordered a retrial
based on a possible misdirection by Judge Shadbolt, who heard the previous
trial. The judge had made comments on the cost of such trials, and told the
jury that if a unanimous verdict was not reached another trial would have to
be held.
Mr Yuill, who had pleaded not guilty to all charges on which he was found
guilty, still faces some additional charges relating to interest-free loans
from another company which he controlled. These will be heard in August. No
date has been fixed for the retrial on the first matters.

Sixty-four people were injured, two seriously, yesterday when two explosions
rocked a demonstration in central Algiers, security forces said, writes Mark
Nicholson in Cairo.
The blasts, apparently caused by a lone attacker, occurred shortly after the
start of the rally, called by the Rassemblement pour la Culture et
Democratie, one of Algeria's main secular parties, just as the party's
leader, Mr Said Saadi, was passing. A CDR spokesman said Mr Saadi was
unhurt.
The CDR called the demonstration, which it said was tens of thousands
strong, on the second anniversary of the assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf,
the former president. No group has claimed responsibility for the blast,
which the CDR said was 'clearly an attack on Algeria's democratic forces'.
More than 4,000 people have died in political violence in Algeria since the
cancellation of elections in 1991 led to intensified clashes between Islamic
militants and the security forces.

North Korea has suspended its usual loudspeaker broadcasts of propaganda
against the Southern president at the truce line dividing the communist and
capitalist states, writes Bradley Martin in Seoul.
The broadcasts attacking South Korean President Kim Young-sam, normally
directed to southern soldiers along the border, halted at 5pm on Tuesday,
just before the announcement of an agreement to hold the summit in Pyongyang
next month.
Temporarily turning off its propaganda insults has been a standard North
Korean measure whenever the two sides approach face-to-face meetings. The
pattern has been for the insults to resume after failure of the talks. In
recent months North Korean propaganda has denounced the South Korean
president as a traitor. Seoul generally is more restrained in its broadcast
characterisations of North Korean President Kim Il-sung.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Fourth government in a year brings LDP back to power: With
an eight-seat majority, the new coalition may be even less stable than its
predecessors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The old order of Japanese politics last night took its revenge on the new,
in a twist to the past year's dismantling of the traditional structure of
power.
r The three-party alliance of the rightwing Liberal Democratic party, the
left Social Democratic party and the New Harbinger party, an LDP splinter
group, is extraordinary by any standards.
The LDP and SDP were in government and opposition respectively for 38 stable
years until the collapse of the LDP government just under a year ago.
Since then, Japan has had two coalition governments dedicated to sweeping
away the old order, in which policies where made on the whim of LDP
factions, in favour of a new power structure closer to the electorate. This
morning, a puzzled electorate will wake up to find that the LDP, a creature
of the old system, is back in the fourth government in a year.
The new coalition, with a slender eight-seat majority, may prove to be even
less stable than its short-lived predecessors. In just over a week's time,
at a Group of Seven summit, its prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, 70,
will face US President Bill Clinton, who is anxious for evidence that Japan
is moving to stimulate its convalescent economy. Yet Mr Murayama and his
party are far out of line with the LDP on most issues, from defence to
foreign affairs and tax.
But the force that drew the old enemies together is clear. Both the LDP and
SDP are dominated by conservatives with large factions which are reluctant
to accept economic deregulation and political reform, the mainstays of the
previous two coalition governments' policies.
Both parties also fear that plans to change the present multi-seat
constituency system into a mixture of single-seat and proportional
representation will sweep away the support groups that kept them in
parliament for nearly four decades.
Mr Murayama has recently called for a snap general election under the
existing political system, before new electoral boundaries can be prepared
for the new one, by autumn.
This could delay or even spell the end of political reform, officials of the
former coalition fear.
Mr Murayama last night appeared to soften his stance and maintained that the
new government would pursue political reform, a sign - though not a
conclusive one - of sensitivity to the support for political reform among
Japan's electorate.
The LDP and SDP are also united in their dislike for Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the
former LDP secretary general who brought down the LDP government last June
by leading a defection. The SDP's wish to take revenge on Mr Ozawa dates
from his backing for the formation of a centre-right bloc in former prime
minister Mr Tsutomu Hata's coalition in April. This excluded the SDP,
causing it to storm out of the government. That deprived the coalition of
its majority, making Mr Hata's resignation, last Saturday, a matter of time.
Mr Koichi Kato, a member of parliament from the LDP's powerful Miyazawa
faction, acknowledged the former rivals' common interests last night when he
said his party shared a common thread of history with the SDP. The breakdown
of Japan's traditional political order had eroded their ideological
differences, he said.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the former prime minister who fought to push political
reform through parliament earlier this year, saw it differently. 'This
collusion is the last struggle of two parties trying to stick to their
logrolling politics that dominated Japan since 1955,' he said.
Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo, described
it yesterday as 'a desperate marriage of the cold war warriors'.
The marriage, however, will be under strain from today, when the LDP-SDP
coalition is expected to try to form a cabinet, in which the numerically
stronger LDP will demand most of the top jobs. Political analysts expect the
LDP to push for Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, a former finance minister and fiscal
conservative, to return to his old ministry.
This will be controversial because Mr Hashimoto, like the mainstream of the
LDP, supports plans for tax reform along the lines drawn up by the Finance
Ministry, for a cut in income tax to be followed by a more than doubling of
Japan's internationally low 3 per cent rate of sales tax. It was this very
issue that forced the SDP to break off talks with the former coalition.
The SDP, which bitterly opposed the introduction of sales tax in 1988 and
campaigns on a promise to ban the tax, will not accept his appointment
easily and will find it even harder to accept a decision on raising tax.
The LDP and SDP were both internally divided before that made their grab for
power last night. The drama may have shaken their unity even further, by
forcing reform-minded members of the LDP and SDP to vote against their old
parties.
On the LDP side, they include Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a reform-minded former prime
minister who broke away from his party ranks just 1 1/2 hours before the
parliamentary vote, in order to stand against Mr Murayama with the backing
of Mr Hata's coalition.
Mr Kaifu had the support of two other LDP heavyweights, former prime
minister Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone and former foreign minister Mr Michio
Watanabe.
Mr Kaifu, looking impassive after his defeat, said he would now leave the
party. The others may be considering leading another round of defections.
The cost of last night's grab for power could, for the LDP, be very high.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Japan's industrial output set to rise again after 32nd
straight fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese industrial output fell 1.4 per cent in the year to May - or 0.8 per
cent from April, William Dawkins writes. This is the 32nd month in which
annualised production has fallen, a record downturn. However, the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry forecast that it would rise by 1.9 per
cent from May to June, to give a 0.3 per cent annualised rise for this
month.
Quarterly figures suggest that production may have started to turn the
corner at the beginning of this year, heralding recovery. It rose by a
seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent from the last three months of 1993 to the
first quarter of this year and could rise by 1 per cent again in the second
three months, said Miti. An official warned, however, that the yen's
volatility against the dollar could upset that prediction. 'There are still
ups and downs,' he said.
Inventories of unsold goods reached 17.8 per cent of annual sales in May,
down 2.2 per cent over the year. 'There was still a sense of excess' and
industry needed to cut inventories still further, an official said. Stock
levels are watched closely because an end to inventory adjustments has
presaged a sustained rise in industrial output in previous recoveries.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Lifelong socialist takes charge: Tomiichi Murayama, a
fisherman's son, is Japan's new PM

<TEXT>
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's fourth premier in less than a year, is a
lifelong socialist, with no previous experience in a ministerial post.
The 70-year-old Mr Murayama became chairman of the Social Democratic party
last September after the resignation of Mr Sadao Yamahana, who stepped down
in order to take responsibility for the party's poor showing in the election
that summer.
Mr Seishiro Fukuda, editor of the party newspaper Shakai Shinpo, described
him at the time as a politician who had no distinct policy platform. 'He is
a harmoniser who will play a balancing role.'
But his attempts to balance the opposing wings of his own party created
little harmony for the coalition formed as a result of that election. The
socialists repeatedly threatened to leave the government. They started out
opposing the opening up of the country's rice markets and initially opposed
the reform measures of the Hosokawa government.
In February this year, the uneasy truce between the socialists and their
nominal allies in government threatened to break down completely when Mr
Hosokawa tried to push through a sharp increase in consumption tax to offset
cuts in income tax. The socialists' opposition forced the government to drop
the plan.
The strains of office finally proved too much for the party in April when
the new government of Mr Tsutomu Hata constructed a conservative grouping
within the coalition.
Hours before the vote yesterday Mr Murayama was still involved in
negotiations with Mr Hata. When these broke down he won the backing of most
members of the Liberal Democratic party.
He takes office at the head of a government dominated by the LDP, which had
been the conservative ruler of Japan for nearly 40 years and, until last
night, the new prime minister's inveterate political foe.
A striking figure, tall and stooping with bushy eyebrows, Mr Murayama is a
former trade union official. The fifth son of a fisherman from Oita
prefecture in southern Japan, he attended Meiji University in Tokyo. He
spent several years in local politics before being elected to the lower
house of the Diet in 1972.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Keating seeks closer ties with Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA, SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday ended a three-day
business promotion visit to Jakarta, reflecting his renewed effort to place
Australian-Indonesian ties on a sound economic footing after a history of
political differences.
Relations between the two have had a bumpy ride over the past few years
following Australia's criticism of Indonesia's record on human rights.
Mr Keating's efforts to divert the focus to economic issues have become more
urgent in the run-up to the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in
November, which will be chaired by Indonesia. Two-way trade between
Australia and Indonesia hit rose to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) last year,
nearly twice its level of five years ago.
Mr Keating's visit coincides with Australia's biggest trade exhibition ever
 -Australia Today Indonesia 1994 - which is being held in Jakarta.
Although Mr Keating would have preferred to adhere to economic matters,
pressure in Australia forced him to raise the question of Indonesia's recent
press bans. Last week the Indonesian government banned two leading magazines
and a tabloid - Editor, Tempo and DeTik - in its most severe clampdown on
political debate in years. The ban came after the government had pledged to
foster more political openness.
Mr Keating said he expressed his regret at the press ban, which he said
'appears to conflict or at least contrast with the openness generally
occurring in the Indonesian economy'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Market - not central bank - to supervise NZ banking:
Customers, competitors and the press will be system's new watchdogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's Reserve Bank is pressing ahead with a revolutionary free
market approach to banking supervision.
The present system, under which the country's 18 licensed banks provide
confidential information to the central bank to enable it to monitor risks,
is due to be abolished early next year.
In its place comes 'prudential supervision', which rests on maximum public
disclosure. The information which had been provided to the central bank
confidentially will instead be published each quarter, allowing the public -
customers, competitors, the press - to act as watchdogs on a bank's affairs.
Locally incorporated banks will have to appoint independent directors,
including the chairman, who will have to sign statements attesting to the
truth and adequacy of risk management systems.
The new system is based on the principle that a well-informed market is the
safest, best and least expensive way for a central bank to supervise banking
operations.
Mr Murray Sherwin, chief manager of the banking system department of the
Reserve Bank, says it is designed to ensure banks' directors take a greater
interest in 'getting it right'.
He says companies will put in place good risk management systems rather than
be forced to publicise bad news that might crop up in a particular quarter.
'In future they'll think very carefully of their risks and obligations. And
directors will be looking equally closely at their bank's skills and
systems, fees, costs and internal budgets.'
Mr Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank, says no system of banking
supervision is perfect, but he is confident that the new one will reduce the
risk of bank failure.
The proposals, due to become law in the first half of 1995 after mainly
technical revisions of the final draft, should lead to lower compliance
costs. Mr Sherwin says under the US system, for instance, regulatory costs
might be 6 to 14 per cent of banks' non-interest expenses. 'There is no
reason why the costs should be so high.'
The new system will build on principles used in establishing the prudential
supervision framework over the past seven years. The system, introduced in
1987, kept regulation to a minimum, based on the concept that the incentive
for prudent management should come from the discipline of a competitive
market, and that the central bank should be the guardian of the stability of
the banking system, not the protector of individual institutions or
depositors. This 'hands off' approach will mean that the central bank will
mainly be concerned with the management of bank failures.
The 1990 Reserve Bank Act - which gave the bank independence in setting
monetary policy with the aim of securing low inflation - also set in place
procedures aimed at ensuring market discipline as the best contributor to a
sound financial system. The emphasis was on ensuring the best possible
information circulated to prevent bank failure.
Mr Sherwin says the new system will offer a number of advantages. It will
lead to efficiency gains. Requirements for banks to issue costly
prospectuses for money raising will no longer be needed. Banks will no
longer have to provide quarterly prudential returns to the central bank,
norwill they have to make themselves available for internal reviews.
Mandatory risk limits on large foreign exchange exposures will be abolished.
So will banking supervision fees.
However, banks must provide comprehensive quarterly disclosure statements,
which could involve costly preparation. These must be audited at the
half-year, which could also be expensive.
Mr Sherwin dismisses suggestions that New Zealand is introducing the new
system because most of the banks are now overseas-owned. He says the logic
of the new system is made even more valid because of the diversity of banks
and the difficulties of applying rules that fit their varying activities.
In what is expected to be the final draft, the Reserve Bank backed down from
its idea that all banks should have a credit rating, although all will be
encouraged to get one. The credit ratings, likely to be obtained from
Standard and Poors, Moody's or IBCA, are intended to be publicly displayed
and will allow retail customers to assess a bank's financial health.
The Reserve Bank also decided against an initial proposal to set minimum
capital requirements different from the international standards set by the
1985 Basle capital accord.
Banks have generally welcomed the latest proposals although they have
expressed concern that the plans still represent a radical step that might
damage investors' perceptions.
A spokesman for one bank - who did not wish to be named because of the
sensitivity of the issue - warns that international investors might be
forced to 'price in more risk' in their loans to New Zealand banks.
Banks also worry that some small retail customers may not understand the
meaning of the credit ratings. Some are perturbed at the cost of providing
quarterly detailed reports, while others say they have an open mind to see
how the new system works in practice.
Dr Roderick Deane, a leading free marketeer who heads Telecom, New Zealand's
biggest company, and has had a big influence on the new strategy, says the
private sector should be left to monitor the performance of the banks.
'The bureaucrats can't do the job any better,' he says.

The new Italian government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday
decided to raise the stakes in its battle to gain control of the RAI state
broadcasting organisation by pledging to remove the management. The RAI
management was brought in last year to cut costs and end its political
partiality but the new government has felt RAI to be prejudiced against it.
The government was obliged yesterday to renew legislation that enabled
debt-ridden RAI to keep operating but the cabinet made it clear it would
only do this if there was an immediate management change. Management had
earlier threatened to go to court and force bankruptcy, thus depriving the
government control over its future.

The CGIL, Italy's main union confederation long dominated by the left,
yesterday elected Mr Sergio Cofferati, a leading member of the chemical
workers' union, to succeed Mr Bruno Trentinas as secretary-general. Mr
Cofferati, 46, will be the CGIL's youngest leader. He also breaks the
tradition of selecting the leadership from the ranks of the powerful
engineers. He takes over at a difficult time for the union movement,
experiencing declining membership and a steady erosion of influence. More
than half of the CGIL's 5m members are now pensioners. The confederation is
under pressure to forge a closer ties, if not merge, with the other two main
confederations, the CISL and the UIL. The three no longer reflect the old
cold war division of the union movement when the CGIL was dominated by the
Communists, the CISL by the Christian Democrats and the UIL by the
Socialists and Social Democrats.

A plan to sell off Germany's postal service, including the state
telecommunications company, was approved by the lower house of the German
parliament yesterday. The postal service is Germany's largest state-owned
employer. Its three components - mail delivery, a banking system, and the
telecommunications monopoly, Telekom - have 670,000 employees. The
privatisation plans could still run into trouble. The opposition Social
Democrats voted for the sell-off but vowed to block it in the upper house
when it comes up for a final vote on July 8 if the government does not give
adequate assurances to save jobs and benefits. Under the law, as of January
1 private investors could start buying stock in all three branches of the
postal service. The government would hold a majority of shares in mail
delivery for at least five years.

The German government is pushing the European Commission to back a proposal
that would impose a sales tax on cars with heavy petrol consumption. Mr
Klaus Topfer, the federal environment minister, said he believed the German
proposal - which would levy tax on new cars that consume on average more
than five litres of petrol per 100km - was the best way to control CO2
emissions from cars. He said the European Commission had not yet signalled
it would pursue the proposal, although Germany hopes to have gained approval
from the environment ministers of the other member states by the end of its
presidency. Mr Topfer conceded that the proposal was unpopular in Germany
where car makers make preponderently big-engined cars. On average, German
cars consume 9-9.5 litres of petrol per 100km.

Opposition to joining the European Union has strengthened significantly in
Sweden over the past month according to an opinion poll published yesterday.
It underlined the difficulty facing the country's political leaders in their
attempt to win acceptance of membership in a referendum on November 13. The
poll, in the Gothenburg Post newspaper, showed opposition rising to 45 per
cent from 40 per cent in a similar poll in May. Support also grew for the
Yes camp, from 34 per cent to 37 per cent. But the worrying trend for EU
supporters was the greater share won over by the No side from a narrowing
pool of undecided voters, widening the opposition's lead.

Greece is objecting to conditions proposed by the European Commission in
return for approval of a rescue package for Olympic Airways, the loss-making
state carrier. Athens believes the conditions would undermine a plan
designed to return the airline to profit by 1997. Fresh talks are due to be
held in Brussels next month. The Commission wants Olympic to drop its
monopoly of ground handling operations at Greek airports immediately and
allow two other airlines to offer competitive services.
Greece also objects to the Commission's requests that Olympic freeze its
seat capacity while the three-year restructuring plan is in effect, and open
up its profitable Aegean island routes to competition from 1998. The
restructuring plan calls for writing off almost Dr500bn (Pounds 1.34bn) in
accumulated debt and providing Dr53bn in fresh capital over the next three
years.

The French government yesterday announced that the SMIC minimum wage would
be increased by 2.1 per cent, from FFr34.83 (Pounds 4.13) an hour to
FFr35.56 (Pounds 4.19) from the beginning of July. The increase, in line
with the legal formula for calculating the minimum wage, prompted an angry
reaction from trade unions, which had been demanding an additional increase.
The SMIC is at the centre of the debate about French labour market reform.
An attempt by the government to change the system so that young apprentices
could be paid less than the SMIC prompted nationwide protests in March and
forced a humiliating climbdown by the government.
The big CFDT union federation, which had demanded an increase of 2.7 per
cent in the SMIC, said yesterday that 'once again, the lowest paid would not
benefit from the same increase in purchasing power as the rest of French
employees'. Under the new rate, the 1.48m employees who receive the SMIC
will be paid FFr6,010 a month for 169 hours of work.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Bond rates rise in Athens reflects instability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's Finance Ministry has signalled anxiety over meeting interest
payments on government debt by sharply raising interest rates on today's
issue of government bonds.
Interest rates on one-year treasury bills, the main instrument for financing
a rising public sector deficit, jumped from 18.5 per cent to 21.5 per cent.
The rise underlines the government's difficulties in raising funds following
last month's currency crisis, which was triggered by the abolition of
short-term capital controls under EU single market regulations. This month
the Finance Ministry must raise a total of Dr650bn (Pounds 1.7bn) to meet
debt servicing charges.
To protect the drachma against a devaluation, interbank rates were raised to
record levels, while interest rates on fixed-term repurchase agreements
soared to more than 40 per cent.
Last month, investors rushed to buy a one-month zero-coupon bond offered at
27 per cent and a three-month treasury bill at 25.5 per cent, while the
one-year bill at 18.5 per cent was ignored. This month, only six-month and
one-year bills are being issued.
Though liquidity has started returning to financial markets as interbank
rates decline, borrowing rates for working capital are still at more than 30
per cent.
Bankers predict that real interest rates on government paper will remain at
more than 10 per cent, as the government borrowing requirement is projected
to rise sharply later this year.
To meet interest payments from a debt rescheduling carried out two years
ago, a total of Dr2,000bn must be raised in September and October alone.
Total interest payments this year on government debt are estimated to equal
13.9 per cent of Greece's gross domestic product.
One banker said: 'Such a big leap in rates on treasury bills, coming at a
time when the government's stated policy is to bring interest rates down,
indicates that financial markets are still very unstable.'
Public debt, already equivalent to 110 per cent of GDP, is expected to rise
to 116 per cent of GDP before starting to decline in 1997, according to the
Economy Ministry. Because of the high inflation rate, which has edged up
from 10.2 to 11 per cent, the Finance Ministry has not been able to extend
the maturity of government debt. Issues of three- and five-year government
bonds carry floating interest rates linked to that of the one-year treasury
bill.
Amid clear signs of investor fatigue, there is growing concern among bankers
that the Finance Ministry may be forced to undertake a partial rescheduling
of the domestic debt later this year.
However, a rescheduling would affect debt held by Greek banks as part of
their reserve requirements, rather than treasury bills in the hands of
private Greek and international investors, analysts said.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition government has only a 0.5
per cent lead in popularity over the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and
Greens combined, an opinion poll showed yesterday. The findings of the poll
by the Infas institute for ARD television have added relevance because the
SPD and Greens are seeking an alliance in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. Any
alliance of the two parties at national level would give them 44.5 per cent
support, according to the poll, whereas the combined total for Mr Kohl's
three-party government was 45 per cent. This government total was made up of
the Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union, with 39.5 per cent, and the liberal Free Democrats with 5.5
per cent.

Two senior German bank officials have offered to resign in the scandal

member of Deutsche's Centralbodenkredit mortgage unit, said fellow board
members, Mr Detlev Rode and Mr Jurgen Huvendick, had offered to step down.
Centralboden's supervisory board will consider the resignations on July 4.
Mr Jurgen Schneider abandoned his property empire in April, leaving it to
file for bankruptcy with DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) of bank debts. Deutsche Bank was
Schneider's largest creditor, owed some DM1.2bn, most of which had been
funneled through Centralboden.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Legal move on Greek embargo fails: European Court of Justice
refuses Brussels an emergency ruling to help end Macedonian dispute

The European Commission has lost its gamble to use legal pressure to force
Greece to lift its crippling trade embargo against Macedonia.
In a setback for Brussels, the European Court of Justice has refused the
Commission's request for an emergency interim ruling ordering the Athens
government to end the blockade, EU officials said.
The ruling vindicates pro-Greek officials and diplomats who have been
pressing for a political rather than legal solution to the crisis in
relations between the Skopje government and Athens. The row centres on Greek
complaints that the Macedonian name, flag and constitution amount to a
territorial claim to its own northern province.
Because of the Luxembourg Court's lengthy procedures, it could take up to 18
months for a definitive judgment. By that time, the impact of the trade
embargo against the Macedonian economy could be devastating, introducing new
instability into the Balkans, according to Commission officials.
The Commission put its case against Greece at a court hearing two weeks ago
held in camera under EU rules permitting such proceedings to take place in
secret when they cover matters of international security. The Court had the
power to order interim measures to halt the embargo if it considered that
there was a risk of grave and irreparable damage. Its decision on an interim
ruling was communicated to the Commission and to the Greek government only.
The Commission's role in the Macedonia dispute has been complicated by the
dual responsibilities of Mr Hans Van den Broek, Commissioner for external
political affairs.
Mr Van den Broek was in the forefront of those arguing for a legal case
before the European Court of Justice in order to underline Brussels' role as
the guardian of the treaty of Rome; but he was also acting as a political
mediator between Skopje and Athens, alongside the US.
A senior Greek official said the Court ruled on the grounds that the
Commission had been unable to show that the trade embargo had caused damage
to the European Union, through its trade with Macedonia.
The official added that the Greek government would use the breathing space
offered by the court ruling to renew diplomatic efforts to find a solution
to its dispute with the Skopje government.
Athens justified its initial imposition of a trade embargo as a means of
breaking the diplomatic deadlock with Macedonia - a high-risk move which
alienated the majority of its EU partners.
Greece hands over the rotating presidency of the EU to Germany tomorrow. The
trade embargo against Macedonia blighted its six-month tenure, though
Germany may also be taken to the European Court if it carries out plans for
a six-month ban on British beef on the grounds that it could contain 'mad
cow disease'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Germany to seek new EU deal for east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany will push for a new deal for the emerging democracies of central and
eastern Europe during its six-month presidency of the European Union,
including more measures to open the EU market and to promote closer
political co-operation.
The aim is to help all the emerging democracies with practical measures for
the whole transitional period leading up to eventual EU membership.
At the same time, the main German themes of the coming six months will be
making Europe relevant to its citizens, and deregulation of the labour
market to create more jobs, combined with strict financial discipline to
keep spending under control.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday spelt out a cautious
programme for the presidency, which begins tomorrow, insisting that it went
no further than what was agreed by all the other member states.
'We will do everything in our power to promote the cause of Europe in this
limited period,' he told the German Bundestag in Bonn. But he added: 'The
German image of Europe is identical with that of our partners.' He laid the
greatest stress in his presentation on the German desire to bring central
and eastern European states ever closer to the EU.
'If there is one special foreign policy responsibility of Germany in the
light of its history, it is that the Europe which we are striving towards
should be built together with the new democracies of east and central
Europe,' he said.
He said new proposals would be presented to the EU summit in Essen in
December to give concrete form to 'getting through the difficult transition
phase in which the reforming states find themselves up to the point of
accession. 'Further market opening and closer political co-operation (even
before accession) are at the top of the list.'
The German thinking is in line with European commission plans, with Sir Leon
Brittan, UK commissioner, planning to put forward a new report on faster
trade liberalisation in the autumn. He will also propose a common
competition policy over a three-year period.
Mr Kinkel said Germany would be pushing also for closer co-operation on
crime prevention, and seeking to turn its Franco-German initiative to combat
racism into an EU-wide strategy in time for Essen.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Russia increases Caucasus role: Grachev announces greater
military presence in troubled north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia is establishing a large military presence in the Northern Caucasian
region, the most unstable area in the country and one in which conflict is
expected to spread.
General Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, made the announcement
yesterday at the regional centre of Rostov on Don shortly after the
resolution of the area's third hostage crisis in the past six months. Three
armed men had held a bus load of 40 hostages and escaped with a reported
Dollars 6m and a helicopter, but were captured in the autonomous republic of
Chechnya.
Gen Grachev, in remarks to the Interfax news agency, said he was creating
'an army capable of conducting combat operations', able to defuse large and
small conflicts. If regional forces proved unable to cope, Russian troops
would help crack down on 'terrorist groupings' which have flourished in the
region.
The Caucasus, with several autonomous republics providing a home for
numerous, often mutually hostile, ethnic groups, has become in the past two
years a hotbed of feuds and outbreaks of hostilities which are barely
controlled.
The fiercest fighting has been across the Russian border in Georgia, where
some 3,000 Russian peacekeeping forces have been deployed this month in the
breakaway region of Abkhazia. They are already blamed by the Abkhazian
delegation in Moscow for promoting the return of Georgian refugees who had
committed 'war crimes' against Abkhazia, which has declared itself
independent.
At the same time, the Russian military continues to deploy armour in the
region in excess of levels agreed in talks within the framework of the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This has caused fears of
Russian expansionism, especially in Turkey, whose regional power had itself
been expanding and which has several areas of potential tension with Russia.
Gen Grachev's announced initiative puts in doubt once more the ability of
the military to live within a budget for 1994 of Rbs40,000bn, the sum agreed
by the parliament last week when it passed the overall budget. It shows he
is willing to use such incidents as the taking of hostages to again argue
the case for the army's higher profile as a saviour of the nation from
border and other conflicts.
President Boris Yeltsin, who is anxious to retain military support, has
partially bowed to the generals' demands by saying that while their access
to budget funds was limited, 'off budget funds' would have to be created to
satisfy their most urgent needs, and those of the arms-producing plants
which are being starved of orders. One proposal has been to use the money
gained from weapon sales abroad for expenditure on the military.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Bulgaria signs accord to reduce Dollars 8bn bank debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bulgaria and its London Club commercial bank creditors yesterday signed a
debt reduction agreement which should re-establish the country's financial
links. These have been blocked since 1990 when the Socialist government
initially stopped interest and then capital repayments.
For the past four years Bulgaria has been cut off from western commercial
financing and has had to rely on the IMF, the World Bank, and foreign aid.
The agreement provides for a 47.1 per cent reduction in Bulgaria's Dollars
8.1bn (Pounds 5.3bn) debt to a group of more than 300 commercial banks.
Bulgaria's total foreign debt, including that to Russia and other former
Soviet bloc countries, is Dollars 9.3bn.
The deal was signed by the finance minister, Mr Stoyan Alexandrov, and
Deutsche Bank, as closing agents for the deal, Citibank, as fiscal agents,
and the US Federal Reserve which will sell Bulgaria collateralised discount
bonds. Representatives of 14 creditor banks arrived in Sofia for the signing
and rest will sign in London and Frankfurt in July.
The deal calls for the restructuring of Dollars 3.8bn of debt. Of this total
12.4 per cent is to be reduced by buybacks, 60.5 per cent by collateralised
discount bonds, and 27.1 per cent through front loaded interest reduction
bonds (FLIRBs).
Parliament will have to ratify the deal by the end of July and Mr Alexandrov
has been consulting leaders of the parliamentary factions to make sure they
will back the deal.
Mr Peter Tils, first vice-president of Deutsche Bank, said the agreement was
'a very good tailor-made package' for Sofia 'I cannot imagine what will
happen if the agreement is not ratified by parliament,' Mr Tils added.
Earlier this week, however, leading economists from both the Bulgarian
Socialist party, which currently dominates parliament, and the opposition
Union of Democratic Forces, said that Bulgaria's economy would be unable to
bear the debt service burden.
According to finance ministry sources Dollars 710m in up-front payments will
be needed for the deal to be closed, reducing the currency reserves of the
central bank to some Dollars 400m. The annual cost of the deal is expected
to be just under Dollars 200m over the next seven years.
The World Bank and the IMF are expected to put up a special loan of Dollars
250m to help finance buy-back operations, but this is conditional on
speeding up reform, including privatisation. Other priority areas for
improvement are bankruptcy laws, banking supervision and a reduction in
social assistance payments.

The European Parliament stepped up pressure yesterday to have a say over who
should become the new European Commission president, urging talks with
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Egon
Klepsch, Parliament president, was preparing to contact Mr Kohl to propose
talks ahead of a summit planned for Brussels on July 15 on Mr Jacques
Delors' successor.
An early task of the parliament, which meets on July 19, will be to approve
the EU's new president. Ms Pauline Green, president-designate of the
socialist group, said parliament must know the identity of the proposed
president before it meets.

FT  30 JUN 94 / European military aviation setbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cross-border co-operation in defence aviation suffered a twin setback
yesterday, with Germany going slow on the Eurofighter aircraft and the UK
reaffirming its unwillingness to fund a new European military transporter.
A meeting of the German parliament's budget committee, the last before the
summer recess, failed to approve the extra funds that were viewed as
necessary to complete development work on the Eurofighter on schedule.
The committee did make a small award of about DM200m (Pounds 80.6m) to
ensure that work on the project will continue in the coming months, but it
did not earmark the funds needed to keep the project on schedule until the
end of the decade.
The main reason for the delay is a dispute between the German Defence
Ministry and Deutsche Aerospace, the German industrial partner, on how the
extra development costs should be split between government and industry.
With German elections due in October, Germany's partners in the Eurofighter
consortium - Britain, Italy and Spain - were understood to be resigning
themselves to some delay in the project.
The four governments had until recently hoped to sign a memorandum of
understanding this summer on completing the Pounds 30bn project.
In London, the Defence Ministry confirmed that it saw no reason to allocate
public money to the development of the Future Large Aircraft, a project to
meet Europe's strategic airlift needs which France and Germany are strongly
backing. Britain is studying two options - the C130J made by Lockheed of the
US and the proposed FLA - as it considers ways to replenish its ageing fleet
of Hercules military transporters.
British Aerospace is urging the government to play a part in developing the
FLA, arguing that that it could bring Pounds 12bn worth of work to the UK
and create 7,500 jobs.
Yesterday's statement upheld the view London has taken since 1989, which is
that there are no grounds for putting UK government money towards the FLA.
It said the government would keep open the option of buying some FLA 'off
the shelf'.
Defence industry experts believe it might be possible for the UK private
sector to come up with development funds - and therefore stake a claim to a
share of the aircraft's production - if the government commits itself to
buying some of the new transporters.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Delors succession search looks south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The hunt for a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission is shifting to the south, with three names prominent on the
diplomatic circuit: Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, Prime Minister
Anbal Cavaco Silva of Portugal, and former Prime Minister Giuliano Amato of
Italy.
The southern connection has surfaced in the wake of the bungled
Franco-German campaign to push through Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime
minister, at last weekend's European summit in Corfu. Two other northern
candidates - Mr Ruud Lubbers, outgoing prime minister of the Netherlands,
and Sir Leon Brittan of the UK - withdrew their candidacies last Saturday.
The attraction of Mr Gonzalez and Mr Cavaco Silva is that they are
experienced prime ministers. Mr Gonzalez, particularly, would seem assured
of winning the required unanimous support. Mr Amato, an economist widely
respected for his role in steering Italy through its political upheavals, is
said to be seeking a top international job.
All three would also lend Mediterranean balance to the Union as it tilts
north and east. Next year Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway plan to join
the Union, and German-led pressure to include the newly emerging democracies
in east and central Europe is certain to grow in the next five years.
Mr Gonzalez, a long-time favourite of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, has been under
pressure for the past three years to throw his hat in the ring. But he has
steadfastly refused on the grounds that it would undermine the Socialist
government he has led since 1982.
Though he is a Socialist, he could be easily repackaged as a centrist on
account of his government's programme of labour market reform and efforts at
fiscal austerity. A French-speaker, he would also be acceptable to France.
In the early hours of Saturday morning, after Mr Dehaene won the first
ballot, Mr Gonzalez expressed regret at the failure to reach a consensus,
believing that he would be called upon to run once again. But he told his
summit colleagues that he did not want to leave Madrid for Brussels - a
position he repeated to the Spanish parliament yesterday.
A German-inspired 'draft Felipe' movement could start to roll if Mr Kohl
sticks to his self-imposed deadline of July 15 to come up with a compromise
candidate to replace his protege, Mr Dehaene. Germany believes it is vital
to present the Commission president designate to the new European parliament
when it holds its inaugural session on July 19.
Mr Cavaco Silva's strongest cards are his experience, his Christian Democrat
credentials, and his economic track-record since he came to power in 1985.
But Portugal holds elections in October 1995, and Mr Cavaco Silva's presence
is viewed as vital to his party's hopes of attaining a third consecutive
majority. Mr Kohl is also said to be ambivalent.
Mr Amato's name is understood to have come up yesterday in conversations
between Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, and Mr Antonio Martino, the
new Italian foreign minister.
His weakness is his connections to the corruption-plagued Socialist
government of Mr Bettino Craxi, though he has remained untainted and above
suspicion.
Mr Hurd and Mr Martino expressed confidence that the deadlock over the
Delors succession could be broken. 'It should be someone who is committed to
European ideals, but at the same time not committed to a dirigistic,
centralistic, bureaucratic vision of Europe,' said Mr Martino.

FT  30 JUN 94 / UK ready to accept alternative candidate for EU job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government sought to draw a line under the row over the
presidency of the European Commission by suggesting yesterday that it was
ready to accept one of several new candidates who have emerged for the post.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said that 'five or six' new names
were being discussed by European Union governments as alternatives to Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister.
Mr Dehaene's candidacy was vetoed by Mr John Major, prime minister, at last
weekend's Corfu summit. But Mr Hurd, speaking on the eve of the German
presidency of the EU, said the new candidates were all 'broadly acceptable'
to the London government.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, took the same position by stressing that
Britain's decision to veto Mr Dehaene's appointment did not foreshadow a
decisive shift in Britain's commitment to the EU.
Mr Clarke emphasised his personal support for the eventual goal of economic
and monetary union and said the government was prepared to see a successor
to Mr Jacques Delors committed to deepening as well as widening the European
Union.
But his comments in a speech at the Konrad Adenauer foundation in Bonn
enraged Conservative party Euro-sceptics, who accused him of undermining a
reassertion at the Corfu summit by Mr John Major of Britain's national
sovereignty.
The speech also failed to persuade many in his Christian Democrat audience
that the London government's pledge to remain 'at the heart of Europe' would
be matched by a constructive approach in practice.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, set out a modest programme for
the country's six-month presidency of the European Union, which begins
tomorrow, insisting that it went no further than what was agreed by all
other member states.
'We will do everything in our power to promote the cause of Europe in this
limited period,' he told the Bundestag in Bonn.
Mr Hurd will hold talks in London today with Mr Kinkel. But the foreign
secretary refused to list the potential candidates for Mr Delors' post.
Diplomats in Brussels are mentioning three names in particular for the
presidency: Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, Mr Anbal Cavaco
Silva, his Portuguese counterpart, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the former prime
minister of Italy.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Patten wins HK reform vote: Colony's legislators support
governor's plans for greater democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Governor Chris Patten's controversial proposals for political reform in Hong
Kong last night won approval from the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo)
despite a long campaign by China to block the changes.
Mr Patten's legislation, which seeks to broaden the franchise in elections
due this year and next, was backed by 32 votes to 24 after a 17-hour debate.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, last night called the outcome 'a very
good and decisive result'.
He said: 'Our task now is to press on, in close co-operation with China,
with tackling the many issues which need to be settled in the remaining
three years of British administration.'
Mr Patten said the vote ended 'a significant chapter in Hong Kong's history.
We must now turn the page'.
However, Beijing made it clear before the vote that it was determined to
hold fresh elections after China's resumption of sovereignty in 1997.
It has objected as much to the manner in which Mr Patten announced his plans
in October 1992 as to their content. Last year, Britain and China failed to
agree about how Hong Kong's remaining elections under British rule should be
conducted.
However, there were indications yesterday that Beijing may move to resolve
outstanding issues with Britain over Hong Kong's transfer. British officials
believe China may today settle seven-years of negotiations over the terms
for the transfer of military land in the colony.
Mr Patten's plan envisages a 1995 legislature consisting of 20 elected
members, 30 from so-called functional constituencies representing
businesses, professions and labour unions, and 10 picked by a committee of
elected municipal officials.
An amendment by the pro-business Liberal party was voted down by the
narrowest of margins - 29 to 28. It would have altered the rules for the 10
lawmakers picked by committee and reduced the electorate for the functional
constituencies.
Two members of the legislature, Mr Martin Barrow, a director of Jardine
Pacific, and Mr Simon Ip, the legal profession's representative, abstained.
Both had intended to vote for the Liberal amendment but changed their minds
at the last moment.
Mr Barrow, who was closely involved in devising the Liberal amendment, said
he abstained so that 'the scales could be tipped by people whose home has
been and will be Hong Kong for generations to come'. He saw the governor on
Tuesday afternoon.
Earlier in the day Mr Allen Lee, Liberal leader, said that no one believed
the governor's electoral arrangements would survive the transition to
Chinese rule. 'Only an idiot would believe that,' he said.
Mrs Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary who has an ex-offico seat in
LegCo, said she hoped legislators would act in accordance with the people's
wish for more democracy. She said only China could answer whether it would
dismantle all tiers of representative government in 1997. If it did it would
go against the community's clear wish for continuity.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Socialist to head three-party coalition in Japan: Dollar
remains weak on fears of continued trade impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's parliament chose a 70-year-old socialist yesterday to lead a
three-party coalition government dominated by the Liberal Democratic party,
which was ousted last summer after 38 years in power.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the leftwing Social Democratic party,
becomes the country's fourth prime minister in a year and the first
socialist to lead Japan for 47 years.
Mr Murayama was elected by 261 votes to 214 with the help of the LDP, the
socialists' traditional enemy, in a second-round parliamentary showdown
against Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former LDP prime minister who broke ranks to
stand against his old party.
Last night, Mr Murayama, who has never held a cabinet post, pledged to push
ahead with economic and political reforms.
However, foreign ministry officials warned that talks on the US trade
dispute were likely to be postponed because of his inexperience in foreign
affairs. Mr Murayama is expected to travel to Naples next week for a summit
of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.
The White House said President Bill Clinton looked forward to working with
the new Japanese government. Asked how the US viewed a socialist in charge
of Japan, Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House spokeswoman, said: 'That's an
internal decision that the Japanese have to make.'
However, the prospect of a continued impasse on efforts to curb Japan's
trade surplus with the US contributed to another rise in the yen against the
dollar. The US currency dropped to a postwar low of Y98.55 yesterday,
although it closed slightly higher in London at Y98.678 and edged up to
Y98.75 in New York. Early today in Tokyo it opened at Y98.83.
The LDP and SDP differ radically on most policy issues. Their unexpected
marriage is a mark of the collapse of the traditional structure of power
started by the LDP's defeat in a no-confidence motion last June.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, leader of the New Harbinger party, a centre-left
former LDP splinter group which is the third member of the new coalition,
said: 'A new round of political realignment has suddenly started.'
Mr Murayama sought an alliance with the LDP's president, Mr Yohei Kono,
after talks broke down with outgoing prime minister Mr Tsutomu Hata.
Mr Hata resigned with his minority coalition on Saturday, two months after
taking office, rather than face a no-confidence vote put forward by the LDP
with SDP support. The SDP and the coalition were deadlocked on proposals to
reduce income tax and
raise consumption tax. Mr Murayama said: 'I was struck by Mr Kono's
sincerity. The political turmoil requires this kind of sincerity and I am
sure I will meet your expectations.'
They are expected to form a cabinet today, with the LDP likely to take the
most senior seats.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, former prime minister, condemned the new coalition as
'nothing less than collusion'.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Enterprise cash raid snaps up 9.8 per cent of Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil raised the stakes in its long-running bid for Lasmo yesterday
by buying nearly 10 per cent of Lasmo's stock from its largest shareholder
for cash.
The deal, clinched in a long-awaited raid timed to coincide with the opening
of Wall Street, angered other shareholders who are being offered only
Enterprise shares and warrants under the terms of the bid.
The Pounds 1.6bn takeover offer, which aims to create a prominent new oil
exploration and production company, has hung in the balance for several
weeks, but the Enterprise raid was intended to wrest advantage just ahead of
the bid deadline at 1pm tomorrow.
However, some institutional shareholders in Lasmo remain undecided, and
analysts last night said the bid was still too close to call.
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, Lasmo's biggest shareholder, confirmed last
night that it had sold 77m shares at 169p a share. It sold the shares hours
after a meeting with senior Lasmo executives. However, PDFM still holds half
of its original 16 per cent holding, and the decision it will announce today
on how that will be voted will be crucial.
Enterprise bought 9.8 per cent of Lasmo shares in two tranches. It said
86.8m shares, which includes those bought from PDFM, were purchased at 169p
a share and 7.77m at 161p.
Mr Rudolph Agnew, Lasmo chairman, said the purchase made the paper offer -
of 36 new Enterprise A shares and 13 warrants for every 88 Lasmo shares -
worthless.
He told Reuters: 'This means the rest of the City are left with a junk paper
offer and they would be well advised not to accept it.'
Some institutions and private shareholders were angry at yesterday's
developments. One private investor who complained to the Takeover Panel
said: 'Every shareholder apart from a lucky few will suffer.'
The Takeover Panel took no action after the raid because it did not appear
to have breached the takeover rules. The fact that Enterprise's raid was
paid for in cash rather than Enterprise paper did not matter so long as the
value was the same.
The rules also permit a bidder to buy up to 10 per cent of the target
company's stock.
Analysts said Enterprise could have jeopardised its bid by antagonising
institutions that were unable to take advantage of the cash offer.
On balance, though, it appeared to have ended up in a stronger position. By
buying half of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management's stake, it has reduced the
size of Lasmo's biggest shareholder and gained control of a useful portion
of its quarry's stock.
Lasmo's shares remained firm at 144p, and Enterprise's fell 27p to 381p.

FT  30 JUN 94 / Channel tunnel express trains suffer further delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, TRANSPORT CORRESPONDENT and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel tunnel has suffered yet another delay with the announcement
yesterday that long-distance passenger services will not start before
September at the earliest.
Passenger services had been expected to start in July following the launch
of freight shuttle services in May and of long-distance container services
at the beginning of June.
The British, French and Belgian railways said the additional delay had been
caused by the complexity of the testing and commissioning programme for the
Eurostar trains. The trains - which will run between London, Paris and
Brussels - cost Pounds 24m each.
They can run on three different national electrical power systems and four
signalling systems.
Jean-Francois Benard, managing director of SNCF, the French railway, said:
'The three networks concluded that there could be no Eurostar opening during
their summer schedules. It won't happen before the last Sunday in
September.'
Tests have been carried out in the three countries but there has not yet
been intensive testing through the tunnel. 'We need to do a lot of
continuous running between the city centres,' European Passenger Services
(EPS), the British partner in the three-nation rail consortium, said. 'We
have got to get the miles on the trains and ensure they are reliable.'
Eurotunnel, which owns and operates the tunnel, said the Folkestone-Calais
shuttle would not suffer as long a delay, and the setback to the
long-distance passenger services would not have a significant impact on its
revenues.
'The contract between us and the railway companies provides for us to seek
penalties and covers at least part of the losses,' it said.
However, Eurotunnel will have to further revise the financial projections
most recently updated for its Pounds 858m rights issue earlier this month.
The launch of passenger services still depends on Eurotunnel obtaining
government approval for the tunnel and its operating systems.
The company hopes to obtain approval by mid-July.
According to French railway officials, the failure to obtain government
clearance for passenger services was a factor in the delay. The
intergovernmental security commission demanded new requirements for tests of
evacuation procedures.
Once Eurotunnel has obtained its licence for passenger services, EPS and the
French and Belgian railways plan to step up their testing programme and
start their marketing campaign. That is expected to take a further eight to
10 weeks, EPS said.
Passengers will be invited to travel on the Eurostar trains during the
marketing period but tickets will not go on sale to the general public until
the autumn at the earliest.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Deckel Maho near bankrupt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deckel Maho, one of Germany's largest machine tool companies, is on the
verge of declaring itself bankrupt.
Mr Werner Schneider, appointed receiver to the Bavaria-based group after it
filed for protection against creditors in April, said that a formal
application for bankruptcy was the next legal step after it had proved
impossible to work out a solution with creditors to guarantee the group's
survival.
Mr Schneider said, however, that he was hopeful that it would be possible to
rescue the group - which owes banks DM530m (Dollars 325.1m) - through a sale
to a third party.
Discussions are taking place with Traub and Gildemeister, two German
machine-tool rivals, but neither company has made a firm offer, Mr Schneider
indicated. It would be necessary to cut the workforce by 500 or 600 from
1,700 this week and next, he said.
Deckel Maho is itself the product of a merger between two family-controlled
south-German manufacturers. This took place last summer on the initiative of
Deutsche Bank and Bayerische Vereinsbank in the hope that the merged group
would better be able to withstand the severe downturn in the German
machine-tools sector.
In July last year, the combined group predicted that it would return to
profits in three years after an aggressive cost-cutting programme.
However, in the year to June 1 1994, turnover was DM340m to DM345m,
considerably below planned sales of DM400m, while at the end of May the
order book amounted to DM70m, just 2 1/2 months' production. Between 1990
and 1994, the two groups shed 3,000 jobs and combined turnover more than
halved.
Mr Schneider said that Deckel Maho shares were worthless in view of the
group's heavy indebtedness. The takeover by a third party would involve a
write-off of existing debt or the conversion of debt into equity, coupled
with an injection of fresh capital from the new owner.

Sales at the entertainment division of Bertelsmann will rise by about 2 per

director of the division, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
He said the division hoped to expand to 40 per cent of Bertelsmann's group
sales in five to eight years, from about 33 per cent at present.
Under a restructuring programme begun last year, the entertainment division
will provide results consolidating entertainment and electronic media
earnings for the first time this year.
Combined sales at the entertainment and electronic media divisions totalled
DM6.3bn (Dollars 3.86bn) in the 1992/93 business year.
Bertelsmann Music Group, the music division of the newly-consolidated
entertainment division, will probably see sales rise to Dollars 3.1bn in the
business year to end-June from Dollars 2.9bn the year before.

<TEXT>
Net profit at Societe Generale, the French banking group, this year should
at least match the level achieved in 1993, but the growth rate will slow, Mr
Marc Vienot, chief executive officer, said, Reuter reports from New York.
He declined to project profits. SocGen earned FFr3.61bn (Dollars 640m) in
1993 against FFr3.28bn in 1992. Mr Vienot expects a lower loan-loss
provision in 1994. SocGen's loan-loss provision rose in 1993 to FFr7.21bn
from FFr6.26bn in 1992.
Domestic or classical banking activities 'have not done badly' in the first
six months, in spite of somewhat weak credit demand since most French
corporations have enough cash to finance expansion without borrowing, he
said.
The pace of new activity in consumer credit in the first six months has been
close to twice that in the same period a year ago and the pace of new
mortgage activity is up 35-40 per cent from a year ago, he said.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: GE bids for rest of Nuovo
Pignone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric of the US has launched a formal bid for the outstanding
shares in Nuovo Pignone, the Italian gas turbines and compressors group, in
a move which would end its Milan stock market listing.
GE acquired control of the Italian company earlier this year when it bought
a 69.33 per cent stake from Eni, the Italian state holding company. The bid
for the outstanding quoted shares is obligatory, and has been launched at
the same price as the original offer.
In theory, buying the 30 per cent stake could cost GE more than L300bn
(Dollars 192m). In practice, however, GE will only be able to buy a further
10 per cent of the group with this offer, because Eni will retain a 20.25
per cent stake.
The US company is still planning to give up 12 per cent of the company to
Dresser Industries of the US and a further 12 per cent to Ingersoll-Rand,
once regulatory approval has been obtained. Dresser and Ingersoll-Rand are
US turbine and oil industry specialists.
GE said it was still in negotiations with a group of Italian banks, which
originally intended to buy up to 20 per cent of Nuovo Pignone as part of the
GE-led consortium. However, Italian banking sources said they believed the
banks were no longer intending to take part in the consortium.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Moulinex sets terms of capital
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moulinex, the French household appliances group, yesterday announced the
terms of its FFr1bn (Dollars 185m) capital increase, saying it would issue
two new shares for three existing ones, at a price of FFr90 a share.
Although long-expected, details of the capital increase pushed shares in the
indebted company down FFr5.3 to FFr122.
Under the terms of the capital increase, for which subscriptions will be
open from July 5 to July 25, Financiere Moulinex DCSM, the holding company,
and Finap, the group subsidiary, will subscribe to FFr404m of the capital
increase. The balance will be offered to the public. The offer is being
underwritten by a consortium of banks led by Credit Lyonnais.
In a separate operation, the holding company will raise FFr500m, bringing in
a number of financial partners chosen over the past few months to support
the company's restructuring.
Following the capital increase, Euris, a consortium of investors, will hold
33 per cent of the holding company. The holding company, combined with
Finap, in turn will hold 28.8 per cent of Moulinex, with employees holding
10.8 per cent and the public just under 60 per cent.
The complex capital restructuring follows a period of protracted
negotiations aimed at reinforcing Moulinex's financial structure. The
company has been hit by the European recession and by the burden of debts
incurred as a result of its acquisition of Krups, a German competitor, in
1991.
Moulinex suffered losses of FFr598m in the financial year to the end of
March 1993, compared with net profits of FFr41m for the same period in the
previous year.
The French government said yesterday that it had appointed Credit Commercial
de France and the French subsidiary of J. P. Morgan of the US as advisers
for the privatisation of Assurances Generales de France.
AGF, one of France's largest insurers, is next on the list of 21
publicly-owned groups slated for privatisation and the operation is expected
to take place after the summer. But no date has been set for the sale and
the timing will depend on market conditions.

Nippon Shoji, a Japanese drug wholesaler and distributor whose employees are
being investigated for alleged insider trading, said yesterday its president
will step down to take responsibility for the scandal.
Company employees face charges that they used confidential information about
the deaths of patients using its shingles drug. The Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission, the securities watchdog, is conducting an
investigation.
Some 175 workers and family members are believed to have sold Nippon Shoji
shares before the health and welfare ministry publicly disclosed last
October the fatal side effects of Sorivudine, the company's treatment,
launched in September last year.
Mr Takakazu Hattori will resign to become the company's consultant, while Mr
Masami Shimizu, vice president, will take his place. The move follows the
company's dismissal of four former executives on Monday over allegations of
illicit stock trading.

China's premier yesterday warned Britain that cool political relations were
bound to affect economic ties and praised Germany for its long-standing
co-operation, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Mr Li Peng told reporters that differences between China and Britain over
democratic reforms for Hong Kong had affected overall relations. 'We hope to
see the economic and trade relations between Britain and China develop but
it is not possible to free the overall relations from the adverse effects of
the cool political relations,' he said.
Mr Li's comments came before leaving on a visit to Austria, Germany and
Romania, accompanied by economic officials and more than 30 business
leaders.
'We have long-standing co-operation with Germany, which is is our biggest
partner in western Europe,' Mr Li said. Germany is the biggest European
investor in China.
Chinese customs data for January to May show trade with Germany at Dollars
4.19bn, up 32.7 per cent over the same period in 1993.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Savings blow for Australian banks
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian banks yesterday lost another round in their battle to carve out a
role in the nation's rapidly expanding superannuation industry, when Mr
Ralph Willis, the federal treasurer, ruled out special tax or regulatory
regimes would have allowed them to offer 'super' investment accounts.
The treasurer failed to use a statement yesterday on superannuation policy -
much of which dealt with the mechanics of how small savers and businesses
could make cost-effective contributions, and avoid unwieldy fees - to
introduce proposals which would have allowed banks to set up their own
superannuation-style accounts.
The omission was quickly attacked by the nation's big banking groups.
The banks claim that their branch networks make them well placed to collect
such savings and warn there could be pressure on rates charged to borrowers
if they remained locked out of the superannuation market.
'Government regulation has meant that superannuation is becoming the
nation's preferred savings vehicle,' said Mr Don Mercer, head of ANZ. 'As
more of the nation's savings are held by life offices and the tax office,
banks will be forced to gather an increasing proportion of their deposits
via the bond and money markets.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / Tietmeyer stresses need for political consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The planned European monetary union will not be able to survive in the long
run unless it is underpinned by a deep political consensus, according to Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president.
'If we create a monetary union . . . and this proves to be a failure, this
will be a very, very sad result for Europe,' he told the Financial Times
yesterday. 'I am not sure this will not bring the whole integration to a
very dangerous situation.'
Mr Tietmeyer, who has often in the past appeared concerned that
implementation of the Maastricht Treaty so far had concentrated on economic
matters to the neglect of political integration, stressed that he wanted
actively to help bring the union into being.
Monetary union was not a technical issue, he said. Because it involved
participants in sharing risks and advantages, it had to be built on a
broader-based political union, he said in an interview.
He also showed his unease that some European central banks had not yet
gained their independence. Both the political establishment and the public
had to learn what it was like to appreciate and live with the merits and
disadvantages of an independent central bank, he said.
Mr Tietmeyer said he regretted that independence for central banks had not
been made a requirement for this year's start of stage two of economic and
monetary union.
Meanwhile, the existing EU had to be broadened for historical reasons. 'I
cannot think in the longer term that we can live in a Europe where we close
the doors to a country like the Czech Republic,' he said.
'On the other hand, I cannot see in the foreseeable future a situation where
all the Maastricht treaty conditions . . . for monetary union will be met by
all countries,' he added. 'I do not think it likely that monetary union will
be possible with all the present or future members from the beginning.'
On recent turmoil in international financial markets, and last week's
support of the US dollar, Mr Tietmeyer said events in exchange markets could
not be controlled fully by intervention.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Regulatory grip that has cost Tokyo dear / A look at why
Japan's financial markets have lost out to other world centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government's package includes measures designed to open up
financial markets, which are among the most highly regulated in the world.
In recent months, several big foreign companies have scaled down their Tokyo
operations, blaming the restrictive regulatory environment.
For the first time the government will permit trading in a key form of
derivative instrument. Forward rate agreements and forward exchange
agreements are contracts arranged between two parties, outside the formal
futures exchanges, allowing the contractors to determine their own agreed
rate on interest and currency swaps.
In the past such contracts have been forbidden in Tokyo since the government
maintains they represent a form of gambling. The Ministry of Finance is to
issue guidelines on the use of the instruments. Traders gave a cautious
welcome to the move as a small first step towards liberalisation of the
almost non-existent Japanese derivatives market.
Other measures make it easier for less creditworthy companies to issue
corporate bonds. Previously only companies with a good credit rating and a
large minimum asset base could issue certain types of bonds in the main
markets. In addition, some interest rates are being deregulated.
The government is also considering lifting a ban on the issue of commercial
paper by foreign securities houses operating in Japan with a parent company
guarantee. But the overall impact of the proposals is not likely to lead to
a big opening of Japan's markets.
Earlier this month an influential group echoed a warning that financial
institutions have been uttering for some time. The Committee on Foreign
Exchange, the Ministry of Finance's own advisory body, said that, unless the
bureaucracy eases its grip on financial controls, Tokyo risks losing its
status as a leading financial centre. Most analysts believe the authorities
will need to go much further if Tokyo is to retain that position.
The Japanese capital used to see itself as challenging New York and London
for global financial supremacy, but that battle already appears to have been
lost. Instead Tokyo is now itself under threat as the leading financial
market in Asia. The fast growing Asian economies are developing increasingly
sophisticated capital markets, and in Singapore and Hong Kong, banks and
brokers are finding much lighter regulatory regimes.
In the last year many of the main international investment banks have cut
Tokyo staff numbers. Many more are said to be considering doing the same.
The number of foreign companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is
declining sharply. Three years ago, the total was 127, now it is down to
just over 100 and expected to fall into double figures within the year.
Companies cite exorbitantly high listing costs and a plethora of rules.
Foreign currency trading, once a key financial business in Tokyo, has
declined rapidly in significance. The explosion of derivatives trading in
the rest of the world has passed by almost unnoticed in Tokyo in the last
few years, as rigid rules keep it restricted.
The authorities have been pursuing a gradual policy of deregulation at their
own pace. But it is now clear that that pace is not enough. The process
began more than a decade ago with the liberalisation of interest rates. The
limited nature of the deregulation was masked by the boom years in the late
1980s. Following the markets' collapse, the uncomfortable climate for
trading has inhibited recovery.
Tokyo has been disadvantaged by:
The cost of a listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It currently costs
between Y15m and Y20m (Pounds 96,000 and Pounds 128,000) a year simply to
maintain a listing - three to four times as much as at exchanges outside
Japan.
Rules that inhibit bond issuance and trading. Tough restrictions limit the
number of companies able to issue bonds, and the secondary market is
hampered by an arcane settlements system, described by one senior executive
at a US investment house as 'men on bicycles carrying mountains of paper
securities'.
Tight control of derivatives.
Opaque disclosure standards. Japanese accounting principles are widely
criticised for failing to present a true picture of companies' performance.
Voluminous paperwork. One banker claims he has to file 38 documents a week,
in Japanese and English, to various government ministries.
Japan continues to enjoy one great advantage - its huge savings pool and
current account surplus provide an unrivalled supply of funds for
investment. Proximity to that money is the principal reason for being in
Tokyo. Furthermore the rapid economic development taking place in Asia
provides a ready home for much of that money.
But, as a senior American investment banker put it: 'Very soon, Japan will
have to confront the reality of moving from an industrial to a
post-industrial economy. If it does not create the efficient, competitive
financial sector it needs for that economy, it risks being completely
eclipsed by its Asian neighbours.'

Transport &amp; Planning
by David Banister E &amp; FN Spon, Pounds 39 248 pages
A new bypass cutting through attractive countryside; the time it takes get
to work or to the shops by train or bus; the privatisation of British Rail.
Few subjects are calculated to stir a heated debate as those relating to
transport.
Transport Planning does not set out to provide an answer to the questions
prompted by government transport policies - or the lack of them. But in
attempting to trace the evolution of transport planning and its relationship
to policy decisions, it provides some helpful hints along the way.
David Banister follows the development of postwar transport thinking from
the days of 'predict and provide', when planners drew up road plans with the
simple aim of accommodating projected traffic growth.
This approach was being challenged by some forward thinking individuals in
the early 1960s. But the long lead-times involved in transport projects and
the mesmerising effect of the car on planners and politicians meant it took
more than a decade before the change in attitudes began to work its way
through.
As the 1970s progressed, greater weight was given to public transport and
planners began to act on the realisation that new roads not only absorbed
existing demand but generated increased car use.
In parallel with this came a radical shift in the approach taken by
politicians towards a more deregulated environment where the market decided.
Like many members of the travelling public, Banister, director of the
planning and research centre at University College, London, has his doubts
about the results of this change. He questions the value of bus
deregulation, which has served to speed up the gradual fall in bus use, and
the privatisation of British Rail.
The problem for those who argue for a greater role for public transport is
the overwhelming attractiveness of the car. The basis on which people plan
their lives, with home often far from the place of work, and attitudes to
car ownership has changed radically over the past three decades. It will be
hard to persuade people back on to public transport.
Yet unrestricted growth in the use of the car threatens irreparable damage
to the environment. A strategic vision and a planning framework are required
to allocate resources and choose priorities, Banister suggests.
The problem for successive British governments is that transport policy is
driven by conflicting requirements to reduce environmental damage, curb the
demands of transport on budget resources and preserve freedom for the car
owner. This confusion has not helped the government's attempts to involve
more private capital in the building of transport infrastructure.
The private sector wants low risk projects which have a short pay-back
period and provide a good return. Yet most transport projects have long
pay-back periods and low rates of return. They involve large capital
investments at the outset and are often subject to cost overruns. The
government cannot expect to withdraw completely, Banister warns.
Lack of an all-embracing policy framework has not slowed the pace of
transport initiatives. Recent months have seen a reduction in the motorway
building programme and the announcement of new planning guidelines to curb
the growth of out-of-town developments. The pace of recent change makes this
a timely book.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (24): Driving force behind
capitalism - Technological Innovation / Andrew Fisher is fascinated by
inventors and their times

<TEXT>
Exploring the Black Box, Technology, Economics and History
by Nathan Rosenberg, Cambridge University Press Pounds 40 hardback, Pounds
14.95 paperback 274 pages
Innovation, the process by which the 'black box' of the title is created,
can be fascinating and fruitful or arduous and frustrating. Sometimes, it
can be all of these. For while technological innovation is vital to economic
advancement, the route to success is anything but straightforward.
In Professor Nathan Rosenberg's book, it is made abundantly clear that
innovation can bring either pain or reward, probably more of the former.
Innovations can be premature so that the pioneers may fail to reap the
profits which are then garnered by those coming later - in such cases, the
products may be technologically brilliant but not yet economically ripe.
Innovations can also go unrecognised so that companies miss the boat. A
telling example cited by Rosenberg, professor of economics at Stanford
University, is that of Western Union which was offered Alexander Graham
Bell's telephone patent for Dollars 100,000 in 1877 but turned it down.
Apparently, it did not regard the telephone as an adequate substitute for
the telegraph.
Inventors and innovators themselves may underestimate or wrongly assess the
value of their breakthroughs. Guglielmo Marconi, for example, did not
foresee how widely radio could be applied in mass communications. Computers,
in their early days, were generally seen as having only limited research
applications.
Another intriguing point made by Rosenberg concerns innovators themselves.
'Major inventions are frequently the work of outsiders - people whose
conceptual frameworks and training are not defined by and limited to the
prevailing technology.' Bell was a teacher of the deaf, Marconi had little
technological training of any sort and Samuel Morse had been a portrait
painter before inventing the telegraph.
All three produced their own versions of the 'black box' which Rosenberg
uses as a metaphor for the mysteries and benefits of technology.
In fact, the book's title is rather more catchy than his treatment of the
subject. (Some chapters developed from earlier papers are written with
collaborators.) His chief aim is to show how innovation proceeds from the
economic, social and scientific background of the time.
Thus the book is not a management manual or a guide for businessmen seeking
advice on how to translate ideas into commercial success.
It is a serious, challenging and often fascinating study - by no means a
relaxing read - of how complex technologies arise and find their way along a
tortuous and obstacle-strewn route to the market.
The book follows an earlier one called Inside the Black Box in which
Rosenberg sought to examine its contents. In this one, he is trying to
establish how they got there in the first place. He analyses, in historical,
economic and technological terms, the processes by which information comes
to pervade new technologies.
Two of the most fascinating chapters in the book are about Charles Babbage,
whose calculating engine was an early precursor of the computer, and Joseph
Schumpeter, the Austrian economist who wrote of the 'perennial gale of
creative destruction' to which capitalist economies are subject.
Rosenberg regards Babbage as a pioneer in the analysis of technological
change. He seeks to rehabilitate him from what he calls his 'furtive, almost
fugitive existence in the literature of economics'.
Babbage, whose book, On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures, was
published in 1833, wrote from a deep knowledge of the newly developing
mechanical age.
Schumpeter's contribution to the debate on innovation was to show that this
was a driving force behind the very progress of capitalism. He described
capitalism as 'by nature a form or method of economic change' which never is
and never can be stationary.
He also believed in the primacy of economic history, regarding this as more
important than theory or statistics.
As well as delving into the history of technological change and analysis,
Rosenberg looks separately and in considerable depth at innovation in the
energy, chemical, telecommunications and forest products industries. But
while these chapters are undoubtedly valuable, it is the broader concepts
developed in the first half of the book that are likely to interest most
readers.

/ Robert Taylor on the final volume of Clegg's history

<TEXT>
A History of British Trade Unions since 1889 Volume III 1934-1951
by Hugh Clegg Oxford University Press, Pounds 55 458 pages
Now that they are virtually banished by government to the fringes of
influence, it is hard for many people to recall the days when Britain's
trade unions were a mighty power in the land. The lasting value of Professor
Clegg's lucid and comprehensive account is to provide a reminder of an
earlier period of this century when the unions played a central role in
Britain's political and industrial life.
Neither the leaders of the main political parties - Conservative as much as
Labour - nor most employers regarded the trade unions between 1934 and 1951
as an obstacle to progress in the market economy, let alone as the enemy
within. On the contrary, Clegg shows how both the state and many companies
sought to work with and not against them.
In the early - and best - chapters he provides a convincing vindication of
the 1930s as 'one of the most productive periods of state intervention in
industrial relations'.
Not only did the 'dismal decade' produce a strong economic recovery but a
significant growth in trade union membership and a substantial expansion in
collective bargaining, mainly at the initiative of conciliatory employers.
Above all, the unions, through the Trades Union Congress, found they could
do business with the national governments of Stanley Baldwin and Neville
Chamberlain without compromising their independence.
The steady rapprochement between organised labour and government during the
1930s was achieved by what Clegg calls the 'strange' but highly effective
'partnership' forged between TUC general secretary Sir Walter Citrine and
Ernest Bevin, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers union.
Both men - aptly described by Clegg as 'the two most remarkable leaders the
British trade union movement has ever produced' - disliked each other
intensely but they worked in harness for over 20 years. While Bevin was
'imaginative, generous (though he could also be domineering) and
passionate', Citrine was the opposite - 'deliberate, systematic,
calculating'.
What they had in common was a pragmatic and clear-headed view of the role of
the trade unions in a democratic society. To a great extent, they achieved
most of their aims for organised labour under the terrible exigencies of
total war.
Following Lord Bullock's masterly volume on Bevin's years as Minister of
Labour and National Service in Churchill's wartime coalition, published over
20 years ago, Clegg provides an overdue assessment of the important but
neglected role the trade unions played in the achievement of victory over
Nazi Germany.
It was that period - from May 1940 to May 1945 - which turned out to be
organised labour's 'finest hour'. Neither before nor since have Britain's
trade unions exercised such a decisive and positive influence. Their
achievement was seen not just at national level through the growth of the
corporate state but also in the workplace where the joint production
committees mobilised with success in the war effort.
Much of Britain's manpower planning was carried out through draconian powers
acquired by the state but to a remarkable extent - thanks mainly on Bevin's
insistence - workers and their unions were able to retain their autonomy.
The core values of the voluntarist tradition of industrial relations
remained more or less intact.
Although Clegg endorses the domestic achievements of the post-war Labour
government in establishing full employment and creating the welfare state,
he argues that after 1945 the trade unions began to lose influence. In part,
he pins the blame for this decline on the 'poor calibre' of the next
generation of union leaders who lacked the abilities of their predecessors.
But Clegg also questions the wisdom of Mr Attlee's government in eventually
demanding union co-operation for wage restraint. In retrospect, he believes
this was 'perhaps a mistake from the start'.
In more socially disciplined Scandinavia national incomes policies might
have been possible but in Britain he believes they 'are best avoided' due to
the decentralised and fragmented character of workplace bargaining and the
lack of central authority that trade unions can exercise over their members.
Most of his life, Clegg was an advocate of incomes policies - a member of
the long defunct Prices and Incomes Board and chairman of the short-lived
Pay Comparability Commission scrapped by Mrs Thatcher - but not apparently
any more.
Indeed, beneath the corporate bias that grew up between the trade unions and
the state from the early 1930s, Clegg pinpoints another and more enduring
trend of workplace unionism based on the shop steward movement.
It was the 'centrifugal' tendency - compounded by 'complicated pay
structures and multi-unionism' - that gave British industrial relations its
distinctive character, particularly in the post-1945 conditions of full
employment and relative worker affluence.
The volume is - like its two predecessors produced over the past 30 years -
accurate and cogent. Clegg may not be an evocative writer: he restrains his
enthusiasms behind a dry, matter-of-fact style. Essentially, his view is
from on high but he has an inspiring story to tell which nobody who is
interested in the history of the 20th century Labour movement can afford to
ignore.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (21): The sophisticated art of
reciprocity - International Cartels / Kenneth Gooding finds a re-telling of
industrial history instructive and enjoyable

<TEXT>
The Co-operative Edge: The Internal Politics of International Cartels
by Debora L. Spar Cornell University Press, Pounds 24.75 273 pages
In November 1980 Gordon Waddell was unlucky enough to be recognised by a BBC
correspondent while enjoying an evening at the Bolshoi in Moscow. Waddell at
that time was an executive director of the Anglo American Corporation of
South Africa and a former son-in-law of Harry Oppenheimer, then Anglo's
chairman.
This was a time when the Soviet Union was insisting it had no contacts at
all with South Africa, 'the racist citadel of apartheid', while the South
African prime minister P. W. Botha was claiming that his people were
fighting against a 'total onslaught by Soviet Communism'.
So why, the BBC correspondent politely inquired, was Waddell, a
representative of South Africa's most powerful mining and industrial group,
being feted by Soviet officials?
Waddell stoicly refused to comment. But within the discreet worlds of the
diamond and gold trading communities, Waddell's appearance in Moscow came as
no surprise. They knew that for many years the Anglo group and its diamond
twin, De Beers, had been involved with the Soviet Union in some form of
'orderly marketing arrangements' for diamonds and gold.
The international diamond cartel organised by De Beers' London-based Central
Selling Organisation could not have survived without solid support from the
Soviet Union. The CSO still controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough
(uncut) diamonds and 25 per cent of the stones it sells come from the former
Soviet Union.
This reciprocity was beautifully illustrated after the collapse of the
Soviet Union. In 1990 De Beers loaned Russia Dollars 1bn - thus doing more
than any country at that time to help the Russians solve their shortage of
hard currency. In return De Beers shipped stockpiled diamonds to London as
collateral for the loan and signed an exclusive, five-year marketing
agreement with Russia - thus ensuring that Russia would not be tempted to
raise money quickly by dumping diamonds in the west.
Debora Spar, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, comes to be
analysing the diamond cartel via a circuitous route. She intended to examine
how the Soviets sold their natural resources on world markets and how they
manipulated this trade in pursuit of political gain. 'Very quickly,' she
recalls, 'I realised that the real puzzle was not why the Soviets were not
competing more vigorously but why they were co-operating so effectively,' -
particularly with their South African counterparts.
Spar also says that she became interested in cartels, 'not for their own
sake but rather for what they can teach us about the politics and processes
of international co-operation'.
She chose four cases: the formal and highly successful diamond cartel; the
sophisticated but informal collaboration in gold; a failed cartel and
subsequent anarchy in uranium; and the silver market, where there is little
evidence of co-operation.
Her central observation is that co-operative behaviour among producers is
not determined solely by the structure of the market in which they operate.
Cartels form, she argues, not only because a market is predisposed to joint
action, but also because at least two major producers have certain internal
characteristics that enable them to initiate and maintain a co-operative
relationship.
She says autonomous competitors - those with the power to discipline and
command their own internal factions - will best be able to make the
commitments that enable them to take part in and perpetuate co-operative
endeavours. Also, insofar as a successful cartel involves a continuous
process of bargaining, it will be best managed by those producers able to
keep the circle of negotiators small, the rules flexible and the power to
retaliate as strong as possible.
The Soviet Union, with its centralised power, was matched for autonomy by
the South African corporations. Spar says: 'De Beers and Anglo American have
long been joined to and protected by a vast corporate conglomerate. All
firms in the network are linked to one another and, ultimately, to the top
of the corporate pyramid and the Oppenheimer family. The 'empire' is
effectively controlled by its centre and remains resistant to outside
pressures and internal squabbles . . . In the Oppenheimer companies very
little decentralisation has occured. Integration remains the guiding
principle and control resides firmly at the top.'
In setting out her case histories, Spar makes some unforgiveable factual
mistakes - for example, a simple examination of the annual reports would
have prevented her making the ludicrous assertion that RTZ's board is
'composed of many of the same people who run various other parts of Harry
Oppenheimer's empire'.
She also fails to mention that the size of a particular market is an
important factor in its suitability for cartelisation. Harry Oppenheimer
himself once told me that Opec was misguided to believe that producers could
control prices in a market as big as the oil market.
But you do not have to agree with Spar's theories to enjoy her re-telling of
some fascinating industrial history.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (22): Notable newcomers - Inward
Investment / Roland Adburgham looks at the Japanese in Wales

Working for the Japanese: The Economic and Social Consequences of Japanese
Investment in Wales
by Jonathan Morris, Max Munday and Barry Wilkinson Athlone Press, Pounds 32,
156 pages
With some justification, Wales has prided itself on its success at winning
inward investment to help to counter the contraction of its traditional
heavy industries. Notable among the newcomers have been Japanese
manufacturers. It is more than 20 years since the first of these, Takiron,
arrived. Today, they number more than 40, including names such as Sony,
Sharp, Matsushita and Toyota.
From the start, they sparked controversy with their novel (at the time)
single union and no-strike agreements and innovative management practices.
They were criticised for being assembly-type operations exploiting the
labour surplus in Wales to create a largely female, low-skilled workforce.
While such issues stimulated broad debate, there has been less analysis of
the overall value to Wales of the newcomers. This book, by three members of
the Japanese Management Research Unit of Cardiff Business School, is a
useful assessment of their impact.
The authors conclude that, although Japanese companies employ only 1 per
cent of the Welsh workforce, the effect has been both considerable and
beneficial - 'Undoubtedly, Wales would be a poorer place without the
Japanese.'
One consequence, they say, is that Welsh employers have been spurred to
develop a 'Japanese-style' of working, 'centring on individual
responsibility for product quality, team working and functional
flexibility'.
Over the years, the nature of the plants has changed: the second wave of
newcomers saw fewer assembly-only plants and more original equipment
manufacturers. Later arrivals included component manufacturers, supplying
the existing plants.
The authors find that 'plants are developing away from the assembly-only
stereotype and are employing, in some cases, large numbers of managers and
engineers'.
But they point out that only a minority of plants carry out research or
design work and investment remains concentrated in a narrow industry segment
 -consumer electronics and office automation. And, they say, 'it is clear
that the boom in Japanese investment that occurred during the mid to late
1980s is largely over'.
The authors' researches throw up many intriguing facts. Government aid has
worked out at about Pounds 7,500 per worker. Although one company reported
1,500 people on its recruitment waiting list, many businesses reported
difficulties in finding engineering staff and technicians. Younger employees
are becoming a smaller proportion of the workforces, as their employers
realise the value of more mature staff.
The companies are beginning to play a corporate-citizen role in the
community. Managers from Japan say they much appreciate the warm welcome
received in Wales and enjoy the working environment. The negative factors
for them are education of children, language problems and their wives'
integration into the local community. One manager complained: 'No hot
springs, no bar hopping, no ladies]'
In spite of the book's title, there is little about the attitude of the
workers. The Welsh workforce, we are told, 'has adapted with remarkably
little resistance or complaint to a Japanese style of working', a fact
attributed to personnel and industrial relations practices. But we do not
learn whether the Welsh prefer to work for the Japanese.

A History of Money: From Ancient Times to the Present Day
by Glyn Davies, University of Wales Press, Pounds 39.95 696 pages
The Sociology of Money, Economics, Reason and Contemporary Society
by Nigel Dodd, Polity Press, Pounds 39.50 209 pages
Should sterling have been devalued? Were the authorities trying to maintain
an unrealistic parity? The question, refers, of course, not to the 1992 ERM
crisis, nor to Britain's return to the Gold Standard in the 1920s, but to
whether 'medieval England was crucified on a cross of silver'.
Even the author of the question, Glyn Davies, emeritus professor of
economics at the University of Wales, admits that 'at this distance of time
it is unlikely that anyone will be able to come up with a convincing
answer'. The aside, though, is typical of the many fascinating historical
perspectives contained in Davies' highly readable new history of money.
During the several centuries in Europe in which money was convertible into
gold or silver, control of the money supply was tied to the discovery of new
mines or the decisions by rulers in times of shortage to debase the coinage
through reminting.
By monetising the gold stocks of the Persian empire, Alexander the Great
gave an enormous boost to world trade. By contrast, the inflow of New World
gold into England into the 17th-century proved highly inflationary, as the
accompanying rise in urban population resulted in too much money chasing too
few goods.
In general, though, bullion famines were the chief cause of economic
downturns over a period lasting from the invention of coinage in Lydia in
the 7th century BC to the advent of paper money in the forms of bills of
exchange from the early 17th-century onwards.
The Athenians were the world's first devaluers (405 BC), responding to a
silver shortage brought on the Spartan wars. In later times, the spiralling
cost of the 'bread-and-circus' budget could equally be said to have been
behind the decision by Nero (AD 54-68) and Norman Lamont (AD 1990-93) to let
'the currency find its own level'.
By AD 270 the silver content of the Roman denarius had fallen from 50 per
cent to 4 per cent, prompting a 50-fold rise in prices which was only
brought under control by the Emperor Diocletian's Edict of Prices in AD 301
and his unveiling of the world's first budget.
Commodity monies were especially prone to new sources of supply. The value
of the Ugandan cowrie shell slumped following its wholesale importation into
the country in the mid-19th century. In the more remote regions of Uganda in
1800 two cowrie shells were known to have been sufficient to purchase a
woman; by 1860 one would have needed 1,000.
Europe had first learnt of paper money from Marco Polo's account of the
court of Kublai Khan, which he visited between 1275 and 1292. Indeed, China
had experienced paper money, as well as regular bouts of hyper-inflation,
for well over 800 years before the printed banknote became common in the
west.
But it was the establishment of the Bank of England, which effectively
democratised the Sovereign's Debt, that initiated the huge increase in the
money supply which dominates the second half of Davies' history.
Among several outstanding chapters, his account of the origins of the Bank,
especially the way in which its position was consolidated by the collapse of
the South Sea Bubble Company which had also competed to manage the National
Debt, and his analysis of the role of regional banks in the Industrial
Revolution, are first-rate.
The proliferation of paper money substitutes, from bills of exchange to bank
bills and cheques, eventually made the principle of monetary convertibility
increasingly hard to sustain, not least because money itself became harder
to measure and define.
In 1982 the Bank of England admitted there was 'no single correct definition
of money but went on to list 24 measurable asset classes', prompting Sir Ian
Gilmour's remark about monetarism being 'the uncontrollable in pursuit of
the indefinable.'
Davies' own monetarist principles show through clearly enough in his
discussion of the 18th-century's mercantilist-bullionist debate (which
produced John Law's splendidly Keynesian pamphlet A Proposal for Supplying
the Nation with Money), a debate which anticipated many of the
monetarist-v-Keynesian arguments today.
But he is honestly agnostic about the relationship between the money supply
and the cultural, social and competitive conditions which shape a nation's
productive activity and can disrupt the monetarist's best-laid projections
of economic equilibrium.
It is at this point that a book such as Nigel Dodd's The Sociology of Money
ought to be interesting. While the main advantage of modern capitalism may
well be 'a necessary - but far from sufficient - condition of an open
society in which many alternative cultures can flourish', there has been a
surprising lack of interest in examining the different cultural, political
and social configurations which economic activity can underpin.
Dodd rejects Marx's belief in labour as the sole value of economic life,
just as he has little time for the arguments of post-Marxists such as Weber
that money is an inescapably alienating force in modern life. But he also
rejects the views of classical and neo-classical economists, whether Adam
Smith or Hayek, whose view of an individual rationally maximising his
utilities in a free market tells us next to nothing about what sort of life
such an individual might lead.
The disappointment is that Dodd's is a deliberately destructive book which
draws back from positing an argument of its own.

World Index of Resources and Population

Publishing, Pounds 95 417 pages
The world will not run out of mineral resources, at least not before the
year 2025. That is the comforting message presented in the overview to this
intriguing tome. Nevertheless, the statistics are awe-inspiring.
Some 25 per cent of all the people ever born are still alive today. There
are about 5.5bn people in the world and in 30 years time the global
population may reach 8bn, 10bn or more. If the 8bn use mineral resources at
the present rate that will require, for example, an extra 9m tonnes of
aluminium a year compared with today's demand of 16m; 1.4bn extra tonnes of
oil, against 3.1bn today; and 1.5bn more tonnes of coal versus the present
4.4bn.
In many developing countries, such as China, Indonesia and Mexico, the per
capita usage of minerals is also increasing. On even the most pessimistic
forecast this will require a massive expansion of the mining, oil and gas
industries as well as the refining, transport and fabrication sectors.
But the authors - a mining engineer, a social scientist and an international
economist - dismiss the 'doomwatch' theory which suggests that the world
will have run dry of resources by then.
They argue that, despite demand for many minerals having trebled or
quadrupled between 1950 and 1993, known reserves in the ground have
continued to increase. 'There is every probability that they will continue
to do so,' they state confidently.
Substitution, recycling, miniaturisation and longer-life applications will
also ensure there are enough minerals to go round.
Nevertheless, major new sources will have to be developed in order to meet
the extra demand.
This book brings together in one volume statistics and forecasts about the
factors that will decided where new mining and oil and gas fields should be
sited.
It systematically analyses the factors which will determine the changes in
demand to 2025 for the 36 minerals which make up more than 95 per cent of
the present global total by value. It examines the 61 countries which
represent the major producing and consuming regions and the 30 leading
internationally-operating companies which fund, develop, produce, refine and
distribute the minerals.
So where will the new mines and oil and gas fields be developed? If
companies follow the 'investment potential' guide devised by this volume,
the top six 'picks' will be the United Arab Emirates; Australia; Norway; the
Commonwealth of Independent States; the US and the UK. The places most to be
avoided seem to be Pakistan; Zaire; Sierra Leone; Zambia; and Bolivia.
This investment guide is calculated from five factors: the value of minerals
in a country's gross domestic product - which is seen as being particularly
important - the value of minerals in per capita GDP; the total annual value
of minerals produced; the rate of population increase; and a subjective
assessment of the political and economic scene.
At Pounds 95 the World Index is not an 'impulse' purchase but, apart from
its obvious attraction for any organisation involved in or with the minerals
sector, it would make a worthwhile addition to any well-used reference
library.
It covers seven topics: world population; individual countries (from Algeria
to Zimbabwe); individual companies (from Anglo American Corporation to
Zimco); individual minerals (from Antimony to Uranium); the energy industry
(with sub-sections on coal, gas, oil, nuclear and hydro); the automotive
industry, because it is the biggest user of raw materials; and the
environment 'because environmental awareness now impacts on every facet of
the minerals industry from mining through to consumption.'
In this connection the World Index shows us why big UK-based groups such as
Hanson and RTZ are busy buying up coal mines despite a vocal environmental
lobby wanting to curb sulphur emissions from coal-burning power stations. It
says: 'Given the forward energy demand profile, there will be no alternative
to a rapidly rising coal burn world-wide.' The review forecasts an increase
in coal burned from 2.2bn tonnes to 4.6bn tonnes by 2025. Little of this
increase will take place in Europe, 'the focal point of pollution
awareness'. Most will be in the US, China and the Pacific Rim.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (19): No solution perfect -
Corporate Governance / Geoffrey Owen looks at contrasting systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Markets and Corporate Governance
Edited by Nicholas Dimsdale and Martha Prevezer Oxford University Press,
Pounds 40 349 pages
The objectives of any system of corporate governance are to organise
relationships between owners, boards of directors and management in a way
which promotes the long-term growth and profitability of the enterprise.
The form which these relationships take varies widely among the industrial
countries and none has found a perfect solution. Most of the 16 papers
edited by Nicholas Dimsdale and Martha Prevezer deal with deficiencies in
British arrangements, including the allegedly malign effects of excessive
takeover activity and 'short-termism.' But the book also contains some
useful comparisons with Japan and Germany, which have problems of their own.
Differences between the three countries - in the composition of boards, in
the pattern of share ownership, in the role of banks - stem from historical
circumstances. In Japan, for example, the capital liberalisation which began
in 1967 promoted companies to protect themselves against foreign takeover
through cross-shareholdings. With more than half their company's equity in
the hands of stable, long-term shareholders, Japanese managers worry much
less about the share price than their counterparts in the US and Britain.
As Colin Mayer points out, Japanese and German systems of ownership and
control are not directed exclusively to the interests of shareholders, but
involve other stakeholders in decision-making, including suppliers,
purchasers, banks and employees.
In Japan, according to Seiichi Masuyama, 'stable shareholders are selected
by and are dependent on management, and cannot therefore play a disciplinary
role on corporate management'. The main source of disciplinary pressure, he
suggests, comes from the need to satisfy employees.
Jenny Corbett notes that Japanese boards are dominated by executive
directors who are promoted from within: 'It is not clear how shareholders
can remove or replace poor managers nor how they can force managers to look
after their interests.'
In principle, the monitoring problem should be handled more efficiently in
Germany, where there is a clear separation between management and
supervision. But supervisory boards meet only three or four times a year and
their members are often too remote from the company's affairs to exert
effective influence; their input, according to a survey reported by Jeremy
Edwards and Klaus Fischer, is far less than that of US non-executive
directors, partly because of the importance in the US of board committees,
especially the audit committee.
Recent failures of German corporate governance have raised doubts about the
'insider' approach to corporate control; there have been calls for the
appointment of genuinely independent directors, with no business ties to the
company.
How these independent directors should be appointed, and what incentives
they might have for rigorous monitoring of management, is one of the
unsolved problems of the Anglo-American system. For Allen Sykes the way
forward is for institutional shareholders to agree among themselves that
every major company would have three to five 'core' investors, which would
hold the shares for at least five years and be directly represented on the
board. Their combined shareholding would normally amount to 15-20 per cent
of the equity. Each of the top 60 institutions would take a special interest
in, on average, eight of the top 100 companies. They would be free to trade
without restriction in the other 92.
Any move in this direction would require an unlikely degree of common
purpose on the part of shareholders. British and American institutional
investors have been intervening more vigorously in badly managed companies.
But this hardly amounts to large, committed shareholdings on the Japanese or
German pattern.
How much do these differences in corporate governance matter? Many
commentators deplore the absence of trust and commitment in the
Anglo-American system. But the regeneration of the US motor industry over
the past decade suggests that some Japanese management practices, including
high-trust relationships with suppliers and employees, can be adopted within
the constraints of US financial markets.
German and Japanese institutional arrangements have some important
strengths, but dispersed shareholdings and an active takeover market may not
be quite as serious a competitive disadvantage as most contributors to this
volume assume.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (16): Banal heroes - Xerox /
Real life sales story has mixed success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Force by David Dorsey Random House, Pounds 23 315 pages
It's nerve-shredding time in the sales department: late November, with only
a few weeks left in the year and the team below its budget target. In a
spasm of anger, one rep throws her frozen Thanksgiving turkey down a flight
of stairs at her husband. Others down medicine to deaden the nausea they
feel on their most crucial sales calls.
Welcome to the world as seen through the eyes of a crack Xerox's sales team
in the rust-belt city of Cleveland, Ohio: purveyors of copier machines to
local industry and facing ferocious competition from rivals such as Eastman
Kodak, Pitney-Bowes and Konica.
First-time author David Dorsey, a business journalist, approached Xerox with
a smart idea: to get under the skin of the great American salesperson by
spending a year with the Cleveland team on client calls and customer
entertainment outings, going to staff meetings and to their homes.
Surprisingly, Xerox agreed, though it may now regret doing so, for his
warts-and-all account portrays one of America's most admired corporations,
and a leading promoter of the Total Quality Management (TQM) movement, in a
very mixed light.
Unfortunately, the book is equally mixed, due mainly to the writing style
adopted by Dorsey - that pioneered by Tracy Kidder (who provides a
dust-jacket endorsement) in The Soul of a New Machine, the story of the
development of a new computer. This uses a novel's narrative style to tell a
non-fiction story. It requires great talent to pull off and Dorsey has not
quite mastered it.
The problem is partly his tendency to indulge in long passages of purple
prose, and it is partly the way he structures the story, with important
background information introduced too late in the narrative, or not at all.
We never do find out precisely what equipment the reps are selling, which is
presumably an important part of their job.
But the difficulty is mainly because this type of narrative needs a strong,
compelling plot. Dorsey's main story-line focuses on Fred Thomas, a star
sales manager: will he beat his annual sales target and 'make trip' - in
other words, get on Xerox's annual jamboree for its top reps, being held
this year in the Californian desert resort of Palm Springs?
A sub-plot involves Fred's up-and-down relationship with his wife, Kathy,
whose ambition in life is to invent a game show which she can sell for vast
sums of money to a television company.
The problem in sustaining this story is twofold: the lives of Dorsey's
heroes are pretty banal and there are only so many ways to describe the sale
of a Xerox machine. In short, your attention begins to wander.
But it is well worth persevering, because large chunks of the book do give a
fly-on-the-wall insight into the life of the salesman and his methods.
'In a sales call,' says Dorsey, 'even if only subliminally, you're reminded
of how much you want to be liked, and yet how little you know of what other
people say when your back is turned. If the salesman seizes the opportunity
this presents, if he realises how easy it is to manipulate a person who
needs to be liked . . . then he can make large sums of money, because he
understands something terrible about human affection.'
We learn the difference between the 'grease' sale (lots of financial
incentives and client entertainment) and the 'puppy-dog' sale - where the
rep builds up a friendly relationship over months which is 'used to box the
customer into a corner where he feels he can't say no without feeling like a
fool'.
One of the book's more interesting insights is into the tension created in
the sales force by Xerox's adoption of TQM, which lays great emphasis on
customer satisfaction. Fred had sold for Xerox for years when the the only
guiding principle was 'to write as much business as possible, as early as
possible, by any means possible'. Now the Cleveland district was trying to
sell both ways at once - promoting customer satisfaction, yet encouraging
high pressure sales when success was at stake.
But TQM did produce results. For one thing, it allowed the rep in charge of
wooing 'non users' (companies burnt by Xerox in the past) to get through the
door again, with the message that Xerox had changed, become an expert on
quality and could help its clients become one too.
It also built better relations with existing customers: At the climax of the
book, one of Fred's most crucial sales is to a company which decides to
order Xerox equipment, rather than take a cheaper deal from Pitney-Bowes,
because of the company's quality programme and emphasis on partnership.
Fred and Kathy, you will be pleased to hear, do get to go to Palm Springs,
where a great time is had by all: Three days of golf, tennis, lazing by a
swimming pool and general alcoholic over-indulgence. They say it's not like
the old days, when people became totally uncontrollable and marriages fell
apart, but the Cleveland crowd try to keep the sense of excess alive.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (17): Selecting quality - Mail
Order / Philip Jenks of the Founders talks to Gay Firth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GAY FIRTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Founders Library, a mail order business book list, aims to act as a
sieve. It recognises the hard truth that - put politely - one business book
can be less useful and readable than another.
Busy people have little time to sift the useful one or two from the boring
thousands in an avalanche of business print. Many do not read at all.
Philip Jenks was a busy but bored articled clerk in a big City law firm a
couple of years ago: 'Most of the work in my first two years was about as
exciting and challenging as sweeping Earls Court after the Horse of the Year
show,' he says.
So he set up his own imprint, Harriman House, and published The Official
Lawyer's Handbook, a keyhole scrutiny as clear-headed, amusing, and
irreverent as himself.
Trotting the copies for sale round London's bookshops (he has sold nearly
9,000 since September 1992), Mr Jenks noted the 'creaking shelves of
business books, some of them 300 pages long', on abstruse management
disciplines and would-be financial wizardry. A need to sift and select, on
behalf of potential readers, was plain.
'There are an awful lot of 'how to' books written by 'never did' people,
perpetrating the myth of easy solutions to business problems and gilding
their solutions in fancy nostrums and empty cant.'
Philip Jenks's cheerful, gung-ho manner can turn steely; his eye is sharp
and his purpose is serious. 'I have a healthy disdain for the heavyweight,
heavy-price, theoretical side of business publishing - the stuff which is no
fun and not much use either.'
The Founders Library specialises in business biographies and business
history. 'Our books are about founders - people who started their own
businesses and successfully built them into large commercial enterprises -
for founders, or at least people with a founder's mentality. Founders are
entrepreneurial, single-minded and intolerant of bull. They want to know
what an author has achieved to warrant their attention.'
Mr Jenks selects from three sources. He buys in books - actual books, not
rights - which have been successful in the US but not published here, such
as the autobiography Made in America by Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart.
The second source is in identifying forgotten business classics and
re-publishing them. The third is a strict selection of 'founder's' books
nearing the end of their first published life in the UK, bought in on trade
terms for mail order distribution.
Jenks's turnover in his first year was Pounds 42,000. 'In the current year
it's difficult to say, but I'll be disappointed if it's not double that.'
His book buyers' database is 2,973 strong: 'Not huge, but they've all bought
within the last 18 months and it's a good quality list.' Jenks has more than
a little of the founder's mentality himself.

Private Intelligence / Robert Peston finds that companies need to keep a
close watch on their secrets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Corporate Cloak and Dagger
by James Croft Harper Collins, Pounds 7.99 212 pages
To bug or be bugged? To tap or be tapped? Those apparently are the choices
for companies and powerful individuals these days.
Whose secrets are safe? Not those whispered down the phone by the Prince of
Wales. Not the private financial affairs of a chancellor of the exchequer.
The 'private intelligence' industry is booming and agencies are becoming
increasingly brazen about advertising their services. Prices are
surprisingly reasonable. One intelligence firm has sent out a brochure
containing the following tariff for searches: Bank balance - Pounds 245
Hard copy bank statement - Pounds 1,000
Salary - Pounds 200
Pension details - Pounds 200
Full career history - Pounds 590
Hard copy of itemised telephone bill - Pounds 750
Overseas tax havens, numbered accounts - price on application.
The firm's blurb continues: 'More sensitive areas of intelligence are
available on request.'
Belatedly, the government has become aware that the law on the protection of
privacy is too vague. New legislation is planned. In the meantime, it is
wise for companies and individuals in possession of confidential information
to consider how best to protect themselves.
A Boy's Own Guide to seeing off the snoopers - or indeed becoming a snooper
 -has been written by a certain James Croft, described by his publisher as
an 'expert in covert and overt intelligence gathering'.
The otherwise anonymous Mr Croft - 'We have no further biographical
details', said Harper Collins - dispels some of the popular illusions about
intelligence industry. Its techniques are mostly low-tech, such as searching
through public records or - in its seedier form - persuading officials or
bankers to pass on information they should keep secret.
Though banks and companies are wise to put in place safeguards against
sophisticated computer hacking, there is little evidence that this is
widespread. Computerisation has increased the risk of disclosure of
sensitive information, but only because it often involves a centralisation
of vast quantities of information which can then be sold by corrupt
employees. Loss as a result of an outsider accessing the system directly is
far less common.
Unsurprisingly, given the sensitivity and complexity of its subject, the
book oscillates between the trite, the obscure, the genuinely practical and
the hilarious.
In the latter category are his six practical steps for raiding the rubbish
bin of a surveillance target. It contains tips such as:
'Always try to collect (rubbish) between 2am and 4am;
Always have a reason to be there - excuses such as a sudden need for the
toilet . . . or conducting market research (at 2am?) ..are useful;
Where a foray into the countryside is needed, use the following procedures:
a) full reconnaissance of area;
b) two personnel;
c) assess drop-off point;
d) passenger leaves vehicle as car slows but does not stop;
e) car continues to predetermined location and waits for an agreed time.
Engine is not turned off - etc etc.'
There is also a lengthy discussion of the legality of rubbish-bin raiding,
in particular the question of who owns the rubbish.
His section on electronic eavesdropping - how to do it and how to prevent it
 -is the most disappointing. It does not give any real insight into how the
various homing, encryption, bugging and jamming devices work, nor how to use
them.
Far more practical is a guide to what information is legitimately available
by searching government and corporate databases. One of the UK's best-kept
secrets is the vast amounts of useful information available to the diligent
researcher from the examination of public records, even in a closed society
such as the UK's.
For example a search of Companies House's directory of directors shows that
13 different 'James Crofts' - if that is his real name - are directors of UK
companies.
Their addresses, ages and nationalities are given with other biographical
details. Is intelligence expert Mr Croft the one who lives in Hertfordshire
and describes himself as an aquatic specialist? Or is he the car hire
manager from Lancashire? Or could he be the Leeds police officer? There is a
chance, of course, that his real name is something quite different - in
which case, the only way to trace him is to resort to the tried and tested
method of cajoling his publisher into telling all.

Technopols / The question of whether political systems govern economic
success is a sticky one

<TEXT>
The Political Economy of Policy Reform
Edited by John Williamson Institute of International Economics Pounds 9.99
93 pages
What conditions are needed for a government to implement economic reform
successfully?
The knee-jerk response to this is to drum up an image of an authoritarian
government taking power during an economic crisis, acting quickly and using
all the means at its disposal, including violence, to silence any opposition
to the policies it knows it must rigorously pursue despite all the
short-term costs. Does that answer the question?
Partly. Those conditions - which more or less describe Pinochet's Chile, for
example - might be sufficient for a government to implement reforms, but
they are not necessary. At least that is the sensible conclusion of John
Williamson's book from the Institute for International Economics. Williamson
doesn't bring us much closer to knowing what is both sufficient and
necessary. But that says less about the quality of his book than the
slipperiness of the subject.
The book, which has grown out of a conference held last year on these
issues, draws together 13 essays by a group of authors that Williamson calls
'technopols' - policy-makers who start off life as technically skilled
functionaries (armed almost always with an economics PhD from a US
university?), unconnected to any vested interests, whose only political
commitment is to their vision of the common good. On this definition, they
are probably the nearest substitute the modern world has for Plato's
philosopher-kings.
Eleven of the 13 give accounts of successful episodes of economic reform,
and two - Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, Brazil's finance minister in 1987,
and Richard Webb, Peru's central bank governor in the early 1980s - try to
say why they could not make reforms stick. These essays have a tendency to
dissolve into acts of self-justification, and some of them could have had a
bit less 'pol' and a bit more 'techno'. In one essay, for example, Jose
Pinera, who was at different times Pinochet's minister for labour and for
social security, fails to mention his government's suppression of dissent,
and thus creates a loud silence which mars an otherwise interesting piece.
Readers looking for a user's guide for policy-makers will find this book
disappointing. Every time you think you have come across the political sine
qua non of economic reform, a counter-example pops up to frustrate you. You
might start off thinking, for example, that authoritarian regimes headed by
visionary leaders must have an advantage over democratic ones, only to
discover that plenty of democratic governments - Portugal in 1985, Colombia
in 1989, Poland in 1990 - have implemented successful reform packages, and
plenty of authoritarian ones have not.
The book tries to test a number of hypotheses like this. Are a government's
chances of success better in the midst of an economic crisis? Or in the
'honeymoon' period at the start of an administration? Commonsense suggests
that they must be, since a crisis creates the sort of shock needed to wear
down resistance to change, and a 'honeymoon' hands the benefit of the doubt
to a new regime. But honeymoons and crises are not always ingredients of
successful reforms, as you learn by bearing in mind that Colombia's 1989
reforms were begun just a few months before the end of President
Barco'sadministration in an atmosphere of relative calm.
Perhaps the biggest drawback of the book is that apples in one country are
too frequently compared with pears in another. Arguably it just doesn't make
sense to compare Colombia's reforms in 1989, for example, to Poland's in
1990, since completely different goals were being pursued. In Poland, the
aim was a fundamental re-ordering of society, against which Colombia's
reforms appear to have been mere tinkering. Naturally, the political
conditions that made each reform possible were different, since the type of
reform being implemented was different. A more complete book would have
resulted if some attention had been paid to this.
Only one condition stands out as being a feature of every successful reform
episode the book describes: the presence of a united and coherent economic
team in charge of designing the reform programme. What lessons come from
this? Should we, after all, hand over our destinies to the technopols? At
least Plato would approve.

Finance for the General Manager
by Roger Mills and Janine Stiles McGraw-Hill Book Company Pounds 23.95, 256
pages
One of the more daunting challenges facing managers moving from middle to
senior executive positions is that of getting to grips with finance. While
most will have had some financial experience as they climb the corporate
ladder, few will be familiar with the broader role of finance in making and
evaluating strategic decisions.
This book, written by two members of the teaching staff at the Henley
Management College, is designed to help. It will not take anyone looking for
a top-flight MBA very far, but its by-and-large lucid and matter-of-fact
approach will be of practical help to the executive who suddenly finds he or
she is moving in a world where understanding of financial issues is
required.
Many such people fear they are entering a world obscured by jargon. The
authors are well aware of this when they quote an apocryphal story of three
men who apply for a job as an accountant. They were each asked to calculate
two times two. The first two answered correctly. The third replied: 'What
figure did you have in mind, sir?' He, of course, got the job.
Again, this book will not enable the new general manager to face down the
creative accountant but a reasonably numerate reader does not need prior
understanding of finance to find it rewarding. Moreover, the authors cover
the waterfront from the relationship between profit, cash flow and the
balance sheet, to the evaluation of company accounts and control of working
capital and capital spending. Throughout, there is emphasis on the need to
ensure good quality data.
Another theme is the importance of cash flow. The authors show how an
otherwise positive business plan can be a recipe for disaster if the timing
of cash flow is not taken into account. 'Understanding how to manage cash is
vital,' the authors argue. 'While general management typically demands the
ability to manage profitability, to do so without paying close attention to
cash will produce limited results.'
One drawback is that this is neither a detailed theoretical textbook nor,
perhaps, sufficiently practical for the manager with his sleeves rolled-up.
Thus, for example, the authors refer to the possible use of options in
hedging foreign exchange risk. They explain clearly how options work and how
the result differs from using the forward currency market, but they do not
discuss how to value options. Judging whether he or she is getting a good
deal is, presumably, is a skill that general managers have to learn
elsewhere.
Similarly, the book gives explanations - with reference to Hanson, perhaps
one of the more complicated examples - of how to examine and assess balance
sheets. Various ratios are discussed, but as is so often the case, the
reader is left in doubt as to how to evaluate the ratios that emerge.
This is a perennial problem as there can be no hard and fast rules, but more
examples would help. Given the recent history of the stock market, one must
treat with a pinch of salt the general statement that it is worthwhile being
cautious of companies with a price/earnings ratio of more than 20 times. But
at least the authors do point to sectoral differences and make it clear that
the notes to the accounts must be scrutinised to make sure that like is
being compared with like.
The conscientious reader will want to delve further once this book has been
digested. If that simply means yet more work for the aspiring chief
executive, there is a small consolation as well. In their discussion on
evaluating capital projects the authors note how the paperwork thins out as
the decision-making moves closer to the board.
They quote the case of a company where more than 150 documents with 1,750
pages were identified with a particular project. By the time the project was
up for consideration by the finance department, these had been reduced to a
20-page document with 30 pages of appendices. The main board did not even
have to read that. Directors received a three-page summary.

For Richer, For Poorer: Shaping US-Mexican Integration
by Harry Browne Latin America Bureau, Pounds 7.99 128 pages
Mexico: Industrial Development Review: The Promise of Nafta
United Nations Industrial Development Organisation Economist Intelligence
Unit Pounds 95 (Dollars 150 in US and Asia) 222 pages
Here are two very different books looking at the same issue: the economic
consequences of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the increasing
economic integration between Mexico and the US.
The first describes sympathetically many of the arguments deployed in
opposition to Nafta, which joined the US, Mexico and Canada in a free trade
area which came into effect at the start of this year envisaging the
elimination of all trade barriers between the three countries over a 15-year
period.
The second is the latest of the country reviews of industrial development
produced by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation and
published by the EIU which examines the ability of Mexico to compete in its
new North American environment.
For Richer, For Poorer typifies much of the muddled debate over Nafta. Its
underlying premise is that the agreement is essentially a charter allowing
large corporations to exploit cheap Mexican labour and lax environmental
regulation and to keep down US wages.
The implicit suggestion that Nafta ignores the needs of dynamic small and
medium-sized businesses on both sides of the border is an interesting one
that deserves further examination, but that's not what we are treated to.
Instead, a work full of contradictions suggests that Mexico's Dollars 280bn
economy will inflict huge economic damage on the Dollars 6,000bn US economy
and on American workers. What's more, as far as one can gather, it will do
so without producing any appreciable benefit to the Mexican economy or the
people who work in it.
The premise is that Nafta will encourage US companies to move to Mexico, but
that Mexican workers will not benefit because Nafta 'contained no mechanisms
that would allow them to resist their government's repressive, low-wage
strategy'.
This refers to the government's domination of the Mexican trade unions which
benefits corporations at the expense of workers. Evidence that Mexican
workers will not benefit from Nafta is the 20-40 per cent fall in real wages
they suffered between 1982 and 1991 - a peak-to-trough comparison
incorporating the years of the debt crisis.
Meanwhile, US workers will suffer even as labour productivity increases.
This is because the theory of comparative advantage - that overall welfare
increases when countries make the things they produce most efficiently and
trade them freely - does not work in the real-world absence of its perfect
market assumptions.
The evidence for this also comes from the 1980s where real manufacturing
wages declined 5-10 per cent. 'Although the number of jobs in the economy
increased by over 20m during the decade and the unemployment rate fell,
workers' incomes barely improved,' it says, as if the creation of 20m jobs
benefits nobody.
The inconsistencies are manifold and evidence used to illustrate one point
is contradicted to make another. For example, while it argues that Mexicans
won't benefit from the low wages to be paid by US companies, it makes the
point elsewhere that it is not only low-paid, low-skill jobs that will
migrate to Mexico.
The initial flavour of academic impartiality is quickly cast aside. Nafta,
though it came into effect but months ago, is somehow connected to the
terrible performance of Mexican agriculture which has turned the country
from being a net exporter of agricultural products into a net importer.
The drawbacks of the maquila system of in-bond manufacturing in place since
1965 - US companies establish manufacturing plants in Mexico and can import
their inputs duty-free providing they export the manufactured result - are
insinuated to be the same drawbacks of Nafta.
The spillover benefits of the maquiladora industry to the Mexican economy
have been limited, it is true. But under Nafta, the maquiladoras - which
earned an estimated Dollars 5bn in foreign exchange in 1993 - will be phased
out. As the UNIDO report points out, Nafta will remove the obstacles to the
maquiladoras' use of Mexican inputs and should help their integration into
the Mexican economy.
The UNIDO publication is both duller and better researched. It argues
electronic, food processing, motor vehicle, petrochemical and textile
industries in Mexico all stand to benefit from Nafta. Among maquilas, those
using Japanese and other foreign components will benefit least. Overall, it
estimates Nafta will lead to the creation of 600,000 new jobs in Mexico by
1995 - and an increase in wage rates.

The Reshaping of the German Social Market
by David Goodhart Institute for Public Policy Research, Pounds 7.50 83 pages
The Germans gave us the word Schadenfreude - delight in others' misfortunes
 -but this ignoble sentiment is by no means confined to its country of
origin. Indeed, the Germans themselves have recently become the butt of
rather too much Schadenfreude from their Anglo- Saxon cousins, some of whom
relish the difficulties faced by the hitherto miraculous German economy.
Reports of Germany's demise, however, are premature. Much of that analysis,
spurred by the Germans' own taste for self-doubt, is no more than the
product of the business cycle and the transient difficulties of
reunification. Germany is emerging from a prolonged and deep recession, a
time during which it is easy to gain an audience for the proposition that
the present gloom will extend for ever. Yet the pessimists are usually just
as wide of the mark as the optimists who see economic rejuvenation at the
top of every boom.
The truth is more interesting, as David Goodhart argues in a
thought-provoking review of the German experience. The German model - what
Michel Albert called the Rhine model of capitalism and what the Germans call
the social market - is under strain. Its social safety net is being tested
by an ageing population and the collapse of employment in the eastern Lander
caused by monetary union at an ill-judged exchange rate.
Germany's industries are facing low-wage competition not only from Asian
newly-industrialising countries, but also from closer to home in Silesia,
Bohemia and Moravia. Its reputation for fiscal orthodoxy has taken a
battering at the hands of sky-high budget deficits.
It is at least arguable, Goodhart concedes, that Germany's skills in
mechanical engineering and a natural bent for incremental improvement were
appropriate to a second industrial revolution of cars and consumer goods
rather than the third revolution of science and technology.
But German strengths should not be underestimated. This is a country with
345 industries that have a world market share of more than 10 per cent.
Germany's wage-bargaining system has also delivered a fall in unit wage
costs of 6 per cent since the start of 1993, an example of wage flexibility
unparalleled in other European labour markets.
There is, of course, a lot of politics wrapped up in all this. Goodhart is
writing for a left-of-centre think tank and has set out to recapture the
German social market as an example for social democrats rather than the
Thatcherite right.
He is persuasive. Germany is indeed characterised by a large number of
institutions and relationships that Anglo-Saxon liberals of the well-brought
up variety find intrinsically shocking.
Lambs lie down with lions in the supervisory boards of German companies and
this flirtation with corporatism extends through banks that own large slices
of companies, centralised wage bargaining between employers and big
sector-wide trade unions and employers' organisations that set training
goals. Where Anglo-Saxons expect conflict, Germans serve up a puzzling
degree of co-operation.
Goodhart points out that firms benefit from a relationship of trust with
their employees because they can invest in their knowledge and skills with
less fear that they will walk out of the door.
If Goodhart's analysis is to be faulted, it is that he does not lay enough
stress on another aspect of the German model which may be less to the liking
of the British left.
Post-war Germany has been fiercely committed to competition in product
markets, enforced by an admirably tough competition in law and by an
aggressive Bundescartelamt that makes the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
look as dangerous as an overfed tabbycat.
With some notable exceptions in declining industries such as coal, Germany
has also been thankfully immune from the belief that the government can
usefully intervene in industry.
Goodhart contends that Germany's style of capitalism will endure in spite of
a gradual breakdown of union influence and widening pay differentials, some
withdrawal of the banks from their position in corporate governance, a rise
in the influence of the equity market and a shift of much high-labour
content production outside Germany together with the growth of real German
multinationals. Within Germany, the relatively small service sector ought to
be able to grow rapidly to take up the slack.
But what of the lessons on this side of the Channel? Britain's economic
institutions have been travelling rapidly away from the Rhine model and
towards the US one over the past decade, but that may not continue to be the
case. Goodhart cites interesting evidence about the preferences of British
managers for a 'stakeholder' company suggesting UK attitudes may be more in
line with Germany than with the US.
Goodhart rightly warns against too glib an import of German institutions,
but he sets out three policy options that might nudge Britain in Germany's
direction. The first is encouragement to institutional investors, which own
more than 70 per cent of quoted Britain, to take a more active role in the
companies they own, as the German banks do.
The second is the introduction of supervisory boards with employee
representatives. The third is to boost the training and enterprise councils
 -now responsible for much of Britain's training effort - by making
corporate membership compulsory for companies above a certain size.
By the standards of recent years, these are radical proposals. But I doubt
that the relative performance of Britain and Germany over the next 10 years
will expunge them from the agenda. The Rhine model is not new. Its essential
features were in place under Bismarck. It has delivered Europe's most
enduring economic success for over a century and it is unlikely to stop now.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (10): Enigma of the Reichmanns
remains - Property / Vanessa Houlder finds no new insights in an account of
the O&amp;Y saga

<TEXT>
Too Big to Fail
by Walter Stewart McClelland &amp; Stewart, Pounds 15.95 335 pages
In essence, the story of Olympia &amp; York's rise and fall is an
all-too-familiar account of how an ambitious company can be brought to the
brink of bankruptcy by the reckless pursuit of growth. But it gains an extra
dimension from the enigmatic personality of the three Reichmann brothers who
founded, managed and owned the company.
The Reichmanns built up one of the world's largest property empires with a
style that set them apart from brasher, pushier developers. They won a name
for honesty, privacy, and discretion that matched their reputation for
innovation, farsightedness and daring.
But once O&amp;Y buckled under the burden of its Pounds 7bn debt in 1992, the
Reichmanns' name and reputation were tarnished. Frustrated creditors felt
they had been misled by the brothers once they discovered the true state of
their empire.
A disappointing aspect of Stewart's book is that he never assesses the
extent to which the Reichmanns' reputation for ethical business dealings was
deserved. Instead, he is sympathetic to the point of sycophancy. 'O&amp;Y are
wonderful managers, superior builders, and all-around worthwhile people,' he
says in the prologue.
Stewart's sympathy for the Reichmanns did not open doors. He admits that he
met 'an unbroken wall of brass' in attempts to talk to O&amp;Y and the Reichmann
family. The result is that the book contains little new material and largely
recounts publicly-available information.
Nonetheless, his outline of their rise and fall makes a remarkable story. It
begins with the brothers' early lives in Hungary, Austria and Morocco, where
their mother, Renee, was the Tangier agent of a committee devoted to
rescuing Jews trapped by the Nazis.
In the 1950s, the family moved to Canada, where Paul and Ralph Reichmann set
up the Olympia Floor and Wall Tile Company (Ontario) with capital of Dollars
50,000. After building a warehouse for the company, they successfully moved
into property development.
O&amp;Y's ambitions were not limited to property. In 1979, it bought Canada
Northwest Land, an oil and gas company; in 1981, O&amp;Y took control of
Abitibi-Price, then the world's biggest newspaper producer; four years
later, it bought a 60 per cent stake in Gulf Oil's Canadian subsidiary, then
the biggest corporate takeover in Canadian history; in 1986, it took control
of Hiram Walker, the drinks and resources group.
O&amp;Y's evolution into a major financial conglomerate was, Stewart suggests, a
step too far for a company still run as a small family firm dominated by
three men. But it was property, O&amp;Y's original area of expertise, that
proved its undoing.
In 1987 the Reichmanns poured Pounds 1.4bn into a pioneering development in
a remote part of east London, encouraged by generous tax breaks and with the
backing of Margaret Thatcher, then Britain's prime minister.
This proved disastrous. The Reichmanns struggled to attract tenants, in the
face of recession, to an area that was unfavourably perceived and poorly
served by public transport, amid an explosion of construction elsewhere in
London.
While Canary Wharf struggled, O&amp;Y sunk into deep trouble on the other side
of the Atlantic because of its exposure to the Campeau retail empire, which
met difficulties after an over-ambitious takeover of two of the US's biggest
department store groups. At the same time, other parts of the O&amp;Y empire,
such as Abitibi-Price and Gulf Canada absorbed large amounts of cash.
On May 14, O&amp;Y applied for bankruptcy protection. Following months of
wrangling a restructuring was agreed in Toronto in January 1993, that would
eventually dismantle much of the empire.
This adequate account of the story does not live up to its subtitle: Olympia
&amp; York: the story behind the headlines. Indeed, it often reads as a critique
of other writers' assessments of O&amp;Y.
Stewart's one-time career as a professor of journalism may explain his
pre-occupation with flaws in accounts written by his rivals, but in a book
so dependent on other people's research and marred by minor errors of its
own, it only serves to irritate.
Nonetheless, Stewart makes some cogent points when he blames the failure of
the O&amp;Y empire largely on the financial and political system. 'What happened
to O&amp;Y has less to do with the personalities of the Reichmanns . . . than it
has to do with the laws governing incorporation, taxation, banking and
bankruptcy.'
O&amp;Y's acquisitiveness was encouraged by Canada's tax laws; its
over-ambitious expansion was fuelled by credulous banks.
When it came to the crunch, the bankruptcy laws protected a company that was
deemed 'too big to fail'. The O&amp;Y debacle did severe damage to the company's
creditors, but it did not ruin the Reichmanns. Two days after the
restructuring of O&amp;Y was approved, Paul Reichmann was back in business with
plans to invest in North American commercial property.

What is Strategy and Does it Matter?
by Richard Whittington Routledge, Pounds 39 164 pages
There are 37 books in print with the title Strategic Management, according
to Richard Whittington in the introduction to this rather self-effacingly
titled little volume in the Routledge series in analytical management.
So who needs a 38th? The answer, of course, is all those who either lack the
time or the retentive capacity to cope with the other 37. Not that
Whittington's book relieves its readers of the burden of informing
themselves more widely, nor indeed does it claim to do so.
What it does seek to do is to map out the landscape of contemporary
approaches to strategy-making, and to provide a guided tour of that
landscape. Readers should then be in a position to decide which approach is
most appropriate to their own circumstances, and to know where to turn for
more detailed guidance.
In this aim it succeeds, at least in the opinion of the judging panel for
the Management Consultancies Association Business Book of the Year. It
carried off the first prize for the best business book of the year by a
British author aged under 45.
Whittington's framework consists of a 2x2 matrix (how else]) within which
any approach to strategy can be slotted. The axes of the matrix represent
the top-down (deliberate) or bottom-up (emergent) process used to arrive at
a strategy on the one hand and the profit-maximising or more broadly based
pluralistic objectives of the strategy on the other.
Within this matrix, four basic approaches are identified. The classical
approach, associated with renowned authorities such as Ansoff and Porter
adopts a deliberate process of rational analysis designed to maximise
long-term advantage. Evolutionists, on the other hand, eschew long-term
planning as largely irrelevant in today's fast-changing world. All that one
can do is to operate as efficiently as possible in today's conditions, and
take tomorrow as it comes. Natural selection will determine who survives and
who goes under.
Processualists such as Mintzberg and Hamel agree that long-range planning is
largely futile, and that organisations evolve through a process of trial and
error. However, this incremental approach is not necessarily just a tactical
one; it may be informed by an underlying 'strategic intent' which provides a
broad sense of direction and channels opportunism.
Finally, Whittington himself favours a systemic point of view, which
recognises that the objectives of an organisation can vary dramatically,
depending on the culture (national culture, in the main) within which it is
embedded.
He notes, for example, that Japanese companies target themselves on market
share and new product introductions whereas US companies are focused heavily
on return on investment and share price.
Having defined his terms (and the book is worth reading for this alone,
though some plain words would have helped) Whittington examines a number of
important elements of modern management - leadership, decision-making,
approaches to growth and organisational change.
He does this through the 'lens' of each of his four basic schools of
strategic thinking. The classical approach to decision-making, for example,
will rely heavily on detailed analysis, whereas the processualists believe
this creates a delusion that one is shaping the future.
The systemic school takes a more cynical view. If analysis is expected to
get the decision, do it; it not, don't. And not surprisingly Whittington
concludes that strategy, or rather the approach to strategy does matter, for
the whole economy as well as for individual enterprises.
He argues that the 'market-rational' paradigm adopted by the Anglo-Saxon
world is deficient, and that future success will require greater state
leadership and some interlocking of national and business strategies.
This sounds over-simplistic, and it is. But that does not detract from the
overall merit of the book, which is well-structured, short and energetically
written. It does, though, deal with some challenging material (the author is
an academic with Warwick Business School) and it is not an easy read.
However, it repays perseverance, and all those concerned with strategy
development, whether as consultants, business development executives or
general managers, should end up with an enriched understanding of what
strategy means for them and which approach is likely to deliver the goods.
This book won the first MCA Book Prize, sponsored by the Management
Consultancies Association, announced in late March.

under the age of 45 - can be obtained from Andrea Livingstone, MCA Book

Doing Business With China
Consultant Editor: Jonathan Reuvid Kogan Page, Pounds 75 120 pages
Everybody in business knows by now that there are huge opportunities in
China. The country's ambitious economic reforms have, in the past two years,
brought extraordinarily rapid economic growth and a deluge of foreign
investment. Even if there are setbacks along the way, the Chinese market is
one that companies increasingly will have to reckon with.
Its openness, however, does not mean that it is at all easy. Any dealings
with China, whether import/export or involving deeper co-operation, require
a combination of perseverance, flexibility and hard-won knowledge.
The effort seems to be worthwhile. Companies which have built up a presence
continue to want to expand.
The pay-back may take some time - although it need not always - but the
combination of a massive domestic market, which has rapidly growing demands
and expectations, and a cheap, bounteous, enthusiastic and educated labour
force, is compelling.
So, you've read all this before but still feel understandable trepidation
about making an exploratory trip. Doing Business With China  - to be
published on July 19 - is a laudable attempt to put all the things you need
to know into one practical (though large) volume. It is aimed at businesses
everywhere.
The book covers most of the issues that are likely to be of immediate
concern: trade practices and regulations; different types of venture allowed
and how they work; currency regulations; customs duties and their operation;
tax; accounting; employment issues; copyright; disputes resolution; quality
assurance.
These issues listed are covered in a straightforward and coherent manner,
mainly by the law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and
Mr Li Yong, a market research expert with the Centre for Market and Trade
Development, an official body in Beijing.
A few caveats. The economic and trade reforms are quite well described,
mostly by Chinese officials. But the book lacks a full overview from outside
of what still needs to be done to further economic reforms and to smooth the
path of foreign investors.
Some of the most politically difficult tasks remain to be tackled. A foreign
company needs at least to have a sense of them before embarking on a venture
with a company which may face radical restructuring as the 'iron rice bowl'
is broken.
And although the book is clearly designed as a business handbook that steers
clear of politics, it seems perverse not to provide an account of how the
political system and government work.
The 'socialist market economy' may not have much to do with socialism, but
China is still run by a totalitarian government and a large part of the
economy remains state-run. Many foreign joint ventures are with official
bodies.
Though the book has lists and statistics aplenty, it needs more maps and
more details about transport. But it does contain some useful tips about how
to conduct oneself in China, such as not insulting contacts by giving
presents bearing the image of a turtle.  This section is one of the most
useful, underlining the importance of building up personal contacts.
The authors would not pretend that you can learn everything about doing
business in China from a book. Contacts, investigation of the right partner,
patient negotiation are all vital. Each venture is different. Agreement of
deals is not the signal to relax. Each requires vigilance and, in the event
of disputes, the procedures for resolution - although they exist - are
hardly reliable. As the book points out, friendly negotiation is necessary.
The fact that the book is needed shows the shortcomings of China's legal
system, its macro-economic management, its bureaucratic control. But it also
underlines the extraordinary breadth and ambition of China's reformers who
are pushing ahead on so many fronts simultaneously. Doing Business in China
will need regular new editions to remain useful.

Creative Financial Accounting: Its Nature and Use
by Kamal Naser, Prentice Hall, Pounds 17.95, 250 pages
Twentieth Century Accounting Thinkers
Edited by John Edwards, Routledge, Pounds 50, 320 pages
For those looking for a primer on how to tweak numbers and boost assets or
profits, the hunt is over. Kamal Nasar, lecturer in accounting and finance
at Cardiff business school, has brought it all together.
In a series of chapters, Nasar highlights a good number of the techniques
used. The treatment of bad debts, circular transactions, capitalisation of
interest, valuation of intangibles, borrowing across year-ends, sale and
repurchase agreements, non-subsidiaries, foreign currency translation
methods - the list is endless.
Nor is all this new. He reminds us of the glorious days of differential
depreciation by British railway companies in the 19th century, the
manipulations of stock by US companies that led to the creation of the
securities acts in the 1930s, and the generous scope for secret reserves in
the inter-war years, triggering notorious court cases. He also provides some
recent examples, such as the famous Midland Bank treatment of third world
debt write-off as an extraordinary item.
In general, when the text moves from description to analysis it becomes
weaker. Nasar seems happier citing other's work in a detailed literature
review than developing original thought.
There is a glimmer of original research in a survey of auditors and company
directors towards the end. But it sits uneasily with the rest of the book
and does not deliver all it promises, although it suggests that nearly half
the auditors consider creative accounting a 'legitimate business tool' and
96 per cent argue that rules can never completely prevent the practice.
On books for the academic market, the epitome comes in Twentieth Century
Accounting Thinkers. In a surprisingly candid introduction, David Solomons
(himself featured in a chapter as one of the 'LSE triumvirate') argues
mischievously that there has not been much great accounting thinking taking
place of late, and that many of the best contributions have been neither by
academics nor accountants.
To an outsider, the contribution of Martti Saario to Finnish accounting
hardly looks of much importance beyond a pretty tight-knit Nordic fan club
gathering on dark winter nights.
A series of chapters on different characters all seem navel-gazing and
self-indulgent. They switch uneasily between a review of the subjects'
writings, personal recollections by the authors, and simplistic and trivial
biographical information, including which houses they lived in.
Nevertheless, for those willing to persevere, some interesting history is
tucked away. One of the more interesting stories is that of Edward Stamp. He
engaged in a fierce and influential debate with the president of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1969 on The Times
letters page over the need for tighter accounting standards after GEC's
merger with AEI.
But it is hardly inspiring to discover that he was prohibited by his
employer from publishing articles including one on LIFO because 'it might
upset one of the firm's clients who used LIFO'.
A similar tale concerns Kenneth MacNeal, whose 1939 article on accounts
manipulation at McKesson &amp; Robbins was commissioned by Fortune magazine and
then dropped because, he believed, of pressure from Price Waterhouse, the
company's auditor, and the American Institute of Accountants.
Stalwarts such as these two academics deserve a little recognition.

The Bedside Executive
Edited by James Charlton
Robert Hale, Pounds 7.99 120 pages
A book of more than 600 quotations from business mavericks, politicians,
economists, writers and leaders of industry sounds like rather heavy going.
But even a quick peek inside the covers of The Bedside Executive is
sufficient to dispel such concerns.
This pocket-sized volume, edited by James Charlton, is packed with wise,
witty and cynical gems - mostly from North America - on topics ranging from
wealth acquisition to achieving success and doing deals.
As Mr Charlton notes in his preface, the financial and business worlds are a
particularly rich field for quotes. But while many of the wittiest come from
acknowledged humorists such as Oscar Wilde or Will Rogers, others have been
penned by unlikely wordsmiths including Henry Ford and J. Paul Getty.
Inevitably profits, money and sound business practices loom large as a
theme. Lee Iacocca, Chrysler's former chairman, once said: 'Volume times
zero isn't too healthy,' and Warren Buffet, the legendary US takeover
specialist, set out his business rules thus: 'Rule number 1: Never lose
money. Rule number 2: Never forget rule number 1'.
PT Barnum, the man who brought the circus to town, observed that: 'Money is
a terrible master, but an excellent servant,' while actor Will Rogers
advised people to 'invest in inflation. It is the only thing going up.'
Comfort for those with large overdrafts comes from the Edwardian wit, Saki
(Hector Hugh Munro), who noted: 'I'm living so far beyond my income that we
might be said to be living apart.'
Underscoring the American domination of pithy business quotes, Getty chipped
in with the classic: 'If you can count your money, you don't have a billion
dollars,' and Nelson Bunker Hunt is credited with saying: 'People who know
how much they are worth aren't usually worth that much.'
Among the observations on particular business careers are the following:
Banking. 'Banking may be a career from which no man really recovers,' said
economist John Kenneth Galbraith, while Mark Twain complained: 'A banker is
a fellow who lends you his
umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins to
rain.'
Corporate finance. 'In the takeover business, if you want a friend, you buy
a dog,' according to Carl Icahn, the Wall Street financier.
Media. 'Advertising is 85 per cent confusion and 15 per cent commission,'
said American comedian Fred Allen.
Stockbroking. 'Buy when everyone is selling. And hold until everyone is
buying,' advised J. Paul Getty, while stockbroker Raymond De Voe adapted an
old axiom: 'Fools rush in where angels fear to trade.'
Economists. 'An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the
incomprehensible,' said publisher Alfred A. Knopf while George Bernard Shaw
quipped: 'If all economists were laid end to end, they'd never reach a
conclusion.' Herbert Hoover pleaded: 'Please find me a one-armed economist
so we will not always hear, 'On the other hand . . .' '
On the state of the economy, another US President, Harry S. Truman, said:
'It's a recession when your neighbour loses his job; its a depression when
you lose yours.'
Among the relatively sparse quotes from women, tennis star Martina
Navratilova observed that: 'Whoever said, 'it's not whether you win or lose
that counts,' probably lost,' while Margaret Thatcher chipped in with: 'If
you want anything said, ask a man. If you want anything done, ask a woman.'
Some quotations sum up their creators better than any biographical
narrative. For example Robert Maxwell, the disgraced tycoon, said: 'When I
see a belt, I cannot resist hitting below it.' Others seem strangely
prophetic such as Richard Nixon who said: 'A man is not finished when he is
defeated. He is finished when he quits.'
This is a book to dip into rather than attempt to read cover-to-cover. It is
not, nor does it pretend to be, an encyclopaedic work, although it provides
plenty of ideas for the after-dinner speaker.
Instead, as the editor notes, 'the real test of a book of quotations like
this is enjoyment, and to that end I hope this satisfies'. It does.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (5): A thin smile only - Humour
/ While it sounds promising, Lucy Kellaway finds a new anthology of European
jokes disappointing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you heard this one? An anthology of European jokes
Europublic, Pounds 3.95 56 pages
Heaven is where the police are British, the chefs French, the mechanics
German, the lovers Italian and it is all organised by the Swiss. Hell is
where the police are German, the chefs British, the mechanics French, the
lovers Swiss and it is all organised by the Italians.
This the first joke in a book that promises to fill a gaping hole in the
market. Think of all those people who give European speeches every year, and
think of their desperation to find appropriate jokes to fill them with. This
anthology of European jokes should be an answer to their prayers.
Even for those who do not have speeches to write, the anthology sounds
promising - cracks about other nation- alities are about the funniest around
 -infinitely better than those other two hack- neyed themes: the mother-in-
law and the wife.
It is therefore both a shame and a puzzle that barely one of the jokes in
this slim volume brings more than the thinnest smile to the lips. After the
first joke, which is moderately amusing if a little aged and no longer
accurate, they fall increasingly flat.
The problem is that the book comes from the wrong stable. Europublic, the
organisation behind it, is more federally minded than Jacques Delors
himself, and is therefore not prepared to publish jokes that might offend or
ridicule any partic- ular country. This is fatal, as the whole point about
nat- ionality jokes is that they are offensive - at least to anyone touchy
enough to be offended by them. The most risque jokes in the collection
gently suggest that another nation might be just a tiny bit silly.
Funnier than some of the cracks is the commentary that goes with them. Take
this one: three prisoners of war are to be tortured to make them talk. The
French- man talks on the first day. The Englishman talks after a week. The
Italian never talks. When finally released, he is questioned about his
bravery. 'But 'ow could I talk with my hands tied behind my back?' he
replies. The joke is acceptable enough, but the commentary is hilarious.
'Think about it a bit, and you realise that, far from making fun of the
Italians, these jokes ack- nowledge that Italians are, or at least may be,
cleverer than the rest of us,' it says.
Again and again, jokes are excused by the editors on the grounds that the
victims themselves think they are funny, or because it is possible to swap
the names of the countries around to use them against a different
nationality.
There is some unexpected information to be gleaned from the book. The
Spanish, we are told, are the funniest nation of all, and have you rolling
in the aisles without even trying to be amusing. To prove it we are given
this example of their witty folk wisdom: 'If your wife tells you to throw
yourself out of the window, pray God it's a low one'. One can only reflect
that humour is a subjective thing.
Even more puzzling is the extraordinary revelation about Swedes. A Swede, a
Norwegian and a Dane are caught in a snowstorm, so the joke goes. They find
a cave to shelter in but are put off by the stench from a half-dead goat.
The Nor- wegian goes in first but comes out after five minutes asphyxiated
by the smell. Then the Dane goes in. After 10 minutes he crawls out and
expires. Finally the Swede goes in and, 15 minutes later . . . the goat
comes out.
It is not clear what this joke means. Could it be that the Swede was even
smellier than the goat? But that does not tally with one's imp- ression of
Scandinavians, and if true, would surely have been vetoed by the
collection's even-handed editors.
The anthology, though a disappointment, is not with- out its uses. Each joke
is in English, Dutch, French and German, which not only offers a painless
way of improving colloquial use of those languages, but might come in handy
for those speeches.
Take the tame joke about the Englishman who returns from a holiday in France
saying that he had no prob- lem with the language but the French did. This
might go down quite well told to a French audience by a Brit who could say
the joke in perfect French memorised from the book.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (3): Leo, the tea shop's other
trade - UK Computer Business / Alan Cane recalls a preposterous episode in
Britain's postwar industrial history

Leo: The First Business Computer
By Peter J. Bird Hasler Publishing, Pounds 15.95 272 pages
In 1947, the year before the transistor was invented, Britain's largest
catering chain decided to go into the computer business. Not satisfied with
building machines for its own use, in 1954 J. Lyons &amp; Company set up a
subsidiary, Leo Computers, to sell them to others. It remained in the
business for 17 years, eventually disposing of its interests in Leo
Computers to English Electric for Pounds 1.9m. Overall losses on the venture
were just over Pounds 100,000.
These bald facts do little justice to one of the most exciting, inventive
and, it has to be said, preposterous, episodes in postwar British industrial
history.
The Journal of the Office Management Association for 1957, quoted in Leo,
makes the argument: 'A potential computer user needs to have some confidence
in his own judgement if he is to buy his computer from a tea shop.'
Point taken: but what a tea shop] 'Joe' Lyons with its hundreds of shops and
Corner Houses, 'nippies' (waitresses) and packet tea, was a national
institution. It was tightly run with an intuitive understanding of the
importance of margins in a volume business. 'Only a farthing profit was made
on each of the 150m meals sold annually from all the teashops,' Peter Bird
notes.
His book is the first detailed account of the Leo (Lyons Electronic Office)
adventure. The machines themselves - Leo I, II and III - are now footnotes
in the history of early computers. But Leo makes an important point that has
been neglected time and again in the development of the computer industry:
successful automation depends on an understanding of what the machine can be
expected to achieve, coupled with detailed planning and documentation. If
other computer users had learned what Lyons management already knew, there
would have been fewer computer disasters over the past 40 years.
Lyons was aided here by its already meticulous office methods; but it also
employed some remarkable individuals during the Leo project, many of whom
were to go on to become mainstays of the UK computing establishment.
The project had its origin in a visit to the US in 1947 by Oliver
Standingford and 'TRT' Thompson, the senior Lyons executives responsible for
office procedures. They were impressed by early American computers and
learned that an advanced system, Edsac, already under construction at
Cambridge University, could be used as a model. 'The possible saving from
such a machine should be at least Pounds 50,000 a year,' they wrote, urging
that Lyons should build its own. The capital cost would be about Pounds
100,000.
The Lyons Board accepted the proposal in what Bird describes as 'in
retrospect, an extremely casual, but far-sighted, decision for a catering
and food manufacturing organisation to have taken during this difficult
postwar period'.
Compared with today's manufacturing costs - the price of building and
equipping a modern semiconductor fabrication plant is about Dollars 1bn  -
Lyons' initial budgetting seems comic: Pounds 140 for an oscilloscope,
Pounds 14 for benches and stools, Pounds 15 for small tools. Much of
Britain's early efforts in computing were marked by a similar grand
amateurism. The metal casing for one early computer was beaten by Mulliner
Park Ward, the Roll-Royce coach builder. Electronic consoles for Leo were at
one stage fabricated by Camper Nicholson, the yacht builder.
Ingenuity amounting at time to sheer brilliance, especially in software,
overcame the obstacles. The Leos worked and worked remarkably well. The Post
Office used them for billing until 1980 when they were replaced by ICL
mainframes, which incidentally, continued to run Leo software.
As the industry matured, the costs of staying in contention rose and Leo
Computers, which had never made money for Lyons, became too great a burden.
It was merged with English Electric and then vanished into the digital
melting pot which became ICL, now owned by Fujitsu of Japan.
Bird, director of Lyons Information Systems for 10 years, has carried out
extensive research in putting Leo together. But he is clearly more
fascinated by the technology than the personalities, which detracts from
what should read as a rattling good business tale. Characters such as John
Simmonds, Thompson and David Caminer are sketched in as stereotypes, rather
than as flesh-and-blood creatures dealing with the most complex machine the
human mind has ever created.
Bird's role as historian, however, is invaluable in placing Leo in context.
It is a welcome counter to the parade of US-authored studies which would
have you believe that nothing of note in computing happened outside North
America.

FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (4):'Look at the market' -
Publishing / Pauline Goodwin of Kogan Page talks to Tim Dickson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULINE GOODWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt the author who failed to find a publisher for Memoirs of a
Microwave Salesman is bitterly disappointed. But if it's any comfort to him,
he is not alone. His is one of hundreds of unsolicited manuscripts rejected
each year by Kogan Page publishing director Pauline Goodwin.
Goodwin's judgment - and that of other senior editors like her - matters a
lot these days in the increasingly fierce battle between UK publishers for
saleable business book titles. The adverse economic climate has dented
everyone's growth, but Kogan Page also faces growing competition from the
likes of Pitman and Butterworth Heinemann for the affordable, jargon-free
practical guides which have been the hallmark of its success.
Even so, the company, founded in 1967 by ex-Cornmarket director Philip
Kogan, is likely to achieve an impressive 20 per cent increase in turnover
for the 12 months to end-June. It can also claim to have avoided
redundancies during the recent recession.
Sitting in her office off the Pentonville Road, North London, Goodwin
appears much more down to earth than the archetypal books editor. She
observes that publishers 'are notorious for using intuition and following
their nose' but insists that commercial discipline is equally indispensable.
'I look at the market and ask myself will it sell? You have to keep up with
current business trends, know what is happening in the economy generally
and, in our part of the market particularly, plug in to management
thinking.'
Timing and packaging, though, can be decisive. Goodwin cites the example of
Kogan Page's highly successful 1992: Strategies for the Single Market, which
started off as a book on international marketing but was subsequently
'tweaked' to give it a full '1992' flavour (including a price tag of Pounds
19.92). The title sold 27,000 copies in hardback, was selected for business
school reading lists, and translated into several other languages.
Goodwin rejects most of the 1,000 or so unsolicited manuscripts sent to her
office each year; those she likes are discussed at the fortnightly meetings
of Kogan Page's publishing committee (which also comprises Philip Kogan, the
firm's senior editors, representatives of the sales and marketing team, and
a rights specialist). Each proposal before the committee is accompanied by a
detailed profit and loss forecast and marketing assessment.
She denies suggestions that there has been a reaction against the flood of
business books. 'I think there may be a reaction against personalities,
against gurus. But we tend to avoid the big names who demand big advances
and lots of personal attention.'
Kogan Page has published about 270 titles in the past year - of which
between a quarter and a third are new editions. Business and educational
subjects dominate the list, but the total includes books published by its
small environmental subsidiary, Earthscan.
Authors, observes Goodwin, are often in it mainly for the personal PR. Ideas
are often generated with the help of outside experts, who advise on business
trends and content. Even so, one of her main dilemmas is 'keeping the
schedule intact'. Many authors are in full-time employment and have
difficulty in finding time to write. 'If one of them gets a big contract the
first thing that will go out of the window is the book deadline,' she says.
One of the company's strengths is its list of co-publishers, including such
organisations as the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and the
Confederation of British Industry.

The History of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community.
Supranationality in Operation
by Dirk Spierenburg and Raymond Poidevin
Weidenfeld and Nicolson, Pounds 70 720 pages
The nine members of the High Authority of the European Coal, Iron and Steel
Community (ECSC) first met in 1952 in remote Luxembourg City. The site was
provisional and the governments never agreed where it should be permanently
located. The members were mostly unknown even in their own countries. Yet in
the bible of European unity this has become Genesis.
Their president, Jean Monnet, had become the prophet of European union and
they had each sworn an oath to administer the Community independently of all
influence from their national governments. How well they did so is the
subject of this officially supported study by the European Commission
written by a respected French diplomatic historian and a Dutch official who
was the youngest and probably the most able member of the High Authority.
The High Authority's work set the later form for Brussels. It was to
administer the letter of a treaty, in this case the 1952 Treaty of Paris,
and a Court of Justice was to interpret each article to make sure it did
this and no more.
A Council of Ministers was intended to keep all important decisions in the
hands of national governments. A parliament had little to do. And Monnet
within two months had established one of the guiding principles of the
future Euro-bureaucracy: it should be overpaid. The less it had to do, the
more it grew. By the early 1960s, when all power had moved to Brussels, it
had expanded to more than 1,000 people.
The US, which wanted European unity, allowed the High Authority the same
pomp and circumstance as a national government when its members visited
Washington. There was even an American loan. But where it mattered, in Paris
and in Bonn, these supposedly independent men had to consult at every turn
and - usually after token dissent - to obey.
The High Authority was one point in a triangle of power of which the other
two were business and government. The Treaty, like government at the time,
was interventionist. International control over the German steel industry
was central to the Allies' settlement with the German Federal Republic.
Expansion of the steel industry was deemed too important to to be left in
private hands. In Britain and France coal was nationalised. To manage a
common market in those circumstances could only mean regulating the market
in an equitable compromise of national interests. Results were mixed.
Tariffs on coal and most steel products went at the start of 1953. Through
railway freight rates, instead of the previous discriminatory charges by
national railway systems, came soon afterwards.
The price of this triumphant public symbolism was:
carefully regulated, although standardised, steel prices;
the survival of regional pricing for coal;
massive subsidisation of Belgium's moribund coalfields;
exclusion from the regulated market for Italy's developing steel industry -
tiny but helped by this to become a future giant; the management of the
equalisation fund for steel scrap; and
the resigned acceptance of the cartels which, according to the language of
the Treaty, the High Authority was supposed to eliminate.
The Ruhr coal producers' sales cartel survived untroubled. France aided and
abetted this, so that it could maintain its own national coal importing
cartel. The German steel firms, broken up into smaller units by the Western
Allies as a departing present to the Community, reassembled themselves at
the low cost of answering a few legal questions from Luxembourg. The steel
export cartel proclaimed itself before the Treaty was ratified and
shouldered the High Authority aside.
In 1958, when the bottom dropped out of the coal market, the High Authority
fell into impotence as Germans tried to keep up prices to save their coal
mines and Dutch and Italians grabbed at cheap US coal. Who could regulate an
energy market by only having the powers to regulate coal? For the builders
of the new Europe this disaster did not matter; the Treaty of Rome had been
ratified and a common market of an altogether grander scope was on its way.
On balance the High Authority did not do so badly. Where it concentrated on
doing what all national governments were doing at the same time, improving
social provision, it was allowed almost a free hand and left behind an
honourable record of better housing for workers, retraining schemes,
re-adaptation grants for unemployed and displaced miners and the beginnings
of a system of easier international labour mobility in western Europe.
This is the book to read for those who really want to know about the EU,
even though it tells only of its childhood. No child was more necessary. But
no child was more father to the man, and like most histories of childhood
this is one of unrealistic and thwarted ambitions, lamentable moral
compromises and excessive parental control.

Dictionary of Twentieth Century British Business Leaders
By David Jeremy and Geoffrey Tweedale
Bowker-Saur, Pounds 35 250 pages
British culture, we are sometimes told, still has a snobbish distaste for
business and commerce. Forget the supposed transformations of the Thatcher
years: look at an establishment bible such as Who's Who - jam-packed with
obscure bureaucrats, academics and politicians, and scarcely an entrepreneur
among them.
As a general proposition, this may be getting out of date. But there is
certainly enough of the old bias left to justify a book such as the
Dictionary of Twentieth Century Business Leaders, which seeks to encapsulate
the lives and achievements of about 750 tycoons in the space of 250 pages.
The big question about any such publication, of course, is who it includes
and who it leaves out. For the reviewer, this is bound to bring on what
might be called 'the anthology syndrome' - that is, the urge to pick through
the book in search of favourites, and quarrel with the results. So here
goes.
In the media world, Cecil King of the Mirror gets in, as does Lord Hartwell
of the Telegraph: but not the great white shark, Rupert Murdoch, arguably
the most powerful media mogul of the century.
Among the ranks of the crooked, Robert Maxwell has a distinguished mention.
But one looks in vain for his kindred spirit, the financier and MP Horatio
Bottomley (twice bankrupt, twice acquitted of fraud and finally jailed in
the 1920s).
Some of the inclusions seem positively quirky: John Hyde Christie
(1836-1926), founder of the long-defunct Scottish dye firm, the United
Turkey Red Company, or the coal-owner James Arthur Joicey (1880-1940), whose
only obvious claim to fame is the fact that he was found dead in the grounds
of his castle after a rabbit shoot.
Contrast these with some of the more stark omissions, such as Jules Thorn
(1899-1980), founder of the Thorn electrical business, or Lord Keith (1916-)
who, besides being chairman of Rolls-Royce and Hill Samuel, managed the
remarkable feat of firing the chairmen of both STC and Beecham in the space
of three months in 1985.
But the book has the odd fascination of its kind. I found myself browsing
through the entries under the letter S, and counting how many I had heard
of. The answer was fewer than half: but I consoled myself with the
reflection that of the remainder, all but six were born in the last century,
and would have retired before I left school.
The book is thus largely historical in tone. This raises the question of how
illuminating that history proves. It is diverting to read of John Percival
Savage (1895-1970), who ran Boots in the 1950s: his reign, say the authors,
'proved to be an interregnum between more dynamic leaders. Uneasy in
command, his insecurity induced him to shout and swear at subordinates who
despised or feared him'.
But if the dictionary is imperfect, it is nevertheless a worthwhile addition
to the sum of knowledge. Who's Who, for instance, contains 37 people called
Matthews. It leaves out the one best known to the British public, the turkey
breeder Bernard Matthews.
Who's Who does, however, include Lord Matthews, late of Trafalgar House.
Other business peers it includes are Lord Stevens of Express Newspapers and
Lord Hollick of MAI. None of these is in the Dictionary of Twentieth Century
British Business Leaders, but Bernard Matthews is.
From an establishment viewpoint, this might seem perverse. But in a sneaking
anti-establishment way, one gets the point.

FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US buying of Wellcome continued yesterday and pushed the shares up 23 at
best. Dealers said Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, had been picking
up American Depositary Receipts, but the shares came off their highs after
US rival Salomon Brothers cut its forecasts for the sector.
Salomon said worldwide health care cuts had led to price competition between
drug firms and it expected slower sales growth and lower gross margins.
It believes Wellcome's profits will grow by only 7 per cent over the next
three years, compared with a previous estimate of 11 per cent. The shares
ended 9 higher at 611p.
Elsewhere, Glaxo, which Salomon sees growing by only one per cent over the
same period, fell from a high of 549p to close 3 up at 543p. SmithKline
Beecham 'A' was ahead 4 at 400p, after touching 403p.
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca rose 10 to 712p after Goldman Sachs recommended
the stock but shaved forecasts. The US investment bank said the stock
represented good value in the drugs sector as it offered low risk and would
soon see the benefits of its research and development pipeline feeding
through.
However, the house trimmed its 1994 profits forecasts by Pounds 25m to
Pounds 765m, reflecting the pressure on drug margins, weakness in
agrochemicals and increased interest charges.
Shares in drinks groups Allied-Lyons and Grand Metropolitan moved in
separate directions as the sector analysts from NatWest Securities
recommended a switch from one to the other.
Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest said he had taken heart from an analysts' visit,
which finished yesterday, to GrandMet's Pillsbury food operations in the US.
He added that the company's shares had underperformed Allied by 20 per cent
over the past quarter. Allied fell 6 to 549p while GrandMet added 13 1/2 at
393 1/2 p.
Guinness was restrained by news of import controls in South America. The
shares declined 7 to 436p.
Conglomerate Hanson climbed 5 1/2 to 243 1/2 p after Japanese securities
house Yamaichi reiterated its buy recommendation.
Job shifts hit chemicals group BOC at the expense of Tiphook, the transport
rental group. BOC fell 10 to 683p on news that Mr Ian Clubb, the company's
finance director, had resigned. Tiphook was 8 per cent ahead at one stage
and closed a net 2 better at 51p on news that Mr Clubb was joining as
chairman designate.
Engineering group GKN gave up a further 15 to 546p. One analyst attributed
the decline to selling brought about by the recent erosion of the yield
premium.
Confidence that Wassall's Pounds 92.2m rights issue, which closes today,
will be a success helped the stock add 3 at 276p.

FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The performances of Enterprise Oil and Lasmo shares continued to indicate
that, as the bid moves into its closing stage, the market believes that
Lasmo will escape the clutches of Enterprise. That view was emphasised by
news that three leading stockbroking firms, Nomura, UBS and Smith New Court,
all independent of the bid battle, had advised clients to reject the
Enterprise offer.
Enterprise moved ahead 8 to 408p on turnover of 864,000 shares, while Lasmo
held steady at 141p, still well below the bid value of around 170p a share.
Turnover in Lasmo was a surprisingly high 6.3m, with a number of UK
institutions said to have moved to buy the stock on the basis that it held
long term attractions.
It was pointed out by dealers that the buying of Lasmo had been carried out
for account settlement and not for cash, indicating long term investment. It
was said that the buying of Lasmo could have represented a 'cheap' way into
Enterprise, in the event of it winning the bid battle.
Marketmakers are now bracing themselves for a possible Enterprise raid for
Lasmo shares, a move which is expected to take place from Thursday onwards,
if Enterprise is seen to be within sight of victory.
'If there is no market raid, then the chances of Enterprise winning look
pretty slim,' said one trader, who added that the market was also preparing
for a sharp slide in the Enterprise share price if it wins control of Lasmo.
The bid battle is thought to hinge on Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management, which
speaks for more than 16 per cent of Lasmo stock.

FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs up on price hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional electricity (recs) stocks raced ahead as the market responded
to hints that the forthcoming pricing review by Offer, the industry
regulator, will be much less severe than expected.
The recs have sharply underperformed the market this year as investors have
unloaded shares after leaks that the regulator was seeking to impose across
the board price cuts of 25 to 30 per cent, plus annual price cuts of RPI
minus 4 per cent for the next five years.
But stories emerged yesterday that Offer had notified the recs by fax with
revised proposals for the distribution review, indicating immediate price
reductions of 20 per cent with subsequent annual price cuts of RPI minus 3
per cent.
Analysts and specialists said the market had shown its appreciation of the
regulator's latest stance which, they said, offered good news for consumers
and investors.
Mr Douglas Falconer, utilities specialist at Yamaichi, the Japanese-owned
securities house, said the indications were that the forthcoming review 'is
not looking as tough for the recs as had been expected; with the results
season to date going as well as it has, the sector should continue to
outperform'.
At Smith New Court, Mr Kevin Lapwood said he felt confident that the recs
could achieve 'real dividend growth of 5 per cent over the next five years'.
Midlands Electricity led the sector higher yesterday, finishing 23 ahead at
575p, after the group announced a 16 per cent increase in the dividend
total, well up with sector rises to date. London put on the same amount to
562p, as did Manweb, 663p, and Northern, 647p.

FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed weakness in bonds took the shine off a tentative recovery in stock
index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening on the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,922 was
at a discount to cash. However, a continuation of bear closing of short
positions first seen towards Monday's close helped the contract advance
steadily.
That early strength faltered briefly following the release of Treasury
economic forecasts. But confident predictions on UK inflation helped to
steady nerves and boosted gilts, helping September advance to 2,939, the
peak of the day.
However, the mood in the sector was changed by the release of poor US
economic data. The subsequent retreat in US bonds and on Wall Street spread
to London, halting the advance of the contract.
September closed at 2,911, at parity with the cash market but at a 13-point
discount to its fair value premium to cash. Volume was 15,086 lots.
In traded options, a big trade in Lasmo was the most significant feature.
There was a seller of some 2,000 of the 154 calls at 3.5p. Total volume in
the stock option was 2,756 contracts and volume in the sector as a whole was
a poor 24,862, of which 8,408 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,905 in the
Euro FT-SE option.

FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gains cut back as currency worries
resurface - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A continuation of the technical rally in the UK stock market was reined in
towards the close of trading yesterday by weakness in US bonds and equities.
The gain in the FT-SE 100-share Index was halved in the second half of the
session, and the closing minutes of dealing saw the futures contract on the
index fall to a discount against the cash market.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,909 for a net gain of 9.1 points
after an erratic day's trading. With the US dollar holding steady overnight
above the Y100 figure, UK equities opened sharply higher, the Footsie adding
27 points despite a somewhat cautious opening in stock index futures.
The Footsie gain was cut back very quickly to only 6.5 points as traders
waited for the announcement of the latest UK Treasury economic forecasts.
Share prices responded well to the upgrading of official gdp growth
forecasts for this year to 2.75 per cent, coupled with a prediction by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, that domestic inflation
would remain subdued at 2.5 per cent for the next two years.
Backed up by at least two sizeable trading programmes, the Footsie moved
upwards again, re-establishing a net gain of more than 20 points. But
confidence began to falter when US bonds opened lower on news of a 1.1 per
cent gain in US import prices in the latest month, together with a strong
consumer confidence index. The US currency came under renewed pressure,
raising all the market's fears that the Federal Reserve might have to push
US interest rates higher.
UK stocks came off the top quite quickly as British government bonds
extended earlier losses, the Dow Average fell 30 points and the US dollar
dipped below Y100.
London market traders said that volatility in share prices and increased
trading reflected some hectic position squaring ahead of the end of the
second trading quarter of 1994 which closes on Thursday. Some fund managers
are believed to prefer to show high cash balances at the end of the quarter.
Traders also pointed out that on Monday, when the market turned in a very
volatile performance, genuine retail or customer business was worth a mere
Pounds 624.2m, one of the lowest daily totals this year.
Trading volume, as measured by the catch-all Seaq-recorded total increased
sharply yesterday, with the 729.3m share total nearly double Monday's
figure. This bore out evidence on the trading screens of large programme
trades, which in turn prompted arbitraging between cash and futures markets.
Around 62 per cent of yesterday's business was in non-Footsie 100 stocks.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, largely unrelated to futures trading, gained 20.8
to 3,384.2.
There was some disappointment that London had failed to follow other
European bourses in holding steady yesterday afternoon, in spite of the
weakness in New York markets. The favourable news on UK economic growth and
inflation clearly pleased equities, before their vulnerability to
developments in foreign exchange markets made their impact.
UK markets had little time yesterday afternoon to make a considered response
to the signs of renewed pressure on the dollar and equity traders will be
watching New York currency trading closely for clues to the likely mood of
the London markets when they open for business this morning.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hit by lower bonds and
weak Dollars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stock markets turned sour yesterday, retreating in the face of dropping
bond prices and fresh instability in the value of the dollar, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished a volatile session only
15.86 lower at 3,669.64 after pulling back from a 45-point fall in the final
hours. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.23 at 446.08, but declining
issues on the Big Board outscored advances by nearly a two-to-one margin.
Volume was a moderate 268m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 2.78 at 422.67,
but the Nasdaq composite held up better, dipping just 0.63 to 702.05.
At the opening, the bearish tone had little to do with the dollar. The US
currency was holding fairly steady against the yen and the D-Mark, allowing
equity investors to focus on developments elsewhere.
To the regret of the bulls, bonds caught the most attention. The Treasury
market, putting aside currency concerns, was disturbed instead by two signs
that the economy was not cooling in response to a tighter monetary policy.
In the first, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes had risen by
4.2 per cent, rebounding crisply from an April decline. In the second, the
Conference Board said consumer confidence was much higher than economists
had expected.
Inflationary fears, which had been suppressed briefly during the recent
currency crisis, resurfaced with the release of the data. With the Federal
Reserve's policy-making arm scheduled to meet next week, the timing of its
next move to lift rates again began to cast a shadow over the market's
thinking.
The effect was to drive down share prices across the board in early trading.
But the damage grew more pronounced near midday, when the dollar again began
to flirt with the Y100 level. The blue chip Dow index widened its loss, led
by stocks which were most vulnerable to a fifth Fed strike on interest
rates. Later, the market attempted to rally but there was too much ground to
retrace.
Caterpillar slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 104 1/8 as its share price
continued to be buffeted by the implications of strike action by production
workers.
Alcoa shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 1/8 and General Motors Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 50 7/8 .
Financial issues, which moved in parallel with rising bond prices on Monday,
again mirrored the trend in Treasuries. JP Morgan shed Dollars 1 to Dollars
62 1/2 , First Chicago gave back Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 and Wells
Fargo was off Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 154.
Shares in Corning were marked up 6 per cent, or Dollars 1 7/8 , to Dollars
33 1/8 . The glass maker's second-quarter net income of 54 cents a share
beat the consensus forecast by 3 cents.
With technology stocks stable, the Nasdaq was able to outperform the other
leading indices. One of its best-performing issues was St Jude Medical, a
leading supplier of artificial heart valves. The stock jumped Dollars 2 1/4
to Dollars 30 3/4 on news that the company had agreed to acquire the
cardiac-pacing device businesses of Siemens for Dollars 500m.
Canada
Toronto recovered from sharp losses seen earlier in the session to end just
slightly easier after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index was off a net 6.8
points at 3,996.8. Falls led rises by 401 to 317 and volume was 52.9m
shares.
Transportation and gold stocks posted the day's largest falls of 1.97 and
1.28 per cent respectively, but the banking sector rose 1.44 per cent.
Brazil
Sao Paulo closed 5.7 per cent higher in local currency terms after investors
followed through on Monday's 8.4 per cent gain. The Bovespa index rose 1,914
to 35,635
Local investors were showing confidence over the July 1 arrival of Brazil's
new currency, the real. However, trading was thin, with foreign investors
still concerned about the prospects for Brazil's forthcoming elections.
Venezuela
Caracas fell sharply following President Rafael Caldera's announcement of
foreign exchange and price controls, with the Merinvest composite index down
8.62, or 6 per cent, to 137.08.
Volume was low at about 2.6m shares, mainly because foreign investors were
barred from trading until the new currency exchange system comes into effect
next Monday. Electricidad de Caracas fell 29.30 bolivars to 335.75 bolivars.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg saw some recovery from its recent heavy losses in mostly slow
trade, although many investors continued to hold back, still worried about
uncertainties in other equity markets.
The overall index finished 34 better at 5,487, and industrials picked up 72
to 6,359 after Monday's 190-point fall. Gold shares ended a net 6 lower at
2,084, bargain hunters having provided late support after the sector saw
some earlier pressure following bullion's overnight losses.
De Beers and Anglos pared early gains to end only mildly better, each adding
25 cents at R109.50 and R230.25 respectively. SAB posted a strong R3
recovery to R89 and Remgro finished unchanged for the second consecutive day
at R26. Gencor firmed 35 cents to R10.35 and Richemont rose 85 cents to
R39.85.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo rebounds by 1.7
per cent on bargain hunting
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong resistance to any further appreciation in the yen against the US
dollar encouraged investors, and the Nikkei 225 average rebounded by 1.7 per
cent on bargain hunting and arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The index gained 338.27 at 20,639.23 after an opening low of 20,356.27 and a
day's high of 20,732.55 in the after-noon on heavy index-linked buying from
newly established investment trusts, and purchases from domestic financial
institutions.
A recovery in high-technology issues, which had been severely upset by the
strength in the yen, also supported equities. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 22.46 to 1,672.24, while the Nikkei 300 put on 3.77 at
304.00. Advances led declines by 953 to 115, with 112 issues unchanged.
Volume totalled 380m shares, against 362m. Some domestic investors remained
cautious over the currency movements, although domestic institutions and
investment trusts supported activity. In London, later, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index moved up 2.73 to 1,361.35.
Traders said share prices were underpinned by buying orders below the Nikkei
20,000 mark. Domestic institutions, including life insurers, have indicated
that they would be buyers if the index fell through that level.
Reports of rapid growth on next-generation portable telephone systems
spurred activity in high technology-linked shares. Ushio climbed Y60 to
Y1,100 and DDI, a long distance telephone operator, jumped Y500,000 to
Y9.2m, the highest level since its listing in September last year.
Other high-technology recoveries included Fujitsu, which improved Y20 to
Y1,100, and Oki Electric, Y26 better at Y786. Large-capital stocks, which
also suffered selling on Monday, were firmer. Nippon Steel rose Y2 to Y353
and Mitsubishi Heavy Y3 to Y790.
Banks rose on arbitrage linked buying. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank moved ahead Y40
to Y2,000 and Bank of Tokyo added Y50 at Y1,600. Brokers were also stronger,
with Nomura Securities up Y20 to Y2,430.
Hitachi slipped Y10 to Y1,020 on profit-taking, while Honda Motor also drew
selling, losing Y20 at Y1,820.

and Sumitomo Metal Mining dipped Y8 to Y977.
In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 328.39 to 23,102.95 in volume of 13.8m

Roundup
The Pacific Rim was mixed, with worries about the outlook for US interest
rates and the currency proving an inhibition.
HONG KONG regained a measure of confidence, although turnover dipped to
HKDollars 2.6bn from Monday's HKDollars 2.9bn. The Hang Seng index finished
29.01 higher at 8,673.49, but well off the day's best of 8,777.58.
Finance issues were mixed. HSBC Holdings gained HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 83
while Hang Seng Bank shed 50 cents to HKDollars 49.
Property shares continued to ease, still hurt by worries that their earnings
would be eroded by government moves to curb the soaring residential property
market. New World Development declined 20 cents to HKDollars 21.30 and
Hongkong Land 30 cents to HKDollars 19.20.
SYDNEY recovered some of Monday's loss, although brokers reported that the
market lacked direction. The All Ordinaries index put on 17.00 at 1,974.4,
having moved between a session's high of 1,981.4 and low of 1,956.7.
Turnover came to ADollars 587.5m.
Among the blue chips, News Corp rose 16 cents to ADollars 8.44 and CRA
gained 12 cents at ADollars 18.08. BHP firmed 6 cents to ADollars 18.22.
Foster's Brewing, up 1 cent at ADollars 1.01, topped volume in the
industrial sector with 8.45m shares changing hands.
SINGAPORE closed higher after bargain hunters targeted selective index
stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index climbed 18.89 to 2,227.60. The
rise in the key index was mainly due to Keppel and Singapore Press Holdings,
up 30 cents apiece to SDollars 10.60 and SDollars 15.40 respectively.
KUALA LUMPUR posted small gains at the close, although trading was
restrained by worries about the outlook for US interest rates. The composite
index edged forward 3.40 to 1,006.92.
BANGKOK registered its seventh consecutive loss as afternoon profit-taking
wiped out gains seen earlier in the day. The SET index slipped 1.88 to
1,252.93 in thin turnover of Bt3.8bn.
SEOUL turned lower as news of a possible summit between two Koreas failed to
maintain its impact. The composite index was off 7.43 points at 923.61 after
an intraday high of 939.17.
Posco, the steelmaker, went the day's limit up, rising Won2,000 to Won65,000
after a report that the chairman had asked institutions to boost its price
to Won100,000 before its share listing in New York.
BOMBAY ended higher, although profit-taking, particularly in Tata Iron &amp;
Steel, eroded sharp gains seen at midsession. The BSE 30-share index closed
37.43 up at 4,211.83 after touching 4,228.70.
In KARACHI, the KSE 100-share index eased 1.52 to 2,350.60. Trading was
disrupted towards the close as many agents stopped work to check reports of
a fatality during a protest in a local community.
TAIPEI lost some of its early gains on late profit-taking, leaving the
weighted index up 7.61 at 5,874.56. Turnover contracted to TDollars 41.48bn
from Monday's TDollars 46.57bn. Selected industrials saw some buying
interest, the most active being China Petrochemical, up 90 cents at TDollars
28.50.
MANILA failed to sustain an initial rise and the composite index finished
8.73 down on balance at 2,740.72. Turnover increased to 624.7m pesos from
Monday's 574.9m.
One exception to the weaker mood was San Miguel 'B', which firmed 1 peso to
133 pesos.
WELLINGTON regained some firmness, the NZSE-40 capital index putting on
17.81 at 1,979.11, but after a high for the session of 2,017.82. Turnover
expanded to NZDollars 40m.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bearish undertone, bourses in
technical recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Afternoon weakness in the dollar, US treasuries and US bond futures made
little initial impact on bourses, mostly up yesterday on Monday's recoveries
in the US instruments, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, Mr Nicholas Knight, a strategist at Nomura in London, said he was
still a bear of Continental equities, seeing sizeable room for depreciation,
for example, in both Paris and Frankfurt.
Mr Knight based his pessimism on loose monetary policy in the US, and
over-tightness in Japan threatening the US dollar and long bond, the nascent
Japanese economic recovery and the Nikkei. Other world markets would be
caught in the crossfire.
He said that the bottom in the bond markets ('still not immediately visible,
but not far off') would not mark the bottom for equities. Accordingly,
Nomura reduced its equity exposure by another 10 per cent to the benefit of
cash, and anticipated committing this liquidity to the bond markets in the
second half of 1994.
FRANKFURT was marked by thin turnover but a lot of professional interest as
the Dax index recovered 29.66 to 2,018.26 in technical trading, and managed
a further token gain to an Ibis-indicated 2,022.25 in the post-bourse.
Turnover rose from DM6.9bn to DM7.1bn. At Bank Julius Bar, in Frankfurt, Mr
Edgar Benischek offered two reasons why equities were resilient in the
afternoon: first, that the September bund future, having come back to a six
basis-point gain on the day at one stage, recovered to a 31-point rise by
the Ibis close; secondly, there was talk that some institutions might be
looking for better equity prices when they closed their books tomorrow.
The technical rebound was good for banks, where Commerzbank climbed DM13 to
DM315.50 and Deutsche Bank rose DM11.80 to DM677.80. Meanwhile, the biggest
gains came in engineering, where Deutsche Babcock put on DM10.50 at DM228.50
on the session, and Klockner Werke DM7.80 at DM149.20. A trade association
reported that orders in the sector increased by a real 18 per cent in May
from a year earlier.
PARIS moved forward in line with the Continental trend, the CAC-40 index
closing 14.16 up at 1,925.76 while turnover eased to about FFr3bn.
Lagardere was active after reporting to a shareholders' meeting that it
expected a good rise in earnings in 1994, mainly due to the completion of
its acquisition of the controlling interest in Matra-Hachette.
Moulinex was marked down heavily at the start of the session, falling
FFr10.80 to a low of FFr116.50 on a long awaited funding plan which included
a two-for-three rights issue at FFr90. Investors were concerned at the
difficulties the household appliances group might experience in raising the
new cash, having seen the problems encountered recently by Eurotunnel and
Euro Disney.
However, Smith New Court in London commented that the announcement was
positive in the medium term, amd saw the rights issue pricing as
'attractive'. Moulinex closed at FFr122.
MADRID broke back through the 300 level again, the general index closing
4.17, or 1.4 per cent higher at 302.34 although here, too, dealers said that
the recovery was technical, and fragile.
Telefonica rose Pta35, or more than 2 per cent to Pta1,765, and traded in 3m
shares as Mr Bill Coleman, telecommunications analyst at James Capel in
London, reaffirmed his buy recommendation for the stock. Last night, Mr
Coleman said that this was 'the last great opportunity to invest in a
European telecoms operator which is coming out of its cocoon', noting that
Italian telecoms stocks had tripled in the same process.
BBV's placing of 4.2m Repsol shares, 1.4 per cent of the oil company's
equity, took market turnover back up to Pta47bn from recently depressed
levels. Repsol rose Pta15 to Pta3,870.
ZURICH was led higher by derivatives, and volume picked up on a day
dominated by professional trading. The SMI index added 43.0 or 1.7 per cent
to 2,604.4.
Financials saw the firmest performances. UBS, in demand by foreign
investors, gained SFr29 to SFr1,174 and, among insurers, Zurich advanced
SFr20 to SFr1,320.
Nestle drew strength from large block orders, particularly from foreign
investors, adding SFr24 to SFr1,126: Goldman Sachs adjusted down its
earnings estimates for 1994 and 1995 to reflect the firmer Swiss franc, but
maintained its market performer recommendation.
Among smaller issues, Holderbank rose SFr12 to SFr889 as the cement group
announced a FFr842m takeover offer for the French building materials group,
Origny Desvroise.
MILAN put in a firm performance, but ended off the day's highs, in volume
which remained thin. The Comit index rose 6.96 to 700.97.
Industrials led the recovery with Olivetti L45 ahead at L2,460 and Fiat L80
higher at L6,425: on Monday, the motor group said that results for the first
three months were a significant improvement on budget and that a significant
recovery was under way.
Montedison rose L25 to L1,503 and analysts commented that the growing
perception of its turnround potential provided more of a spur than a re-run
of rumours that it planned more asset disposals.
The insurers were mixed after Monday's slide. Fondiaria lost L445 or 3.5 per
cent to L12,370, after Monday's 4.1 per cent decline, still weighed by its
warning of a possible capital increase in coming months. Generali picked up
L234 to L41,100, the news of its lower than expected premiums in the first
five months already discounted.
AMSTERDAM resumed an upward course helped by technical trading and bargain
hunting following the market's recent declines.
The AEX index improved 4.12 or 1.1 per cent at 381.22.
Heavy trading was seen in both KLM and Philips, the shares gaining Fl 1.90
and Fl 1.50 respectively to Fl 47.90 and Fl 50.60. The airline group was
supported by a broker's upgrade.
