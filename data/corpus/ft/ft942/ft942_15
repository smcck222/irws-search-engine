Email, the Australian white-goods and building-products manufacturer,
yesterday announced a 58.3 per cent increase in after-tax profits for the
year to end-March, to ADollars 87.8m (USDollars 65.9m). The rise was
achieved on operating revenues of ADollars 1.8bn, up from ADollars 1.47bn a
year earlier.
The figures included a nine-month contribution from National Consolidated,
the building-products and formed-metal business, which added around ADollars
13.7m to after-tax profits. However, earnings per share still rose
significantly, to 34.1 cents from 21.7 cents on a fully-diluted basis.
Email said that margins rose by one-fifth, due to productivity gains, cost
reductions and some volume gains. Export sales also rose significantly.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Overseas units behind sharp rise
at Citic

<TEXT>
China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic), the Chinese
investment conglomerate, sharply increased profits last year to Yn3.35bn
(Dollars 389.5m), compared with Yn380m in 1992.
Citic, which is rapidly developing its domestic and international business,
attributed the improved performance to a bigger contribution from overseas
subsidiaries and stronger domestic management.
The company, established in 1979 as a channel for foreign investment in
China, continued in 1993 to increase international borrowings, raising
Dollars 440m in the international debt markets.
This takes to Dollars 2bn the amount raised abroad in 18 bond issues. Among
Citic's 1993 capital raisings was a Dollars 250m 10-year bond in the US.
Citic's assets at the end of last year stood at Yn82.8bn against current and
long-term liabilities of Yn73.3bn. Citic managers say they are committed to
reducing indebtedness, but acknowledge this will not be easy in the present
growth phase.
Mr Wei Mingyi, Citic's chairman, writing in the company's annual report,
commended the performance of Citic Australia which had been 'profitable' for
the past six years. He added that the Hong Kong-based Citic Pacific was one
of the colony's fastest-growing enterprises, and Citic Industrial Bank
doubled profits last year.
Mr Wei described 1994 as 'crucial for China'. Citic's priorities this year,
he said, would be to improve management and expand its business in such new
fields as finance, insurance, securities and fund management.
It would also push ahead with the development of the Daxie Island economic
development zone off the the coast of Zhejiang province.
Citic plans to invest some Yn4bn in Daxie's infra-structure and is seeking a
further Yn20bn from foreign investors.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Log-jam along the Rajang river -
Many Malaysian timber groups plan to float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rajang river, Malaysia's longest waterway, is a mile wide at Sibu, a
small town not far from the coast of Sarawak. Old tugs chug by, pulling log
booms to freighters waiting out at sea. Saw mills and plywood factories dot
the river's banks.
Sibu is the unlikely-looking headquarters for some of the most cash-rich
companies in Malaysia - those involved in the timber business.
Traditionally, these companies have been privately owned, tightly knit and
secretive enterprises run by Chinese Malaysian families. But times are
slowly changing.
Sarawak accounts for about 80 per cent of the world's unprocessed tropical
timber exports. Pressure by environmentalists and others has resulted in the
state making big cuts in logging, so companies that have grown fat on the
timber industry are looking for other investment opportunities. Many are
planning to put themselves on the stock market.
The Rimbunan Hijau group, based in Sibu, is among the world's biggest
tropical timber companies. It is run by the family of Mr Tiong Hiew King,
who is regarded as the king of Sarawak's timber tycoons. Various members of
the Tiong family are said to control timber concessions in Sarawak amounting
to about 800,000 hectares, an area about 10 times the size of Singapore.
Rimbunan Hijau's overseas timber operations are even bigger. Together with
several other Malaysian companies, the group has moved much of its logging
operations to the tropical forest of Papua New Guinea, where it is said to
have concession areas of nearly 2m hectares. Other log-hungry Malaysian
companies have been opening up operations in the Solomon Islands.
The wealth accumulated from the tropical timber industry is immense. Due
mainly to reduced logging activities worldwide, prices of most tropical
hardwoods have doubled - in some cases tripled - over the past 12 months.
Late last year, the Tiongs announced a MDollars 1bn (USDollars 387m), plan
to go public through a reverse takeover of the stock market listed Berjaya
Textiles, part of the Berjaya group, one of Malaysia's most aggressive
conglomerates.
Eager share traders have been licking their lips at the prospect of one of
the country's biggest privately-held enterprises moving on to the stock
market. Last year, the Kuala Lumpur market went up by 98 per cent. Some of
the most actively-traded stocks were timber-associated and much smaller than
the Tiong empire.
Mr Philip Ting, head of Sarawak Securities, the state's only broking house,
says that timber tycoons like Mr Tiong feel that they will gain
respectability by going public.
'The patriarchs who usually run these companies are also under pressure from
a younger, foreign-trained generation who want to introduce more modern
methods and use the company's resources to diversify - not merely to cut
down trees and sell them,' says Mr Ting.
This process has already begun in the case of the Tiongs. The family is
Malaysia's biggest plywood producer. It also owns a publishing business
which includes the country's largest selling Chinese newspaper. The Tiongs
have extensive property and plantation holdings and a 20 per cent stake in a
medium-sized bank.
Among the family's overseas assets are a large cattle ranch in Australia, a
timber mill in China and property in Singapore. A brother of Mr Tiong living
in Singapore is said to use the family holdings to trade in global equities.
Analysts say that families like the Tiongs feel that going public will
provide some insulation from political uncertainties and from the pressures
on their activities by environmental groups.
Sarawak is a very timber-oriented state. The state minister for the
environment is also head of one of the biggest timber companies. Mr Tiong
has built strong alliances with leading local politicians.
The Tiongs also want to insulate themselves from uncertainties overseas. The
activities of Rimbunan Hijau and other foreign timber companies operating in
Papua New Guinea have come under increasing official scrutiny.
Environmental groups say that the timber companies have accumulated too much
power and are resisting official controls on the industry.
Another problem for the timber tycoons is that Kuala Lumpur's bureaucrats
are taking a growing interest in the private concerns of the country's
wealthy particularly those involved in the logging industry.
'Timber companies have been getting away with too much,' said one finance
ministry official.
'Log export values have been understated or logs have been sold at a loss to
other family members in Hong Kong before being re-exported to Japan or South
Korea at great profit.'
In recent months revenue officials have mounted a number of raids on the
offices of Sarawak timber companies.
Malaysia's Securities Commission has frequently said that companies wishing
to go public must be prepared to divulge more about their activities.
A lack of transparency in some of Rimbunan Hijau's operations is thought to
be one reason for an official delay in approving the Berjaya deal.
'These timber companies have very large resources but if they stay private
there is only so much they can do,' says Mr Ting of Sarawak Securities.
'They see other Malaysian companies building big conglomerates and want to
do the same. The only problem is that a few family secrets have to be let
out of the bag.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Argentina to sell off remaining
20% of YPF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina yesterday came out in favour of selling the government's remaining
20 per cent stake in YPF, the privatised oil company.
The deal is expected to raise about Dollars 1.8bn at current prices.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, said that the government was in
favour of the sale with one condition. The sale of the stake is being
heavily promoted by members of the governing Peronist party in Congress.
Mr Cavallo said: 'It depends on the use the resources would be put to. If
used for development of the interior, we would view it positively. If there
was a one-off distribution of the resources as assistance, it would be an
error.'
YPF, Argentina's biggest company, was privatised in June last year in a
Dollars 3.04bn local and international share offering. The government sold
45 per cent of YPF to investors, held on to a 20 per cent stake and sold the
remaining shares to workers, provincial governments and pensioners.
YPF now has a market capitalisation of close to Dollars 9bn.
Last week members of Congress proposed selling the government's shares in
YPF to finance construction of 100,000 houses in the run-up to next year's
presidential election.
Mr Cavallo said the sale would be carried out through a public offering, but
warned that debates in Congress and discussion over the use of the money
meant that a final decision would probably only be taken in two or three
months.

A financial futures market trading three-month interbank interest rates

'We're working toward a September target,' said the Kuala Lumpur Commodity
Exchange. However, the Securities Commission, which will regulate the new
market said: 'It all depends on when the regulatory requirement for a single
clearing house is in place.' The commission urged the Kuala Lumpur Futures
Market (KLFM) and rival Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange

facility'.
KLFM, run by the commodity exchange, will initially trade in the three-month
Kuala Lumpur interbank offered rate (Klibor).
Kloffe, which is not expected to begin operations until late next year, will
trade in stock index futures.
KLFM officials said it is possible they could set up a clearing house which
Kloffe could join later.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cox climbs to third in US
cable-TV league - Louise Kehoe examines the Atlanta-based company's Dollars
2.3bn deal with the media group Times Mirror
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Times Mirror, the US media group, reached a definitive agreement over the
weekend to sell its cable television operations to Cox Enterprises, a
privately-held Atlanta-based cable television and publishing group.
The complex Dollars 2.3bn deal involves the exchange of stock and debt. It
will make Cox Cable, the Cox Enterprises cable unit, the third largest US
cable-TV company, after Telecommunications and Time Warner, with around 3.1m
subscribers.
Currently, Cox Cable is the sixth largest US cable-TV company with 1.8m
subscribers. The acquisition will provide Cox with the economies of scale
needed to compete aggressively in the emerging market for broadband
interactive multimedia communications services to the home, said Mr James
Robbins, president of Cox Cable.
Mr Robbins will also become chief executive of the merged operations.
Through the merger, Cox will acquire cable TV systems in some of the most
populous areas of southern California and Arizona.
The Cox-Times Mirror deal signals renewed investment interest in the
cable-TV sector, which had cooled following the collapse of two planned
telephone company-cable TV deals involving Bell Atlantic and TCI, and
Southwestern Bell and Cox, earlier this year.
These agreements were scuttled by concerns about regulatory moves to cut
cable-TV service prices by the Federal Communications Commission.
'While we are not at all happy about the current state of regulation, we
believe strongly in the long-term cost effectiveness of the broadband
platform,' said Mr Robbins. 'That's what this deal is all about.'
The Cox-Times Mirror deal may encourage further consolidation in the
cable-TV industry, analysts said. Several smaller cable-TV companies are
said to be looking for buyers.
The cable-TV industry is being transformed by advances in technology that
herald the emergence of 'interactive' television services such as
'video-on-demand', TV shopping and news and information services.
However, only the largest cable-TV companies can afford to upgrade their
networks to provide such services. They also face potential competition from
telephone companies which are also planning to transmit interactive TV
services over their networks.
For Times Mirror the deal reflects a decision, reached late last year, to
refocus on its publishing operations. The group owns the Los Angeles Times,
Newsday, and several other US newspapers and magazines.
Analysts said that Times Mirror recognised that it would have to make
substantial investments to upgrade its cable-TV operations to remain
competitive and chose instead to focus on its 'core competencies' in
publishing.
'With this merger, we have committed our future to the content side of the
information highway and have gained substantial resources to pursue our
growth strategy,' said Mr Robert Erburu, chairman, president and chief
executive of Times Mirror.
Times Mirror aims to become a leading supplier of information and
programming for digital media services, he said. The group plans to grow
'through the application of new technologies and global expansion as well as
building new positions in consumer multimedia', he declared.
As part of their agreement, Times Mirror and Cox Cable will form a
partnership to develop and invest in cable television programming, the
companies said. Times Mirror will manage this partnership.
A new Outdoor Life TV channel, previously announced by Times Mirror, will be
funded by the new partnership. The companies have also agreed to explore a
collaborative test of interactive information and entertainment services in
Southern California.
Times Mirror said that it will reduce its stock dividend, following the
completion of the deal, to 'enable us to make very sizeable investments in
promising information businesses'.

<TEXT>
Domtar, the big Canadian construction materials, pulp and paper and
packaging group, plans to spin off its gypsum, wallboard and decorative
panels business with an initial public offer in the US and possibly Canada
that could raise more than CDollars 400m (USDollars 289.8m).
The assets, valued at about CDollars 380m, have already been put into a new
100 per cent-owned subsidiary called America North Industries (ANI),
including 16 wallboard plants plus gypsum mining operations, located mostly
across the US and also Canada.
Domtar ranks as North America's third-biggest wallboard producer. The
business is recovering sharply with a rising US home building market.
ANI also includes Domtar's highly-profitable decorative panels business.
The initial public offer will be made through Kidder Peabody and Salomon
Bros as lead underwriters. Concurrently ANI will raise another USDollars
125m via a public note issue.
Domtar could retain up to 40 per cent of ANI. It has already spun off its
newsprint unit in a CDollars 289m initial public offer. It wants to
concentrate now on its communications and business papers unit, speciality
fine papers and packaging.
It is trying to negotiate management buy-outs of two pulp mills in eastern
Canada.

<TEXT>
Banco di Sicilia, the leading financial institution on the island, has
reported 1993 losses of L849bn (Dollars 502m), one the of the biggest annual
losses recorded by an Italian regional bank, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The bank is 14 per cent owned by the Treasury and the remainder is held by a
foundation controlled by the Sicilian regional government. The losses, which
compare with a break-even in 1992, are in line with estimates made by a Bank
of Italy inspection last year.
The latter led to the resignation of several senior executives and an
investigation by Palermo magistrates.
Finalisation of the 1993 accounts should pave the way for a L949bn capital
increase funded by the Treasury and the Sicilian regional government. In
addition to the losses, the bank has accumulated doubtful loans of L4,200bn,
equivalent to 7 per cent of the those in the Italian banking system.

Diversey, the special chemicals arm of Canada's Molson brewing group, has
bought the cleaning chemicals division of Chemrite in South Africa, writes
Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The deal gives Diversey a third foothold for expansion on the African
continent. It already operates in Kenya and Egypt.
'South Africa is the foundation for our expansion across the entire southern
cone of Africa,' said Mr David Hull, Molson's senior vice-president for
international operations.
He would not reveal the price but said local management would retain a
minority stake in the business.
The Chemrite division has been making chemicals under licence from Diversey
since 1981. Diversey operates in 45 countries with annual sales of well over
CDollars 1bn.

<TEXT>
A first tranche of shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned
Dutch postal and telecommunications operator, will be floated next week at a
price of Fl 49.75 per share, valuing the company at Fl 22.9bn (Dollars
12.3bn).
The price is slightly higher than many analysts had predicted, and just
above the mid-point of the indicative range of Fl 46 to Fl 52 a share.
Private investors will be given a discount of Fl 2.50 per share on up to 75
shares. This is in line with the government's commitment to give small
shareholders a discount of around 5 per cent compared with the price paid by
institutional investors.
The flotation of 138.15m shares, representing 30 per cent of the
government's 100 per cent holding in KPN, will raise Fl 6.9bn for the state.
An additional Fl 1bn could be generated if the banking syndicate exercises
its 30-day right to sell a further 20.7m shares in case of heavy
oversubscription.
Analysts had agreed the flotation price would be Fl 50 or less, with many
predicting Fl 48 or Fl 49. The government is aiming to sell half the shares
in the Netherlands.
The price, announced yesterday morning, was determined early on Sunday. It
was based on the outcome of a 'book-building' exercise among institutional
investors. Subscriptions opened yesterday and will close on Thursday
afternoon. Trading on the Amsterdam stock exchange is due to start on
Monday.
Mr Wim Kok, the finance minister, said yesterday the transaction should give
'a substantial stimulus to the strengthening and deepening of the Dutch
capital market'. The stock exchange hopes the KPN example will persuade
privately- or family-owned companies in the Netherlands to seek bourse
listings.
KPN's total market capitalisation will make it the third-largest stock on
the Amsterdam stock exchange, behind the two Anglo-Dutch groups Royal
Dutch/Shell and Unilever. The flotation, which is to be followed with a
second tranche by the end of 1997, is the Netherlands' largest.
The KPN flotation is the fifth European telecoms share offering in the past
year, but the first privatisation of a state monopoly to include a postal
service.
The UK government will soon launch a consultation paper likely to advocate
partial privatisation of the Royal Mail. Part of the case for the move is
the need for the state operator to be able to compete internationally with
more entrepreneurial postal services, notably the Dutch.

<TEXT>
Electricidade de Portugal, the state-owned power utility, is to be split
into 10 separate enterprises as part of a restructuring. Electricity
production and distribution will also be partially privatised, Mr Joaquim
Silva Correia, EDP chairman, said yesterday.
EDP is to be unbundled in July. Separate companies will manage power
production and the high-tension transmission network, and there will be four
regional distribution companies and five service companies.
A holding company will co-ordinate operations and strategy.
The new production company, Companhia Portuguesa de Producao de
Electricidade, will privatise about 20 per cent of its capital on the Lisbon
stock exchange by mid-1995, said Mr Silva Correia. Further tranches would be
privatised, but the state would retain a majority holding. The regional
distributors would also privatise a minority of their capital over the
medium term. All the other companies would remain wholly state-owned.
CPPE will take over all of EDP's power plants, estimated to represent about
half the company's net assets of Es2,247bn (Dollars 13bn). Generating
capacity of 7,200MW is to be expanded to 8,800MW by the year 2000. EDP is
Portugal's second-largest company by turnover and number of employees.

<TEXT>
CGIP, the French holding company that has been raising capital through
disposals, is on course for a return to strong profits growth in 1994,
according to Mr Ernest-Anotione Seilliere, chairman.
Mr Seilliere told shareholders at yesterday's annual general meeting that he
expected to see 'a significant boost to earnings' this year.
CGIP, which earlier this year raised FFr994m (Dollars 175m) from a
convertible bond issue, recently reported flat profits for 1993, at FFr547m
against FFr542m in 1992.
However, the board yesterday proposed an increase in the dividend, to FFr34
for 1993 compared with FFr32 for the previous year, as a reflection of its
confidence in the future.
Mr Seilliere said this year's increase in profits would be partly due to 'an
improved contribution' from CGIP's interests, which include a 32 per cent
stake in the CarnaudMetalBox packaging concern and 20 per cent of Cap Sogeti
Gemini, the computer services group.
CGIP should also benefit from the capital gains on disposals, including the
recent sale of control of Cedest to Holderbank, the Swiss cement group, for
FFr3.6bn. The group has been raising new capital to help pay for last year's
deal whereby it lifted its stake in CarnaudMetalBox.

<TEXT>
Losses at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank,
narrowed sharply to FM275m (Dollars 50m) from FM626m in the first four
months, as it benefited from reduced credit losses, new business and lower
interest rates.
However, it said it expected a full-year deficit of up to FM1bn before
returning to the black next year. Last year, the bank made a FM2.66bn loss,
in its third consecutive year in the red.
The recent improvement was attributed mainly to the drop in credit losses,
from FM933m to FM537m. This would have been much higher had the bank not
anticipated continuing problems by establishing a FM900m general provision
at the end of last year. It used all but FM300m of the facility in the first
four months.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Philips leaves darks days behind
 -The semiconductor side is investing again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of cost-cutting, the semiconductor division of Philips, the
Dutch electronics group, is spending again as it celebrates a return to
profitability.
Philips is even considering a new chip factory, which could cost up to
Dollars 1bn. If built, it would represent the largest single investment by
the company since its financial crisis began in 1990.
A decision on the plant is expected later this year - but the fact that such
a large investment is being contemplated underscores the change in fortunes
at Europe's biggest semiconductor maker.
Even without the plant, Philips is aiming to double investments in fixed
assets this year, to around Fl 600m (Dollars 325m) from Fl 300m in 1993,
according to Mr Doug Dunn, who is about to mark his first anniversary as
head of Philips' semiconductor business. He was formerly managing director
of GEC Plessey Semi-conductors.
Expenditure on research and development is set to remain at 15 per cent of
sales, although this will rise in absolute terms because of an expected
sharp increase in the division's turnover during the next few years.
Besides stepping up investments, Mr Dunn says he wants to pursue swift sales
growth, putting an end to the bad times of the early 1990s when the division
concentrated on retrenchment.
Recalling his arrival at Philips' semiconductor division, Mr Dunn notes:
'The organisation had been focused - quite properly, as you have to be for
survival - not on growth, but on cost-cutting, cost-cutting and more
cost-cutting.'
Philips' return to heavier investment in semiconductors is a milestone for
the division and a welcome turnround from 1990, when the group abandoned
pilot production of one-megabit static random access memory (S-Ram) chips.
It did this to staunch the drain of cash into a project that had generated
prestige but produced heavy losses.
Semiconductors returned to profitability in 1992. The rise became more
pronounced in 1993 and, in the 1994 first quarter, continued to strengthen.
Precise figures for semiconductors, which are part of the components and
semiconductors product sector, are not published.
However, the components and semiconductors sector as a whole was the group's
biggest earner in the first quarter, contributing Fl 372m of total group
operating profit of Fl 695m. It edged out lighting as the company's
traditional 'cash cow'.
Philips does not dispute Dataquest's estimate that 1993 sales of
semiconductors amounted to around Fl 4.1bn. On profitability, Mr Dunn will
say only that margins are clearly in double digits.
'When it comes down to income from operations, or profit, we are the best in
Europe, and very close to the best in the world,' he says.
The business generates enough cash to pay for investments, including the
possible chip factory. However, Mr Dunn stresses that a completely new plant
is not the only option, and he has yet to present any one plan to the
group's board.
One alternative would be to increase capacity at Philips' plant in the Dutch
town of Nijmegen, where there is still some vacant space.
This, however, would not produce as much extra capacity as a new plant. Mr
Dunn said Philips might also consider building the plant with other
semiconductor makers, thereby spreading the cost. The plant could be built
anywhere in the world, he added.
Philips currently has chip factories in the Netherlands, Germany, Britain,
France and the US, as well as assembly operations in several locations in
Asia.
The division's return to profit is partly due to the general industry
upswing. However, the rebound at Philips is also the result of an internal
shake-up by Mr Dunn's predecessor, Mr Heinz Hagmeister, who cut operating
costs by Fl 500m a year and pruned unprofitable products, roughly halving
Philip's range of semiconductors and integrated circuits to some 20,000
products.
Philips' strong growth in semiconductors has been achieved in spite of the
company's absence from the market's two fastest-growing segments, memory
chips and micro-processors destined for personal computers. This absence is
a legacy of Philips' own withdrawal from PCs, plus the halt to S-Ram
development.
The company, however, has profited from its strength in chips for computer
peripherals, and in products for mobile communications. Another best-selling
item is the '1-chip TV', an electronics component used in advanced
television sets.
'We are still astonished by demand for this chip, and we still are
struggling to meet our customers' expections and, indeed, we cannot meet
their expectations in quantity terms,' he says.
In spite of the division's improvements, there are still challenges to be
met.
One goal is to develop expertise in memory chips with imbedded logic for
signal processing, in keeping with the television set's development as a
multimedia machine based on digital rather than analog signals. 'We have a
straight choice of developing these ourselves or doing a licence (deal),' he
says.
Another priority, according to Mr Dunn, is to improve Philips'
identification of marketing opportunities and to come up with solutions
demanded by the marketplace.
'We're feeling very pleased with ourselves, but we can do even better,' he
says.

FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Sara Lee to take Dollars 495m
charge for shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sara Lee, the US food and personal products company, is to take a Dollars
495m after-tax charge against earnings in its fourth quarter for a worldwide
restructuring. The charge is equivalent to Dollars 1.03 per share.
The restructuring will lead to the closure and consolidation of some hosiery
manufacturing plants in the US and Europe.
Sara Lee hopes the move will lift the long-term results of its personal
products division, which includes brand-name hosiery such as Hanes and
L'eggs; the knitwear company, Champion; and intimate apparel lines Playtex,
Bali, Dim and Kiwi.
The charge includes the cost of cutting Sara Lee's international workforce
by about 6 per cent, or 8,280 employees.
The restructuring is expected to produce gradual cost savings, with the
company forecasting annual operating savings of Dollars 250m beginning in
1998. Ms Ellen Baras, analyst with Duff and Phelps, said a restructuring had
been widely expected.
'What this does is accelerate their plan to get their hosiery operations
back on track,' Ms Baras said.
Sara Lee's fourth quarter ends in July, with results due on August 8.
Analysts expect the company to report flat results, with growth tempered by
overcapacity in its hosiery division.
The restructuring resembles similar successful efforts by Sara Lee to turn
round its bakery and packaged meat operations, analysts said.
'It's a growth-driven company,' one observer said. 'The personal products
division has been turning around more slowly than they would like.'
Mr John Bryan, Sara Lee's chairman, said that while the company is 'on
course' and expected record sales and earnings for the fiscal year, 'our
ability to remain a growth company, competing effectively in rapidly
changing markets, both today and in the future, requires these actions.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A natural buyer - at first sight / RTZ's
hunger for coal after its US deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's biggest mining company, RTZ Corporation, at first sight seems a
natural candidate to buy some of the British Coal mines put up for sale by
the government.
After all, RTZ has made its strategic interest in this unfashionable fuel
very clear. It spent Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 900m) on two coal businesses
bought in rapid succession last year.
These purchases were in the US, and making it that country's fifth largest
coal producer.
They were followed by a Dollars 233m deal for another US coal business,
completed in April.
To the uninitiated investor, the push into US coal did not look like perfect
timing.
It came just after President Bill Clinton had promised both new energy taxes
and to clamp down more firmly on any activities which damaged the
environment.
But from RTZ's point of view there could not have been a better time to
pounce. Coal was out of favour, and therefore cheap in relation to other
minerals.
And the cost was nowhere near as great as it first appeared.
RTZ's biggest US acquisition was Nerco, the floundering natural resources
company, previously 82 per cent-owned by PacifiCorp.
RTZ quickly sold Nerco's oil and gas and gold mining interests.
So its net outlay for Nerco and the second acquisition, Cordero Mining,
bought from Sun Company, was in fact only Dollars 480m.
And these assets then contributed Pounds 36m towards RTZ's total net profits
of Pounds 287m last year, even though Nerco was included only from February
onwards and Cordero did not contribute until the end of May.
April's purchase of Colowyo Coal from the WR Grace group also involved some
fast financial footwork.
Although it was worth Dollars 233m to Grace, it cost RTZ only Dollars 13m
cash.
This was because RTZ did not buy some long-term coal contracts, but instead
these were used for non-recourse financing to give Grace Dollars 220m before
the deal was completed.
So what makes US coal so attractive?
According to Mr Bob Wilson, RTZ's chief executive, it is not only cheap, but
also offers long-term, if modest, growth prospects.
Before Mr Clinton's election the consensus was that electricity consumption
in the US would grow by about 2 per cent a year, and that would provide 2
per cent growth for coal used by the utilities.
Mr Wilson suggests there will also be important changes within coal demand
as the US clean air legislation bites deeper during the rest of this decade.
Coal with a high sulphur content from Illinois and the Appalachian Mountains
is expected to be displaced by low-sulphur coal from the Powder River Basin
which straddles Montana and Wyoming. 'So low-sulphur coal demand could grow
at better than 2 per cent a year for a long time to come,' says Mr Wilson.
Nerco gives RTZ two open pit, steam-coal mines in the Powder River Basin and
a half share in a third.
Cordero added another open pit mine nearby. More than 60 per cent of
production from these mines is secured by long-term contracts, and 95 per
cent of the contracts run into the next century.
Mr Wilson says the mines 'are about the lowest-cost in the world', with coal
typically costing only Dollars 4 a tonne to mine.
This is because the deposits are thick and very little waste has to be
removed before the coal can be extracted by cheap, open-pit methods.
The snag is that Powder River coal has to be transported by high-cost
railways up to 1,200 miles to reach customers.
Also, Powder River coal might be 'clean' but it usually contains only a
moderate amount of energy compared with Appalachian material.
However, last month's acquisition, Colowyo, is a surface mine in north-west
Colorado which adds a higher-energy coal to RTZ's US portfolio, enabling it
to offer a broader range of products. RTZ's annual US coal output should
rise from 37m tonnes last year to 42m tonnes in 1994.
These acquisitions fit RTZ's declared philosophy of wanting a portfolio of
wholly-owned, world-class, long-life, low-cost and
internationally-competitive mining assets.
RTZ executives privately point out that it seems unlikely anything British
Coal has to offer will meet these criteria.
Nevertheless, the group has gone through the pre-qualification process,
paying for details of each of the five British Coal regions up for sale. The
cost at Pounds 15,000 each is negligible and, as one RTZ executive said:
'How can we decide that we don't want to bid until we see the details?'
Analysts suggest it is more likely that RTZ will bid for more coal in Latin
America or South Africa. Mr Wilson said recently that the group would look
for opportunities to buy into the internationally-traded coal business or
add some value by putting some international coal trading companies
together.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet may raise Pounds 75m from property
disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upturn in the property market has prompted Grand Metropolitan, the food
and drinks group, to put 28 development and investment properties up for
sale.
The portfolio, which is expected to fetch about Pounds 75m, mostly consists
of properties that are no longer used by GrandMet businesses.
The portfolio includes three Oxford Street buildings, including a building
occupied by Virgin Megastore, close to Tottenham Court Road, which used to
house the Sportsmans Club casino.
Mr Bob Williams, chairman and managing director of Grand Metropolitan
Estates said that the sale was in line with the group's strategy of
concentrating on its core food and drinks business.
The portfolio covers shops, offices, industrial properties and development
sites situated around the country and includes the former Truman Brewery in
London's Brick Lane.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Intercare interim results hit by changes in
Dutch legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dutch legislative changes have hit interim profits of Intercare, the
USM-traded supplier of healthcare products, prompting an 8p fall to 89p in
the share price yesterday.
At the pre-tax level, profits declined by 20 per cent to Pounds 1.34m in the
half year to end April, reflecting a 41 per cent drop in the mobility
division contribution to Pounds 430,000.
Mr Robert Shepherd, non-executive chairman, said that the legislation
changes had led to a downturn in scooter business and trading was likely to
continue to be affected in the second half.
For the group as a whole, he believed the first half pattern of trading was
likely to continue for the rest of the current year. In 1992-93 group profit
was Pounds 4.31m.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 20.5m, while earnings per
share came out at 3.25p (4.1p).
The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.7p.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bakyrchik Gold reserves confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following a study of reserves the definitive ore resources of Bakyrchik Gold
have been reduced slightly to 31.4m tonnes producing a total of 8.6m ounces.
That compares with earlier estimates of 31.6m tonnes and 9.3m ounces.
However, the measured reserve category has almost doubled from 655,760
ounces to 1.26m ounces.
The study confirmed expectations that it was capable of producing 1m tonnes
of ore a year with gold output of about 250,000 ounces a year from the stage
II sulphide plant.
Stage II is likely to be sanctioned once gold has been produced through the
stage I plant, which is expected to be commissioned within the next few
weeks, and revenues have been received in foreign currency.
The study results were given when the company, which came to the market in
August to exploit a gold mine in Kazakhstan, announced losses of Dollars
635,000 (Pounds 423,000) for the period from incorporation in April to March
31.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Smiths pays Dollars 150m for US medical
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare group is paying Dollars 150m
(Pounds 100m) for Deltec, a US medical equipment manufacturer owned by
Pharmacia of Sweden.
The deal will add more than one-third to Smiths' Pounds 181m annual sales in
healthcare.
It will also result in a book profit of SKr600m (Pounds 50.6m) to Pharmacia,
which is scheduled to be privatised this month.
Deltec, based in St Paul, Minnesota, makes portable infusion pumps and
injection ports. In 1993, it had sales of about Dollars 100m and operating
profits of more than Dollars 13m.
The cash will come from Smiths' existing resources. The company will pay
Dollars 98m for Deltec's equity and repay inter-company debt of Dollars 35m.
The balance of Dollars 17m will be paid as Deltec's non-US offices change
hands.
This is Smiths' second healthcare acquisition in less than two years. In
October 1992, it bought Intertech Resources, the US medical equipment
company, for Dollars 110m.
Intertech had annual sales of less than Dollars 50m and Smiths said
yesterday that 'there are more reasonable prices being asked for medical
companies these days'.
Deltec has more than 80 per cent of its sales in the US and Smiths said that
the non-US market for the company's products 'remains to be exploited'.
Two thirds of Deltec's sales are of a pump that allows a patient receiving
medication to leave a hospital. The pump continues to supply the patient
without the need for direct nursing care.
Although each pump costs more than Dollars 3,000, and must be fitted with
Deltec's proprietary medication-containing cassettes, there are greater
savings to be made from not having the patient in hospital, said Smiths.
'The wearing of the pump provides doses of medicines to people who do not
need a hospital bed. The driving force in the US (healthcare business) is
getting people out of hospital beds,' said the company. Patients occupying
beds typically cost hundreds of pounds a day.
For Pharmacia, the disposal represents a move to concentrate on the core
business of drugs manufacture.
The company has accumulated a disparate group of businesses through
acquisition.
The sale of Deltec has been planned since February, said Pharmacia.
The company will keep the rights to sell Deltec's products in parts of
Europe but not in the UK, Germany and France.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Blacks Leisure recovers to Pounds 928,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blacks Leisure Group, the camping, sports and fashion company,returned to
profit with a pre-tax figure of Pounds 928,000 for the year ended February
26, against losses of Pounds 10.3m, which included Pounds 7.68m for goodwill
already written off.
The retail division performed well as an aggressive national marketing
strategy pushed sales up 20 per cent to Pounds 45.2m (Pounds 37.7m). Retail
operating profits rose to Pounds 2.7m, against losses of Pounds 991,000.
Within the retail division, the Blacks Camping chain traded well. A new
store was opened in Aberdeen and the company plans to open a further six
this financial year.
Turnover in the distribution division was down from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds
15.1m, pushing down group turnover from Pounds 65.1m to Pounds 60.3m. Group
operating profits from continuing operations rose to Pounds 1.28m (Pounds
9,000) on turnover of Pounds 58.5m (Pounds 53.6m).
The distribution side incurred operating losses on continuing activities of
Pounds 516,000 (Pounds 1.58m profits) on turnover of Pounds 13.4m (Pounds
15.9m).
Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, said a major cause of this
fall in turnover was the deterioration in the performance of the company's
Fila distribution operations.
Although the American-designed sports fashion footwear remained popular in
the US, there was a sharp drop in UK sales.
The company has also had difficulties with its own soccer brand, Quaser.
This reported a loss, mainly due to poor sales in the UK, which accounts for
60 per cent of sales. However, the brand continued to sell well in foreign
markets.
The board is recommending an unchanged final dividend of 1.5p per share,
making a same-again total for the year of 2.25p.
Earnings per share stood at 2.4p compared with losses of 31.8p.

<TEXT>
Emap, the media and exhibitions groups, is planning to continue its twin
policies of launching new magazine titles and expanding through acquisition.
Mr Robin Miller, chief executive, warned yesterday: 'We are in an aggressive
mode. We think this is a good time to acquire both at home and abroad.'
He added that by next June he expected Emap to be a somewhat larger company
than it is today.
Mr Miller was speaking as the group announced a pre-tax profit rise of 8 per
cent to Pounds 45.7m for the year to April 2 - a result that appeared to
compare badly with last year's 56 per cent increase to Pounds 42.4m.
This year's profit figure came after Pounds 9.7m in launch investment - the
company launched 22 magazines during the year - and Pounds 2.5m in
rationalisation costs.
The underlying pre-tax figure represented an increase of 20 per cent.
Ms Lorna Tilbian, media analyst at SG Warburg, stockbrokers, gave Emap 'full
marks' with printing operations the only disappointment. She is sticking
with a Pounds 58m forecast for the present year.
Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at Kleinwort Benson raised his
forecast from Pounds 56m to Pounds 59m.
The share price closed 18p higher at 397p yesterday.
Less is expected to be spent on launches this year between Pounds 6m and
Pounds 7m.
Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 362m (Pounds 318.3m). Earnings per share
were 16.8p (17p) and the total dividend is being raised to 8.86p (7.9p) with
a recommended final payment of 6.4p.
Sir John Hoskyns, the new chairman, said Emap saw a gradual, but long-term
improvement in advertising, which accounted for 50 per cent of the company's
business.
'This coupled with rationalisation and launch activity in the last year will
have a very positive impact,' he said.
Consumer magazines maintained operating profits of Pounds 24m, but
underlying growth was 19 per cent.
Operating profits of business communications, the combined magazine and
exhibitions interests, rose by 33 per cent to Pounds 14.6m.
Newspapers were up 8 per cent to Pounds 8.1m and the radio division grew 25
per cent to Pounds 1m.
These figures exclude rationalisation costs.
COMMENT
A superficial glance at the pre-tax profit level would suggest that Emap was
starting to go off the boil. The group said yesterday that they were simply
getting on with successfully launching new magazines. And although newspaper
margins are at the low end by the group's standards, executives can point to
the fact that their Northampton Chronicle won an award as the fastest
growing daily last year. If Emap can contain launch costs, boost advertising
revenues as the economy improves and consumate takeovers, it should return
to brisk growth with pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 58m for an
undemanding prospective p/e of 18.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hasbro turns up the heat in scrabble for
Spear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro yesterday turned up the heat in its battle for control of JW Spear,
the games group, with a veiled threat of legal action against trustees
controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group.
The US toy maker said the trustees were still bound by agreements to sell
the stake, in spite of an eleventh hour bid by Mattel, the rival toys group.
Hasbro launched its Pounds 9 a share bid for Spear, maker of the word game
Scrabble, 10 days ago, valuing the group at Pounds 47m. The trustees had
agreed to sell their shares to Hasbro, as long as Spear did not publicly
announce an alternative, higher bid in three working days.
On the last day, at just five minutes to midnight, Mattel jumped in with a
Pounds 10 a share offer valuing Spear at Pounds 52m. The announcement was
lodged with the Stock Exchange, while the Takeover Panel and both sets of
advisers were informed of the offer.
Hasbro now claims this was not a public announcement and so the undertakings
are valid. 'All the steps were taken of getting ready to make a public
announcement, but no public announcement was ever made,' said Mr Francis
Jackson of J Henry Schroder Wagg, its advisers and merchant bank.
Hasbro said it was considering its options regarding legal action if the
trustees did not adhere to the undertakings. No response had yet been
received from the trustees.
Spear rejected Hasbro's claim and said it had received professional advice
that the Mattel offer had been validly announced. The board, with the
exception of Mr Francis Spear, the chairman, was recommending Mattel's
offer. Mr Spear originally backed Hasbro's offer, but has been silent since
the Mattel bid.
The regulatory authorities appear to be divided on the issue raised by
Hasbro. Under Stock Exchange guidelines, a public announcement is made by
notifying the Stock Exchange and at least two national newspapers and two
news wires.
However, Spear's advisers, the merchant bank Barings, are understood to have
consulted the Takeover Panel on their interpretation of a public
announcement. While the Panel would not comment on the contract signed by
the trustees, it is believed to have defined a public announcement as
notification to itself, the Stock Exchange, the company, Hasbro and both
sets of advisers.

interim stage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Utility Cable, the company formed via the reverse takeover of the JP
Fitzpatrick companies by Baillie Gifford Technology in February, incurred a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 50,049 for the six months to February 28.
The results compare with a previous deficit of Pounds 16,129 and reflect the
historic activities of the company investing in advanced technology
companies. They do not include trading results of the Fitzpatrick companies.
The year end has been changed and the current financial period will cover
the 18 months to August 31, which will include a full six months' trading
contribution from the Fitzpatrick companies.
The directors intend to pay a final dividend for the 18 month period.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional puts London &amp; Metropolitan in
the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London &amp; Metropolitan, the property developer that was forced into a second
financial restructuring last year, yesterday announced a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 10.2m for 1993, compared with a loss of Pounds 19.6m incurred in the
previous year.
Profits were buoyed by a Pounds 20.2m exceptional item as a result of the
restructuring, primarily from the write-back of provisions.
However, the company remains hampered by its sole overseas project, the Pont
Royal resort in southern France. L&amp;M made a Pounds 7.7m provision against
its share of the cost of the project, reflecting disappointing sales during
1993.
The directors said the company was in better shape following its latest
restructuring, a debt-for-equity swap. Debts were down by Pounds 54m to
Pounds 73.3m, and negative shareholders funds amounted to Pounds 4.93m,
against a negative Pounds 60.33m in 1992.
Mr Chris Harris, chairman, said: 'We've got the company back to a position
where we can now take advantage of opportunities coming out of the
improvement in the UK market.'
However, its problems are not over. The company was brought to the brink by
its involvement in the collapsed consortium to redevelop County Hall, and
its joint venture development of Pont Royal remains critical.
L&amp;M is carrying Pounds 45m of floating rate debt from its exposure to the
French project, and sales last year did not cover interest costs.
In the UK, business was said to be looking better. L&amp;M is project manager
for Value Retail, which plans a number of US-style factory outlet shopping
centres.
The first, in Bicester, will open in spring 1995 and Mr Harris said it was
25 per cent pre-let, with a further 50 per cent at an advanced stage of
negotiation.
L&amp;M has an option to take a 15 per cent stake in the company.
Overall, the group's UK operations contributed operating profits of Pounds
2.5m for the year, while interest costs were were reduced from Pounds 12.46m
to Pounds 4.79m.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Judgment day over Pounds 1.8bn bid - The
battle surrounding Lloyds' offer for C&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few, if any, of those with a ringside seat for the legal fight between the
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society and the Building Societies
Commission over Lloyds Bank's agreed Pounds 1.8bn bid for C&amp;G believe that
the High Court's judgment will be the end of the affair.
The two days of hearings before Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor,
revealed fundamentally different approaches by C&amp;G and its statutory
regulator to the relevant provisions of the 1986 Building Societies Act.
The gulf was summed up by Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, counsel for C&amp;G: 'There
are a number of features which are anathema to the Building Societies
Commission but which to us are entirely proper features of the
trans-action.'
In addition, the stakes for each side are so high that whichever falls at
the first hurdle can scarcely afford to leave the matter there.
For C&amp;G, Mr Sumption argued that the act was not a comprehensive code of
regulation for the transfer of a society's business to a successor company.
Counsel for the Building Societies Commission, Mr Phillip Heslop QC, said
that since societies were creatures of statute, their powers were limited to
what legislation specifically stated or necessarily implied they could do.
Within these diametrically opposed approaches, three main points were at
issue:
could anyone except the society and its successor be a party to the transfer
of its business?
could a payment be made in relation to a transfer that was not expressly
allowed by the relevant part of the act?
assuming a third party could make a payment, could this benefit members of a
society of less than two years' standing, who would not be allowed to share
in a distribution of funds under a transfer agreement which clearly fell
within the legislation?
Mr Sumption said that the draft transfer agreement in the Lloyds/C&amp;G
transaction included terms agreed between the society and its successor
company which covered all the issues the legislation required. The fact that
the same matters had been agreed with others as well did not mean that the
agreement did not comply with the 1986 act.
The commission's argument, however, was that in referring to an agreement
between the society and its successor on the terms of the transfer, the
legislation meant that nothing integral to the transfer could be agreed with
anyone else.
As for the question of a payment not expressly allowed by the act, Mr
Sumption argued that if Parliament had wanted to control the actions of a
third party, it would have had to create a more elaborate scheme than it had
done.
For example, the legislation did not provide any sanction against a third
party which handed out benefits to a society's members. Debates in
Parliament on the bill had not mentioned third parties, and no-one could
know what Parliament might have thought of third-party payments.
However, Mr Heslop argued that the detailed provisions about what societies
could do - even to the extent of explicitly allowing them to acquire
premises and make loans for mobile homes - showed the act was based on
having to give societies express powers to carry out activities.
The consultation and discussion on the proposed legislation before it
finally became law reinforced the argument that the idea of transferring a
society's business to a successor was intended to be only a limited
exception to the previous blanket prohibition on such a move, he said.
It is on the two-year restriction on payments that the dispute is most
critical. The terms proposed by Lloyds would involve cash payments of up to
Pounds 10,000 to all saving and borrowing members of the society, as well as
depositors, employees and pensioners.
The voting thresholds set in the legislation for members of a society to
approve a transfer are so high that, without support from at least some of
the 27 per cent of C&amp;G's shareholding members who are of less then two
years' standing, there is no prospect of achieving approval.
Mr Sumption admitted that Parliament had intended the act to prevent
members' taking decisions on the basis of short-term financial gains and to
prevent speculative flows between societies on rumours of takeovers.
He argued, however, that the primary defence against this was the high
voting thresholds themselves.
Though the act prevented relatively new members benefiting from a
distribution of a society's funds, it did not necessarily follow that
Parliament thought this restriction should apply when 'new' money from
another organisation was being handed out, he added.
For the Commission, however, Mr Heslop said Parliament could not have
intended that a transaction would be able to avoid having to comply with the
regime set out in the act, simply by a relatively modest structuring of a
deal to involve a third party.
Such easy circumvention of what were intended to be safeguards to prevent
the destabilising of the building society movement by speculative flows
would mean that compliance was 'optional', he said.
Given such deep divisions, Sir Donald's judgment, to be given tomorrow at
5pm, looks likely to trigger an application for leave to appeal. The losing
side may seek to take its case all the way to the House of Lords.
Even when the courtroom drama has finished, that will not necessarily be the
end of the argument.
If the commission loses, the Building Societies Association will rush round
to the Treasury to urge the reinstatement of the two-year restriction on
payments to society members.
Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, has already said that the whole
deal would have to be looked at again if C&amp;G lost.
In the meantime, there would be hundreds of thousands of C&amp;G customers who
might feel aggrieved that the cash windfalls they had been expecting had
been taken from them.
'I imagine many customers might want to write to their MPs, complaining,'
one senior figure on the Lloyds/C&amp;G team mused.
Whatever the outcome, the battle that began in private discussions between
the society and the commission looks set to end in the Commons, not in the
courts.

Back in March, Abbey surprised analysts with an increased dividend pay-out

However, Mr Birch just managed to top this. The latest annual report reveals

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Harrington Kilbride, the specialist publisher, fell a further 10p
to 58p yesterday as news of its Pounds 3m additional provision for bad debts
was digested.
The provision, mainly for debts from eastern Europe where the company has
expanded considerably in the last two years, turned the 1993 pre-tax profit
of Pounds 2.42m into a loss and has put the proposed final dividend of 3.2p
in doubt.
The move was prompted by the collection of 1993 debts being slower than
expected.
A detailed review of its trade debtors is being undertaken.
Accounts will not now be presented to the annual meeting being held this
Friday. An extraordinary meeting is to be convened as soon as possible.
The shares fell 66p on Friday.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Beverley losses up to Pounds 2.67m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Beverley Group, the engineering concern, said yesterday that it had
completed its rationalisation programme and was now planning a placing and
open offer to fund future growth, both organically and by acquisition.
Details were expected to be announced shortly.
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.77m for the 1993 year pushed pre-tax
losses up from Pounds 276,000 to Pounds 2.67m.
Turnover of continuing operations fell from Pounds 12.84m to Pounds 7.97m.
After eliminating an Pounds 828,000 technical adjustment arising from a
write-off of goodwill, losses per share worked through at 7.63p (0.21p).
The directors said the restructuring had provided an opportunity to create
more added value through the provision of high quality products and
services.
However, despite the benefits now showing through, they said the group would
not show significant improvements on 1993 until the second half of the year.

The bulk of BAA's future capital spending will go to Heathrow, the world's
largest international passenger airport, which will absorb Pounds 1bn of the
planned Pounds 1.4bn expenditure over the next three years. Capital spending
totalled Pounds 681m in the last three years.
Gatwick airport will absorb Pounds 214m, while spending programmes at BAA's
Scottish airports will involve Pounds 107m with a further Pounds 70m at
Stansted over the next three years.
Capital programmes include the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express rail link; a new
baggage screening system costing more than Pounds 100m to install throughout
the company's airports; expansion and modernisation of departure lounges and
check-in halls as well as airport retailing facilities involving about
Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m for each lounge; a new flight connection centre
between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at Heathrow, and preparatory work for
Heathrow's new Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m Terminal 5 project.
If BAA wins the Terminal 5 planning inquiry, it will face continued heavy
spending after 1997 when construction of the terminal would begin.
The airports group expects only a modest impact on its business from the
opening of the Channel Tunnel with a loss of about 2m passengers in 1995-96
when the tunnel becomes fully operational.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Electricity's poor relation makes good -
Why National Grid's results today are of more than passing interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In pre-privatisation days the National Grid was considered within the
electricity industry to be a poor relation to power generation. No-one will
be feeling sorry for it today.
The company, which operates the high voltage transmission system in England
and Wales, is this morning expected to report pre-tax profits for 1993-94 of
between Pounds 570m and Pounds 580m, against Pounds 533m in the previous
year.
As an unlisted company, previous results have attracted only passing
interest from the City. This year is different.
The 12 regional electricity companies (recs) which own the Grid this spring
appointed Kleinwort Benson, the investment house, and Herbert Smith, the
legal firm, to advise on its future.
Few doubt that this will lead to anything other than a flotation, which will
give National Grid a valuation of at least Pounds 4bn.
So what kind of a company is likely to be floated and what are the
implications for the regional electricity companies?
National Grid's attraction is that it has a cast iron future with almost as
strong guarantees of profit growth.
Transmission is a monopoly business in every country in Europe except
Finland and, with development costs so high, it will remain so.
In England and Wales demand for electricity is likely to grow, albeit at low
percentage rates. The main constraint on the Grid's profits growth
therefore, is regulation, but even this presents no great threat.
Whereas the regional power companies face a potentially severe regulatory
review to take effect from next April, the Grid's pricing formula on its
main transmission business is in place until 1997.
It allows the company to raise transmission prices by inflation minus 3 per
cent. 'Since transmission revenues account for 80 per cent of revenues, this
relatively benign regulatory settlement emphasises the value of the Grid,'
says Mr Nigel Hawkins, Hoare Govett analyst.
While transmission will continue to be the main revenue source, the company
is growing its non-regulated income by investing in transmission projects
overseas and establishing its subsidiary, Energis, as a third
telecommunications force.
The beauty of Energis is that it can be built on the back of the electricity
transmission system. The fibre optics can be wound round existing earth
wires or incorporated into new ones.
In spite of the more than reasonable prospects for the Grid's businesses,
the company is held back by a complicated management structure.
The recs own the National Grid Company indirectly through their investments
in National Grid Holding Company. The chains of command are not always
clear.
Some rec chief executives were irked when Mr David Jefferies, Grid Company
chairman, announced the appointment as chief executive last year of Mr David
Jones, who held the same post at South Wales Electricity.
While Mr Jones is well regarded, some of his former colleagues thought Mr
Jefferies had not consulted widely enough and, in any case, should have
looked outside the industry to fill the post.
Some recs feel they are not involved enough in decision making on overseas
investment and Energis.
On the other hand, running a business where 12 forceful owners with
differing objectives want a say can be damaging.
Talks this year with AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications concern, about the
company taking a stake in Energis were hampered through disagreements
between the recs on a suitable price. So far no link has been formed and
AT&amp;T has backed away from taking an equity slice.
Sorting out the management structures will be among the chief considerations
for Kleinwort Benson. Its over-riding task, however, is to maximise the
value of the Grid to recs.
While the City estimation of the Grid is at least Pounds 4bn and possibly
Pounds 5bn, the company is valued in the rec balance sheets at Pounds 780m
on a historic cost accounting basis or Pounds 2.2bn on a current cost basis.
There is therefore significant scope for unlocking value and boosting the
recs' share prices. But the companies will have to tread carefully
politically.
One problem is that the Grid was a government gift to the recs when they
were vested. Capital gains tax could therefore be as high as 33 per cent of
the value of whatever proportion of the company the recs decide to sell.
Offering shareholders separate shares in the Grid also presents problems to
shareholders since there could be an advanced corporation tax liability.
Mr Nick Pink, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says a tax efficient
structure could be devised but there are dangers. 'Avoidance could damage
relations with the government and there is considerable scope for
unflattering media coverage.'
Such considerations will influence the recs' decision on how much of the
Grid to sell, with anything from 25 per cent upwards possible in one or more
tranches.
They will also have to decide if they want to sell as separate entities some
of the non core businesses like Energis or pump storage facilities for
generating electricity.
The final uncertainty is timing. Labour's threat before the last election to
'take control' of the Grid still weighs heavily on the recs. If the shares
are widely distributed, it would be more difficult for a future government
to effect renationalisation.
That means a flotation before 1997 is a virtual certainty. Within the
National Grid, next spring is considered the best bet.

FT  07 JUN 94 / BPC pulls float after pricing doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market retreat claimed another corporate victim yesterday
when the planned flotation of British Printing Company, the UK's largest
commercial printer, was postponed.
BPC's board said it had 'decided to delay its approach to the market until a
time when the market environment is considered to be more predictable'. It
was now unlikely to seek a listing before the end of the year.
The postponement is the latest sign of trouble in the new issue market. One
merchant banker said that there could be other highly leveraged companies,
mostly buy-outs, which must now be looking at refinancing debt rather than
relying on a flotation to repay lenders.
However, there was no sign yesterday of other significant forthcoming issues
being pulled. New issue experts believe there is still good demand for
shares in well managed companies of a significant size, if they are
correctly priced. Advisers to Eurodollar, Pillar Properties, Chesterton
International, 3i and Exco, for instance, said they had no plans to delay
issues due before the summer break.
However, they were watching the market carefully and still had time to
postpone if necessary.
BPC announced its plans for a summer stock market debut - expected to value
the group at around Pounds 250m - early last month. The funds raised would
have been used to repay debt associated with the management buy-out of the
business from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire in January 1989,
thereby eliminating about Pounds 25m a year in interest costs.
The group's high level of debt meant that a relatively small reduction in
the prospective issue price had a disproportionately large effect on the
value of the equity. It is thought that Mezzanine Management, which led a
second refinancing in mid 1992, had particularly objected to cutting the
issue price.
BPC's decision follows the delay of flotations for three cable companies and
of the issue for London Capital Holdings, which was to have valued the
property investment group at Pounds 150m.
Other recent issues have been scaled down as vendors were dissatisfied with
prices available, such as Amey Holdings, the construction materials group,
and UPF Group, a vehicle chassis maker, late last week.
New issue specialists put the recent delays down more to disappointments on
pricing following the recent fall in the stock market than to the
indigestion which the market had already been suffering because of a surfeit
of new issues, especially of smaller companies.
One merchant banker said of BPC, 'they could have got it away but the price
would have been soggy compared with original indications'.
Mr John Holloran, BPC's chief executive, said he was determined that BPC
should come to market 'with its chest puffed out' rather than 'limp on to
the stage'.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Sprint/EDS drop Dollars 30bn merger after value dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KANSAS CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sprint, the US telecommunications group, and Electronic Data Systems, the
world's largest computing services company, said yesterday they had
abandoned negotiations for a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) merger but were
still exploring other forms of strategic relationship.
The merger failed, according to sources close to the negotiations, because
of a disagreement over the value of Sprint, the third largest US long
distance operator, which is believed still to be seeking an alliance with a
European telecoms group. It has had talks with the French and German state
telecoms operators. One source claimed yesterday that potential European
partners had been contemplating an equity investment in Sprint or the
combined Sprint/EDS.
The collapse of the merger talks came three weeks after the two companies
announced they were in discussions which might have led to the creation of
an information services powerhouse, with a market capitalisation of Dollars
30bn and annual revenues of more than Dollars 20bn.
This is the latest multi-billion dollar engagement called off between
companies in the converging US industries of telecoms, cable television and
computing. The immediate reason was money. The proposal involved EDS
shareholders getting one new share in the combined company for every EDS
share. EDS thought Sprint shareholders should get 1.1 shares in the new
business, while Sprint demanded 1.3.
EDS is a subsidiary of General Motors. To help the merger negotiations, GM
said it would consider spinning off EDS. GM said yesterday it would continue
to consider a spin-off if such a move would help EDS 'attain its strategic
objectives'.

FT  07 JUN 94 / BAA to double airport investment to Pounds 1.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the privatised UK airports group, yesterday announced plans to double
capital spending to Pounds 1.4bn over the next three years after reporting a
13 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 322m.
Revenues rose 15.3 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn in the year to March. The strong
performance coupled with a proposed one-for-one scrip issue helped push up
BAA shares 11p to 949p yesterday.
Although income from regulated airport charges was virtually flat at Pounds
368m, reflecting the Civil Aviation Authority's price control formula, net
retail income rose by 7.6 per cent to Pounds 328m with passengers spending
on average 5 per cent more in airport shops.
Retailing is increasingly becoming a prime source of income for BAA and is
expected eventually to overtake revenues from regulated airport charges.
The big increase in capital spending reflected the need to cope with
expanding air travel in the UK. 'By the turn of the century, we are
expecting nearly a third more people to fly through our London airports than
at present,' said Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive.
Passengers using BAA's airports increased 5.6 per cent last year to 82m,
with 71.5m using the three London airports of Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted. Sir John said passenger traffic was continuing to grow by around
5.5 per cent this year, confirming the economic recovery. Overall, BAA is
forecasting annual growth of around 4 per cent until the end of the century.
Sir John argued that Heathrow's planned Terminal 5 was 'vital' for BAA, the
UK aviation industry and the UK economy. He said recent estimates suggested
that more than 180,000 jobs were generated by economic activity at Heathrow
airport.
BAA was confident it could finance its ambitious investment programme from
its own cash and borrowings.
'Our key ratios have continued to improve, with interest cover rising to 4.8
and gearing falling to 28.5 per cent,' said Mr Nigel Ellis, finance
director. 'We will ensure that we have the capacity to build Terminal 5
without the need for a rights issue.'
However, he said cash flow, which was positive last year, would be negative
this year with the higher capital spending. Debt is expected to start
rising.
BAA is proposing a final dividend of 11.25p, giving a total for the year of
18p, a 12.5 per cent increase on the previous year's 16p. Earnings per share
rose 12.7 per cent to 47p (41.7p).
The company is also proposing to introduce a scrip dividend to allow
shareholders to take their dividend payments in shares instead of cash.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Kmart investors dig in heels over discount record: Richard
Tomkins explains how the US retailer has provoked a shareholder rebellion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low prices were the foundation on which Kmart, the US discount store group,
grew to become the world's biggest retailer, but it was never the intention
that this reputation should extend to its shares.
Now, angry shareholders are signalling that they have had enough. At the
company's annual meeting on Friday, dissident institutional investors
delivered a humiliating blow to Kmart's management by throwing out its plans
to create new shares tied to the earnings performance of its speciality
stores.
Shareholder activism is nothing new in the US. Many big US companies -
including another retailing giant Sears, Roebuck - have been forced into
changes of direction as a result of shareholder pressure. Several -
including General Motors, International Business Machines and Eastman Kodak
 -have lost their chairmen or chief executives along the way.
But what has gone wrong at Kmart to provoke shareholders into such a public
attack?
Shortly after Mr Joseph Antonini became chairman and chief executive in
1987, he proclaimed in a newspaper interview: 'My goal is to make Kmart the
most respected dominant retailer in America.' Briefly, the company won that
respect in 1989 when it overtook Sears, Roebuck to become the world's
largest retailer. But already, analysts were predicting that the discount
store group most likely to succeed in the 1990s was not Kmart, but its rival
Wal-Mart Stores.
They were right. In 1990 Wal-Mart swept past Kmart to claim the number one
slot. In terms of sales, profits and share price, it has soared ahead ever
since.
Analysts say that Wal-Mart is quite simply the better retailer. Kmart has
too often had to sell off goods cheaply to get rid of them, or run out of
things people want to buy.
But there is another factor. Kmart has baffled shareholders with its
repeated changes of direction. In the 1980s, it decided to use the cashflow
from general merchandising to enter speciality retailing. It bought or set
up the PayLess Drug Stores chain, the Waldenbooks and Borders book stores
and the Sports Authority shops, among others.
Confusingly, however, it also set about expanding its general merchandising
activities by making forays into the hypermarket and membership businesses,
first by taking a stake in the Makro hypermarket chain and then by buying
the Pace Membership Warehouse operation. Both these ventures proved
unsuccessful.
The basic strategy went awry when Kmart realised that its discount stores
would not generate the expected surplus cash because they needed so much
investment to survive the competition from Wal-Mart. But the refurbishment
programme was abruptly scaled back in 1992, when Kmart considered
re-entering the hypermarket business. Then in January this year, it said the
results from its refurbished stores were so good that it was starting up the
programme again.
Meanwhile, the PayLess Drug Stores chain disappointed and was sold last
year. The performance of the other speciality retailers also fell short of
expectations, but in January Kmart said it had no intention of selling them.
Instead it came up with a plan to create a new class of shares in the
companies and sell 20-30 per cent of them.
It was this plan that proved the last straw for some shareholders. After
watching their company plunge to net losses of Dollars 947m last year, they
wanted Kmart to get out of speciality retailing altogether and concentrate
on putting its discount stores to rights.
One after the other, the big pension funds - among them, the College
Retirement Equities Fund and the California Public Employees Retirement
System - weighed in with announcements that they would vote against the
scheme. On Friday, Kmart's management lost the vote.
So what happens now? Yesterday Kmart seemed dazed by the defeat, putting out
a vague statement that spoke of 'reviewing all alternatives and taking
actions that are in the best interests of Kmart shareholders'.
The failure of its plan to sell stakes in the speciality retailers will
leave it short of Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn, a sum badly needed for its
store refurbishment programme. Options could include selling the 21 per cent
stake in Coles Myer, the Australian retailer; a cut in the dividend; or
another attempt at a partial spin-off of the speciality subsidiaries.
Alternatively, Kmart could do what the shareholders want and sell the
subsidiaries altogether. That would not be Mr Antonini's preferred option:
but if it is a choice between losing the subsidiaries or his job, he may yet
come round to it.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Andersen moves up to third in Big Six
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five of the UK's 'Big Six' accountancy firms experienced virtually stagnant
fee incomes and cut staff sharply in the last year, according to figures
released yesterday.
Only Andersen - comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting - showed
appreciable growth, with revenues excluding expenses up 11.7 per cent and an
increase in both partners and other professional accountancy staff. The
changes elevated Andersen, the UK arm of the only truly global accountancy
partnership, to the third largest firm in the country, compared with sixth
place two years ago.
Among the six large firms, Touche Ross suffered most from recession,
reporting the only absolute decline in revenues: by 0.8 per cent to Pounds
332.9m, adjusted to exclude income from the Channel Islands.
Last year all the firms except Andersen reported absolute revenue declines
and cut staff: reductions in staffing have continued, with Price Waterhouse
cutting professionals by 409. It cut partner numbers by 67, although it said
60 were being reallocated to full-time work in other countries.
Mr Peter Smith, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said it was increasingly
impossible to compare firms. 'We are not a body shop providing armies of
people to run large computer facilities,' he said, in a swipe at Andersen
Consulting. However, Mr Jim Wadia, managing partner of Arthur Andersen,
said: 'Let them say whatever they like. We want to grow and succeed. We are
very pleased.'
The figures are compiled with comparable year-ends. The Big Six firms audit
the vast majority of UK quoted companies and are substantially larger than
any competitors.
Grant Thornton, next in size, reported fee income down 6 per cent to Pounds
107m. BDO Binder Hamlyn, most parts of which are expected shortly to merge
with Andersen, reported fees down 1.8 per cent to Pounds 106.5m.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Retreat on 'Union bonds' boosts EU summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday staged a
tactical retreat over his plans to launch 'Union bonds' to finance the
multi-billion dollar transport, telecommunications and energy projects known
as trans-European networks.
In a further conciliatory gesture, he agreed to a German plan to set up an
independent panel of experts to study barriers to deregulation provided it
examined European Union and national laws.
The compromise on deregulation cools a potentially damaging row between the
Commission and an Anglo-German alliance favouring tighter controls on
Brussels legislation.
As a result of the two agreements, a meeting of EU finance ministers in
Luxembourg ended on a positive note, boosting prospects for a harmonious
European summit in Corfu later this month. But there is still a risk of a
showdown between EU heads of government over who succeeds Mr Delors as
Commission head.
Arguments over financing of the trans-European networks quickly evaporated
at yesterday's session in Luxembourg. Mr Delors stated at the outset he was
unwilling to press the case for Commission borrowing on the capital markets
to fill an alleged 'financing gap' of around Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.85bn).
The UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy all made clear that they wanted
strict appraisal of the feasibility of the networks - a point echoed by Sir
Brian Unwin, president of the European Investment Bank, which is expected to
provide the bulk of capital.
Sir Brian said: 'I will not express any views on whether there needs to be a
new financial instrument, but the EIB is ready to do very much more in
financing networks. The EIB can raise very large financing for sound
projects.'
A working group under Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, has
identified 10 priority projects. These include high-speed rail links from
Paris to Strasbourg, and Munich to Berlin; a rail-road tunnel through the
Brenner pass in Italy; and motorway routes between the Portuguese capital
Lisbon and Valladolid in Spain.
Mr Delors, who views the networks as vital for improving European
competitiveness and creating jobs, said he hoped work could start on January
1 1996. But he remains adamant the private sector and the EIB alone cannot
raise enough capital.
Under the new deal on deregulation, a panel of experts will scrutinise
existing European Union laws, and put member states under the microscope in
recognition that most labour market law is at national level.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Philip Morris acts against Australian ban on advertising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the US cigarettes, food, and brewing giant, yesterday
launched a High Court action in Australia, seeking to overturn the country's
ban on cigarette advertising on the grounds that it denies 'commercial
freedom of speech'.
This is thought to be one of the first attempts by a US cigarette
manufacturer to litigate against 'anti-smoking' laws outside the US, and
comes as the industry faces increasing pressure from regulators at home and
in the international market.
The company said it filed a statement of claim because the restrictions
imposed by the 1992 Commonwealth Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act were
'so wide-ranging that they deny it the right to take part in debate on
political, public and social issues and deny it the normal commercial
freedom of speech.
'Important issues of freedom of speech are at stake because the restrictions
deny us the right to communicate on political, public and commercial
issues,' said Mr David Davies, vice-president at Philip Morris.
The 1992 Act made tobacco advertising illegal in Australia from the middle
of last year. It will also phase out cigarette sponsorship of sporting
events by the mid-1990s unless exemptions are obtained. Existing sponsorship
contracts were allowed to run their course.
When the legislation was introduced, federal health officials claimed that
about 18,000 Australians died each year from tobacco-related diseases and
the drain on health services amounted to about ADollars 6.8bn (Pounds 3.3bn)
a year. Some 28 per cent of Australians are estimated to be smokers.
Philip Morris claimed yesterday its decision to proceed with a lawsuit came
last month, after it tried to recall some promotional cigarette lighters,
which were thought to be faulty. It said some Australian media groups
claimed initially that they could not publish the recall advertisement for
fear of breaching the federal law. After a brief delay, modi-fied
advertisements were accepted.
Philip Morris, which is under assault from the anti-smoking lobby in the US,
employs about 4,000 people in Australia and says it pays more than ADollars
1bn in taxes and licence fees to state and federal governments.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Finale on Omaha for D-Day ceremonies: Community of nations
is recalled on Normandy beach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OMAHA BEACH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Veterans and international leaders gathered yesterday on Omaha Beach, the
most notorious of the five Normandy landing points because of heavy US
casualties, for the closing ceremony of the D-Day commemorations.
Recalling the community of nations which banded together to fight Nazism 50
years ago, and that has since embraced democratic Germany, the wartime
allies reviewed troops, bands, aircraft and ships from 14 countries that
fought the Nazis.
The overall message which the leaders gathered in France sought to convey
yesterday was that from the anti-Nazi struggle of 50 years ago came the
postwar international co-operation that must be continued to combat present
and future conflicts.
President Bill Clinton told the US Rangers, who had scaled the Pointe du Hoc
cliff above Omaha, there are 'still cliffs to be scaled' by the world's
democracies which must maintain strong alliances.
Mr Clinton went on to tell the Ranger veterans that 'if we should falter, we
need only remember you at this spot 50 years ago, and you again at this spot
today'.
The tale of the D-Day preparations was recounted in two ways - first in the
homespun words of Mr Walter Ehlers, who won America's medal of honour and
lost his brother on June 6 1944. Then President Francois Mitterrand, himself
for a time a prisoner of war in Germany, in polished rhetoric saluted all
the veterans 'come to rejoin their past, which is our future'.
The French president also saluted the heroism of the Russian people, who
pinned down 150 German divisions, the French resistance which helped pave
the way for D-Day and Hitler's opponents inside Germany 'who remained true .
. . to the Germany of their dreams, home of the highest culture'.
Meanwhile, in a newspaper interview yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl denied
he had ever solicited an invitation to the D-Day ceremonies, and said: 'I
understand very well why the allies are commemorating this occasion, so
significant for Europe and for their sacrifices.'
Chancellor Kohl, in a meeting with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime
minister, later underlined forcefully the continuing commitment of Germany
to the process of European integration.
Britain commemorated its dead at the Bayeux cemetery in morning drizzle and
then its veterans at Arromanches in afternoon sun. The ceremony was attended
by President Mitterrand, Australian prime minister Paul Keating and other
leaders including the Grand Duke of Luxembourg who served in the Irish
Guards to free his country from the Third Reich.
Later, the Queen and Prince Philip walked among the graves of the 3,935
British dead and the memorial to 1,808 unknown dead of the Commonwealth. At
Arromanches, the Queen said the presence of Mrs Simone Veil, a senior French
minister who as a young Jewish girl was in Auschwitz, 'represents perfectly
why we are here today'.
Mr Clinton, who has been criticised for not serving in the Vietnam war, paid
eloquent tributes to fallen US soldiers and survivors. But at Utah Beach,
where US forces had also landed, veterans booed when they were told that
tardiness on the part of President Mitterrand had delayed Mr Clinton.

FT  07 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Sprint/EDS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A disagreement over the relative values of Sprint and EDS caused the
breakdown in their merger talks. But the logic of putting a telecom operator
together with a data processing company is still plausible, if a little
fuzzy. Since both companies are important pieces on the multimedia chess
board, a further phase in the complex game of telecoms alliances is in
prospect.
Sprint will be the centrepiece of attempts to put together a third force in
the US telecoms market to compete with AT&amp;T and MCI. It will also be a
player in whatever group emerges to rival the global alliances led by AT&amp;T
and BT/MCI. With indications that France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are
going cold on linking up with AT&amp;T, the likelihood that Europe's two largest
carriers will join forces with Sprint has increased. Some sort of alliance
with NTT is also possible, though the Japanese carrier is still being wooed
by BT and in any case is limited by regulations in what it can do in
overseas markets.
There is little point in combining EDS with another company which does not
own a US telecom network. It may therefore make sense for it to gain its
independence from General Motors and use whichever networks offer the best
deal. Alternatively BT, which came close to buying a stake in EDS two years
ago, may renew its interest. Shareholders in the UK group, though, are
likely to be worried about the dilution implicit in such a move.

FT  07 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to conclude from the latest statistics on consumer credit and
the housing market that April's tax increases are starting to bite. Perhaps,
though, it would be more relevant to ask how far the economy would now be
set to overheat if there were no tax increases to dampen consumer demand.
Consumer credit may have fallen compared with March but April's total of
Pounds 413m was still higher than January and February and more than double
that of April last year. The slippage in housing market activity is more
unsettling, but it seems unrelated to the tax increases: more likely it
reflects the bunching of transactions earlier in the year while the cheapest
fixed-rate mortgages were still available. It will take a month or two to
tell how serious is the housing market setback. So far nothing has happened
to deter the upward drift of City estimates for this year's economic growth
to 3 per cent or even higher. Expansion at that pace cannot be entirely
consumer-led. Happily there are glimmerings of increased investment demand
which should help pick up any slack, while the nascent recovery in Europe
should bolster exports.
If that makes the recovery more sustainable, the risk remains that tax
increases combined with fears of higher interest rates will eventually sap
confidence. Base rate concerns, though, are still only a matter of
expectations. If fears of higher rates did upset the recovery, the
authorities would be spared the political embarrassment of having to
implement the steep rate rises now predicted by the money market.

FT  07 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The paralysis which started to grip the new issues market in May is
spreading. British Printing Company, the latest UK company to postpone its
flotation, is neither an unfashionable property developer nor a cable
television operator. Despite its colourful past within the Maxwell empire,
BPC is the kind of solid industrial company institutions would normally be
happy to own. Despite flotations totalling Pounds 7bn this year - more than
in the whole of 1993 - there is no shortage of institutional funds even if
patience is wearing thin.
While equity and bond markets are choppy, though, many institutions would
rather accumulate cash than commit fresh funds. Pension funds were certainly
building cash balances during the first quarter. Long gilt yields of almost
9 per cent tempted some fund managers into bonds last week. Where money is
flowing into equities, larger stocks are more likely to benefit. On a yield
premium of 20 per cent to the Mid 250 index, the FT-SE 100 looks most
attractive to investors in search of value.
A medium-sized company like BPC was therefore swimming against the tide. The
flotation might have still have succeeded, but only by pricing the shares
more cheaply than the company and its existing shareholders could accept.
Other hopefuls may be prepared to bend a little more. Greater realism in
pricing new issues was anyway overdue. The sight of big industrial groups
floating subsidiaries rather than making trade sales - ECC and Hanson are
cases in point - was a hint that equity market valuations had become
over-blown.

FT  07 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: BAA reaches for the sky
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA has the defensive qualities of a utility but the growth prospects of the
civil aviation industry. So it is hardly surprising that chief executive Sir
John Egan is piling investment into the business. Planned capital
expenditure in airports of Pounds 1.4bn over the next three years is more
than double investment over the past three years. Part of this is to
accommodate future growth in passenger volumes. But the stepped-up spending
is also designed to expand airport retailing, improve the quality of
terminals and build more office space. A further Pounds 200m is earmarked
for investment outside airports, mostly building factory outlets.
Given that BAA's strategy of controlling costs and boosting retailing
revenue is delivering handsome returns, investors will probably be pleased
to have more of the same. Sales per passenger at the group's first
redesigned shopping mall, Heathrow's Terminal Four, have increased 30 per
cent. Meanwhile, BAA's construction costs have dropped by a third over the
past three years and the company now boasts world standard building costs.
There are two main worries. First, that BAA's airport retailing investment
could hit diminishing returns as passengers presumably have finite budgets.
Second, that the group's move into factory outlets could prove misguided,
given its poor record of diversification outside airports. Still, Sir John
is determined to proceed on a suck-it-and-see basis and would be prepared to
pull projects if rates of return failed to meet expectations. The expansion
programme seems to be in safe hands.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Girders fall back into place: Lionel Barber says Europe's
rescue plan for the steel industry may be revived in a more acceptable form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission must make up its mind tomorrow whether its rescue
plan for the steel industry is dead, alive, or in suspended animation.
Three weeks ago, the answer seemed clear. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition
commissioner and co-architect of the plan to cut surplus steel-making
capacity, confessed to failure. 'We have fallen well short of our target,'
he declared. 'The plan is dead.'
Mr Van Miert's pronouncement spread confusion through Europe's steel
industry. In spite of his outburst, the Commission has since worked hard to
rebuild the shattered girders of its steel policy. For without a guiding
hand from Brussels, officials believe the industry has few incentives to cut
the EU's surplus of 19m-26m tonnes of steel products a year.
Officials insist that the EU rescue plan is the best hope of preserving
Brussels' controls on state aid. 'Without this political framework plan, we
risk a free-for-all on state aid in a market which remains extremely
fragile,' says one Commission steel expert.
Inevitably, questions are being raised about Mr Van Miert and his motives
for disavowing a plan with which he was intimately associated. The answers
reveal much about the inner workings of the Commission as the 10-year reign
of Mr Jacques Delors as president draws to a close.
Mr Van Miert, a protege of Mr Delors, has tried every trick to cajole
steel-makers into making cuts, but he has struggled to overcome the
resistance of the state-owned and private sector, which can usually count on
national governments for support:
In Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez extracted a high price for closing
capacity in the volatile Basque region, winning approval from Brussels for
the construction of a modern steel plant at Sestao.
In Italy, a reluctance by the Commission to undermine a reform-minded
government slowed down capacity cuts in 1993. Today, efforts to eliminate
steel mills in the northern Bresciani region remain sensitive for the new
Berlusconi government and its Northern League coalition partners.
In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has fought to protect the Ekostahl plant
in former East Germany. In West Germany, the failure to close the
loss-making Klockner works near Bremen last year was a hammer blow to the EU
plan.
In the more liberal camp, the UK and the Netherlands have remained sceptical
about the effectiveness of the Commission's role, partly because information
on closures and state aid from member states is inadequate. Private
companies such as the British Steel Corporation insist that the Brussels
plan is tilted in favour of the state-owned sector.
This mutual suspicion formed the background to last December's meeting when
EU industry ministers finally put their seal on a deal which offered a total
of Ecus 7bn in subsidies to state-owned companies in Germany, Italy, Spain
and Portugal. The main quid pro quo was an agreement by the companies to
close 5m tonnes of capacity, an end to state aid, and a new deadline of
September 1994 for meeting the total 19m-tonne reduction in capacity.
Somewhat ruefully, Mr Van Miert now admits that there was always an element
of creative fiction and mutual bluff involved in the plan. Yet this was
inevitable from the moment that the Commission stepped into the crisis. Both
Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, have
consciously adopted a different approach from the early 1980s when Brussels
cast itself in the role of organising the steel market under the so-called
'Davignon plan'.
The plan - named after Mr Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner  -
allowed Brussels to dictate individual company's production quotas, impose
protectionist trade measures, and endorse subsidies and price cartels.
This time, the Commission used a lighter touch. It offered market
supervision through quarterly 'recommendations' for forward production and
delivery volumes; but it encouraged privatisation to take out excess
capacity. The aim was to balance state aid for restructuring with monitoring
of plant closures.
After a fashion, it worked. By spring this year, the Commission had notched
up real and promised cuts totalling 11m tonnes. But in his search for the
extra 8m tonnes, Mr Van Miert overstretched.
The first signs of trouble appeared at a meeting in Strasbourg early last
month when Mr Van Miert delivered an ultimatum to European steel industry
bosses: failure to find the extra cuts would bury the rescue plan and
terminate his role.
Two weeks later, the Belgian commissioner put forward to a full Commission
meeting new proposals for approving Ecus 415m of Italian state aid in return
for the closure of capacity in the Brescia. There was one snag: no actual
company would close, only a portion of the plants.
Mr Van Miert pleaded for a flexible interpretation of rules on steel aid,
noting that the amount of subsidies was modest compared to aid already
authorised. But Sir Leon Brittan demolished his arguments, claiming the
subsidies were legally dubious and undermined the EU position in
negotiations with the US on a multilateral steel agreement.
The meeting ended in disarray. Only four commissioners, including Mr Delors,
stood by Mr Van Miert. It was the worst row inside the Commission since the
1991 bust-up over the US-EU Blair House accord on agricultural subsidies
which ended with the (temporary) resignation of Mr Ray MacSharry, Irish
agriculture commissioner.
Mr Van Miert staged his own walk-out the next day, pinning the blame on Sir
Leon and proclaiming the rescue plan dead and buried. He still rejects
charges that he was bending the rules. 'It is totally unfair. I was asked to
find a solution, and I can't see what I could have done otherwise.'
In retrospect, several lessons can be drawn from the affair. Mr Van Miert
admits he should have put more pressure on the steel industry to deliver
cuts in capacity before he offered concessions such as pre-financing for
closures. 'Van Miert is a socialist turned liberal,' agrees one observer.
'That does not make a good combination.'
Second, many of the commissioners were caught unawares by Sir Leon's
intervention, suggesting either a lack of homework or an unhealthy reliance
on their own Cabinet staff who had backed the Van Miert plan overwhelmingly
just two days before. Mr Bangemann's own involvement has been sporadic. He
was in Estonia when the crucial Brescia vote took place in the Commission.
Third, Mr Van Miert appears to have become obsessed with hitting the
19m-tonne target. 'He made it seem that the Commission was responsible for
finding the cuts in capacity, rather than industry. That was a fatal
mistake,' says one official.
Fourth, the Commission may be underestimating the interest of steel
companies themselves in finding market solutions to the crisis. A slowly
recovering steel market coupled with new governments in France and Italy
committed to privatisation may offer new possibilities, says one official.
These possibilities could include new transnational alliances, with
companies choosing to eliminate specific capacity in return for reciprocal
equity stakes and investment. Arbed, the Luxembourg steel-maker, has led the
way in Europe in cross-national joint ventures. Some believe that British
Steel may pursue a similar approach, possibly in France.
When the Commission revisits the steel crisis tomorrow, it seems likely that
it will approve a repackaged version of the Van Miert plan. The onus in the
new version will be on Berlusconi's new government in Italy to show that
state aid to the Bresciani plants does not violate EU rules, and the blame
for failure will be shifted to the industry rather than the Commission.
So, the steel plan looks set for the greatest comeback since Lazarus. But it
is far from clear whether it will meet Mr Van Miert's own demands for at
least 'a minimum amount of political and intellectual coherence'. His vote
will be worth watching.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Booked up for knights of Polish passion: Harlequin's eastern
promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Polish men used to take their gallant reputation seriously: this is a
country where coal miners would kiss a lady's hand on introduction at the
picket line. But since the collapse of communism, Polish women in search of
a white knight turn increasingly to Polish translations of romance novels
published by the local subsidiary of Canadian-based Harlequin company.
Over the past two years, Polish women, like those in Hungary and the Czech
Republic, have fallen for the western charms of Harlequin heroes as avidly
as their men have taken to the western pornography once banned by communist
censors. While the competition to satisfy eastern Europe's appetite for
pornography is fierce, over the past three years Harlequin, which trades in
the UK as Mills and Boon, has managed to establish the same market dominance
east of the Elbe that it exerts in western Europe and North America.
More than 90 per cent of the 24m romance novels sold in Poland last year
were Harlequins, and the company enjoys similar sales levels in Hungary and
the Czech Republic. This year, Harlequin is pedalling passion even further
east, through new subsidiaries in Bulgaria and possibly Russia, where the
company is conducting a trial run.
Harlequin is the McDonald's of romance: its product is inexpensive, mass
produced and offers the same, reliable story-line in dozens of languages
every month. In Poland, this approach has allowed Arlekin, Harlequin's fully
owned local subsidiary, to become the nation's largest foreign publisher,
with monthly sales approaching 2m and a gross profit of nearly Dollars 2m
last year, with a full-time staff of only 11.
Harlequin paperbacks, with their covers of couples locked in romantic
embraces, are now a common sight in Polish bookstores. But to market
Harlequins in Poland, Mrs Nina Kowalewska, the managing director of Arlekin,
first had to promote a feminine version of the capitalist dream which has
conquered eastern Europe: a romantic love match with an invariably
well-heeled Prince Charming.
First, she blitzed the country with television advertisements in which a
woman, sitting in a grey apartment on a grey sofa, finds herself in a
bright, elegant, expensively furnished home, with a well-dressed man at her
elbow. As a male voice croons 'enter the garden of love', several Harlequin
novels appear on the screen.
Mrs Kowalewska followed up her visual assault with an even more direct
effort to make the western woman's romantic idyll a part of post-communist
Polish culture: in 1992 she introduced Valentine's Day into Poland.
Harlequin held a Valentine's Day party for its main subscribers and assorted
politicians, created a Valentine's Day package for television and offered
romantic holidays and a Nissan Micro car as Valentine's Day prizes to its
readers in a lottery-style draw.
Mrs Kowalewska, one of Poland's best known businesswomen, has also employed
less glamorous marketing techniques. She insists on high production
standards, printing Polish Harlequins in Germany because no Polish press can
cope with such a high volume. Mrs Kowalewska stresses that 'you will never
find a spelling mistake or typographical error in our books'.
High production quality is a necessary defence for Mrs Kowalewska, who must
counter the soft but incessant grumbling of Polish intellectuals. They
resent the replacement of the high-brow literary classics such as the epic
poem Pan Tadeusz, by 19th century writer Adam Mickiewicz, which once
provided a refuge from the reality of communism, with the popular culture of
Harlequin novels.
But Mrs Kowalewska, who admits that Harlequins are 'entertainment, not
literature', enjoys a subtle revenge for the intellectuals' put-downs. High
culture in Poland is strapped for cash now that subsidies have ended, and
many Polish writers are making ends meet by translating Harlequin romances
from English to Polish.
'As a result, Harlequins are better written in Polish than in English,' Mrs
Kowalewska says, adding with a polite smile, 'in this way we can also help
to subsidise high culture'.
Her final defence, taken up on the pages of a Polish political journal, is
that while western feminists might criticise romance novels for perpetuating
sexist stereotypes, in Poland, such writing is in the vanguard of the
struggle for women's rights.
'Polish men are rough, crude and exploitative,' Mrs Kowalewska says.
'Readers tell us that after reading Harlequins they no longer put up with
that kind of treatment. They demand to be treated as partners and to be
cherished.'
Despite the quiet scorn of Polish intellectuals and the mounting trepidation
of Polish men, this appears to be a message which Polish women are willing
to spend billions of zlotys a year to hear.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Future of the OECD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fiftieth anniversary of the conference at Bretton Woods is focusing
attention on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Completion
of the Uruguay Round is set to transform the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade into the World Trade Organisation. The end of the
secretary-general's current term of office in September ought to force a
similar re-evaluation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. What justifies such re-appraisals is not these anniversaries,
but fundamental political and economic changes. Institutions that
underpinned past successes must be kept up-to-date, if they are to serve
well in future.
The OECD is unique by virtue of its limited membership, now 25 (following
Mexico's accession in April), along with the wide range of areas it covers.
These include all aspects of economics; statistics; agriculture; trade;
energy; the environment; public sector management; education, employment and
social affairs; science, technology and industry; and fiscal, financial and
business policies. Affiliated to it are the International Energy Agency and
centres for advising former communist countries and research on economic
development.
Many significant initiatives have emerged from discussions in the OECD,
since it replaced in 1961 the Organisation for European Economic
Co-operation, itself the overseer of the Marshall Plan. One was how best to
respond to the structural shocks of the 1970s. Another was the secretariat's
analysis of producer and consumer subsidy equivalents in agriculture. Yet
another is the effort, on the agenda of this week's ministerial meeting, to
promote a consensus on measures to lower unemployment. The OECD plays a
central role in the preparation of internationally comparable statistics,
which help debates on such subjects as health, ageing and the environment.
It has also become the chosen forum for negotiations to limit subsidies to
shipbuilding and export credit.
The OECD needs to remain the focal point for inter-governmental discussion
of this wide range of topics. But it will also have to change. The Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia are banging on the door. Argentina,
Chile, and Brazil, with which the OECD has contacts, might become members,
following Mexico. In east Asia, there are several countries that might
follow South Korea, due to join late next year.
In principle, the OECD should embrace all advanced market economies. But it
must not become as unwieldy as the United Nations. This can be managed only
by alterations in the way it is now run. The current principle that all
members are entitled to a seat at virtually all tables will have to end.
Smaller members could be grouped into constituencies. Regional sub-groups
could be established. Sub-groups might also be formed out of those
interested in particular topics.
Also necessary is streamlined decision-making. At present unanimity is the
rule. Weighted voting would help facilitate executive decisions in a larger,
more diverse grouping. Such a change in voting should help a
secretary-general determined to play a more powerful role in shaping the
global policy debate.
Much depends on who is the successor to Mr Jean-Claude Paye, who has been in
place for 10 years. Challenging the French incumbent are Mr Donald Johnston,
a former Canadian minister backed by the US, and two other European
candidates - Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr
Lorenz Schomerus, a senior German economics ministry official. All of these
candidates have merits, though none seems to have the perfect blend of
intellectual weight, political clout, diplomatic ability and administrative
experience. Probably Lord Lawson comes closest.
As David Henderson, former head of the economic department, has pointed out,
'OECD has neither money to offer nor the power to give instructions; but
what happens there can have influence on governments and a wider public
opinion, if the work of the organisation is professionally competent,
objective and timely.' The next head of the OECD must, above all, be someone
able to initiate and promote such work to gov-ernments and to a wider
public.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Soap wars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the late 1980s, multinational managers have been repeatedly urged to
'think global, but act local'. When first coined, the axiom was intended to
correct the then common misconception that the opening of international
markets meant that consumer demand was identical everywhere. Today, there is
a wealth of business school case studies demonstrating the error of that
assumption.
However, the recent war of words between Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever, two
of the world's biggest consumer goods manufacturers, suggests a rather
different conclusion. The hostilities centre on P&amp;G's allegations that a new
Unilever detergent, which contains a patented cleansing technology, rots
clothes.
The origin of Unilever's embarrassment lies not in the difficulty - but in
the relative ease - of marketing across borders. That, indeed, has become
essential in the detergents industry, where steadily fiercer competition has
eroded producers' traditional positions in national markets. Increasingly,
success depends on being the first to develop new products and launch them
simultaneously on many world markets.
Though P&amp;G's allegations may prove baseless, and Unilever's faith in its new
product vindicated by consumers, the incident points to a wider lesson. As
pressure grows on manufacturers to innovate faster and expand their sales
efforts across borders, they are also obliged to confront much bigger risks.
In the days when they began by selling products just on their home markets,
any hiccups could be attended to before they were launched abroad. Today,
they can become a global headache from day one.
Furthermore, the advantages procured by global product launches can be
short-lived because they can often be quickly copied by competitors.
Unilever has sought to combat that problem by using patented technology in
its new detergent. But that is difficult in most other consumer products.
From ice cream to nail varnish, makers of good new products invite ever
earlier a horde of global imitators. For them, the challenge of the 1990s is
no longer learning how to cross borders, but how to survive thereafter.

Tom Spencer is standing as the Tory party candidate for the Surrey
constituency in the European elections on June 9. For some reason Spencer
chooses to sign his election leaflet not 'yours', nor even 'yours sincerely'
but 'love'. 'My starting point is that Surrey is geographically and
industrially at the heart of Europe,' says Spencer's handout.
Clearly a man fuelled by wishful thinking and desperate optimism; an ideal
candidate for the Tories.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What does the secretary of the Bank of England actually do?
Take Geoffrey Croughton, the current incumbent. Apart from keeping the
minutes of the weekly meeting of the court of directors, Croughton has been
slaving away for months organising tomorrow's Bank of England tercentenary
concert at the Barbican.
If anyone knows the score it is Croughton. Not only has he arranged the
programme, but he will be on stage singing with the Philharmonia Chorus.
Indeed, this will be his swan song. After eight years on the job, he retires
at the end of the year and hands over to John Footman, the Bank's
user-friendly PR chief.
Footman follows in a distinguished tradition. Kenneth Grahame found time to
write Wind in the Willows and several other tomes during his 10 years in the
post, and Montagu Norman, who ran the Bank for 24 years, is reported to have
offered the job of company secretary to TE Lawrence (of Arabia).
Oddly enough, Lawrence seemed to prefer an even bigger desert.

Talking of the arms business, is the British government once again about to
turn to British Aerospace, Britain's biggest arms exporter, to find its top
arms salesman?
Sir Colin Chandler was BAe's marketing director when he was poached to head
the Ministry of Defence's Export Sales Organisation in 1985. Now another BAe
type, Charles Masefield, 54, is being fingered to do the job. His dad, Sir
Peter Masefield, used to be a big wheel in the British aviation industry,
which helps in a business where names matter. Masefield junior is also an
ex-chief test pilot for Hawker Siddeley; so at least he should know what
he's talking about on the hardware side.
It's certainly taken long enough to find a boss for one of Britain's most
successful export businesses. One reason may be that the MoD insists on
having a Brit.
But if an Australian - Malcolm McIntosh - can be chief of defence
procurement, surely an out-and-out foreigner could be Britain's chief arms
sales rep?
It would certainly widen the field and reduce the suspicion that the job
will be stitched up over a few brandies and cigars at the Athenaeum.

South Africa's new minister of defence Joe Modise - former head of the ANC's
armed wing - is wasting no time getting to know an industry that was created
specifically to thwart his guerrilla army.
At a briefing by state arms manufacturer Armscor - where Armscor declared
its intention to double arms exports from their current annual figure of
R886m - Modise could hardly have been more fulsome in his praise.
Modise spoke warmly of Armscor's contribution to exports, job retention and
the maintenance of local technology, but then refused to take questions. A
less than generous hack remarked that his words bore an uncanny resemblance
to those of Armscor's first great promoter - former minister of defence,
later president, P W Botha. Plus ca change.

47m, but Mattel squeezed in last Friday, valuing it at Pounds 52m.
Observer understands the matter has already passed into the hands of two top

crucial weekend phone call.
S: Whaddya mean by this, tryin' to upstage ma show? Old man Spear has

S: You ain't got a decent pedigree, sweetie pie. Ah'm British, through and

B: British? Don't crease me up. You ain't been British since 1986.
S: I jest know that Spear likes my looks better than yours.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Revive the OAU
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's admission to the Organisation of African Unity at the weekend
will provide an opportunity to breathe new life into a discredited body.
Since its inception in 1963 the OAU has been preoccupied by apartheid, but
its contribution to the ending of minority rule was negligible. Instead
South Africa became a convenient rallying point for leaders wishing to
divert attention from their failures at home.
OAU summits rightly denounced minority rule in South Africa, but ignored
human rights abuses in member states. The organisation has also neglected
its role as a mediator in African conflicts. It belatedly recognised the
continent's economic crisis, but still seems reluctant to endorse the
fundamentals of structural adjustment.
Some of the more forthright leaders, such as Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, have
made refreshingly frank appraisals of the OAU's performance. But only
President Nelson Mandela can bring the combination of qualities that the OAU
needs if it to be rejuvenated: moral authority, economic clout, military
muscle and, above all, the inspiration of South Africa's successful
transition to democracy.
If one looks elsewhere for a figure with the right to speak for the region,
one searches in vain. The first generation of post-independence African
leaders are mostly dead and/or discredited. Many of their successors are
even less fitted to the task. They pay lip service to democracy, line their
pockets, and allow economic reform programmes to lapse.
When he addresses the summit next week, Mr Mandela should set out the OAU's
post-apartheid agenda. It can strengthen its commitment to democracy by
encouraging and monitoring all members' elections. It should make mediation
a priority, and co-ordinate its peacekeeping role with the UN. It can tackle
corruption with the help of Transparency International, the recently-founded
campaign for a universal code of business conduct. It should invite rigorous
conditionality in return for bold western initiatives to resolve the
external debt burden. Above all, Mr Mandela needs to inspire and harness the
same energy and commitment that helped Africa win independence and gave the
OAU its raison d'etre.

<TEXT>
It's jobs, stupid. The Clinton campaign's famous phrase should be thus
re-stated in time for the next British general election. The deciding issue
could be employment policy. That would not necessarily be to the
disadvantage of the Conservatives. Since 1979 they have won most of the
arguments. As soon as Labour has a new leader it had better find out why,
and what to do about it. A bogus commitment to full employment will not
suffice, except perhaps as a cynical slogan. What Labour needs is a credible
social and economic programme. At present it has none.
This is not to belittle Mr Tony Blair, the likely winner of a leadership
contest. He talks of national renewal. He also espouses the development of
the individual through a return to the values of the family and the
community. Such a sermon could win converts, but it would not guarantee
victory. For that Labour needs a believable set of economic proposals, a
strategy that comforts the electorate, a story that convinces voters that
they would be better off if they threw the Tories out.
To his credit, Mr Gordon Brown has cleared the way for some of the necessary
rethinking. The shadow chancellor has worked hard to reposition the Labour
party. He and his colleagues now run a mile from anything that could imply
an increase in personal taxation. The party is no longer associated with
devaluation. His central message is that Labour would fit people for the
21st century job market by better education and lifetime opportunities for
retraining. The Conservatives have expressed their admiration by copying
bits of it. Mr Brown further distinguished himself last week by stepping
aside to allow Mr Blair a clear run at the leadership. He was right. A man
who speaks in capital letters would be unlikely to soothe the anxieties of
wavering voters. He could do his cause a further service. He could challenge
his party's long-standing beliefs about deregulation, the minimum wage, and
unemployment benefit.
I have chosen those three out of a potentially longer list because the new
leader, be it Mr Blair or his likely rival Mr John Prescott, will be asked
about them. The debate could begin next Monday. The GMB general union has
invited contenders for the Labour leadership to appear before its delegates
in Blackpool on Monday afternoon. Mr Prescott believes that it is his duty
to campaign for a commitment to full employment, if only to force Mr Blair
to reveal his hand. Touching as it may seem, Mr Prescott regards a challenge
by himself as an endeavour to ensure that the new emperor has clothes.
Violins, please. Self-sacrifice has become chic in the Labour party. The
only danger is that he might win. Happily, it is slight.
What will Mr Blair say? He appears to have handed the economic portion of
his brain to Mr Brown for education and training. One or both of them will
doubtless study a special report due to be published by the OECD tonight.
This should put persistent structural unemployment high on the political
agenda. It is too closely argued to be disposed of in a few headlines, but
the thrust of it favours the Conservative approach to labour market
regulation, tax policy, social security contributions, and the minimum wage.
Education 'n training is also on the OECD's lengthy menu of proposed
job-creation policies, but the people's party will find little support for
its current thinking in most of the other items.
Alternatively, the putative leader of the opposition may turn to Mr Robert
Reich, Mr Clinton's secretary of Labour. Mr Reich has been all over London
town. He spoke at a Guardian seminar on Sunday and delivered a lecture
organised by the Labour think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy
Research, yesterday. He has a tale of woe to tell, about the US being the
most unequal society in the world, with Britain racing to catch up with that
dismal record. Jobs, and wage increases, are going to the 'problem-solvers',
people with university degrees. The unskilled and uneducated are today's
losers. Like everyone else, Mr Reich favours more training and better
education. That said, his further arguments give little support to an
inadequately modernised Labour party.
He is lukewarm about increases in the US's generally low minimum wage. How
low would Mr Blair put the floor in Britain? Mr Reich acknowledges the high
cost in jobs foregone of continental Europe's regulated and highly taxed
labour market. President Clinton's re-employment legislation is designed to
get people off social benefit. In the 1980s it might have been called
workfare. On the morning of Black Wednesday in 1992 I heard the president
campaign on this theme in Watts county. In last autumn's British Budget the
Conservatives announced a new 'job-seekers' allowance'. It cuts the time on
benefit from 12 to six months and obliges claimants to look for work or
accept training schemes. Labour is awaiting the report of its social justice
commission on this subject. Its leadership candidates should beware. Any
promise of full employment, or a move towards it, would be hollow without
some reform of the welfare system. The American slogan 'a hand-up rather
than a hand-out' would do.
Mr Reich has other pots simmering. One contains a school-to-work
apprenticeship programme; another a tax credit system for low-paid workers.
Britain's Tory administration introduced family credit for low-paid
employees and national vocational qualifications that could become goals for
apprentices. As with all job-creation programmes, none of these is itself a
solution, but together the complete Reich package may add up to somewhere
between harmless and mildly beneficial.
Labour is trapped between the tempting haven of continental Europe, whose
comfortable conditions for employees cannot be sustained, and the awful
example of America, whose 1980s deregulation has destroyed whole layers of
society. There is no magic third way, certainly not one that ends with
everyone who wants a job getting one. Subsidies rarely work. You have to
settle for less regulation and less welfare if you want more people in jobs.
The question is how much less. If Mr Blair becomes leader he will have to
teach his party these facts of life. Then, with Mr Brown, he should assemble
a package that outflanks the Conservatives. The alternative is hot air, and
another Tory victory.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No privatisation means paralysis for
Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE GUISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is good that the government is at last to propose privatisation of
the Post Office although a full sale of the component parts would make more
commercial sense than partial retention of public ownership.
The privatisation legacy of the 1980s, which has enhanced both the quality
of customer service as well as national return on capital throughout all the
privatised sector, has left the Post Office out of kilter with everything
around it. It cannot modernise and revamp its assets without meeting
Treasury opposition. It cannot participate in a joint venture with, for
example, an air freight operator, or make an acquisition without that being
called a nationalisation. It is therefore currently held in a full Nelson,
one arm financially and the other arm politically. For any business this
would be bad, but for a communications business it must mean long-term
deterioration.
Because of recent organisational improvements, the Post Office is currently
throwing off net cash to the exchequer and therefore assisting in public
borrowing reductions. It has been fiscally convenient to milk this cow while
indecision about privatisation continued. A normal business would be using a
good part of this cash flow to protect and enhance its future competitive
position.
There are several parts of the Post Office which could be privatised in
their entirety, such as Parcelforce, and the Counters business, without
putting the thorny issue of Lettermail and the Queen's head on the political
centre stage. Lettermail should, of course, ultimately be privatised, with
simultaneous abolition of the monopoly. Deliveries to the Isle of Mull could
be protected either by direct state subsidy or by the inhabitants paying a
commercial rate. The use of the Queen's head could either be discontinued
or, better, licensed with the royalty going to royalty.
Those who wish the Post Office well should not be deceived into believing
all will be safe if the state retains ownership and control. Such control
can only bring paralysis leading to the ultimate destruction of the
business.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Personal View: Spirit of new trade order - Making the
Uruguay Round effective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER SUTHERLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I doubt there were many Financial Times readers who failed to heave a hearty
sigh of relief in April when ministers signed the Uruguay Round deal in
Marrakesh. Relief, partly because most of them must have felt war-weary
after eight years of reading about seemingly interminable negotiations and
partly - perhaps predominantly - because they understood just how vital the
deal really was.
The results of those negotiations will be implemented as from January 1 1995
when the World Trade Organisation comes into being. One can only hope that
the major players will not make the process of ratification - which is
required before we can finally confirm the implementation date - into an
agony of indecision and delay. The birth of the WTO should not be held
hostage to domestic political in-fighting - nor to transient trade
squabbles, which tend to be of mind-withering inconsequence when measured
against the crucial importance of the new multilateral trading system.
But even when the WTO is in place there will be a temptation, in some
capitals at least, to revert to 'business as usual'; perpetuating the same
kind of preoccupations, justified or not, with respect to bilateral trade
balances, alleged 'unfairness' in trading practices and so on. It is
important that we recognise that the WTO is a response to continuing global
changes, economic and otherwise, and that, as a consequence, its activities
have to be seen against a background of much more than big-power trade
politics.
It will be a truly multilateral institution seeking multilateral responses
to the economic problems faced by a large continuum of countries. This is
not to talk of 'world government'; it is simply to face up to the
inter-linkages between economies. It is also to reassert the spirit of the
Uruguay Round in finding meaningful, practicable approaches, acceptable to
all, which drive forward the creation of wealth and sustainable development.
Establishment of the WTO does, though, call for a new commitment to
co-ordination in economic policymaking. Why? Think for a moment about one
key preoccupation of most governments at present: education and training in
the context of unemployment.
There is a convincing argument that expanded trade between the developed and
developing worlds has, in the past few decades and particularly since the
mid-1980s, led to significant employment shifts in both. And it is not a
simple matter of jobs lost and gained. While the extent of jobs lost in
certain industries and gained in others in the developed countries can be
debated, it seems clear that trade with the developing countries has tended
to favour the skilled against the unskilled and exacerbated the gap between
them. At the same time, in developing countries, export-oriented policies
have encouraged a faster rate of learning and investment in education. This
has opened up a gap between those with little or no education, who are
unlikely to be involved in anything but the most rudimentary manufacturing
activity, and those with at least a basic level of education.
This is an important observation. The results of the Uruguay Round, and
particularly those related to increased market access for goods and
services, are designed to expand trade; certainly between developed and
developing countries and those countries in the process of economic reform.
Thus, the impact of recent trade growth on skill demands and on the gap
between skilled and unskilled, educated and uneducated may be reinforced
and, perhaps, accelerated over several decades.
Nor is it just concessions on market access which will spur demands on
education and training. New opportunities will be opened up through the
intellectual property agreement - encouraging technology transfer, for
instance - and the services deal will lead to the establishment of foreign
service providers requiring skilled, educated employees. And this should not
be seen as a one-way process; opportunities for the development of new
skills will be as great in industrialised as in developing countries.
The real question that arises is whether we are thinking hard enough about
the machinery which will help governments identify and respond to such
trends.
After all, it is evident that the most important influences on national
economies are now, and will be increasingly, outside their borders. As a
consequence, most governments will be left with few policy instruments with
which to attempt to affect the performance of their own economies. If that
is the case then it is vital that the international machinery be effective.
I have argued previously that the present machinery of the G7 is now
inadequate. On almost every measure, it is an unrepresentative organism and,
consequently, its deliberations seldom have meaning or relevance for
countries outside the select group - not always, indeed, for those inside.
That is a big loss. The fact is that the G7 countries must recognise that
they cannot take sole responsibility for the broad thrust of economic
management without adequate participation of the countries representing new
dynamic markets in the developing world. There is a need for a grouping of
countries that can be more effective and representative with some
participation, perhaps, on a rotating basis.
But the key to making such a group effective is not only representation but
the input participants receive. Here, the multilateral institutions must now
get their act together.
At present we have a multitude of researchers and analysts in a multitude of
organisations producing countless papers and reports to be added to those
produced by governments themselves. Why should the organisations concerned
with money, finance and trade - the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and the WTO - not evolve a single coherent statement on issues of
economic concern to a representative forum of the world's leaders? And in
order to ensure implementation of the decisions reached, the same
organisations should co-ordinate more effectively to give strong
institutional support.
One thing is for sure. We must concentrate on the long-term implications of
the agreements which have been reached and must be implemented by the WTO
and on the way in which this new multilateral trading system will spur new
approaches to global economic management.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Contracting out by no means clarified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN MCMULLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I comment on your feature on the revision of the Acquired Rights
Directive, which protects employee rights on transfer of undertakings,
('Government near victory on contracting-out reform', May 31)? In
particular, will the revised directive solve a problem for contractors,
currently affected by wide interpretations of the present directive? You are
right to draw attention to the fact that the revised directive declares that
the outsourcing of only an activity of an undertaking does not in itself
constitute a transfer of an undertaking. This is underpinned by the preamble
which makes it clear that the principles of 'legal security' demand a clear
distinction between transfer of undertakings and transfers of only an
activity.
I wonder whether, however, celebrations may be premature. The directive goes
on to state that a transfer of an undertaking shall be considered to have
taken place in cases where together with the transfer of an activity an
economic entity which retains its identity is also transferred.
The revised version of the directive makes it clear that there is a
distinction between the bare contract for services and a transfer of an
undertaking. But it should be noted that, in the recent European Court case
of Christel Schmidt (the outsourcing of a cleaning operation) and in the
Court of Appeal case of Dines v Initial Health Care Services (the changeover
of contractors providing cleaning services to Orsett Hospital), it was
specifically found that there was a transfer of an economic entity retaining
its identity.
It is certainly arguable, therefore, that these cases would have been
decided no differently, even if the revised directive had been in place. If
that is the case, tribunals and courts battling with the revised version of
the directive (if adopted) may find in many cases that the distinction
between the transfer of an activity and the transfer of an activity that
amounts to an economic entity which retains its identity is extremely hard
to pinpoint. Any view that the new definition of a transfer is more
restricted will depend on the interpretation of new wording in the
directive's preamble that 'an economic entity (is) understood to consist of
several parts operating autonomously and pursuing a specific objective . .
.' However a lot more work needs doing on the draft directive if real
clarity is to be achieved.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Managements should pay for bad advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SAUNDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'More knocks for the PIA' (26 May), is yet another
example of the divergence that is taking place away from the real issue. I,
for one, have become increasingly frustrated at the inability of the
Treasury and Securities and Investments Board to avoid politicisation of the
issues involved and at their unwillingness or inability to grasp the
fundamental points which are, or should be, simple and clear.
First, the structure of regulation as proposed by the Personal Investment
Authority is having, and will encourage, an anti-competitive result (this
being directly contrary to the Treasury's stated intention); an increasing
number of independent financial advisers are giving up the business.
The effect of the proposed new regulatory structure is to encourage
'bank-assurance' and the like to the obvious and long-term detriment of true
independent advice.
Second, protection for the individual investor could be considerably
strengthened within the existing regulatory framework and without the need
for a PIA. Existing regulations do already impose direct penalties on the
perpetrators of bad or fraudulent advice. However, to fine an insurance
company punishes the shareholders and/or the policyholders of that company
and does not punish those responsible, that is, the managements which have
allowed the salesman too much latitude. If the existing regulators made sure
that the managements were individually fined, then the industry would see a
very rapid and effective clean-up of its operations. Let it not be
overlooked that most of the recent mis-selling of pension transfers was made
by those employed by the insurance companies and banks, not by independent
advisers.
Third, while no legislation will be able completely to deter the occasional
fraudster, recompense to those injured should come from a compensation fund
created directly from a product levy.
Perhaps it is naive to imagine that the expansion of the regulation industry
(for that is what it has become) could now be slowed down when there are so
many people now involved, all with their large salaries, final salary
pension benefits, personal assistants, secretaries et al and, of course,
individual spheres of political influence. It would be nice to see, or even
hope for, a return to commonsense, rather than witness this continued
expansion, knowing we in financial services have to pick up the tab and
that, in the long run, the investment buying public will suffer.

<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Gerald Frankel and Mr Ben Coleman are quite wrong to put forward
their view that only the largest companies can afford to commit resources to
ensuring that new European standards are not to their disadvantage (Letters,
June 1). Industry organisations and trade associations have a key role in
the negotiation of CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) standards.
Industries which have organised to meet this challenge through associations
do so at very modest cost to individual members.
The existence of the European standards system is a matter of fact.
Inadequate representation or poor performance in a standards negotiation can
lead to products being standardised out of existence. On the other hand, a
successful standards negotiation can offer a significantly greater market to
a product which meets the new standard.
Virtually all players, large and small, in the UK galvanising sector give
solid support to their industry organisation, finance it at a realistic
level and look to it to deliver full value in European standards
negotiations. Mr Frankel and Mr Coleman would do well to encourage the same
approach elsewhere. In this way UK business meets the challenge of business
from other EU states with equal strength.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: Happy Days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do we mean by stasis in drama? Winnie, the heroine of Samuel Beckett's
Happy Days is visually almost as immobile as any protagonist since
Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound: embedded in a mound of earth - in Act One up
to her waist, in Act Two up to her neck. Nor does she progress
psychologically. What one recalls most are the phrases on which she harps -
'That is what I find so wonderful'; 'Ah yes, great mercies'; 'Another happy
day' - time and again.
And yet this is not, for us, a static play. All Winnie's repetitions help us
to know her better, and to lead us more intimately into the vast tragicomic
situation which is larger than her. For Happy Days is a mortal's
contemplations of the gradual diminuendo ending of life: 'loss of spirits,
lack of keenness,' loss of memory, of sexuality, of energy, of hope. Against
which Winnie's repeated little optimisms, staving off despair, become
heroic.
Beckett achieves this often by working on the most trivial scale. Winnie
re-examines her toothbrush until, after whole minutes, she discerns all the
legend 'Fully guaranteed genuine pure hog's setae.' Whereupon she remarks
'That is what I find so wonderful, that not a day goes by - to speak in the
old style - hardly a day, without some addition to one's knowledge however
trifling, the addition I mean, provided one takes the pains. And if for some
strange reasons no further pains are possible, why then just close the eyes
 -and wait for the day to come - the happy day when flesh melts at so many
degrees and the night of the moon has so many hundred hours . . . That is
what I find so comforting when I lose heart and envy the brute beast.'
So many of these phrases we have already heard from her lips, and will hear
again, that the full impact of these sentences hardly hits us at the time.
Yet it is the repetitions that matter most, for they represent Winnie's
Canute-like efforts to defy the incoming waves of oblivion. I am, mind you,
speaking here of Happy Days itself, and not of the specific performance it
is currently receiving at the French Institute.
Angela Pleasance gives Winnie an accent so precisely filled with
lower-middle-class English nuance, that it is as if she took a Jane Clark
view of Winnie. Her voice and face condescend to impersonate Winnie,
tiptoeing quaintly below stairs for every separate inflection. Her director,
the French Simone Benmussa, may well be tone-deaf to the English class
connotations of Pleasance's performance. But Benmussa must be aware of some
of the extensive artifice employed by Pleasance, and by Peter Bayliss in the
small role of Willie.
No doubt it is Benmussa who has encouraged Pleasance to speak the whole play
on a near-inaudible thread of voice. This sustained pianissimo would be
daring and compelling were Pleasance suggesting a larger-souled Winnie. Not
so, however. As Pleasance delivers it, Happy Days is simply the slow
extinction of what used to be called the soul of a housemaid. The play,
however, is so much larger and more enthralling that you can listen to its
words and imagine, so to speak, the play beyond this meagre performance.
Happy Days remains one of the great plays of the century.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: All admiration for Zimerman and the Nash - Concerts in
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER and JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman's packed recital at the Royal Festival
Hall on Thursday night had a most unusual programme, at first sight bitty,
consisting of a string of variation sets by improbably assorted composers,
writes Paul Driver. However, his playing not only justified five of his six
choices - sometimes making undistinguished music sound much better than it
is - but nearly authenticated the sequence as an artistic whole.
That playing is utterly compelling: flawlessly virtuosic; muscular and
suavely lyrical by turns; equally capable of the most limpid delicacies and
most massive quasi-orchestral grandeur; and always informed by a questing,
unorthodox musical intelligence, which was evident in the delightfully
quirky programme notes he provided as well as in such astonishing
performances as that of the opening item, his own (1973) transcription of
Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582. I would never have thought
that two hands on one piano could produce so detailed and convincing an
impression of a full organ as this.
Cheekily, he followed the gigantism of this piece with a translucent
miniature allegedly by the eight-year old Schubert, Seven Easy Variations in
G receiving their British premiere, no less. There is nothing beyond elegant
Mozartian simplicity in the writing, but Zimerman's formidable musicianship
raised the expression a power or two. For the mature Mendelssohn's
Variations serieuses Op. 54 he restored some of the orchestral
thunderousness of the Bach account, but making a point of not following the
false Horowitz tradition and actually ending with thunder. His reading was
otherwise as gloriously full of Horowitzian technical brilliance as you
could wish. (Like Horowitz, Zimerman travels with his own wondrous
instrument.)
After the interval we were plunged, a little unpreparedly, into the
glittering hard nostalgia of Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales, among
which Zimerman found several occasions for introspective lingering; and yet
more abruptly into the modernist pointillism of Webern's Variations Op. 27,
which was given a passionate and athletic despatch, Zimerman squaring up to
the keyboard like a tennis player receiving service. His endpiece, the
diffuse, immature Variations on a Polish Theme, Op. 10, by Szymanowski,
rather let the programme down, though lent moments of keen persuasiveness.
Why not finish with one of the dozens of piano variation sets that are
masterpieces?
Critics may not be the best-loved members of the music profession, writes
John Allison, but one would not have guessed that from the warmth of the
audience at the Wigmore Hall on Saturday: Felix Aprahamian was celebrating
his 80th birthday, and a throng of his admirers combined with devotees of
the Nash Ensemble to pack the hall, leaving standing room only at the back.
But then Aprahamian, who was number two on The Sunday Times for 41 years, is
no ordinary critic. A legendary figure in British musical life, a friend of
many composers and musicians, he was above all a champion of French music in
this country. He played a significant role in presenting the 'Concerts de
Musique Francaise' at the Wigmore during 1940s and early 1950s.
The venue for Saturday's celebration was thus as appropriate as the Nash
Ensemble's programme, all French with the exception of the honorary-French
Delius. One of the group's many strengths is its versatility, and this
programme had variety and balance.
An evocative account of Ravel's Introduction and Allegro for harp, string
quartet, flute and clarinet set the tone for the evening. Skaila Kanga was
the consummate harp soloist. No less accomplished was the flautist Philippa
Davies, who captured the contrasting moods of Roussel's Joueurs de Flute. A
shifting of stage furniture brought out strings, piano (Ian Brown,
excellent) and the baritone Francois Le Roux for Le Bonne Chanson, Faure's
setting of nine Verlaine poems. Le Roux, a musicianly singer, was not at his
most mellifluous: his tone seemed a little grey and colourless for music as
luminous as this.
Christopher van Kampen was a warm soloist in Delius's Sonata for cello and
piano, and brought shape to its long, musing lines. Debussy's ethereal
Sonata for flute, viola and harp was dispatched with delicacy before we
heard the evening's party piece: Le Bal Masque, an appropriate choice since
Poulenc was one of Aprahamian's closest composer friends. Le Roux declaimed
Max Jacob's verses with verve and the eight players discharged the cheeky
score with zest. The Nash musicians are renowned communicators, and here
they bubbled over, providing a rollicking end to an otherwise sober party.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: Comrades at arms - William Packer reviews of the work
of Rex Whistler, the Welsh Guard and artist hero who died in Normandy, 1944
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rex Whistler was never a war artist in the now conventional sense: he was,
rather, an artist who chose to be a soldier and went to war. He had tried
for a commission in the Territorials after Munich, and volunteered again
when war was declared in September 1939 although, at 35, well over-age for
call-up in the normal way. 'I have a strong feeling,' he told a friend,
Kenneth Rae, 'that if anyone has to go and fight . . . it is precisely
people of my age, and not the young boys.'
By then no new commissions were being given except through the ranks, with
the Brigade of Guards the sole exception. Colonel Leatham of the Welsh
Guards put him on the waiting list, his commission finally came through in
May 1940 and he joined his unit for training in June. Thus as a troop
commander, 3 Squadron, 2nd (Armoured Reconnaissance) Battalion The Welsh
Guards, Lieutenant RJ Whistler at last went to the war, landing with his
troop on Gold Beach on June 30, 1944, D-Day + 24.
On July 18 the battalion went into action for the first time, moving across
Pegasus Bridge and so south to take part in Operation Goodwood, the planned
breaking of the deadlock of the battle for Caen. That afternoon his tank
came under fire while temporarily disabled by loose wire. Caught in the open
as he organised his troop's response, Whistler was killed outright by a
mortar blast, the battalion's first casualty of the campaign. He was 39.
There is little doubt that had he been offered a commission as a war artist
at the outset, he would have accepted it, but his name was the 750th to be
considered by Kenneth Clark, whose committee's decision it was, and by then
it was far too late. In the four years of training and waiting between
Dunkirk and D-Day, Whistler had become a true soldier, imbued not just with
his personal sense of duty as an army officer, but with the ethos of his
regiment, and a guards regiment at that.
He had turned down camouflage work, and had been given every opportunity to
apply for a job on the staff. He had friends quite literally at court, on
one notable occasion being summoned, a mere subaltern still, 'to dine with
the King &amp; Queen at Sandringham last Tuesday] And went there with my Col. &amp;
General &amp; an officer or two from the Grenrs &amp; Bde HQ . . . very informal and
everyone in such good spirits.' He could so easily and honourably have
excused himself from active service but was adamant. 'If you try to stop
me,' he told his squadron commander, 'I shall kill myself.'
It is easy to make a hero of a hero, especially so naturally modest and
likeable a hero as Rex Whistler - 'one of the most delightful men the Welsh
Guards has ever carried on its roll . . .' said his commanding officer - and
a reputation as an artist can so easily be elevated in proportion. The
usefulness of this delightful and, in the end, poignant exhibition of
Whistler's war-time work is that it allows us to see it for what it is,
through all the fuss of personality and circumstance.
As a painter he is not all that remarkable, uneven yet capable on occasion
of great charm and even power in a particular image - the portrait of the
battalion's master cook, for example; a tiny Essex landscape painted the
weekend he joined up; the officers' mess under canvas on Salisbury Plain; a
self-portrait in his new uniform. He painted constantly, portrait studies of
friends and fellow officers, genre scenes of military and domestic life, the
gardens and interiors of the houses he visited on leave. There is a sense
that in this time he was beginning to come to himself as a painter, and this
body of work does stand as a particular record of the war on the home front.
But it is as a draughtsman and designer that Whistler shows himself as being
truly remarkable. His pre-war reputation rested largely on his mural
decorations for the restaurant at the Tate, executed in the 1920s, and on
his work as an illustrator. Through the war such freelance work continued as
military duty allowed, including a number of major commissions for stage and
film design. But what is more interesting is the degree to which such
activity was not independent of his life as a soldier at all, but part of
its very fabric.
He was draughtsman and designer in his very nature, reacting spontaneously
to every turn of the military life in terms of line and image. A diagram of
the lay-out for kit inspection became an elegant and wryly instructive work
of art. A suggestion to the colonel of easy improvements to the comforts of
the mess became a lively before-and-after cartoon, after the manner of a
Rowlandson. Who but Whistler would think to decorate the visitors' book of
the travelling cinema, come to entertain the troops? Pastiche Old Masters
for the now-refurbished mess? A battalion badge? A battalion Christmas card?
Whistler was the man.
Much of the material for this show remains in private hands. A great deal
more is in the collection of the Welsh Guards, which evidently treasures his
memory. We can see why.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: A Doll's House - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As if to reassure the shades of those London theatregoers shocked by A
Doll's House in 1889, Chichester's Minerva Theatre has mounted a new
production of this dissection of sexual non-communication that places Ibsen
smack in the middle of old-fashioned melodrama. Tchaikovsky surging in the
background, ominously dimming lights, an erring heroine who almost launches
into a mad scene: it might be Lady Audley's Secret. The director, Annie
Castledine, did a full-blooded Gaslight at Greenwich; and a colleague at
Chichester wondered aloud whether a new last act for Ibsen would reveal that
patronising husband Torvald had engineered the whole crisis to get rid of
wife Nora and make off with her old chum.
Jane Maud's unusually strong Christine would make this understandable. Poor
Mrs Linde's hard luck story emerges with bleak melancholy that occasionally
erupts into anger. Her reunion with Nora is competitive, defiant, as they
prowl around each other catching up with the news like big cats marking out
their territories.
Sharon Maughan's Nora is hampered by entering in a red dress on a minimal
red-walled set that recalls Ingmar Bergman's Hedda Gabler. Like Hedda, or
Ellida in The Lady From The Sea, Nora is looking for moral responsibility,
the right to make her own decisions, in the face of stifling masculine
protectiveness. Delightedly identified from the Gold Blend TV commercial by
a section of the audience, Ms Maughan cleverly suggests the bird in the
gilded cage, the pampered plaything in a marriage whose cloying sweetness is
disturbed only by tension over too many tooth-rotting macaroons.
The sexual side of the marriage is absent until the last act, when Peter
McEnery's fantasising Torvald, inflamed by Nora's dancing, reveals himself
as the true Victorian paterfamilias: obviously vastly experienced with women
of a different sort, reserving a mixture of worship and possessiveness for
his wife. By this time the production's throbbingly theatrical mood has
turned Torvald into a clown. 'I don't want any melodramatics,' declares Mr
McEnery, who has evidently not noticed that the past 2 1/2 hours have
consisted of nothing else.
Christopher Hampton's 1971 version hardly helps with its blend of
Victorianisms ('Get on with you, you little minx]') and detached
editorialism - a 'terrible blow to his masculine self-esteem' is not the
sort of over-aware phrase Nora would come out with; before Act Three anyway.
Initially the direction makes Nora bounce between the chirpy and the
hysterical, ending Act One frozen into the dating mask of a silent scream, a
Norwegian national pastime to judge by the country's most famous painting.
The performance is not only too lightweight; it makes Nora's final, rational
declaration of independence totally implausible.
This is unfair on Ms Maughan, who comes into her own with an earnest
eagerness that makes the scene into a quietly controlled but murderous call
to arms. Liabilities include an offstage ball that sounds as if the St
Petersburg Philharmonic has moved in upstairs and an inert Krogstad (Nick
Reding) of pure Norwegian wood. But the play's issues still reverberate
uncomfortably: 'Most young criminals usually have dishonest mothers,' says
the benign husband. Substitute unmarried for dishonest and we are back to
basics - and concomitant attitudes - unchanged since Ibsen's day.

It seems that the people at Channel 4 still believe that women, like blacks,
are inferior beings who cannot participate equally in this competitive world
but must be given protective ghettoes where they can do their thing without
big bad men (or wicked whites as the case may be) interfering. Thus they
rope off yet another 'women only' area today, this time labelled First Sex.
Here programmes 'made by women for women' can be shown in safety. The
silliness of this patronising folderol becomes obvious when you imagine our
reaction if they suggested we needed special programmes 'made by men for
men' (9.00). The documentary series 20 Miles From Piccadilly Circus has been
doing just what its title implies and showing how remarkably rural a village
 -Eynsford - can be even when it is very close to the metropolis. This week
the village policeman provides the main focus (7.30 ITV). The latest
television cook, Gary Rhodes, goes to Norfolk for sausages and onion gravy
in Rhodes Around Britain (8.30 BBC2). Later BBC2 begins another series of
One Foot In The Past (9.45).

FT  07 JUN 94 / Technology: Old bugs learn new tricks - Oil a l'orange is a
tasty dish for some
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edward Billington, the Liverpool sugar merchant and foods group, appears to
have found a way to make waste oils, tars and other unwanted hydrocarbon
stains and contaminants more palatable - not to humans but to bacteria.
The development offers a more environmentally friendly way of cleaning
grime-prone surfaces like garage, workshop or factory floors, or petrol
station forecourts.
It also works on contaminated ground, where hydrocarbon waste has soaked
into soil, giving an alternative to digging out the earth and dumping it.
Using bugs to devour hydrocarbons has been practised in sewage farms for
decades but problems arise when the waste comes in an emulsion or suspension
after the oils have been dissolved in detergents.
Bacteria are put off by the taste of the detergent and the digestion process
becomes inefficient. Most producers of effluents tend to accept the
situation and pay their local water authority extra to compensate for the
problem.
The principal ingredient of Billington's process is a natural solvent called
Pronatur, made from waste orange peel. Billington unveiled it last year
after it bought the small company which had developed the solvent. It has
since invested Pounds 200,000 in a new factory in Bootle - twice the sum
planned originally because sales of the solvent are growing faster than
expected.
One of the solvent's properties is that it is immiscible in water. This
means that if it is used to clean oil-stained concrete, it can be washed
down the drain with water and easily separated from the water in interceptor
pots.
In porous material like shingle or soil, a spray of water helps the solvent
and bacteria soak in and do their work. In either case - solid surfaces or
porous media - the final chemical products are carbon dioxide and water.
The solvent smells like oranges and seems to appeal to oil-devouring bugs.
The system has been demonstrated during trial cleaning of stained concrete
and railway track at Tyseley depot in Birmingham.
The trials were evaluated independently by Derby University's Environmental
Impact Analysis Group and seem to support Billington's claims for its
product and systems.
When the trials started, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of Tyseley's
effluent was 12,144 mg/l, more than 20 times above the permitted level. By
spraying with Pronatur and water and then adding bacteria to dissolve the
waste hydrocarbons, the figure dropped to 4,286 mg/l after a week and 88
mg/l after three weeks.
The hydrocarbon content of the effluent went from 470 mg/l to 54 mg/l in the
period. Glycol readings plunged from 7,610 mg/l to less than 1 mg/l, while
the pH moved from a highly alkaline value of 12 to 6.82 - barely on the
acidic side of neutrality.
'We are now selling do-it-yourself kits to industry, plus training, so
companies can carry out this cleaning as a simple, cheap, maintenance
routine,' says John Hassett, Billington's chief executive.
Richard Monbiot, technical director of Pronatur Products, a Billington
subsidiary, says the aim will be to undercut cleaning contractors, where the
main cost is labour, and obviate the need to pay extra to water authorities
for effluent treatment because consent levels cannot be attained.
In the Tyseley railway depot case, effluent charges had been Pounds 20,000
over six months. The new system cost Pounds 10,000 to get everything
thoroughly clean, while continuing maintenance will be a fraction of that.
However, while Pronatur is gaining ground among big companies, Monbiot says
medium-sized and smaller companies are sticking to trichlorethane, its
entrenched rival. But Billington believes that companies may be forced to
change by law, as environmental controls tighten over synthetic chemical
solvents.
'Big companies are greener and are more likely to act earlier,' Hassett
says. Pronatur has attracted interest in the US and Europe, where
distributors are in place, and also in Japan.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Headhunting season closed - A US
injunction that limits poaching of a rival's staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In April, Arthur D Little, the Massachusetts-based management and technology
consultants, obtained an injunction from a California Superior Court judge
banning Electronic Data Systems, an information-services subsidiary of
General Motors, from soliciting its employees anywhere in the world.
The move followed a lawsuit filed by Little alleging that EDS had unfairly
hired away almost the entire staff of Little's aerospace consulting
practice, resulting in a significant loss of business.
The sweeping nature of the injunction took corporate America by surprise.
Although companies frequently threaten legal action when one competitor
poaches another's talent, cases rarely reach the courts. Broad prohibitions
on soliciting employees are rare. The 13th amendment of the US Constitution
guarantees citizens the right to work for any employer they choose if that
employer is willing to employ them.
EDS is considering an appeal. But, if the injunction is upheld on appeal, do
US companies need to reconsider their hiring policies?
EDS denies it has done anything wrong. Mr Mark Fox, an EDS spokesman, says:
'We believe the suit is without merit and the injunction is without merit.'
The lawsuit should be put into perspective, he says. EDS has built up a
management consultancy of 1,100 people from scratch in two years. Of that
number, 30 worked in the aerospace field and, of those 30, eight were former
Little employees.
'We're building something very exciting, of which aerospace is a key area.
People are attracted to that and are keen to work for us. But we've done
nothing to twist their arms or use illegal means to bring them in,' he says.
So why did Little bring the action? Mr Sam Gallo, the company's general
counsel explains that the poaching of almost its entire aerospace
consultancy was an unprecedented event.
'Over the years many people have moved in and out of the company, but we've
never had a situation where an entire practice area was essentially raided
from the firm,' he says.
When Little subsequently discovered that EDS was attempting the same thing
with its metal industries consulting practice, it felt it had little choice
but to take legal action.
Mr Gallo says the suit has three parts. Little is suing EDS for unfair
competition under the California Business and Professions Code; theft of
trade secrets; and for inducing Little employees to breach fiduciary duties
to the company.
It is also suing Mr Charles D Scales, former head of the aerospace
consulting practice, for breach of fiduciary duty and contractual
obligations. Little alleges that, while still working for the company but
after being hired by EDS, Mr Scales used his influence and position as an
officer of the company to persuade colleagues to move to EDS.
Finally, Little is suing Heidrick &amp; Struggles, an executive recruitment
firm. Little alleges the firm acted improperly by helping EDS recruit
members of its aerospace group while Little itself was a client of the
headhunters. Heidrick &amp; Struggles denies it acted improperly.
Having filed the lawsuit, Little then sought a worldwide injunction to
preserve the status quo until trial of the action. Its intention was not to
prevent any Little employees from applying for jobs at EDS but to stop EDS
from approaching any more Little staff around the world.
Mr Gallo says that, to get the injunction, Little had to satisfy the judge
it was more likely than not to win the lawsuit. 'He must have been satisfied
we had a strong case or he wouldn't have granted the injunction,' he added.
Does the sweeping nature of the protection gained by Little have broader
implications for US businesses? Mr Jeffrey Kingston, a partner of San
Francisco-based Brobeck Phleger &amp; Harrison, says there are several
dimensions to the case.
At one level the lawsuit appeared to be a straightforward Bancroft-Whitney v
Glen claim, named after the 1960s case which established the principle under
California law that it is a civil wrong, or tort, to conduct a raid designed
to cripple a competitor by luring away a group of its employees.
'It's fairly difficult for a plaintiff to prove but, if (the raid) delivers
a crippling blow, then it's a tort for which damages are payable,' says Mr
Kingston.
The action against Mr Scales was more commonplace, he says. If a manager,
before leaving a company, induces employees under his supervision to leave
with him, it is a breach of his fiduciary duty of loyalty to the company for
which he could be held liable in damages.
Few of these cases reach the courts, however, because where only one or two
employees have been lured away it is very hard to quantify damages. Where,
on the other hand, a large group of employees has been lured away en bloc,
as is alleged in this case, such an action becomes more viable as the
damages can be more easily quantified.
In the Little case the hiring away of almost an entire practice group is
said to have crippled Little's Dollars 4m aerospace consultancy.
The case was also about theft of trade secrets, says Mr Kingston. The
allegation is that EDS misappropriated Little's trade secrets by using Mr
Scales' inside knowledge about employees at Little and their terms and
conditions of employment to lure them away. Such knowledge would not
normally be available to outside headhunters.
Overlaying all this, however, is the allegation that the EDS action amounted
to unfair competition in breach of the California Business and Professions
Code.
According to Mr Howard Fine, a partner in the San Francisco office of Baker
&amp; McKenzie, if the Little claim is upheld by the courts it would represent a
novel application of the unfair competition law.
By granting the injunction the court appeared to be saying that, where a
company undertakes a targetted business programme to undermine a competitor
by picking out its more gifted employees, that would amount to unfair
competition.
The unfair competition law could not be used to block EDS from soliciting
one or two employees, he adds. To succeed when the action comes to trial
Little will have to show a concerted plan by EDS to damage its aerospace
consultancy. That may prove difficult, he says, unless it can produce
evidence such as internal EDS memos planning to target Little employees.
Unfair competition cases normally involve allegations of unfair business
practices and other restraints on competition, Mr Fine says. If the Little
case goes to the California Court of Appeals it could represent an important
development in the law.
But most lawyers believe the case will be settled before going to trial. Mr
Fine says the likely course of events is for the two sides to reach an
agreement that the defendant company will not solicit the plaintiff's
employees for a certain period of time. Provided it does not restrict the
freedom of individual employees to work for whomever they choose, such an
agreement could provide the basis of an amicable settlement, he says.
Mr Fox says EDS are anxious to move on and put the dispute behind them. Mr
Gallo says Little are 'not averse to settling it' on the right terms.
Clearly, a settlement would make commercial sense for both EDS and Little.
But if they do settle, the uncertainty surrounding this area of the law will
continue, and that may be in nobody's interests.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Intellectual rights given precedence -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Where intellectual property rights conflict with the interests of free
competition, intellectual property rights should take precedence, according
to a preliminary opinion of the European Court of Justice.
The interests of undistorted competition should prevail only where the
exercise of a given intellectual property right was not necessary to fulfil
the essential function of that right, according to the opinion of Advocate
General Gulmann in the appeal in the Magill TV Guide cases.
The cases concerned attempts by Magill to publish a comprehensive weekly
television guide. Copyright in TV scheduling information belonged to the
BBC, Independent Television Publications and the Irish broadcaster, Radio
Telefis Eireann, all of which published guides of their own listings. The
companies licensed daily and weekend comprehensive guides.
Magill complained to the European Commission. The Commission found the three
companies had abused their individual dominant positions by preventing the
publication and sale of comprehensive weekly TV guides in Ireland and
Northern Ireland. It ordered them to supply each other and third parties
with their individual weekly listings - that is compulsory licensing. The
companies appealed to the Court of First Instance, which found in the
Commission's favour. They then appealed to the ECJ.
Before dealing with the points raised by the parties, Advocate General
Gulmann made some remarks on the special nature of copyright. He said by
their nature copyright laws give copyright owners the right to restrict
competition. He also noted that the copyright laws of the member states
generally balance the interests of copyright owners and undistorted
competition by restricting the exclusive rights of copyright owners in
certain ways, such as giving others the right to make certain use of
copyright material on payment of a royalty.
He said that, although such a balancing of interests did not preclude
further limitations on the copyright owners' exclusive rights on the basis
of the EC Treaty's competition rules, it did mean that caution should be
exercised.
Six grounds of appeal were lodged in total by the parties and interveners.
The only ground on which the advocate-general thought that the appellants
should succeed related to the concept of abuse of a dominant position.
The appellants claimed the CFI had misconstrued this concept and its
judgments should thus be annulled. The CFI had upheld the Commission's
finding that the refusal by the parties to grant licences constituted an
abuse of a dominant position.
The central issue was whether, and if so under what circumstances, a refusal
to grant a copyright licence could constitute an abuse of a dominant
position.
It was agreed a refusal to grant licences in itself did not constitute an
abuse. However, there would be occasions where such a refusal had been
exercised under such special circumstances that it created an unacceptable
obstacle to undistorted competition and that therefore the copyright owners'
rights should be restricted by EC competition rules.
But, the advocate general stressed that, given that compulsory licensing
constituted a serious interference in copyright, there had to be substantial
and weighty competition grounds if the right to refuse copyright licences
were to be regarded as unnecessary to fulfil the essential function of the
copyright.
He considered some of the CFI's findings on this point were flawed and not
sufficient to be considered special circumstances. For example, the CFI
found the copyright owners' rights were capable of being restricted because
their refusal to grant licences prevented the emergence on the market of a
competing new product.
However, the advocate general considered that such action could be taken
only where a refusal to grant a licence prevented the emergence of a
non-competing product. Where a competing product was restricted, the
interests of the copyright owners should prevail over those of consumers.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Technology: Battle for house and home - The competition for
fun and games is heating up as PC makers take on the video giants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal computer manufacturers have always eyed the home market as an El
Dorado, a largely untapped gold mine that promises great wealth to those who
can find the right combination of technology and price.
Yet the PC industry is littered with sad tales of companies that failed to
make it into the home market, or lost huge fortunes in the attempt, such as
Coleco with its Adam home computer, the Sinclair ZX80, Commodore and IBM
with its IBM PCjr.
But despite the failures, PCs have made remarkable inroads in the US home
market. According to the Software Publishers Association, 27 per cent of US
households have PCs. Market research company Link Resources predicts that by
1998, almost 50 per cent of US households will own a PC.
'When you look at medium to large business sectors, the markets are already
very saturated,' explains Abhijeet Rane, senior industry analyst at Link
Resources. 'The home market offers much greater potential for growth than
the business market.'
While many PC companies have offered low-end models as a way into the home
market, Intel, the leading microprocessor manufacturer, has discovered that
US consumers are buying large numbers of sophisticated systems.
'Conventional wisdom says that the home PC market is served by a low-end
machine,' said Paul Otellini, senior vice-president and co-general manager
of Intel's Microprocessor Products Group. 'The facts are different, however.
Multimedia education and entertainment applications are key pieces of the
home PC marketplace and they require CPU (central processing unit)
performance as well as a robust system design.'
Intel recently launched a Dollars 150m (Pounds 100m) marketing campaign to
promote its most powerful microprocessor, the Pentium, in systems aimed at
the home market. Intel also plans to cut the price of Pentium
microprocessors at a faster rate, making Pentium-based PCs more affordable,
especially for the Christmas selling period. By the fourth quarter of this
year, Intel expects Pentium-based PCs to account for 25 per cent of all PCs
sold, with at least half being sold to the home market.
The strength of the home PC market is making its mark on the design of
future PC systems, an area that used to be driven by the demands of the
business market. For example, CD-Rom drives and sound cards are becoming
standard equipment on PCs, yet there are few business applications that
require them. Windows 4.0, the next big upgrade to Microsoft's popular
Windows user interface, will be able to run games and educational software
applications.
Software applications have always been the key to hardware sales. In the
same way that financial spreadsheet software helped boost sales of business
PC systems, games promise to help PC companies in their efforts to enter
more homes.
Market research shows that children are a key factor in determining PC
purchases. This means that the PC has to adopt some features that will
appeal to children who are already familiar with video game player machines.
But the competition is formidable. While PCs have managed to enter markets
once dominated by workstations, minicomputers and mainframes on the basis of
high performance and low price, video games players are already very cheap.
The next generation of video game players, due in 1995 from Nintendo and
Sega, will feature fast graphics and powerful microprocessors that will
rival high-end workstations at a fraction of the price.
Jeff Camp, multimedia systems product manager at Microsoft, said: 'The home
PC market is growing quickly but we have had an earful from customers
complaining about the lack of fast games for Windows systems. We are now
able to provide games that have the fast graphics that customers want.'
Developing games for PC systems has many attractions for video-game
companies. There is an installed base of about 40m Windows-based PC systems
and the distribution of games for PCs is cheaper. Nintendo and Sega charge
video game developers about Dollars 20 for each video game cartridge and
they maintain strict control over the type of games that can be played on
their systems. In contrast, there is no royalty to pay for distributing
PC-based games and there are no restrictions on the development of games.
PC owners are typically more affluent and can afford to buy more games. The
Software Publishers Association found that half of all US households with
PCs have an annual income of at least Dollars 50,000.
'PC versions of major arcade game and film hits are the fastest growing
segment of our business and of the game industry overall,' says Henry
Kaplan, chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based game
developer Hi Tech Expressions. 'Industry-wide, this segment of the market
accounted for about Dollars 800m in sales in 1993 and we expect it to grow
to Dollars 1.5bn by the end of this year.'
While Microsoft is happy to encourage third-party game developers, it is not
ignoring this fast growing market itself. The company has expanded its
consumer products division and launched its Home brand which includes
low-end versions of its business software such as word processing and
spreadsheet software plus new entertainment software.
Although Microsoft offers fast, graphics-based games such as those found in
its Arcade package, Tony Garcia, manager of the entertainment division at
Microsoft, explains that most of the games are more adult oriented. 'Games
such as Flight Simulator and our forthcoming Space Simulator offer more
depth which appeals more to adults.'
Software companies such as Utah-based WordPerfect have also targeted the
home market. Earlier this year, WordPerfect introduced its Main Street
software line, a collection of word processor, spreadsheet, games and
educational software. The company also agreed a deal with Walt Disney that
will allow it to use Disney characters to market its software in Europe.
Among PC manufacturers, Compaq Computer has been successful in reaching the
home market with its Presario models. Its success recently pushed the
company to the top in US sales for the first quarter of 1994, ahead of 1993
market leaders IBM and Apple Computer.
For now, PCs and video game-playing machines can co-exist, with most
households that have PCs also owning game machines. The battle for the home
market will be waged with the coming integration of computers and TVs in the
form of set-top TV boxes. These will be powerful computing devices, capable
of running business as well as entertainment software, and acting as
gateways to the much heralded 'information superhighways'.
PC firms such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Apple Computer are developing
their own set-top TV systems. These companies have an advantage in that
there is a huge base of software applications, not just games, that will run
on their platforms.
However, video game machine makers will not give up their huge installed
base without a fight. Nintendo, Sega and Sony are developing powerful
set-top TV systems. Nintendo has teamed with workstation manufacturer
Silicon Graphics to develop a set-top TV system that will incorporate many
of the features of a high-end 3-D graphics workstation yet retail for less
than Dollars 300.
Nintendo, Sega and Sony have an advantage in that they understand the
consumer electronics market better than their PC rivals. They also have more
widely recognised brand names and well-established distribution channels.
Whichever technology wins, it is clear that the competition for the home
market will result in larger numbers of computers in the home; allowing
parents to work from home, children to run educational and entertainment
programs and, eventually, to provide a means of managing huge data flows
from future 'information superhighways'.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Survey finds UK conveyancing best in
Europe - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International property investors believe the UK has a better legal system
for property transactions than other European countries. They also prefer
the UK's tax structure, according to a survey conducted by Gallup for
international property consultants Richard Ellis.
The survey of 68 institutions - which included Japanese life companies,
French insurers, German open funds, Dutch pension funds, Hong Kong
entrepreneurs and UK institutional investors - found that half of those
questioned thought the UK's conveyancing system was preferable to others in
Europe. Only 16 per cent thought it was worse. On the tax system, 44 per
cent thought the UK was better than its European rivals.
UK chartered surveyors were also rated more highly than their European
counterparts by 71 per cent of those questioned. But more than one-third of
those surveyed thought London's status as a world financial centre had
declined in the past five years and 26 per cent believe it will decline
further.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 4: Export trade is life's
blood of pig co-op - How Gatt has affected Danish Crown, the country's
largest pork company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Danish Crown, Denmark's largest pork company, has already started to feel
the effects of the latest General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal. This
year, the company has exported significant quantities of meat to Korea for
the first time in its history. 'It surprised us - we didn't expect it to
happen so quickly,' says Mr Kjeld Johannesen, company president. 'Korea was
a closed market for us.'
European exports of pork - mainly frozen belly and collar - reached around
6,000 tonnes in the first quarter - with Denmark providing the lion's share.
Mr Johannesen believes sales to Korea could increase to as much as 20,000
tonnes by the end of the year.
The opening up of new markets overseas is of vital interest to this huge pig
co-operative since the export trade is its life's blood. In the 1992-1993
financial year to the end of October, 85 per cent of Danish Crown's DKr9.2bn
turnover came from its export business and a third of sales were made
outside the European Union. Its overseas sales make up 12 per cent of all
Denmark's agricultural exports.
'In general, the export market is a question of survival for Denmark because
we produce many times our own needs,' says Mr Johannesen.
One of the strength's of Danish Crown's marketing efforts overseas is its
strong focus on quality products. 'The consumer's focus on food safety is
very important and that's why we like to control production from breeding to
the end-user,' he stresses.
Danish Crown is able to exert an influence on pig production through its
co-operative set-up. The company has 15,000 farmers as members, all of whom
receive a share in profits at the end of the year. Farmers also shape
company policy by electing representatives to an advisory committee which
comprises 225 producers and 22 staff. That committee elects 12 members to
the Danish Crown board of directors.
The co-operative set-up commands considerable loyalty from farmers who see
it carving a market for their produce in a way that would be impossible for
individual producers. While some farmers are tempted to sell to private
operators as these often offer a higher price, they must leave the
co-operative to do so.
'If someone is selling privately while still in the co-operative, he is
spoiling the company for a quick profit and I will make him stop or he must
leave,' says Mr Niels Rovsing, a pig farmer who is a representative on the
Danish Crown board.
Farmers are currently feeling the pinch from low pig prices in Denmark,
where as in the UK, pork profits are depressed by overcapacity. Pig prices
fell from DKr13.40 per kg two years ago to DKr8.60 per kg in January to
March this year, pushing some producers out of business. 'It has been very
tough,' said Mr Rovsing, who estimates that about one pig farmer in 20 went
out of business.
Prices are creeping back again now with the onset of the barbecue season and
the market has reached DKr9.80 a kg. But Mr Rovsing stresses that, even
though prices are low, at least farmers have a steady outlet for their pigs
which the co-operative must always take even if it sees little demand.
The decline in pig prices across Europe, which produces around 5 per cent
more animals than it consumes, highlights the importance of Danish Crown's
export sales outside the EU. The company delivers 11 per cent of its export
sales to the Japanese market, but the high value of those sales means Japan
represents 21 per cent of the value of its exports.
Those lucrative markets could be threatened by expansion of the US pig herd,
however, and increasing competition resulting from the Gatt deal. 'It is
very important that we are aware of very tight competition from the US,'
says Mr Johannesen.
Danish Crown's biggest markets still remain within the EU with Germany
overtaking the UK for the first time last year as the most important
destination. Germany took 16 per cent of the company's exports last year
with 13 per cent going to Britain.
Denmark's efforts to market its agricultural products overseas have been
very successful, aided by the homogenous domestic set-up which sees large
co-operatives controlling most of the output.
Danish Crown is part of a larger pork co-operative which sets prices to
farmers and produces a joint marketing campaign. The Dansk Slagterie, to
which Danish Crown belongs, is made up of five smaller co-operatives which
between them slaughter 96 per cent of the nation's pigs.
Danish Crown uses its high standards of production and the quality of its
meat to differentiate itself from run-of-mill producers in other countries.
This gives it a particularly important edge in the Japanese and Asian
market.
The company has over 100 veterinary inspectors who regularly check on
farmers' pig herds. It insists that regular disease checks are made on pigs
and that all feed is tested for salmonella before the animals eat it. 'The
co-operative makes it easy to influence in a short time what is being
produced by the farmer,' says Mr Johannesen.
Along with the demand from consumers for 'clean' products and calls for
free-range pigs, particularly from the UK market, Mr Johannesen sees a move
towards more old-fashioned products with a traditional taste. Danish Crown
has worked with some supermarkets to produce the Mester Porker range of pigs
which have slightly more fat than today's lean animals; they are larger and
are hung for longer to give them more flavour.
At the opposite end of the scale, Danish Crown has introduced its Green
Butcher range of meats and salad products which contain less than 3 per cent
fat. This range currently represents 2 per cent of sales in Denmark and is
sold overseas on a franchise basis. The company has recently run a large
advertising campaign for the products in the hope that it will capture 5 per
cent of the market. It is now working on a fat-reduced salami, since salami
products are widely eaten in Denmark.
Formed four years ago when three co-operatives banded together, Danish Crown
has managed to cut its costs by 10 to 15 per cent in the past two years. The
company sees a tough period ahead with increasing competition in markets
outside Europe from the US. 'It is important for us to stay in front on
standards and keep in touch with our customers' demands,' says Mr
Johannesen. 'That's how we will compete.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 4: Cuts bring home the bacon
 -Profile / Tulip International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago, Tulip International, Denmark's large processed meat
exporter, was losing DKr1m a day. Today, following a programme of severe
rationalisation, the company is back in the black and looking to increase
its markets overseas.
During that period, Tulip has been transformed from a collection of
competing farmers' co-operatives into a limited company which is 44 per cent
owned by Danish financial institutions. 'These co-operatives had been
competing for 50 years and we had to change from a slaughterhouse culture to
develop marketing and advertising strategy,' explains Mr Flemming Lindelov,
group managing director.
Tulip was formed in 1990 by the merger of the processed meat divisions of
three slaughterhouses and Danepak, a Danish-owned UK bacon company. The
slaughterhouses, which have since completed their own merger, still own a 56
per cent stake in the company. A group of bankers injected DKr625m into the
company to enable it to rationalise production capacity.
This meant closing four factories to concentrate production in three
centres. The restructuring involved a 34 per cent cut in the workforce from
4,039 employees in 1990 to 2,728 last year, while the company continues to
produce the same amount of processed meat: 150,000 tonnes a year.
The rationalisation cost roughly DKr600m, with DKr400m being spent on
closing facilities and boosting production capacity at other plants to take
up the output. The company has now managed to turn a loss of DKr270m in the
1991-1992 financial year ending in October to a net profit of DKr151m in the
last financial year.
Tulip will continue to invest in efficiency improvements by spending DKr123m
this year and DKr140m in 1995 on equipment for increasing productivity.
'We've done all you can read in management books by turning ourselves into a
company with high volume and low costs; now we must concentrate on being
customer and market-led,' Mr Lindelov says.
Tulip has put a lot of effort into product development which is vital for
its growing export trade. About 95 per cent of its production is exported
and the company has slicing, packaging and processing plants in the UK and
Germany.
Tulip receives 37 per cent of its DKr5bn turnover from the UK market where
it has 1,200 employees. Around 35 per cent of its sales come from the rest
of Europe and 11 per cent from the US.
It is a leading supplier of bacon and ham products to Marks and Spencer, the
UK retail group, for which it manufactures 30 to 40 new products a year.
'Marks and Spencer is really keen on new products; for the rest of our
markets we bring out 10 to 15 new products,' Mr Lindelov explains. The
company has 15 employees working on product innovation in the UK and 15 in
Denmark.
It is looking to Russia as a big new export market where the company is
supplying canned ham. Sales in Russia now represent DKr250m and Mr Lindelov
is confident this level could double within a couple of years. Tulip
recently opened its own warehouse in Russia and hopes to start a sales
office in Moscow.
Its canned meat division also plans to increase sales in eastern Europe and
central America. At the same time, Tulip is looking to boost its market
share in the German and Scandinavian markets where tastes are similar and
the same products can be sold.
However, last year the company drew back from the US market where it was
suffering from currency fluctuations and halved its market share in the US.
It is trying to differentiate itself in the US market by selling higher
value, low-fat ham products to delicatessen shops.
Mr Lindelov has tried to foster a culture where the company is responsive to
the needs of its customers and employees remain flexible. For example, the
head of Tulip's ham division, who was in charge of 600 people with a
turnover of DKr1.1bn, has now been moved to head a sales office in Germany
with 50 employees. 'We want to try and show that a product development
manager is as important as leading a sales division,' Mr Lindelov explains.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 4: How rennet led to
biotechnology - Profile / Christian Hansen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given Denmark's long history in the world food industry, one might expect
its food companies to have reached a mature old age. A striking exception to
this is the Christian Hansen Group, which supplies food ingredients to
multinational giants such as Nestle, Kraft, General Foods and BSN.
Christian Hansen was founded as long ago as 1874, specialising in the
manufacture of rennet, the cheese ingredient used to clot milk and give the
cheese its flavour. It is still the world's biggest rennet supplier, with
about 20-25 per cent of the world market. The world cheese market is
scarcely growing: however, that did not stop the company increasing profits
last year by 30 per cent to DKr181m (Pounds 18.65m) before tax, and by 36
per cent the year before.
With sales of around DKr1.5bn (Pounds 150m), Christian Hansen is scarcely a
giant. Neither is it a financial minnow; being heavily involved in the
glamorous business of biotechnology, it is highly rated by the stock market
and its market value stands at around DKr2.5bn (Pounds 250m).
The involvement in biotechnology is again something of a Danish speciality.
But as Mr Poul Hansen, the company president, remarks, the term can be
confusing. It is commonly taken to refer to genetic engineering, in which
Hansen is involved to some extent. But, Mr Hansen says, the company's
origins in the dairy industry mean it has been involved in biotechnology
from the outset: in enzymes and bacterial cultures, which exist in nature
but which the company began by producing in pure standardised form.
The development can be illustrated by reference to rennet, which made up
some 90 per cent of the company's sales as recently as 20 years ago. Until
the 1970s, the company produced the natural enzyme from calves' stomachs. By
the mid-1970s it was producing microbial rennet, derived from fungi or
bacteria and qualifying for use in the growing market for vegetarian cheese.
Then, some five years ago, it began producing genetic rennet, made by
replicating the animal gene but still qualifying as vegetarian in, for
instance, the UK market.
In genetic rennet, it competes with Pfizer of the US and Gist-Brocades of
Holland, both much larger than itself. However, this does not bother the
company's executives unduly. The policy, Mr Hansen says, is to operate in
niche markets, and to be big in them. Historically, the food ingredients
industry around the world consisted of small, privately owned companies in
each market. There are still a few left, Mr Hansen says, 'but we are one of
the few which have stayed independent.'
Besides Pfizer and Gist-Brocades, other giants of the pharmaceuticals
business have bought their way into the industry, such as Rhone-Poulenc of
France. But Hansen, too, has acquired some 15 smaller companies over the
years. Plainly, it is an industry in which size means something.
'The very big multinational food companies,' says Mr Vagn Dinesen,
vice-president, 'need people of a certain size as a matter of reliability.
The concentration of the food industry brings a corresponding concentration
in their suppliers. We follow our customers around the world, and our
philosophy is to service the customer at close range. It's an expensive way
of selling, but it's necessary for us.'
Take, for instance, natural food colourings, another Hansen speciality. A
certain red colouring, derived from paprika, is used in pepperoni sausage.
'We buy hundreds of tons of red peppers a year, from Spain, Brazil and
Africa,' Mr Dinesen says. 'Suppose a big American pizza chain decides it
wants to use our colouring in the pepperoni on its pizzas. When head office
has decided that, it spreads throughout the world.'
Oddly enough, the company's production is less scattered geographically than
it used to be. 'Originally,' Mr Hansen says, 'we put production in almost
every market, since transportation of rennet was a problem. Now we're
cutting back: we have six rennet plants worldwide - three in Europe, two in
South America and one in Australia.'
In colours, Hansen now has plants in the UK, Brazil, Spain and Argentina,
besides Denmark. Some of its foreign ventures have a distinctly exotic
touch. Recently, it has started up a plantation producing annatto, a bush
whose seeds have an orange-yellow colouring that is used in butter,
mayonnaise, cheese and margarine, on the estuary of the Amazon in northern
Brazil.
'Part of our philosophy,' says Mr Hansen, 'is to help industrialise food
production around the world. In Denmark or the UK, food is produced in big,
modern factories. In the Far East, it is typically made in households. Our
philosophy is to help bring food production to industrial scale, using
natural ingredients.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 3: The target is Europe -
Profile / MD Foods
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MD Foods, the large Danish dairy co-operative, is delivering milk to British
doorsteps as part of a move to stretch its reach abroad. Through its
corporate arm, MD Foods International, the co-op has bought into the UK
market in advance of the coming liberalisation of milk production.
Mr Finn Christiansen, executive director of MD Foods, explains its
international ambitions: 'We'd invested very heavily in the rationalisation
of the Danish dairy industry at the end of the 1980s and had got to the
point where growth was stagnating.'
Recognising the need to expand abroad, the co-op thought it could not ask
its 10,600 farmers to put up the cash. 'Emotionally, it's very difficult to
get farmers to understand that we would be going to other countries and
processing other producers' milk.'
Four years ago, the co-op set up MD Foods International in which it owns a
52 per cent share, with the rest of the capital supplied by institutional
investors. The Danish Dairy Federation, which represents dairy companies,
contributed some overseas assets and the Danish Dairy Suppliers, a co-op
which provides equipment to the industry, put up DKr100m (Pounds 10.3m).
Mr Christiansen stresses that MD Foods has targeted Europe as an area of
primary interest since the company believes it will face restrictions on
exports of dairy products to third countries as a result of the Gatt
settlement. In 1990, the company began its acquisition route into the UK and
it is also looking at moving into Germany.
The export trade is vital to Danish dairy farmers, who produce three times
their domestic requirements. The UK, restricted by EU milk quotas to output
covering only 85 per cent of its milk needs, is seen as an extremely
important prize by overseas suppliers.
MD has spent Pounds 150m in the UK in the past four years, gaining a 10 per
cent share of the UK milk market. 'The liberalisation of the market will
present good opportunities for us to work closely with farmers. That comes
naturally to us as that's what we do in Denmark,' Mr Christiansen explains.
The opening up of the Pounds 3bn UK milk market will leave dairies to buy
their supplies directly from farmers if they wish.
MD Foods controls 81 per cent of the milk output in Denmark - 70 per cent
directly and the rest in co-operation with Klover, another dairy group.
Milk production in Denmark has traditionally been quite fragmented with the
average producer owning just 40 cows, but growing cost pressures are forcing
dairy farmers to expand. Last year, the number of milk producers fell from
17,200 to 15,000 with the remaining farmers increasing in size. This is a
trend that is likely to continue.
Mr Christiansen believes the whole of the EU dairy market is becoming more
competitive as a result of the Gatt settlement. In the run-up to the
implementation of the Gatt deal next July, dairies are positioning
themselves on the European market and buying market share at almost any
price.
In April, MD secured an additional DKr50m to its annual investment budget of
DKr500m specifically to invest in facilities for making products aimed at
the EU market. The extra funds will probably be spent on producing
mozzarella and other cheeses for the German market.
The big impact of the Gatt deal could come on the cheese market, Mr
Christiansen believes. Cuts must be made in subsidised exports of cheese to
countries outside the EU - this will involve reducing subsidised exports to
305,000 tonnes by the year 2000.
At the same time, the EU must give access to its internal market to third
countries. Mr Christiansen reckons the combination of these two measures
will mean the EU market must absorb an additional 280,000 tonnes of cheese
by 2000. 'Prices are already being squeezed as people are trying to position
themselves in the market in anticipation of the export cuts,' he says.
MD Foods is also looking to increase its position in the European market for
higher-value products as a way of securing market share under the rigours of
Gatt. Mr Christiansen is keen to build on the success of its Lurpak butter
brand in the UK and, since the butter market is declining, substitute cheese
and dairy products.
A new cheese spread, which was launched in the UK last year, has not taken
off because Mr Christiansen acknowledges that it was placed wrongly in the
market and is too expensive. 'We need to do more research into the type of
products that will fit well into the UK,' he says.
Its new Gaio yoghurt will be introduced in the UK later this year in the
hope that it will enjoy the levels of demand found in Denmark. Since last
October, Gaio has captured a 15 per cent share of the Danish
yoghurt market - MD Foods had to cancel television advertisements several
weeks after the launch as the company did not have enough production
capacity to satisfy demand.
Gaio is based on a recipe found in a remote part of the Ukraine where
villagers traditionally live to extremely old ages. MD Foods is not allowed
to make any health claims for its product, but it has captured the
imagination of many consumers.
Eventually, MD Foods hopes to sell products such as these outside the EU,
particularly in the growing Asian market, but it is a slow process. Mr
Christiansen says he has been developing the Japanese market for 35 years to
which MD Foods sends mozzarella and cream cheese. Asia accounts for 9 per
cent of MD's export sales. 'Gradually, the Japanese are eating more pizza
and cheesecake, but they still consume very small amounts of dairy products
compared with the west,' he said.
The European dairy industry is concerned that some of these markets could be
jeopardised by the cuts in subsidised exports required by Gatt. For this
reason, the Danish Dairy Federation has suggested to the European Commission
that some farmers could produce a little extra milk at world prices.
This proposal is still in its very early stages and no final decisions have
been made, but it would get round the problem of maintaining export markets.
'If we don't find a way to produce more without subsidy, we will see that in
six years at the end of the current Gatt deal, we will have lost a big part
of the world market,' says Mr Christiansen.
Some 55 per cent of MD Foods' export sales come from outside the EU. Mr
Christiansen is hoping that he can hold onto this in spite of Gatt.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 3: Carlsberg sees China as
top market - The global reach of a brewer that (probably) exports more than
80 per cent of its output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who believes Danish business is parochial should look carefully at
Carlsberg. Around the world, brewing is for the most part a parochial
business: perhaps unsurprisingly, since a product consisting almost wholly
of water is expensive to ship.
Carlsberg, however, sells less than 20 per cent of its beer in its home
market. With the exception of Heineken of
Holland - which Carlsberg sees as its main rival - no other big brewer has
the same international reach.
In theory, at least, this is a very enviable position to be in. Rather like
the tobacco industry, brewing in the western world has seen its prospects
transformed in recent years by the opening up of vast new markets in China
and eastern Europe. Unlike the tobacco companies, most of the world's big
brewers are scarcely equipped to take advantage of the fact.
Carlsberg, by contrast, has been outward looking since its beginnings, if
only because the smallness of its home market forced it to be. Founded in
1847, it first shipped beer to England in 1860. By the turn of the century,
as Carlsberg executives will tell you today, it was putting up advertising
posters in China.
The attraction of China is no less powerful today. 'By the turn of the
century,' says Mr Michael Iuul, Carlsberg's head of international
operations, 'China will probably be the biggest (beer) market in the world:
bigger than the US.' At present, he puts the Chinese market at 70-80m
barrels a year. His forecast is for 130m barrels or more.
As with tobacco, the overseas share of that market is still minute, if only
because foreign beer is so much more expensive than the local brands. But
Carlsberg has breweries in both Hong Kong and mainland China, and its
subsidiary Danbrew - a specialist in building breweries in the developing
world - has built 10 breweries for Chinese customers to date.
Even so, Carlsberg is not currently the leading foreign brand in China. That
position, it concedes, probably belongs to San Miguel of the Philippines -
though, Mr Iuul says, 'there is very little information available.'
Besides China, Carlsberg has big breweries in Vietnam and Thailand, and has
spent the past five years trying to develop its business in Russia. Its
chief advantage lies in its strength as an international brand: and in this
respect, Mr Iuul says, its competition is 'Heineken again and again'. The
big US brewers, owners of such domestically dominant brands as Budweiser and
Miller, seem to have made little impact so far. However, given the record of
US global brands Marlboro and Coca-Cola, it would be unwise to assume this
state of affairs will last for ever. As Mr Iuul remarks of the US brewers,
'they certainly have the financial muscle'.
To an extent, all this depends on how far brands manage to establish
themselves as a global force in brewing, as they have in spirits or soft
drinks. 'In some mature markets,' Mr Iuul says, 'you are getting cheap
own-label products moving in. But in growing markets, you have a lot of
people with social aspirations. And when it comes to beer, most of the
(international) brands reflect higher quality as well.'
But however global the future may prove, Carlsberg's immediate outlook is
dominated by Europe, where it still sells around 85 per cent of its volume.
This might suggest a kind of race between a big declining European business
and a small but fast-growing overseas one. Mr Iuul does not accept this.
'The market is not losing ground in some of the traditional wine-growing
Mediterranean countries,' he says. 'Germany is a battlefield, and the UK and
France have certainly had difficult years during the recession. Over the
next few years, I see Europe as stagnant, but not declining.'
The UK market, however, is of central importance to Carls- berg's fortunes
in the near term. In 1992, it put its UK operations into a 50-50 joint
venture with Allied-Lyons, the UK brewer. The venture, known as Carlsberg
Tetley, is one of the biggest brewers in the UK and, according to out- side
estimates, Carlsberg's half share contributes close to half the group's
worldwide profits.
This makes it all the more important that the two part- ners should see eye
to eye. Allied recently went out of its way to reaffirm its com- mitment to
the venture. But in the longer term, its ambitions are in the global
business of wines and spirits, not the domestic business of UK beer.
Carlsberg, Allied hints, is in the long run the more natural owner of the
business.
Mr Iuul shrugs this off. 'I don't know', he says. 'You can have a married
couple where one says 'I want a divorce' and the other still sees the
marriage as happy. We are quite happy with the partnership. It had its
problems at the outset, but any merger has. And Allied say they are
committed and confident.'
That apart, the European market is far from stable. 'There will be a
shake-out in Europe,' Mr Iuul says. 'There is strong price competition in
many markets, which will lead to a shake-out in production costs.
Competition has also been promoted by concentration in the retail sector. A
'cheapie' sector has established itself and gained some volume, and it won't
go away.'
Similarly, he argues, the UK market is in transition. 'There is no doubt
that brewing in the UK has to be rationalised. The cost per barrel being
produced is in many cases higher than on the Continent. With further
harmonisation of beer duty, the costs have to come closer together.'
The obvious question is how far Carlsberg wants to play a part in that
process. Suppose that, as some believe, the UK market - probably the most
important to Carlsberg in the world - is doomed ultimately to end up a
brewing duopoly along American or Australian lines. Does Carlsberg want to
be a player?
Mr Iuul does not answer the question directly. The duopoly hypothesis, he
says, is a long way off. 'In general terms, we like to spread our risk. But
the UK market is one we feel comfortable with. We've been there a long time.
When you go into a country like Vietnam, your knowledge of local conditions
is bound to be more superficial.'
To venture a paraphrase: Carlsberg is looking to a brave new world, but it
cannot afford to turn its back on the old world either.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 2: A model for eastern Europe
 -Advice to farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With 20m pigs in a country with only 5m people, it is clear that the focus
of Danish agriculture must be on finding markets elsewhere. Farmers are
increasingly geared towards producing for the export trade.
But it is not just pork and milk that are exported from Denmark; its farming
advisory service has gained such a prominent reputation overseas that
advisers are now exporting the 'Danish model'.
The Danish Agricultural Advisory Service is owned by producers and run in a
similar way to the co-operatives which dominate farm output in Denmark.
Local advisers must answer to a board of farmers which also dictates
priorities for research. This structure helps information to be disseminated
as quickly as possible to a range of farmers.
The advisory service runs 95 local centres at a cost of DKr1.1bn (Pounds
112m) a year: the government provides some of the funds but most is put up
by farmers themselves. The organ- isation runs a national head- quarters at
Skejby near Aar- hus in Jutland, providing a resource centre for local
advisers with a budget of DKr238m. It also helps to chan- nel requests to
research bodies.
The system has been so successful in Denmark that its advisers are helping
set up similar operations in eastern Europe. Danish agricultural advisers
are currently working in Poland, and the three Baltic countries: Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.
One of the advisers points to the difficulties of setting up a system which,
in essence, is run by farmers on the ground in countries that have been used
to receiving orders from the top. 'We try to stress that we are supporting
farming in the same way that fertilisers are: we are just one input,' says
Mr Niels Gert Nielsen, an international adviser.
The structure of the Danish farming industry, which comprises some 70,000
mainly family farmers, makes it important that advice is offered at a local
level and that the process involves as many producers as possible.
With the current emphasis on reform of the common agricultural policy in the
European Union, and all that involves in price cuts, farmers need all the
help they can get.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 2: Coping with the challenge
of Gatt - Bjorn Westh, the minister of agriculture, talks to Hilary Barnes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark has a position of strength in food production which offers
opportunities for development, says Mr Bjorn Westh, the minister of
agriculture who is sometimes tipped to become his country's next EU
Commissioner.
'We do not think there is anything old-fashioned about producing food,' he
declares in an interview. 'The food industry gives rise to 25 per cent of
all employment in Danish industry. It brings in about DKr55bn (Pounds 5.7bn)
a year in export revenues, and export revenues are required to keep the
welfare state going. If we want to develop the welfare state we must have
jobs in industries which earn foreign currency, and in the food industry we
have a position of strength that we must utilise.'
This might seem a bold commitment at a time when European agriculture is
being forced by reforms of the common agricultural policy and the Gatt deal
to curb production and exports. Mr Westh does not dispute the fact that the
future of Danish agriculture and its related export industries is dependent
on how the European Union reacts to the Gatt.
On the other hand, he does not have much time for calculations which show
that Danish farm incomes will be cut by DKr2bn or so - 7 or 8 per cent of
gross factor income - by Gatt. 'They don't take into account the new market
opportunities, so they are unhelpful, static calculations. The world does
not stand still, and Denmark is not standing still.
'On our part, we want the European Council, in connection with this year's
price negotiations, to approve a declaration calling on the Commission to
work out a strategy by which the European countries can utilise the new
market opportunities which the Gatt will provide.'
Mr Westh is referring to the obligation of Gatt signatories to allow at
least 3 per cent of their food supplies to be imported, rising to 5 per cent
after five years. 'We see Gatt as a challenge, and we must go on the
offensive. We must ensure that we are active and that it is not the
Americans, the New Zealanders or the Cairns Group countries who run away
with everything,' he says.
As the Gatt calls for a reduction in exports of subsidised products, 'we
want to put the Commission to work to see if we cannot abolish or reduce
export subsidies.
'The EU corn price is still 10-15 per cent above the world market price. If
we can bring it down to the world market price, corn exports would not be
subject to export subsidies, and neither would products based on corn, such
as pigmeat and poultry. A side-effect of this would be that we would no
longer need obligatory set-aside policies.'
This view finds support in the UK and France, he says, but other EU
countries will resist it. However, he points out that if the EU does not
succeed in adopting policies which allow exports to third (ie, non-EU)
countries, Denmark will have to sell large quantities of dairy and pigmeat
products in Europe, with a painful impact on prices. 'I think this argument
will mean that some countries will begin to listen to what we are saying.'
As Mr Westh sees it, Danish food exports will not compete with exports from
developing countries, at least not directly. 'We shall compete in markets
where there are consumers who want high quality products and have the means
to pay, especially markets in south-east Asia, such as Japan, Korea,
Singapore, some south American markets and the Nordic market.
'Danish agriculture will try to live up to this strategy through an
aggressive, broad quality policy, from conditions on the farm through
processing to transport  .. Quality is having control over environmental
problems, over the surroundings in which animals live, and not only the
product itself.'
As an example, he points out that a major effort is being made at the moment
to eliminate salmonella from infecting pigs on the farm or at any stage of
processing.
Mr Westh is on the whole an optimist. Last year Danish pig production passed
20m for the first time. 'I don't see why we shouldn't produce 25m pigs by
the year 2000, and perhaps more milk than we do today as well,' he says.
'If I am relatively optimistic it is also because when you look around the
world you see the environmental issues coming into focus. We have a good
chance of handling these problems successfully, not only because we started
to tackle them early on but because we have a structure which makes the
problems easier to tackle. You only have to look at a big food producer like
Holland, which has twice as many animals and three times as many people in
an area a third the size of Denmark.'
Legislation which restricts the number of farms that one farmer may own or
lease, and regulates the number of animals per hectare of land, will prevent
the establishment of gigantic pig farms, however. 'We do not want individual
units to be too big. There are veterinary and health dangers in very big
units. In return we have told the farmers that they can own and lease more
units.
'This goes together with our quality approach. We do not want a policy which
encourages the use of medicines, and we want the farmers to be able to keep
an eye on the health of the animals,' he says.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 2: The skill not to turn its
back on the basics - Tony Jackson on Danisco, a big fish in its pond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trouble with the Danish food industry, according to one of its most
senior executives, is that its output is just too basic. Take meat and
animal products, says Mr Elvar Vinum, chief financial officer of Danisco,
the food group. 'We're still selling raw materials too much. We have to do
more to develop them.'
Since Danisco makes much of its money from such basic activities as refining
sugar beet and freezing peas, it might seem open to the same criticism. Not
at all, says Mr Vinum. There is a lot of skill in freezing and distributing
vegetables to the standards required by international food companies such as
Unilever and Nestle. As for sugar, the company has more than 120 years of
experience. It is a business in which efficiency is all: and Danisco, Mr
Vinum says, is one of the two or three most efficient sugar refiners in
Europe.
Danisco was formed at the start of 1989 through the merger of three publicly
quoted Danish companies: Danish Sugar (much the biggest of the three),
Danish Distillers - almost the monopoly Danish producer of spirits,
especially aquavit - and Danisco itself, a maker of food ingredients. The
motive, says Mr Vinum, was simply one of growth. Taken together, the three
companies would have 'more momentum'.
The rationale of the new group was that it should be in 'food-related'
industries. This involved a lot of pruning: some 43 per cent of the original
group by turnover, chiefly in engineering, has been got rid of. At the same
time, the group has been expanding in packaging, both in corrugated board in
the UK and Denmark and in flexible plastic packaging around the world.
This apparently paradoxical broadening of the portfolio is defended by Mr
Vinum. 'We've been in packaging for a very long time,' he says. 'It's a
business we felt we knew something about.' The packaging is mostly for food
products, and the great bulk of it is for outside customers. It is not, in
other words, an old-fashioned case of vertical integration. 'We're not in
packaging to provide it for our own products. It's a business on its own.'
Although unusually large for a Danish company - comfortably among the top 10
quoted companies in market value - Danisco counts only as a medium-sized
food group in global terms. In 1992-93 its sales were DKr13bn (Pounds
1.3bn), and its market value is about DKr10.71bn (Pounds 1.1bn). However, it
is plainly ambitious. Since the merger, and not counting the financial year
1993-94 just ended, it has spent DKr5.5bn on acquisitions and the same
amount again in capital expenditure.
The largest part of the investment, says Mr Vinum, has been in sugar.
Besides being the Danish monopoly producer of beet sugar, Danisco paid
DKr2.2bn in 1992 for its opposite number in Sweden, making it the fourth
biggest producer in Europe. Also two years ago, it bought eight small sugar
refineries in Germany and is just finishing the task of combining them into
one European-scale plant, at a total cost of a further DKr1bn.
Acquisitions apart, a lot of the expenditure has gone on the food
ingredients subsidiary Grindsted, which grew out of the original Danisco.
This is a truly global business, with new capacity recently installed in
Denmark, the US, Mexico, Chile and Malaysia. Grindsted, says Mr Vinum, is
one area where 'we can see a lot of growth around the world'.
The trick, he says, is to work very closely with the customers, the food
manufacturers. 'For instance, we are one of the world's biggest producers of
pectin' (used in making marmalade). 'That's a very specialised field, where
the customer wants to be absolutely sure the pectin produces his marmalade
every time.'
Another Danisco subsidiary, Taffel, is itself a marmalade producer. 'It took
Grindsted quite a long time to break into that company with their pectin
after the merger. The customers know exactly what they want, and to change
may be very difficult.'
Yet another area still offering scope for expansion is packaging: both in
northern Europe - taken to include the UK - and in the US. Danisco, says Mr
Vinum, is particularly interested in the US because the sale of its
engineering businesses reduced its activities there, so that almost its only
activity now is food ingredients. 'We're open to acquisitions,' he says.
The one part of the business which looks decidedly unglamorous at present is
distilling. Eighteen months ago, in an event which has distinct echoes in
the UK at present, the Danish government cut the duty on beer by some 40 per
cent to protect local brewers from German imports. Duty on wine was cut as
well, but not on spirits. As a result, Danisco complains bitterly, alcohol
drunk through the medium of its products is taxed at six times the rate of
that on beer or wine.
Given that Denmark has the highest duty on spirits in the European Union,
this was predictably damaging. Last year, Danish consumption of spirits fell
11 per cent, while the markets for beer and wine went up 2 per cent and 9
per cent respectively. The result, as Danisco points out, is to distort
competition. Whether the government is prepared to forgo yet more revenue to
set that right is not yet clear.
Either way, the company's attention is devoted much more to the
international arena these days. At the start of this year, it undertook an
international offering of DKr1.15bn worth of convertible bonds, with around
70 per cent taken up by foreign investors. The goal, Mr Vinum says, is to
get foreign ownership of the company's equity up to around 20-25 per cent.
At present it is half that.
The company, in other words, is showing signs of outgrowing its native
financial system. As it expands on the world stage, it seems not impossible
that it will one day attract the unwelcome attentions of one of the real
giants of the food industry. So far, however, it remains a big fish in a
respectably-sized Scandinavian pond.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 2: Market leader in meat
machinery - Profile / Wolfking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever you eat fast food, the chances are high that the ground meat in the
burger, the chicken nuggets in the salad or the salami slices on the pizza
were churned out by machinery from a small Danish company, Wolfking.
With few exceptions, the Danish companies which manufacture machinery for
the food processing industry are small, but they often have a substantial
share of the world market in their special area.
Wolfking is typical. At its headquarters in the town of Slagelse, on
Sjlland, it employs about 200 people and has a turnover of about DKr160m
(Pounds 16.5m), but it is nevertheless a market leader in its field. About
85 per cent of its production is exported. Its biggest market, where it
employs a sales and service staff of 25, is the US, followed by the UK,
Germany and France.
The global range of its exports, which go to China, Japan, Korea, and South
America as well as the US and Europe, has helped Wolfking maintain its
growth despite downturns in individual national or regional markets.
Started as a family business in 1949, Wolfking has been a member of the
Danish BJH Group since 1979. BJH is an unlisted private company with a
turnover of about DKr1bn, mainly from production of raw materials for the
European petfood industry.
Since 1949, Wolfking's employment has more than doubled to more than 200 in
Slagelse itself. In addition, it has sales and service companies in the US,
the UK and Germany. It works through agents in another 30 countries or so.
Two years ago it bought a Dutch company, Belam, which concentrates on ham
production systems, with 50 employees. Altogether, the Wolfking companies
have a turnover of about DKr200m.
Wolfking produces all the machinery which is required by butchers,
supermarkets and mass-producers of minced-meat products or hams from the
point at which raw materials are delivered to the final handling and
portioning of the finished product (but not packaging machinery) - ranging
through simple machines to semi- and fully-automated systems, including
'grinders, mixers, emulsifiers, injectors, tenderisers, massagers, pumps and
transport equipment', according to its catalogue.
The acquisition of Belam is an indication of things to come. Other companies
which have high-quality products and product programmes are being sought to
complement Wolfking's existing business.
Most of Wolfking's machinery is for the meat industry, but not all. The
company also manufactures food pelleting systems for the fish-farming
industry, machines for making processed cheese, and plant to produce
fish-fodder for mink (which is no accident: Denmark is the world's largest
producer of mink skins). Some of its equipment also goes to the
pharmaceutical and chemical industries, bakeries, and producers of chocolate
and sweets.
Where Wolfking has the edge over its international competitors, says Mr
Jacob Dilling-Hansen, marketing manager, is in its supply of complete,
fully-automated processing lines. 'No one else makes such complete machinery
systems as we do.'
As a supplier of automated production systems, says Mr Dilling-Hansen, 'we
are cleaning up the market. Our share of the world market for systems of
this kind is about 75 per cent.'
Wolfking gained its first reference for this kind of system by delivering
the equipment for a big plant operated by Tulip International, the Danish
company, for minced-meat products at Vejle, Jutland. The plant was installed
at the end of the 1980s. Since then, it has delivered complete systems to
Germany, Spain, Norway and the UK, where one of its production lines turns
out 75 tonnes an hour, 24 hours a day, six days a week for Spillers, the
petfood group, near Glasgow.
The development of these large-scale systems has taken Wolfking into the era
of computer-aided design and manufacturing and computer-integrated
manufacturing systems. All project development, engineering and design is
done on three-dimensional CAD network. Plant control software is developed
in-house.
When machinery or complete systems are delivered, the same engineers who
worked on production are sent to the customer to undertake installation and
start-up, says Mr Dilling-Hansen.
One of the company's main pre-occupations is to ensure that its machinery
meets the requirements of the European Union's machinery directive, which
comes into force in 1995. The directive concerns hygiene and safety. 'We
expect that all our machinery will receive the 'CE' stamp by then,' says Mr
Dilling-Hansen, 'and we think that many of our competitors will have trouble
meeting the deadline.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry: A healthy appetite for world
markets - The food industry accounts for a quarter of exports and has been
hit by the recent Gatt deal. But there could be new opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
An English schoolgirl who was asked in the 1980s what she associated with
Denmark, replied: 'pig, pig, bacon, pig'. This may not be an uncommon image,
but there is much more both to modern Denmark and to its food industry.
Though it rears more than 20m pigs a year and still provides the
best-selling imported bacon in Britain, Denmark, with only 5m people,
produces enough food for three times that number. It also has a large share
of world markets in other areas apart from pigmeat where it has specialised,
such as cheese and fresh and frozen fish.
The food industry provides between 12 and 18 per cent of Denmark's domestic
employment, (depending on the definition used), and accounts for about 25
per cent of the country's merchandise exports.
Denmark is the world's fifth-largest exporter of food products, according to
a report produced for the Ministry for Industry last year, and a 16 per cent
increase in output over the past 10 years has enabled it to maintain its
share of world markets.
Manufacturing industry long ago overtook agriculture as the country's main
export industry, and now provides about 70 per cent of the country's
merchandise exports, but agriculture and fisheries still account for about 5
per cent of total employment and roughly the same share of total production.
The rise of the primary food industries - pigmeat, dairy products and fish -
has been accompanied, too, by the development of companies in associated
industries, many of them world leaders. These include Novo Nordisk,
Christian Hansen Group and Grindsted Products, producers of food ingredients
such as enzymes, emulsifiers, stabilisers and flavourings; Foss Electric and
Radiometer in instrumentation; and APV Danish Turnkey Dairies and Niro
Atomiser in food processing machinery.
Carlsberg has, of course, established itself, too, as a leading
international brewing company. Danisco, the sugar, distilling, frozen
vegetables and packaging group, is less well-known internationally but has
become one of the largest European producers of beet sugar through
acquisitions in Sweden and Germany, and is one of the country's largest
listed industrial corporations.
The food and food technology industries, because of their vital importance
to the health of the Danish economy, have been pinpointed by the government
as one of the sectors on which Denmark's future growth and prosperity will
depend.
For this reason the government is helping to finance a substantial programme
of research, which, it is hoped, will enable the country to lift the quality
of its products along the route from the farm to the table.
The strong position which the country holds in the food industry goes back a
long way. Denmark was one of a few countries in Europe which did not react
to the challenge of cheap American corn in the 1870s by raising import
barriers. Instead, its farmers had to find alternative sources of income,
and as a result, developed a lucrative market exporting butter, eggs and
bacon to the UK.
The country's food and food technology industry has never looked back. Since
entry into the then European Communnity further support for Denmark's
primary agricultural industry has come from the common agricultural policy,
which subsidises exports to non-member countries.
Yet, a threat of sorts does now hang over the sector in the shape of the
recent Gatt agreement, which calls for a reduction of 34 per cent in the
volume of exports of subsidised products.
Mr Bjorn Westh, minister for agriculture, sees the Gatt agreement as a
challenge, which opens up opportunities to win new markets. and he is
calling for an attacking policy on the part of Europe to make the best of
these opportunities.
Mr HOA Kjeldsen, president of the Agricultural Council (an umbrella
organisation for almost all the Danish farmers' organisations) shares the
minister's view, although, as he says, his members 'face a harsh period of
adaptation'.
The rest of Europe has a special reason to be interested in the Danish food
industry and its ability to adapt. A large share of Denmark's agricultural
exports goes to non-European Union countries, especially cheese, a product
in which Iran is the largest export market by tonnage. The Middle East is an
important market for butter and milk powder and Japan has overtaken the UK
as the most important market for Danish pigmeat (by value, though not by
tonnage).
As Mr Westh points out, policies which allow Denmark to continue to export
to third countries should be of interest to other European countries.
Otherwise, the products concerned will be offloaded on to the European
market, causing serious downward pressure on prices.
He wants the European Union to consider bringing the European corn price
down to the world market level. This would eliminate the subsidy element in
the production of pigmeat and poultry, which are fed on corn products. No
quantitative restrictions, would as a result need to be imposed under the
terms of Gatt agreement, on exports.
Mr Kjeldsen also wants Europe to introduce B-quotas for milk production. The
B-quota would be priced at the world market price and could be used to help
Denmark to maintain its exports of cheese, butter, and powdered milk exports
outside Europe.
Prospects for the primary food industry clearly depend on access to world
markets, but Denmark has one important advantage. Pigmeat, the most
important agricultural export product, is not directly supported under the
common agricultural policy and its exports are therefore not threatened by
the Gatt agreement in the same way as dairy products and beef.
Though pessimists focus on the food surplus in European countries in
considering the future of the agricultural food industry, others, such as Mr
Erik Juul Jorgensen, head of the private Institute for Food Studies and
Agro-industrial Development, in Copenhagen, focus on the global market. They
predict a strong increase in demand for food, and see few limits to the
potential for Danish production and exports, given a satisfactory world
trading regime. In a 1992 report, Mr Juul Jorgensen argued that Denmark
could double production by its agricultural, food processing and
agro-technical industries between 1990 and 2001.
The pig farmers have shown the way. Between 1989 and 1993, pig production
increased from 15.5m to more than 20m animals per year, or by 30 per cent.
Pigmeat prices over the past year have been so low, however, that no further
increase in production is expected.
Mr Bent Sloth, chairman of the Association of Danish Slaughterhouses and
himself a pig producer, predicts that pig output will not rise from the
present level for several years. However, Mr Westh believes production may
well reach 25m by 2000, and Mr Juul Jorgensen sees no reason why it should
not reach 30m during the first decade of the next century.
A feature of the agricultural sector is the domination by the co-operative
movement. Two co-operative dairies, MD Foods and Klover Milk, account for 90
per cent of the milk produced on farms. Five slaughterhouse groups account
for almost all the pig production. MD Foods and the two largest
slaughterhouse groups, Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier (West Jutland
Abbatoirs) are among the largest companies in their industries in Europe.
The co-operatives, which are governed by a democratic system of one man, one
vote, provide the dairies and slaughterhouses with a unique degree of
vertical integration from farmer through processing to export sales.
One of the disadvantages of the co-operative system according to its
critics, is its inability to raise equity capital from external sources. The
co-operatives have found a way round this limitation, however, through the
establishment of MD Foods International in the dairy sector, and Tulip
International in the meat sector,
MD Foods, which has invested heavily in the UK dairy industry, and Tulip,
which is the processing arm of Danish Crown, (producing such items as minced
meat and ham, as opposed to fresh and frozen cuts), are partly financed by
equity from Danish institutional investors.
Critics of the co-operatives also say the industry has been slow in
embarking on production of more highly processed foods, such as charcuterie
products and convenience foods, but Mr Kjeldsen rejects that charge. 'Most
of our exports are high-quality, processed raw products. We obtain
attractive prices, for example, for our pigmeat exports to Japan, because we
make products with a uniform high quality. We would earn less if we went
into highly processed convenience foods and sold them under our brand names,
a business that requires an enormous investment.'
Although the farmers are enduring tough times at the moment, Mr Kjeldsen is
not discouraged. 'When young people ask me if there is a future in farming,
my answer is: Yes. There will always be problems, but there are problems
whatever sector you are in. A well-educated farmer has a good future in
Denmark,' he says confidently.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Go-betweens for business
angels - Richard Gourlay examines the growth of informal capital financing
and the marriage bureaux set up to bring companies and cash together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Informal capital supplied by business angels is increasingly recognised as
an important source of finance for small private companies.
Yet it is a stark fact that very few, if any, of the marriage bureaux that
bring together wealthy individuals and private businesses make ends meet.
Almost all have required subsidies from government, corporate sponsors, or
other parts of their own business, to cover the full cost of their service.
Even in the US, where the entrepreneurial seam runs deeper, the most
successful marriage bureaux are subsidised.
This is not to say private investors are not backing private companies.
Introductions are probably made every day in the golf club and through
family ties. According to some estimates, as much as Pounds 2bn has been
invested in the UK informally over the last 10 years.
The government clearly believes this informal investment is an appropriate
form of finance for undercapitalised companies too small or too risky to be
considered worthy of formal venture capital. But are introduction services,
as currently structured, likely to increase substantially this flow of risk
capital?
In last month's white paper on competitiveness, the government said it
wanted to work with Business Link organisations, TECs and the private sector
to encourage informal investment. The DTI would work to try to help develop
'national coverage of a local brokerage service throughout England', the
white paper said.
But neither the white paper nor the DTI have said whether the government
will provide any funding for this. The DTI's pump-priming funding runs out
next December for the five business introduction pilot schemes it backed two
years ago.
The DTI has tried, but failed, to encourage the formation of a national
database. The agencies - Venture Capital Report, Linc, Capital Exchange and
Techinvest - could not agree the form such a national service should take.
As a result, the introduction agency market remains fragmented and the
service offered to subscribers varies greatly. The following are some of the
leading providers:
Venture Capital Report. Lucius Cary, who started VCR 16 years ago, is the
grandfather of the business angel introduction industry. Publisher of a
monthly report that goes to the 634 business angels on its books, VCR claims
to be the most interventionist of the bureaux, assessing projects at a depth
not attempted by other services.
This, VCR argues, filters out the non-starters and gives busy investors a
warts-and-all view of businesses including the amount of equity on offer.
VCR consultants spend half a day interviewing the company and then compile a
five-page summary of the business proposition for publication in the report.
Investors pay Pounds 300 a year to subscribe; companies Pounds 350 and, on
completion of a deal, a Pounds 1,000 fee plus 2.5 per cent of any money
raised. VCR normally does about 15 deals a year but has already done 17 in
the last six months, raising Pounds 1m. It has raised Pounds 15m since it
was set up. Expansion of the formula is constrained by the time required for
each appraisal. (Tel 0491 579999)
The Local Investment Networking Company. Comprising 12 Training and
Enterprise Councils and Enterprise Agencies, this national umbrella group is
sponsored by the private sector. Councillors ensure business plans are
complete but their assessment has in the past been seen as more perfunctory
than VCR's.
The company seeking equity writes a two-page summary that is published in
Linc's monthly bulletin. Linc says there are 250 investors on the books of
regional members who have helped raise about Pounds 4.5m for 95 businesses
since the group was set up in 1987.
It says investor meetings run by its members are increasingly popular; at
each meeting about six companies tread the catwalk before potential
investors in a beauty parade.
Linc's record has been patchy. Some members, like Staffordshire Development
Association, have been active and successful. Others have done almost no
deals and have left Linc. Companies pay Pounds 200, investors Pounds 120 a
year; some of the Linc members charge commissions when cash is successfully
raised. (Tel 071 236 3000).
Techinvest. Based in Cheshire and one of the DTI's five demonstration
programmes, Techinvest is one of the more successful regional introduction
services. Started in February 1993, it has 79 angels on its books and says
it has raised more than Pounds 1m for 20 deals in 12 businesses. (Pounds
500,000 was provided in one deal by a venture capital group.)
The service offers companies seeking money a subsidised advisory service
during which consultants put the proposal into shape. It also runs investor
meetings and plans to open them to the public for a fee next month.
Techinvest sends some of its proposals to VCR and some to Linc for inclusion
in Linc's national bulletin. Investors and companies pay Pounds 200 to join
 -Pounds 400 if their cases are published through VCR - and a fee similar to
VCR's if cash is successfully raised. The source of future funding is
uncertain. (Tel 0606 737009.)
The Capital Exchange. The youngest of the four partners the DTI was trying
to encourage, Capital Exchange is purely a publishing operation. It aims to
provide a market place for information and attempts to provide angels with a
wide choice of businesses, but it does not vet its investors.
A network of self-employed principle advisers spends about three hours
verifying that companies seeking funds have a complete business plan. These
advisers receive part of the Pounds 120 fee that the companies pay for
inclusion in a newsletter.
Capital Exchange says it has found as much interest among corporate as
private investors. Set up late last year, Capital Exchange says it has found
joint venture partners or equity for 19 businesses. It has no way of
verifying how much of the Pounds 2.8m sought was actually raised. It has
1,100 members, 700 of which are investors, who pay Pounds 75 a year
membership. (Tel 0432 342484.)
Somewhat different from all of these is 3i, the UK's largest supplier of
private equity to private companies. At the height of the recession, 3i had
used successful businessmen and women with time on their hands as
non-executive directors, particularly in smaller companies which the group
was refinancing.
Increasingly these non-executives wanted and took equity stakes, investing
alongside 3i in classic informal financings where the managerial expertise
of the angel was as important as the cash.
The group says that a large number of its deals worth less than Pounds
500,000 now follow this pattern of co-investments alongside business angels.
In the 17 months to the end of December 1993, 3i co-invested in 53 companies
in this way; its contribution is between three and 10 times what the angels
invest, depending on the size of the deal. 3i says it has 150 business
angels on its books, many of whom want more than one non-executive equity
investment. The angel is often the factor that makes the deal viable, 3i
says.
Other groups trying to introduce angels and opportunities include accounting
firms such as Blackstone Franks that keep a database as part of their
service to customers.
The National Westminster Bank has said it will launch a pilot introduction
service that will incorporate a national database of business angels. The
launch has been delayed but NatWest says it is developing the product. Other
introduction agencies are listed in a booklet produced by the British
Venture Capital Association.
One group not in this guide is Enterprise Adventure (Tel 0483 458111), which
launched a national database last week called Venturelist. Computer-based,
it hopes to be a national clearing house which angels can access via modems.
After a period in which the service is free, companies will pay Pounds 300
for a quality assessment by a consultant and an entry on the database.
Individual investors will pay Pounds 500 - firms of accountants bringing a
number of angels will pay Pounds 1,000.
Like the other services, Venturelist will depend heavily on getting an
adequate supply of angels and a strong enough deal flow.
Pinning down angels and the amount they invest is notoriously difficult. But
if recent research is to be believed, there are about 50,000 informal
investors in the UK. Colin Mason, of the University of Southampton,
guestimates angels have as much as Pounds 3bn they would invest if only they
could be joined with business opportunities.
A better flow of information would clearly facilitate more marriages between
angels and entrepreneurs. But judging by the record, most angels will
continue to find their investment opportunities through their own networks
rather than through the energetic offices of the business introduction
services.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Call for trust changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Venture Capital Association is this week expected to tell the
government its proposed venture capital trusts need substantial changes if
they are to be attractive to investors and sponsors.
In a submission to the Inland Revenue, the BVCA says the VCTs need to be
allowed to invest in larger companies and says greater tax breaks are
required to attract investors.
The government announced it would launch the VCTs in last November's budget
as one of a number of measures to encourage private investment in small
companies.
While the idea has been welcomed in principle, the structure proposed by the
Inland Revenue has been widely criticised as providing insufficient reward
for the added risks of investing in unlisted companies.
The BVCA wants the single investment limit to be Pounds 2m, compared with
the Revenue's proposed figure of Pounds 1m; the Association of Investment
Trust Companies wants a Pounds 3m ceiling.
The BVCA also wants investors to enjoy capital gains tax roll-over relief
when they sell quoted or other investments and reinvest the gains in the
VCTs. Since the last budget, this relief has been available on direct
investment in private companies.
The government wants the VCTs to help attract private equity investment in
start-ups, new and high-technology and smaller companies.
The BVCA argues that, by only allowing investment in this type of small
company, the VCTs would be unattractive to investors and highly risky.
It argues the government should consider either up-front relief against
income tax at 20 per cent or tax relief for investments in the smallest
companies, for example below Pounds 500,000, instead of the proposed tax
relief on dividends and capital gains.

FT  07 JUN 94 / New-car sales regain buoyancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New-car registrations in May were up 10 per cent year-on-year as demand
rebounded from the impact of tax increases in April.
Registrations increased to 150,070 from 136,386 in the same month a year
ago, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
The rate of growth in car registrations slowed in April with a year-on-year
increase of 4.8 per cent, but sales strengthened again in May in particular
in the retail and small-business market.
Car registrations of 821,515 in the first five months were 13.3 per cent
higher than the 725,116 of the same period a year ago.
Early in the year growth in fleet-car sales (to operators of at least 25
cars) outpaced the market. This was reversed last month. Sales to retail and
small-business customers in May were up 13.9 per cent year-on-year compared
with an increase of 6.2 per cent in fleet-car sales.
Mr Ernie Thompson, chief executive of the SMMT, said the motor industry was
'poised for a better than expected 1994' following the 'encouraging' upturn
in May. Carmakers were driving the market forward by 'recourse to active
promotional programmes'.
The UK is one of the main growth markets for new-car sales in Europe and
manufacturers are intensifying their marketing activities with an array of
cash rebates, special editions and other incentives.
Mr Ken Martindale, chairman of Lookers, one of the leading UK motor dealer
groups, said last week that some carmakers had made 'frantic efforts' to
maintain market share in recent months. This had led 'to forced
registrations not backed up by 'real sales'.' The manufacturers' intense
marketing activities, however, had created 'some profit opportunities' for
dealers, he said.
Mr Paddy Byrne, sales director of Ford of Britain, the leader of the UK
new-car market, said car registrations for the whole of this year were
forecast to rise by 10 per cent to 1.95m from 1.78m last year.
The industry is preparing for the traditional surge in car registrations
that takes place in August with the change of registration prefix.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Loans blow for recovery denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lenders were keen yesterday to damp concerns that the latest monthly figures
on lending from the CSO reflect a setback for the consumer-led recovery.
'The situation is still buoyant as far as we are concerned,' said Mr Gordon
Rankin, deputy marketing director of Barclays Bank. 'Our finance and
credit-card operations have not seen any drop off in business, with May and
the first few days of June showing positive growth,' he said. Mr Dick
Spelman, general manager of marketing for Halifax, said that Class 3 loans -
unsecured personal loans and overdrafts - were buoyant 'across a wide range
of customers. We have seen month on month improvements from March to April
and then April to May.'
The CSO figures show that total lending to consumers fell from Pounds 518m
in March to Pounds 413m in April. This was mainly due to a sharp fall -
Pounds 131m - in lending by finance houses which in turn was due mainly to
falls in lending for vehicle purchases and store goods.
But the finance houses do not appear concerned. Lombard, a NatWest
subsidiary, says 'the fall in car lending is not significant because of the
seasonal nature of this business'. Lombard said it was not adjusting its
view that 'the market will be around 2m new car units in 1994 compared to
1.78m in 1993'.
This view was reiterated by Ms Lesley Kay of the Finance and Leasing
Association. 'It's not surprising to see that lending for car purchases has
fallen,' she said. 'It is a reflection of the fact that consumers brought
forward their car purchases to the first three months of this year in
response to special deals from dealers.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / FoE calls for more wind farms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, wants more wind farms to be
built in spite of criticism of their economic value and visual impact.
In guidelines published today the group calls on planners and wind-power
developers 'to ensure high-quality, publicly supported wind-power projects
continue to appear in the countryside'.
It suggests planning refusals have been influenced by 'a sometimes
vociferous anti-wind power minority'.
Wind power has divided environmentalists. It is a renewable energy source
but it requires a large number of obtrusive turbines to generate a small
amount of electricity.
The Council for the Protection of Rural Wales has called for a moratorium on
development and local authorities have recently taken a more restrictive
attitude.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Health climbdown on coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government announced a significant climbdown on coal privatisation
yesterday when it said it would retain responsibility for health and injury
claims resulting from service with British Coal before privatisation.
Its decision, confirmed by Lord Strathclyde, a trade and industry minister,
follows pressure from potential buyers of the corporation who said they
would be deterred from bidding unless the government capped the illness
liabilities.
Yesterday's announcement leaves outstanding differences between the
government and prospective bidders over other liabilities including
subsidence and pollution.
However, the illness issue was the most significant of the differences.
Previously the government had suggested that new owners of the industry
would have to pick up the entire bill for future claims even if some of the
illness related to a period when the worker was in British Coal's
employment.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Minford attacks plans for councils
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to scrap Scotland's two-tier system of local government
will reduce the Scottish economy's ability to compete internationally and
could lead to chaos, Professor Patrick Minford said yesterday.
Prof Minford, a rightwing economist and one of the of 'wise men' who advise
the Treasury, said large local authorities were needed to take strategic
planning decisions involving such things as roads, factories and airports.
The costs of such projects were heavily concentrated in a particular
locality whereas the benefits were spread widely. Planning powers given to
small local councils to block development on 'not in my backyard' grounds
would limit Scotland's ability to compete for inward investment.
Prof Minford was in Glasgow addressing businessmen and councillors invited
by Labour-dominated Strathclyde regional council, which is fighting
government plans to replace it and its 19 district councils with 12 unitary
authorities under the Scottish local government reform bill.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Business failures 'likely to fall by 10%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business failures during 1994 will be 10 per cent lower than last year,
Trade Indemnity, the specialist trade credit insurer, forecast yesterday.
The number of company failures notified to Trade Indemnity was up 10.7 per
cent to 1,037 in the first quarter of 1994 compared with the last quarter of
1993. But failures were down 42 per cent compared with the first quarter of
last year, when they stood at 1,767.
Mr William Simpson, chief economist, said companies' investment intentions
were modest because of 'erosion of capacity during the recession, widespread
late-payment mistrust and weak loan demand'.
Trade Indemnity's quarterly financial trends survey suggested that a further
reduction in business failures would be a function of progress on overdue
debts, the attitude of banks and whether companies can absorb rising
materials costs. It warned that risk would be concentrated in smaller
companies which find it most difficult to obtain finance and invest, and
those in unpredictable sectors such as high technology.
The survey showed that the average value of debts outstanding for more than
30 days beyond the due date had risen to Pounds 145,000.
The largest regional declines in failures compared with a year ago came in
the west Midlands at 53 per cent, East Anglia at 49 per cent, Wales at 48
per cent and Yorkshire and Humberside at 47 per cent.
The region with the largest number of failures in the first quarter was
south-east England, with a total of 392, a reduction of 35 per cent on the
total of 605 recorded in the first quarter of last year. The smallest
reduction was in the south-west, where the total declined by 29 per cent to
71 in the first quarter from 100 a year earlier.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Easter's moveable feast dishes statisticians: Critics say
the CSO system of seasonal adjustment may itself need some adjusting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A statistical health warning accompanies the UK consumer credit figures
released yesterday. The data, the Central Statistical office noted, may have
been distorted because of Easter and its effect on seasonal adjustment.
Such warnings are not entirely new. Spending and borrowing both surge before
public holidays and statisticians have always floundered over the fact that
Easter is a moveable feast and Christmas can occur on any day of the week.
But the timing of Easter this year has created particular problems. Because
the holiday straddled both March and April, statisticians have been
uncertain which month they should adjust to account for the anticipated
surge in high street activity.
The CSO insists that the statistical effect of these monthly 'glitches' is
tiny and point out that the problem can be avoided by using the three-month
average, which is generally regarded as the best indicator of trends.
But this argument has failed to convince some observers who say a more
radical overhaul of the system of seasonal adjustment may be needed.
For example, the Credit Card Research Group - an industry research company -
argues that the present system of seasonal adjustment is too limited since
it fails to account for variations in the number of credit-card processing
days. One reason why the credit figures fell this month, they point out, may
have been that there were fewer processing days in April.
Meanwhile, some British academics argue that the broad statistical methods
used to calculate the seasonal adjustment are outdated and clumsy, and
should be replaced by newer mathematical models.
The CSO's method of seasonal adjustment, which is called 'X11', uses a
technique known as a 'moving average'. This was first developed in the US in
the 1960s and has since been adopted by most western goverments.
Under this system seasonal adjustment is calculated by looking at
fluctuations over several years. To calculate the adjustment for December
1990, for example, the system might look at the average spending surge in
the months of December between 1986 and 1994.
The system works well for calculating past seasonal fluctuations, where
there is data before and after any month. But as Mr Tim Jones, senior
statistician at the CSO, admits, the system is less accurate for the most
recent data, since there is no 'future' data with which to calculate an
average. As a result, the CSO usually assumes that the future trend will be
the same as previous trends, and does not attempt to predict any events that
might dramatically change it.
The CSO argues that attempts are being made to make the adjustments more
sensitive, and points out that a new system known as 'X12' is being
developed in the US which addresses the problem of recent data.
But academics such as Professor Andrew Harvey of the London School of
Economics argue that the system is too rigid, since it cannot respond to
rapidly changing patterns of behaviour. Prof Harvey believes it should be
replaced by a mathematical model system which can take better account of any
new seasonal factors.
The Department of Employment has already adopted one such system for some of
its labour data, and the Bank of England, which uses a system similar to the
CSO's, has researched different options.
But so far the Bank has decided against moving to a model-based system,
partly because it fears a mathematical model might take longer to process
the data. Meanwhile, budgetary restraints at the CSO leave Prof Harvey
pessimistic that it will change its system rapidly.
In the interim, some observers suggest that the best solution may be to
place less emphasis on seasonal adjustment. Mr Eddie George, governor of the
Bank of England, for example, is said by former colleagues to be deeply
suspicious of seasonally adjusted numbers. Meanwhile, the Building Societies
Association does not seasonally adjust its own figures, arguing that it does
not have the resources to produce a 'fool-proof system'.
But as Mr Jones points out, the wild swings in non-seasonally adjusted
figures, particularly in areas such as retail sales data, can make it
extremely difficult for observers to make sense of non-adjusted figures.
'If we didn't seasonally adjust then every analyst would just create their
own systems of seasonal adjustment,' Mr Jones says. He insists that the CSO
has no intention of abandoning seasonal adjustment - leaving most officials
to conclude that the most practical solution to any uncertainty may be to
increase the size of the statistical health warnings.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Finance house lending shows dip during April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK consumers borrowed less money through finance houses to buy items such as
cars, large household goods and DIY items in April, official statistics
showed yesterday. But the level of credit-card purchases continued to rise.
Net lending to UK consumers through finance houses, bank credit cards and
building society loans fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 413m during
April, down from Pounds 518m the previous month, the Central Statistical
Office said.
The figure was stronger than the markets had expected, with most analysts
previously predicting a fall to Pounds 300m net credit. Indeed, economists
yesterday played down the monthly dip, insisting that the underlying trend
of consumer spending was still relatively strong.
Measured on a three-monthly basis - a more accurate indicator of the
underlying trend - net consumer lending rose to Pounds 1,282m in the three
months to April, up from Pounds 1,079m in the previous three months.
Nevertheless, the breakdown of the monthly figures suggests some slowdown in
the use of credit for the purchase of large retail items such as cars or
white goods, analysts said.
Although this is at odds with the recent strong retail sales data, the
figures tally with recent surveys pointing to continuing low levels of
consumer confidence. They may also suggest that consumers have become more
cautious about taking on medium-term credit.
Overall, the amount of new credit advanced to consumers fell sharply from
Pounds 5.214bn in March to Pounds 4.848bn in April.
Net lending by finance houses - a category which covers credit for cars and
most large retail store items - fell to Pounds 300m, down from Pounds 431m
in March. Meanwhile, the level of new credit advanced by finance houses fell
to Pounds 1,864bn, down from Pounds 1.993bn in March.
A drop in lending for car sales accounted for much of this dip. Net new
credit for car purchases, which represents about half of finance-house
lending, fell to Pounds 871m, down from Pounds 968m the previous month.
This drop appears to be at odds with May's car sales figures, which
indicated a pick-up in car purchases. Analysts yesterday suggested car fleet
purchases may have distorted the figures, pointing out that the trend in car
sales earlier this year had been down.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Minford fears threat to Scots councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to scrap Scotland's two-tier system of local government
will reduce the Scottish economy's ability to compete internationally and
could lead to chaos, Professor Patrick Minford said yesterday.
Prof Minford, a rightwing economist and one of the panel of 'wise men' who
advise the Treasury, said large local authorities were needed to take
strategic planning decisions involving such things as roads, factories and
airports.
The costs of such projects were heavily concentrated in a particular
locality whereas the benefits were spread widely. Planning powers given to
small local councils to block development on 'not in my backyard' grounds
would limit Scotland's ability to compete for inward investment.
Prof Minford was in Glasgow addressing businessmen and councillors invited
by Labour-dominated Strathclyde regional council, which is fighting
government plans to replace it and its 19 district councils with 12 unitary
authorities under the Scottish local government reform bill going through
parliament.
Prof Minford said the government seemed to be interested only in councils
delivering services efficiently to the consumer rather than in their
strategic planning role. Chaos was 'an apposite word' to use to describe the
results of the government's policy.
Arguing for a two-tier system, he pointed to the crucial role South
Glamorgan county council, soon to be abolished, had played in overruling
Vale of Glamorgan district council to secure the location of a Bosch plant
which now employs 1,000 people.
By contrast, the economy of Merseyside was declining because of the
inability of councils to agree following the abolition of the metropolitan
authority in 1986.

FT  07 JUN 94 / People: Manchester school head to lead UK teacher training
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Education secretary John Patten is hoping one of English education's leading
traditionalists will run teacher-training in England and Wales. Yesterday,
he named his candidate to chair the Teacher Training Authority, a new quango
which will start work in September if the education bill currently in the
Commons passes into law.
Geoffrey Parker, 61, retires at the end of this term as High Master
(headmaster) of Manchester Grammar School, one of the country's most
prestigious centres of academic excellence.
The appointment makes sense as Parker is certainly untainted by any
suggestion of the educational establishment's alleged 'political
correctness', which the new quango is intended to stamp out.
Instead, MGS has continued happily to admit that it is elitist, rigorously
selecting its boys and then working them very hard. The advent of A-level
league tables in the past few years has confirmed it as one of the top ten
independent schools in the UK.
However, Parker, a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge, denies accusations
that he runs an 'exam factory', answering with the names 'Atherton' and
'Crawley'; both England's current cricket captain, and his possible
successor are recent graduates of Manchester Grammar. The school plays as
hard as it works.
Parker's appointment, which is part-time, need not provoke the left-wing
establishment, as he has never taken a high political profile, and has
publicly defended links between schools and university education
departments.
However, one disgruntled teachers' union official suggested that a career
teaching 'the brightest sons of the North-West' is no preparation for the
job of training young teachers to work effectively in deprived inner-city
comprehensives. That task may be rather more difficult.

FT  07 JUN 94 / People: Brent picks Dobbie
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sandy Dobbie, 42, has been appointed chief operating officer of Brent
International, the speciality chemical maker which cut its dividend recently
following a collapse in its profits.
Dobbie's appointment almost completes the boardroom reshuffle at Brent
International which began last August when chief executive Stephen Cuthbert,
51, quit following mounting City concern about the company's lack-lustre
performance.
Keith Hutchings, 46, Brent's former finance director, was confirmed as chief
executive in March and Bill Jessup, 42, who used to work at Brent, has
returned as finance director. Dobbie will start by taking over Dennis
Wilby's role heading Brent's industrial chemicals operations and will add
responsibility for the printing services side at a later stage. Wilby, 46,
has been an executive director of Brent for eight years and his future role
has yet to be settled by Brent's new management team.
Dobbie, who has a doctorate in organic chemistry from Glasgow University,
will complement Hutchings's financial background. He started his career as
an industrial chemist and switched into production management. He joins
Brent from Merck's speciality chemicals subsidiary Kelco International where
he has been managing director for almost four years.
The changes in Brent's boardroom are not confined to the executive team.
Lord Lane, 69, a former senior partner of chartered accountants BDO Binder
Hamlyn, steps down next year after ten years as Brent's chairman and hands
over to Alec Daly, 58, an executive director of GKN. Meanwhile, Adrian Burn,
managing partner of BDO Binder Hamlyn, joined the board as a non-executive
director last month following the retirement of David Swallow and John
Jones. Brent plans to add another non-executive director at some stage.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Wind farm call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, wants more wind farms to be
built in spite of criticism of their economic value and visual impact.
In guidelines published today the group calls on planners and wind-power
developers 'to ensure high-quality, publicly supported wind-power projects
continue to appear in the countryside'.
It suggests planning refusals have been influenced by 'a sometimes
vociferous anti-wind power minority'.
Wind power has divided environmentalists. It is a renewable energy source,
but it requires a large number of obtrusive turbines to generate a small
amount of electricity. The Council for the Protection of Rural Wales has
called for a moratorium on development and local authorities have recently
taken a more restrictive attitude.

FT  07 JUN 94 / People: Hugh Harris decides to retire early from Bank of
England
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The management reorganisation at the Bank of England has prompted Hugh
Harris, 58, to seek early retirement from his position as associate director
with responsibility for the Bank's own central corporate services.
Harris is the most senior official to decide to quit the Bank since the
decision to eliminate a management layer and divide its operations into two
broad 'wings' responsible respectively for monetary and financial stability.
The changes at the Bank have already resulted in the departure of seven
other senior officials and the closing down of its international division.
Harris's departure, due later this year, follows a restructuring of the
Bank's central services under which the heads of the Bank's personnel and
finance divisions and the Bank's secretary will in future report directly to
Rupert Pennant Rea, deputy governor.
As part of these changes, John Footman, the head of the Bank's information
division, will be promoted to secretary with effect from September when the
present secretary, Geoff Croughton, retires. Footman will retain
responsibility for press and information work.
Gordon Midgley, head of management services and the Bank's computer
specialist, will expand his empire and be put in charge of finance and
resources after the retirement of John Rumins, finance director. Mike
Phillips remains Bank auditor and will report to Eddie George, the governor.
A new personnel director will be recruited from outside the Bank. Harris,
who joined the bank in 1959, will fill this role on a temporary basis until
the position is filled. (See Observer)

FT  07 JUN 94 / Eastleigh runner-up may get a prize: Why coming second in
Thursday's by-election is important for Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few prizes for coming second in politics. But tell that to Ms
Marilyn Birks, the Labour party candidate in the Eastleigh by-election on
Thursday, and you will be met with a look of disbelief. Labour has never
worked so hard in a seat which it knows it cannot win. Along with the
Conservatives, it privately conceded victory to the Liberal Democrats long
ago.
But coming second is everything for Labour in this by-election contest,
called after the death in February of the Conservative MP Stephen Milligan.
Its claim to be the main party of opposition in the south, as well as being
the dominant party in the north and inner cities, is to be put to the test.
If it can prevent its vote being squeezed and come second with about 25 per
cent of the vote it will be able to portray the result as the beginning of
the end of the Liberal Democrat claim to be the only party of opposition in
southern England.
It is true that the best scenario for Labour would still see the Liberal
Democrats overcoming a Conservative majority of 17,702, no small achievement
even by the recent standards of humiliating Tory by-election defeats.
Also - as Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat candidate, pointed out -
Labour would do well to learn from the Liberals that coming second in
British politics is never good enough.
Nevertheless, Labour's performance is likely to be judged against the target
it has set itself - to push the Tories into third place.
Only last week Mr Tony Blair, the favourite for the Labour leadership, told
a rally in Eastleigh that Labour was proud to be campaigning in the south of
England.
His comments were not lost on the audience. It has become something of a
novelty for Labour to take a by-election seriously in a Conservative-held
seat in the south. But not any more. Mr Blair had come to draw the line at
Eastleigh - the party must come second.
It is a risky strategy, which was to some extent forced on the party by the
fact that the constituency is next to Southampton, where Labour won the
Itchen constituency at the 1992 general election and failed by just 1 per
cent of the vote to capture Test. The Woolston ward of the city is part of
the Eastleigh constituency.
In the 1992 general election Labour increased its share of the vote in
Eastleigh from 16.7 per cent to 20.7 per cent at the expense of the Liberal
Democrats, who saw their share of the vote fall from 32 per cent to 28 per
cent.
To some extent Labour's strategy has already paid off. Its vote does not
look like collapsing. Although the Liberal Democrats recently took a council
seat off Labour in its Woolston stronghold, there is evidence that many
voters in the council blocks neighbouring Southampton remain loyal to
Labour.
Mr John Prescott, the likely challenger for the Labour leadership from the
traditionalist wing, received a sympathetic hearing when he visited the
Aercon group of companies, which make ducting and fittings, in the northern
part of the constituency.
One of the group directors said he was 'minded to vote Labour' after hearing
Mr Prescott field questions from the workforce. Most employees willing to
talk politics said they were planning to do the same.
Mr Blair's rally in the Fleming Park sports centre attracted more than 1,000
Labour supporters. As a morale-raising event it was a great success,
complete with band, balloons and US-style razzmatazz. But as an indication
of Labour's potential strength in the constituency it was less useful - many
of those attending the meeting had driven from Southampton.
In the Comrades and Unity workingmen's clubs there is still talk of voting
for the Liberal Democrats as the party best-placed to take the seat. One or
two of the regulars said they would vote Labour if they knew for sure that
the Conservatives would lose.
To this end Mr Bruce Grocott, the MP minding the Labour candidate, angrily
accused the Liberal Democrats of publishing misleading material showing
Labour in third place after the council elections. He argued that Labour
secured 25.1 per cent across the constituency compared with 24.4 per cent
won by the Conservatives and 50 per cent for the Liberal Democrats.
His message was simple - voters disillusioned with the government can risk
voting Labour without letting the Tories back in. But as things stand, not
enough voters appear willing to take that risk.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Major's man in Dorset plays the multi-speed card: John
Authers finds allegations of dirty tricks have arisen in a closely fought
Euro-seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bryan Cassidy, Tory MEP for the Liberal Democrat target seat of Dorset
and East Devon, is clear about his attitude to Europe. 'I'm a Euro-sceptic,'
he says, 'but not a Europhobe.'
The distinction is important, he says, and lies at the heart of his campaign
to hold on to the seat.
His aim is to enthuse voters about Europe's importance, and the potential
for local benefits - increasing the chance that they will turn out to vote -
while also tapping distrust of the Brussels bureaucracy.
Mr John Major's call for a 'multi-speed' Europe suited Mr Cassidy and he is
quick to mention it to voters as his campaign Land Rover blares Beethoven's
Ode to Joy, the European anthem.
Keeping the campaign on European issues is the only way to avoid turning the
election into a referendum on Mr Major's record at Westminster, and the
'multi-speed Europe' position, says Mr Cassidy, is one the party can defend
on the doorstep.
The Liberal Democrats are emphasising local issues. Last week saw the launch
of a petition against the closure of rural post offices. Mr Philip
Goldenberg, the candidate, has also helped to collect a petition against
value added tax on fuel.
Lib Dem election literature stresses Conservative 'broken promises' on VAT,
income tax, education and the National Health Service. Meanwhile the party's
national figures, including Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader, make regular
visits.
There have even been allegations of dirty tricks. Mr Goldenberg reported Mr
Cassidy to the European Court of Auditors for 'alleged misuse of public
money for electioneering purposes', while Mr Cassidy has complained of
'political hoodlums' stealing his poster boards.
On paper, Dorset and East Devon is one of the Liberal Democrats' best hopes
of victory. The party won Dorset County Council last year, and opinion polls
predict that it will win the seat. Christchurch, scene of a sweeping
by-election victory last year, was within the seat until its boundaries were
redrawn earlier this year.
But Dorset is not as fertile territory for the party as the Somerset and
Cornwall Euro-seats, both of which have two Liberal Democrat MPs. All the
Dorset Euro-seat's seven Westminster constituencies are held comfortably by
Conservatives, and most of it is untouched by South West Water's high
charges, which provoke bitter opposition further west.
Socially, the seat resembles the Conservative heartlands of the Home
Counties and the south coast more than it does the non-conformist west
country. Apart from the conurbation of Bournemouth and Poole, the towns are
predominantly agricultural market towns, while many residents in the east of
the county are retired pensioners from the Home Counties.
Mr Cassidy encountered plenty of anger on the placid streets of Bridport
last week, but most of it - perhaps because the Ode to Joy was playing in
the background - was directed at Europe, not at Mr Major.
An elderly gentleman, asked if he would vote Tory, said: 'I don't think so
somehow, not this time. I'm very anti-Common Market. It's cost me too much
money.'
He said he would vote for the 'anti-Common Market candidate'. There are two,
a Conservative Anti-Federalist and the UK Independence party.
A traffic warden was angrier: 'We're listening to people in Brussels telling
us what to do. It interferes with me in my life, in what I have to buy. They
try to stop us making our own cider and farmhouse cheese.' Mr Cassidy
dismissed these as 'media myths'.
Out on the stump, talking about Europe, the seat appears safe for the
Tories, and yet there is a perceptible air of unease about the campaign.
They know that if Dorset did opt for the Lib Dems, no special local factors
could be blamed as would be possible in Cornwall or Somerset. It would be an
unambiguous vote of protest against the Conservative government.
One Tory-voting local businessman articulated the concern: 'How are you
going to get people to vote for you on Europe as opposed to what they've
seen in the country as a whole?'
He added: 'As far as Westminster is concerned, there's been a lot of
incompetence, I would suggest. It's unprofessional at best.'

FT  07 JUN 94 / Booked for an easy ride to Westminster: Kevin Brown previews
Thursday's four by-election battles where low turnouts appear to pose the
only danger to Labour's strong grip on the seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the East End they are calling it the District Line election, after the
London Underground service that links the three constituencies of Barking,
Newham North East and Dagenham.
The line - the green one on the London Tube map - also passes through
Westminster, which is where Labour's three by-election candidates will be
heading on Friday morning.
The elections follow the deaths of Ron Leighton (Newham), and Jo Richardson
(Barking), and the resignation of Mr Bryan Gould (Dagenham), to return to
his native New Zealand.
All three seats are Labour strongholds, held with more than 50 per cent of
the vote at the last general election in 1992. Defeat would be unthinkable.
Labour is also certain of victory in Bradford South, the fourth seat it is
defending in Thursday's by-elections, which was won with 47 per cent of the
vote by the late Bob Cryer.
But the elections are not free of danger for Labour. The biggest fear is a
repeat of the low poll in Labour's successful defence of Rotherham last
month.
In that election Labour's majority fell from 17,561 to less than 7,000. The
proportion of voters supporting Labour also fell, from 63.9 per cent to 55.6
per cent.
Similar results in the east London and Bradford elections would do much to
remove the gloss from the victories Labour expects to record in the European
elections.
The real losers, however, are likely to be the Conservatives, who came
second ahead of the Liberal Democrats in all four constituencies in 1992.
The Conservative candidates have little chance of improving on the party's
1992 performance, and in the current political climate none can rule out the
humiliation of finishing third.
The danger is greatest in the three east London constituencies, where the
Conservatives won no seats in the May local government elections.
The Liberal Democrats are hoping for good results to ease the pain of the
loss of Tower Hamlets, their former East End stronghold, which fell to
Labour in May.
The party finished well behind the Conservatives in all three constituencies
in 1992, but hopes are highest in Barking, where they took 20 per cent of
the vote in May.
All the main parties fear a resurgence of extreme rightwing support, in
spite of the defeat in May of the British National party's sole councillor
in Tower Hamlets.
Overall, the ultra-right achieved its best results in a decade in east
London, prompting the BNP to put up a candidate in Dagenham, and the
National Front to stand in Barking.
Fortunately for the mainstream parties the BNP and the NF are bitter rivals
for the extremist vote and are unlikely to maximise their prospects by
pooling their resources. Most attention will focus on Mr John Tyndall, the
BNP leader, in Dagenham.
Neither party has put up a candidate in Newham North East, one of the UK's
most ethnically diverse constituencies, where the BNP nearly won a council
seat in May.
The main candidates are:
Barking: Labour - Margaret Hodge, 49, former leader of Islington council;
Conservative - Theresa May, 37, banker; Liberal Democrat - Garry White, 21,
unemployed.
Dagenham: Labour - Judith Church, 40, union official; Conservative - James
Fairrie, 46, former army officer; Liberal Democrat - Peter Dunphy, 27,
recruitment consultant.
Newham NE: Labour - Stephen Timms, 38, former Newham council leader;
Conservative - Philip Hammond, 38, company director; Liberal Democrat - Alec
Kellaway, 40, economist.
Bradford S: Labour - Gerry Sutcliffe, 41, council leader; Conservative  -
Ronnie Farley, 49, chartered accountant; Liberal Democrat - Helen Wright,
37, health clinic manager.

<TEXT>
Head teachers will be legally obliged to pass information about the national
curriculum to their staff under teachers' pay and conditions arrangements
announced today.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said teachers were 'frustrated that
information sent to the school, such as the initial proposals to slim down
the national curriculum and circulars', was not made available to all staff.
This now becomes a duty for heads.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, which lobbied for the change, said he both welcomed it and
regretted that it had been necessary.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Minister deplores detention protest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Home Office minister yesterday accused 'leftwing protesters' of stirring
up trouble at an immigration detention centre from which six Algerians
escaped on Sunday night.
Windows and furniture were smashed and detainees took to the roof during
protests at the Campsfield centre in Kidlington, near Oxford.
Twenty two people were yesterday transferred to another centre and four
detainees who tried to jump the perimeter fence were taken to hospital with
leg and ankle injuries.
Mr Charles Wardle, junior Home Office minister, yesterday attacked
demonstrations against the centre. He said: 'The main difficulty is the
regular series of protesters - a motley coalition of leftwing supporters.'
Mr Wardle said the trouble on Sunday was probably sparked by the removal of
Mr Ali Tamaret, an Algerian student who was due to be deported tomorrow. He
said Mr Tamaret went to Algeria voluntarily on September 2 but returned two
months later using a forged passport.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Award to Name reduced by half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A High Court judge yesterday reduced sharply the damages awarded to a member
of the Lloyd's of London insurance market who successfully sued his members'
agent, Andrew Jack writes.
In an unprecedented decision in April Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled that a
members' agent was liable for the losses incurred on syndicates to which it
allocated two Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the market.
Yesterday Mr Gatehouse issued a revised judgment cutting by about half the
damages to be awarded to the richer of the two Names, Mr Richard Brown.
His decision followed a technical re-calculation of the way in which Mr
Brown's underwriting was allocated to higher risk insurance syndicates. The
award will now be calculated pro rata based on his allocation to particular
syndicates in each year of underwriting.
The award may still be under threat because Elborne Mitchell, solicitors for
KMR Services, formerly H G Poland, the members' agent being sued, is
believed to be considering an appeal.
The amendment does not affect the award to Mr Michael Sword-Daniels, the
dentist who brought the case with Mr Brown.
It is unclear, however, how much money will be received by either of the two
Names because KMR went into liquidation last month following claims arising
from the original court award.
The liquidator said yesterday KMR had cash of Pounds 120,000, compared with
claims so far from creditors of Pounds 825,000, including Pounds 130,000
from Mr Sword-Daniels and Pounds 333,000 from Mr Brown.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Gummer reopens Tory split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday reopened the divisions
over Europe in Mr John Major's cabinet by taking a markedly different
approach from the prime minister to the future of the European Union.
As Labour sought to highlight what it called the Tory party's 'great divide'
over Europe, Mr Gummer hinted at discontent in the cabinet about Mr Major's
recent commitment to a 'multi-speed' EU.
With the European elections only two days away, the prime minister has
elaborated on a 'new vision' for Europe, in which member states can decide
'in their own way and at their own speed' how much power they give to
Brussels.
But Mr Gummer - one of the most pro-European ministers - yesterday warned
that it would be 'quite unacceptable' if the development of more flexible
decision making allowed Britain to take a more cautious line on its place in
Europe.
'What is absolutely clear is that Britain is not going to be at a slower
speed than the rest of Europe,' he said at the Tories' daily Euro-election
news conference. 'We are at the heart of Europe and we have no intention of
being at a slower speed than the others.'
Mr Gummer also appeared to disagree with the prime minister on why flexible
decision making needed to be introduced in the first place.
Last week Mr Major claimed that the 'multi-speed, multi-track' idea should
be an integral part of the EU's development into the next century.
But yesterday Mr Gummer cast that theme in more modest terms, claiming that
it would merely relate to new applications for EU membership from the
developing countries of eastern Europe.
He said: 'A number of countries who want to join cannot just join on the
basis of total access. What the prime minister is suggesting is that you
have got to look at ways in which we enable people to join at a different
level.'
Labour claimed that the prime minister was trying to manage irreconcilable
division between pro and anti-Europeans in his party.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said: 'So deeply split is the
Conservative party now on Europe that its leader is obliged himself to face
both ways on just about every important issue.'
He said that the prime minister had become 'the modern embodiment of Janus:
a split personality chairing a split cabinet, leading a split party'.
Mr Cunningham singled out Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, who so
far has played no part in the campaign, saying that sending him to France
had failed to keep the 'rift' in Tory ranks out of the headlines 'let alone
to heal it'.
For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Russell Johnston, Europe spokesman, said the
Tory campaign had been 'wholly negative' and had sought to maximise
differences.
Mr John Major's rhetoric had not 'openly mirrored' the condemnation of
foreigners expressed by Euro-sceptic cabinet ministers such as Mr Michael
Portillo and Mr Lilley, Sir Russell said. But 'the meaning has been the same
and they have never been disowned'.
Sir Russell was supported by Lord Thomson of Monifieth, a former EU
commissioner, who said it was a 'heartbreaking tragedy' that the Tories had
turned their back on playing a key role in the EU 'for reasons of purely
domestic politics'.

FT  07 JUN 94 / TUC warns top companies about works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As many as 59 of the top 100 UK companies will be legally compelled to
establish European-level consultative committees for their workers on the
Continent in spite of Britain's opt-out from the social chapter of the
European Union's Maastricht Treaty, the TUC says today.
The EU's draft directive on information and consultation in transnational
companies will require companies employing at least 1,000 workers in other
EU states and 100 or more in at least two of those states to negotiate
European-wide arrangements if this is demanded by their employees or their
representatives.
The directive is expected to come into law in the second half of this year
during the German presidency.
In an estimate issued today by its EU-funded multinationals information
project, the TUC concedes that none of the named companies will have any
legal requirement to include British workers on the planned committees. But
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said yesterday that he expected
British employers would extend consultation arrangements to their British
workers.
A number of the companies named by the TUC said they were awaiting the final
passage of the works council directive before deciding what to do. They said
they would comply with the law, and make up their minds later on whether to
include British employees in the scope of any machinery they set up.
The Confederation of British Industry last night accused the TUC of a
'blatant attempt to bounce UK companies into something they know very well
would not work'.
The FTSE companies listed by the TUC cover a range of activities. Those in
the food, leisure and transport sector are Allied Lyons, Associated British
Foods, Bass, BAT Industries, British Airways, British Petroleum, Burmah
Castrol, Cadbury Schweppes, Forte, Granada Group, Grand Metropolitan, Great
Universal Stores, Guinness, Inchape, Ladbroke Group, Marks and Spencer,
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, Reuters Holdings, Shell Transport
and Trading, Scottish and Newcastle, and United Biscuits.
Manufacturing companies covered are Arjo Wiggins Appleton, Blue Circle
Industries, BOC Group, Boots, Bowater, British Aerospace, British Steel,
BTR, Caradon, Coats Viyella, Courtaulds, General Electric, Glaxo, ICI,
Reckitt and Colman, Redland, Reed International,Rentokil, RMC Group, Siebe,
Smith and Nephew, Smithkline Beecham, Thorn EMI, TI Group, Tomkins,
Unilever, Wellcome, Williams Holdings, Wolseley, Zeneca.
In the financial services sector the companies are Barclays, Commercial
Union, Guardian, HSBC Holdings, Lloyds Bank, National Westminster Bank,
Royal Insurance Holdings and Sun Alliance.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Quango appointment attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday launched a fierce attack on the decision by Mr John Patten,
the education secretary, to appoint a chairman for the new teacher-training
quango when the bill which would create it has yet to pass the Commons.
Mrs Ann Taylor, who speaks for Labour on education, described this as an
'abuse of parliament'. She said: 'Parliament hasn't even agreed to set up
the Teacher Training Agency, and yet they have already made the appointment.
'Having a democratic process in this country means the opposition is
entitled to argue its case. It is conceivable, given the government's defeat
in the Lords, that we could vote down the proposals.'
The Department for Education was confident, however, that the decision would
not cause any problems for the bill when it continued in the committee stage
after parliament reconvened. It said that Mr Geoffrey Parker, the new
chairman, was officially only the 'chairman-designate' and that his
appointment was subject to the education bill receiving royal assent.
If the bill is successful the new body must start work in September. The
department believed it 'essential' to appoint a chairman as soon as
possible.
There are precedents for the move. The department pointed to Sir Christopher
Benson, who was appointed chairman of the Funding Agency for Schools before
the agency started business in April this year, and to Sir Ron Dearing, the
chairman of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Liffe condemns concealment of share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange must gradually remove restrictions which block immediate
publication of the prices at which shares are bought and sold in London, the
London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange said yesterday.
Mr Daniel Hodson, chief executive of Liffe, said the lack of transparency
was already inhibiting the development of a robust futures market in London
and would constrain it even further in the future.
He said activity in financial futures which track the FT-SE 100 index was
already lower than in comparable futures contracts in France and Germany.
Liffe was responding to a paper from the Securities and Investments Board,
the City's chief regulatory watchdog, which asked whether some practices
affecting professional investors in London were beneficial to certain market
participants at the expense of others.
In particular, SIB asked whether rules which restrict price transparency
were truly needed to ensure that sufficient liquidity was available to
investors.
Liffe is arguing that because so much business in London is executed at
prices which are not visible to the public, equity derivatives products
cannot properly reflect the value of the underlying cash market they are
intended to mimic.
Stock Exchange rules allow any trade of more than three times 'normal market
size' to be hidden from other market participants for 90 minutes, and any
trade more than 75 times normal market size to be hidden for up to five days
or until the marketmaker has hedged against the risk of adverse price
movements in that stock.
Also, the exchange allows marketmakers to buy and sell shares to each other
through inter-dealer broker screens at prices which may not coincide with
those on the Exchange's own Seaq price-display mechanism.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Leadership Contest: Beckett seems likely to stand:
Leadership contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party's leadership election is likely to be a three-horse race
between Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, Mr John Prescott, shadow
employment secretary, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's leader. Mrs
Beckett is not certain to stand yet, in spite of strong pressure to put her
name forward from feminist and traditionalist Labour MPs. But friends say
she is increasingly likely to run for the leadership and the deputy
leadership.
Mrs Beckett, who is said by many MPs to have performed creditably as party
leader since John Smith died last month, has told friends that she wants to
do the job permanently. She believes that her position may help her to
overhaul Mr Tony Blair, the runaway favourite, over the six-week campaign
that will start on Friday.
Her supporters think her prospects of winning would be boosted significantly
by endorsement from outside her base on the left.
The key target is Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU general union, which
sponsors Mrs Beckett.
Supporters are also seeking endorsement from Mr John Edmonds, leader of the
GMB general union, which has invited the potential candidates to address an
informal gathering of its annual conference on Monday.
Mrs Beckett's emergence as a serious candidate for the leadership
complicates the options for Mr Prescott, whose support is also mainly on the
left of the party.
Mr Prescott is thought unlikely to stand for both the leadership and deputy
leadership because of the fear that his leadership bid would be regarded as
less than serious.
Most Labour MPs think Mrs Beckett's role as the continuity candidate makes
her certain to be re-elected deputy leader - even if she contests the
leadership as well.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, is still gauging his
support, but is thought unlikely to stand.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Peers pledge to oppose core of de-regulation bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's bill to cut regulatory burdens on business faces a
difficult passage through the House of Lords, opposition and Conservative
backbench peers indicated last night.
Labour and Liberal Democrat peers made clear that they would mount a
determined bid to remove core provisions in the bill, which would allow the
government to short-circuit parliamentary procedures in abolishing
regulations.
Lord Peston, chief Labour spokesman on the de-regulation and contracting-out
bill, denounced as a 'constitutional outrage' the government's proposal to
abolish regulations using parliamentary orders. The orders are subject to
short debates and cannot be amended whereas primary legislation is subject
to the full parliamentary process.
Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, for the Liberal Democrats, described the
provisions as 'outrageous'.
Lord Cockfield, the Conservative peer and former cabinet minister, also
criticised the growth in ministerial power at the expense of parliament.
He urged ministers not to be mesmerised by the catchphrase 'de-regulation'.
Assurances by Lord Strathclyde, the minister in charge of the bill, that the
bill's 'exceptional' powers would be subject to new safeguards in the
Commons as well as the Lords, failed to satisfy the critics.
Lord Peston called on peers to delete the provisions from the bill and force
the Commons to think again. 'If we do not do that I cannot see what
justification there is for us being here at all.'
From the non-party cross benches Lord Bancroft, a former head of the civil
service, said the process of dismantling the public service through the
transfer of functions to agencies subject to very limited parliamentary
control and debate had gone too far.
Lord Beloff, the Conservative peer and academic, said the
'professionalisation of politics' had reduced MPs of all parties to lobby
fodder.
Lord Clinton-Davis, in the final speech from the opposition front bench,
reaffirmed that if the bill became law it would be repealed by the next
Labour government.
The bill was given an unopposed second reading.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Row erupts over 'cruel' tests for jobseekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployed people are being offered vacancies which are deemed 'hard to
fill' as a way of testing whether they are genuine applicants for social
security benefit, according to a leaked government memorandum.
The memo, which was drawn up by the Employment Service, reveals that
applicants for benefit are being offered jobs such as hairdressers, chefs
and cooks as a means of testing whether they are truly seeking work.
The document was leaked to Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington. He
condemned the proposals as 'cruel and sneaky'.
'This scheme has been designed by ministers in a desperate attempt to meet
Treasury spending targets,' he said. 'They ought to be ashamed of
themselves.'
He added: 'How on earth do they expect a redundant miner to react when
offered a job as a hairdresser or a chef?'
According to the document, which was sent to all regional directors of the
Employment Service, tests using hard-to-fill jobs were introduced last month
in a trial period to last until mid-August.
The document states that 'claimants who refuse to, or fail to, apply for
jobs . . . may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for a
maximum of 26 weeks'.
Currently, anyone drawing unemployment benefit must look for a new job.
After 13 weeks on the dole, individuals are challenged as to the
appropriateness of the job they are seeking, and may be asked to
re-consider. Failure to do so can result in benefits being taken away.
The document suggests that more rigorous methods are being used to test the
search for work.
According to the memorandum, the idea of testing applicants in this way was
raised by Viscount Astor, the parliamentary under secretary at the
Department of Social Security.
Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, responded to the suggestion
'expressing scepticism', but asked officials to 'investigate the
possibilities'.
The memo defines hard-to-fill vacancies and ranks occupations in order of
unpopularity. Hairdressers and barbers top the list, followed by debt
collectors, credit agents, nannies, chefs and cooks and service managers.
The Department of Employment said: 'A small minority of clients make little
or no effort to find work, and are unwilling to take up training. In such
cases, it is entirely appropriate to test whether a client satisfies the
condition that they are able and willing to accept employment. The best way
of doing this is to offer them a chance of a job.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of complaints received by the largest UK chartered accountancy
body has jumped by more than half in the past three years, its latest annual
report shows.
The professional conduct department of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales received 3,420 complaints last year, up 8
per cent from 1992.
It said the current caseload of complaints under investigation was about
2,000, and added that uncertainty about future growth created 'a
considerable challenge' in the management of the department.
The largest single proportion of complaints related to allegedly poor work
by chartered accountants on behalf of their clients.
A similar proportion related to complaints about 'dilatory behaviour' by
members of the institute in the conduct of their work.
A further 13 per cent of complaints related to insolvency matters.
Investment business, change of appointment and fee disputes each made up 9
per cent of complaints.
There were 160 fines imposed on accountants last year after investigations,
and 219 disciplinary orders made against practitioners, including 169
reprimands. Four accountants were censured, 24 given a severe reprimand and
21 excluded from membership of the institute. One received an admonishment,
the mildest possible rebuke.
The annual report, which is due to be debated by the institute's council on
Wednesday, says about 85 per cent of complaints can be resolved by staff
without reference to a professional conduct committee.
In a separate report Mr Anthony Surtees, who was appointed as an ombudsman
or independent reviewer of complaints in April 1992, says he investigated 33
cases last year.
In 30 cases he found in favour of the institute and three cases were
returned to the investigation committee for re-examination.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Imro probes adviser's role in alleged fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imro, the self-regulating body for fund managers, is investigating advice
given by AP Black, a UK investment adviser, in relation to the provision of
funds to a company in the Bahamas suspected of involvement in an alleged
currency options fraud.
US and UK investigators say the alleged fraud may have resulted in a loss of
more than Dollars 90m (Pounds 60m) to investors worldwide.
The investigation, involving agencies including the FBI and Britain's
Serious Fraud Office, is focused on the activities of Mr William C. Dunn, a
US-based commodities broker; his company Delta Consultants based in New
Jersey; Delta Options, an unregulated investment company incorporated in the
Bahamas; and Nopkine, a company based in the British Virgin Islands.
Imro has told AP Black to cease trading as a precautionary protection for
investors. It is examining whether directors of AP Black may have breached
rules governing advice to customers. It is Imro's policy not to comment on
any case until, and only if, it results in disciplinary action.
In a letter to AP Black's lawyers last week, the SFO made clear that it was
not contemplating any proceedings against any employee or director of AP
Black. The SFO is continuing its investigation into the affairs of Mr Dunn
in conjunction with the US authorities.
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has alleged in a New York court
that Delta, Mr Dunn, and the two offshore companies made 'false, deceptive,
and misleading representations of material facts in connection with
soliciting funds from customers and prospective customers'.
The commission alleges that in July 1993 Mr Dunn, acting in his capacity as
president of Delta Consultants, claimed to be managing Dollars 180m in
customer funds invested in Delta Options.
It is further alleged that in October and November 1993, Mr Dunn issued
statements reassuring customers after they had expressed concern.
According to the commission's complaint, notwithstanding these statements,
customers of Delta Options have not been repaid in full and have not
received profits. On November 26 1993, Mr Dunn and Delta Consultants told
Delta Options that its customers had suffered losses of Dollars 95m.
AP Black acted as a soliciting broker for the funds which were deposited in
the name of Delta Options and traded through the New York branches of
several European banks, believed to include Credit Lyonnais and Swiss Bank
Corporation.

Union Carbide of the US and Elf-Atochem of France, part of Elf Aquitaine,
are to create a joint venture to manufacture specialist plastics.
The move is the latest in a series of consolidations in the European
petrochemicals industry in response to low prices and competition from the
Middle East and Asia.
The venture will market polyethylene resins and compounds for the wire and
cable, pipe and other industries in Europe. It will take over Elf-Atochem's
the gas phase polyethylene reactor at Gonfreville, France, and Union Carbide
will license its Unipol process technology to the venture.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Chile in favour of ties with Mercosur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO, SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's proposal to use the planned Mercosur common market as a building
block for a South American free trade area has been backed by Chile, which
could next month start negotiating to join Mercosur as an 'associate'
member.
Brazilian officials said this would also mark the first step towards Chile's
full membership of Mercosur.
Mr Carlos Figueroa Serrano, Chile's foreign minister, said his country was
interested in joining Mercosur, which groups Brazil with Argentina, Paraguay
and Uruguay. He intends to discuss the matter with Argentina later this
week. Chile will, however, continue to negotiate its entry into Nafta, still
seen as the country's priority.
Chile is an especially welcome partner for Brazil, which has been trying to
tie other countries into the Mercosur network. Mercosur is due to become a
customs union, with a common external tariff for most goods, from January 1
next year. Countries wanting 'associate' trading ties with Mercosur will
have to remove barriers on trade with Mercosur members, but will not be
bound by the common external tariff rules.
Brazil has been discussing the South American free trade area with other
countries for several months. But Chile is the first publicly to express
definite interest in joining.
Chile is seen as the South American country most prepared to join Nafta. By
joining Mercosur as well, it would show other countries that it was possible
to be a member of both trade areas. Chile's intention to negotiate some form
of association with Mercosur reflects concern in the country, which is
highly dependent on exports, of being left on the sidelines of the region's
emerging free-trade blocs.
Brazil and Argentina are Chile's third and fourth biggest trading partners
respectively.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Beijing 'must play by rules'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday warned China it
must play by world trade rules and said the Europeans and Americans were
united over Beijing's bid to join the international economic community,
Reuter reports from Paris.
'If the Chinese are going to continue to grow, trade and become an
international player, they are going to have to play by the rules. The US is
adamant about that,' Mr Kantor said on his way to Paris for the annual
meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD).
Mr Kantor said China must change its trade practices before it could join
the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Some US officials have proposed privately that China should be kept out of
the WTO for the entire first term of the Clinton presidency because of its
poor human rights record. 'But that's not a policy,' Mr Kantor said.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Beijing must play by rules - Kantor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, yesterday warned China it
must play by world trade rules and said the Europeans and Americans were
united over Beijing's bid to join the international economic community,
Reuter reports from Paris.
'If the Chinese are going to continue to grow, trade and become an
international player, they are going to have to play by the rules. The US is
adamant about that,' Mr Kantor said on his way to Paris for the annual
meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD).
Mr Kantor said China must change its trade practices before it could join
the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which takes over next year from the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The European Union
increasingly shared the US stance, he added.
Some US officials have proposed privately that China should be kept out of
the WTO for the entire first term of the Clinton presidency because of its
poor human rights record.
'But that's not a policy,' Mr Kantor said. 'It's just a guess. We're totally
open to them meeting these requirements as soon as possible and we have said
that publicly and privately.'
On the issue of a partial trade deal with Japan, Mr Kantor said it would be
'immature' to reject such an option.
Mr Kantor, who had previously insisted on an all-or-nothing trans-Pacific
trade package, said he would now accept a scaled-back version when the two
nations' leaders' meet in July.
'You want to make progress where you can. This is a long- term situation and
you won't resolve all the problems overnight,' he said.
The two sides want to strike a broad new deal that cuts Japan's Dollars
131bn (Pounds 87bn) trade surplus and boosts foreign access to three key
sectors: cars, insurance and public procurement.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: France renews gas deal with Norway -
NKr50bn contract lifts Oslo's market share

Norway yesterday announced a 20-year contract to supply natural gas to
France.
The deal, valued at an estimated NKr50bn (Pounds 4.6bn) based on current gas
prices, also includes an undisclosed price revision for gas supplies covered
under existing contracts with Gaz de France.
Norway's Gas Negotiating Committee - comprising Statoil, the Norwegian state
oil company, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum, two other Norwegian oil
companies -agreed to provide Gaz de France with fresh annual quantities of
gas from 1996 or 1997 which will build to a level of 4.0bn cu m from 2001.
The deal will boost Norway's market share for gas in France to 30 per cent
by the year 2000 from 18 per cent in 1993.
Gaz de France has imported gas from Norway since 1977 from the North Sea
Ekofisk, Statfjord, Heimdal and Gullfaks fields. Gas exports under the Troll
sales agreement began last year.
Statoil said: 'Based on these contracts and the new agreement, annual
deliveries to France will reach 13bn cu m soon after the turn of the
century.'
France last year consumed 33bn cu m of gas but indigenous production is
rapidly declining and totalled less than 3.0bn cu m in 1993. France also
imports gas from the Netherlands, Russia and Algeria.
Norway recently postponed by two years a decision to invest in new capacity
to meet increasing demand for gas. A sellers' group led by Statoil will take
responsibility for the new contract with France.
Last year Norway supplied about 25bn cu m of gas to Europe and expects
deliveries to rise sharply to 60.8bn by 2005.
It currently holds a market share of 10 per cent in the European Union, but
this is predicted to rise to 12 per cent by 2005.

FT  07 JUN 94 / World Trade News: China air space rows 'bad for business' -
Disputes with Moscow and Seoul over flight jurisdiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two air space disputes are souring China's otherwise good economic relations
with South Korea and Russia.
Under pressure from foreign airlines seeking both to take advantage of the
economic boom in China and cut costs and flying time across the Pacific
Ocean, diplomats are pushing Beijing to resolve these longstanding
disagreements.
Of the two, the most knotty involves differences over the air space between
Beijing and Seoul. It has meant that there are currently no direct scheduled
flights between the Chinese and South Korean capitals.
'In terms of business, both sides are losing fantastic amounts of money,' a
western airline executive said. 'Scheduled charters from South Korea are
full. Everybody wants to come here, but the Chinese say do it under their
terms or not at all.'
The obstacles in the dispute are primarily commercial issues. Neither side
can agree either on the frequency of flights that should operate between
Beijing and Seoul or the number of destinations to which carriers could fly.
Aviation experts say Chinese airlines fear that if there were enough flights
from South Korea to meet the growing demand, few passengers would opt to fly
Chinese airlines, which have a poor reputation.
To pressure Chinese authorities to resolve these issues, South Korea
recently lifted its official ban on tourism travel to China. Last year,
between 100,000 and 120,000 Koreans visited the mainland for business or
official purposes. Travel agencies expect tourism traffic to push this
figure up to 500,000 a year.
A significant hurdle in what is known as the '124-125 fight' was cleared
during the recent visit to China by South Korean President Kim Young-Sam.
The Chinese agreed to the South Koreans' demand that the air traffic control
boundary remain at 124 degrees east longitude as laid down by the
Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) for
regularly scheduled flights between Beijing and Seoul. South Korea had
argued that a one-degree extension of Beijing's air space would give China
control virtually to the South Korean coast.
However, Chinese officials are still standing by their claim that the air
traffic control region between Shanghai and Seoul should stay at 125 degrees
for chartered flights. While the Koreans are reportedly unhappy with this
arrangement, they are willing to accept it for the present.
With the trade boom between China and South Korea, pressure on both sides to
find a solution has risen. Bilateral trade between the two countries soared
63 per cent to Dollars 23bn (Pounds 15.3bn) in the first nine months last
year. Korean Airlines is also pushing the government to resolve the impasse.
If direct flights between Beijing and Seoul were allowed, Seoul could become
an international hub in north-east Asia.
Airlines seeking to shorten the long haul across the Pacific have also run
into trouble over a Sino-Russian dispute dealing with restrictions on air
space along their eastern border. Details of the dispute remain unclear and
Chinese officials have been unwilling to discuss the matter.
What is known is that some western airlines are permitted to refuel in the
Siberian city of Khaborovsk, but are not allowed to cross the border there
and enter directly into China's north-eastern Heilongjiang province.
Instead, they must fly back down across Japan and on to Beijing, adding
considerable time to their journey. Chinese airlines are also frustrated by
this roundabout route.
There is concern that Russian and Chinese air traffic control systems may be
inadequate to handle a higher volume of traffic if the corridor were open to
foreign carriers. Currently, both countries can handle an aircraft every
half hour but opening to foreign carriers would mean an aircraft entering
Sino-Russian air space every two and a half minutes.
Aviation experts say this ought not to be a problem. Modern aircraft do not
need ultra-sophisticated air traffic control systems. They can use satellite
navigation once they reach cruising altitude.
Some western airline officials are 'cautiously optimistic' that China's
differences with Russia will be resolved sooner than those with South Korea.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Northern Yemenis announce ceasefire

<TEXT>
Northern Yemenis said yesterday they would begin an indefinite ceasefire at
midnight last night in the six-week war with the south.
Mr Mohammed Salem Basendwa, the foreign minister, said in Sanaa: 'We have
informed the secretary-general of the UN and the secretary-general of the
Arab League that a ceasefire will start from midnight tonight (2100 GMT).
'The ceasefire will last until the other side ceases to abide by it. Then I
don't think it will be possible for us to stop our people.'
The minister said Sanaa made the ceasefire offer before Gulf Arab states
made a statement on Sunday in which they said they would push for action
against any side which failed to heed a UN ceasefire call made last
Wednesday.
'We think the statement (by the Gulf Arab states will encourage the
mutineers (southerners),' Mr Basendwa said. Southern Yemenis, who welcomed
last week's ceasefire call, have said that their fighting since then has
been in self-defence.
Earlier yesterday, north Yemeni artillery had continued to pound Aden in the
most determined offensive against the south Yemeni capital since the start
of the civil war.
With Aden's refinery still ablaze following an air raid on Sunday, the
north's artillery turned its attention to the airport, long the mainstay of
south Yemen's defence. Despite the new offensive, the airport remained fully
operational.
North Yemeni military forces began their latest attack on Sunday morning, as
two warplanes bombed the oil refinery at Little Aden and set fire to two
storage tanks. Southern political leaders said a second attack was launched
in the evening, setting four more tanks alight.
Mr Mohammed Hussein Hajj, manager of the refinery, said six firefighters had
been killed in the blaze and a further 16 injured. He confirmed six storage
tanks had been severely damaged and petrol supplies might become critical.
Northern officials, in a broadcast on Sanaa Radio, denied their warplanes
had been involved. Northern artillery, aiming at Aden airport, continued to
shell the city yesterday.
Western observers, visiting the front lines yesterday, confirmed that
southern defences remained in the positions they have held for the past
three days. Despite claims by Sanaa Radio of a successful attack, Aden
airport was operational yesterday with southern jets flying sorties at
10-minute intervals throughout the day.
According to Sanaa television, the south's aircraft yesterday attacked
economic and oil installations in Marib and Shabwa provinces. The south had
threatened such raids if its refinery were attacked.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Tupolev crash adds to China's air woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China's reputation for air safety was yesterday dealt another severe blow
when a Russian-built Tupolev-154 crashed eight minutes after take-off from
the city of Xian, killing all 160 passengers on board.
The crash of the Russian TU-154 of China Northwest Airlines, bound for the
southern city of Guangzhou, continues a run of accidents, hijackings and
near-misses for China's overstretched aviation sector. Its airline industry
has undergone explosive growth in the past few years, which has strained
overstretched pilot and maintenance resources. The country now has over 30
regional airlines; passenger growth has been running at 20 per cent
annually.
In 1993, 76 people died in five crashes. This followed the deaths of 276 the
previous year, including those in the November 1992 crash of a Boeing 737
near Guilin, a southern beauty spot, in which 141 perished.
A foreign airline representative said visitors to China were entitled to
'shudder' if they found themselves booked on Russian-built aircraft widely
used on domestic routes. Some 10-15 per cent of China's airliners are
Russian-supplied, including Ilyushins, Antonovs and TU-154s. A Chinese
company announced at the weekend it had leased a further five Tupolevs.
A Chinese newspaper reported yesterday that mechanical and personnel
problems had increased in China's aviation sector this year. The China
Business Times quoted an official of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), the country's aviation regulatory agency, as attributing
problems to 'lack of safety consciousness and poor management'.
In the first five months of this year 17 accidents had occurred, involving
aircraft missing the tarmac on landing, mid-air engine failure and wing tips
touching the ground on landing, the official said. Among factors behind
China's disastrous safety record was the 'poor quality' of pilots and ground
crew, and ill-discipline among staff.
In February the International Airline Passengers' Association described
China as an aviation danger spot. The authorities have launched air safety
drives with, it seems, little effect. Safety procedures at airports are lax
by international standards; so too is cabin discipline.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Hata challenges bureaucrats over consumer prices: Living
costs above OECD average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Differences have emerged between Japan's prime minister and the government's
economic bureaucrats over plans to curb the country's high consumer prices.
Mr Tsutomu Hata yesterday welcomed an interim report from an official task
force on deregulation, urging the government to halve over the next five
years the disparity - up to 50 per cent - between Japan's high cost of
living and that of its main partners.
Mr Hata's low price campaign has aroused fears of deflation - a chain
reaction of falling prices, wages and consumption - at the Economic Planning
Agency.
The deregulation panel, staffed by private sector advisers, estimates that
Japanese consumer prices are between 36 per cent and 50 per cent higher than
the US and European average. That is conservative by comparison with an
Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development estimate that Japanese
retail prices are 80 per cent above the OECD average.
Prices could be brought down by cutting costly regulations, banning cartels
and lifting barriers to cheaper imports, the panel proposes.
This is the second time in two weeks that Mr Hata has publicly espoused
consumer price cuts, after his related decision to freeze for six months an
estimated Y460bn (Pounds 2.9bn) worth of public sector price rises.
Both moves are politically popular for obvious reasons. They correspond with
an explosion in discount retailing and a trend among producers of cars and
consumer electronics to design cheaper products for the Japanese market. The
yen's strength has also fuelled demand for cheap imports.
The panel aims to produce a final report by the end of this month, for
inclusion in a government package to open the Japanese market and stimulate
the economy, to be presented to the US in the margins of the group of seven
summit in early July.
EPA officials, however, fear that more deflation on top of an existing
decline in wholesale prices might kill prospects of economic recovery.
Any attempt to force the pace on retail prices is also likely to anger
Japan's shopkeepers and its multi-layered distribution system. These are
important features in high prices and strongholds of the two main opposition
groups, the Liberal Democratic party and Social Democratic party.
According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, 6.9m people
work in retailing and 4.8m in wholesale distribution. This is far higher in
relation to retail sales than in the US, points out Mr Paul Heaton, retail
analyst at Baring Securities in Tokyo.

FT  07 JUN 94 / 51% sale of El Al planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli government yesterday announced plans to sell off 51 per cent of
shares in El Al, the national airline, by the end of the year, with the
remaining 49 per cent to be disposed of at a later date.
The shares will be sold in public offerings on the Tel Aviv stock exchange
and markets abroad, presumably including New York, after the company is
taken out of a 13-year receivership in October.
Two teams of foreign and local experts are carrying out valuations of the
airline, which has had a troubled financial history, but which officials say
made net profits of about Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) last year on revenues in
excess of Dollars 1bn. Official 1993 results have yet to be published.
The El Al sale is the latest stage of a government privatisation drive,
which includes the sale of government holdings in the country's main banks,
intended to raise Dollars 1bn during this year.
Mr Yisrael Kessar, Israeli transport minister, said yesterday the government
intended to issue what he called a 'golden share' in El Al to the state, to
protect vital interests.
Thus, he said, the government would retain the right to order El Al to
maintain flights to and from Israel even at times other airlines were not
flying there. During the 1991 Gulf war, when Israel came under Iraqi Scud
missile attack, El Al was the only airline to maintain its services to and
from Israel.
As a constant target of potential terrorist attack, El Al incurs Dollars 55m
in annual security costs, 80 per cent of which are covered by the
government. It is also limited by a ban on Sabbath flights, imposed under
pressure from minor Orthodox Jewish political parties. Furthermore, the
company is embroiled in a dispute with the US Department of Transportation,
which has ordered it to cut back flights to and from New York because Israel
has refused to authorise flights to Tel Aviv by World Airways.

Ethiopians are pictured examining election posters during Sunday's election
for 547 members to a constituent assembly, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa.
Officials said 90 per cent of registered voters turned out for the assembly
elections, an important stage in entrenching democracy after centuries of
feudal rule followed by Marxist dictatorship.
'It was a smooth sail all the way. We are happy about the way it was
conducted,' said Mr Samson Gethahun, legal affairs head of Ethiopia's
Electoral Board.
A total of 15m of Ethiopia's 50m people were registered to vote.
Provisional results should be known later this week.
A main issue in the draft constitution to be debated by the elected members
is whether it should include a provision on the right of Ethiopia's regions
to self-determination.
Some opposition parties, which draw most support from the Amhara ethnic
group in the capital, boycotted the polls because they believe the new
constitution could fragment one of Africa's most ancient empires.
The Red Sea province of Eritrea seceded last year after opting
overwhelmingly for independence in a self-determination referendum after
years of civil war.
President Meles Zenawi and his then-guerrilla movement, the Ethiopian
Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Force, overthrew the dictatorship of
Mengistu Haile Mariam in May 1990.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Call for new swap and option curbs rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior international bank supervisor yesterday rejected calls for further
regulation of financial derivatives such as swaps and options, arguing that
banks' derivatives trading is already covered by prudential rules.
Mr Tommaso Padio-Schioppa, chairman of the Basle committee on banking
supervision, said creating ad hoc regulations for derivatives would only be
justified if they represented a new form of financial risk.
He stressed that bank supervisors looked at categories of risk rather than
particular products, and risks associated with derivatives were the same as
those involved in other banking operations.
His call reinforced the caution about regulation of derivatives expressed
last month by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, who said
supervisors already had sufficient powers to control derivatives.
Any debate over the possible regulation of bodies such as the unregulated
derivatives trading units of investment banks has been sparked by a US
General Accounting Office report warning of risks from derivatives.
Mr Padio-Schioppa told the International Monetary Conference, a group of
executives from 103 large banks, that the only 'quantum leap' created by
derivatives was in understanding, managing and containing risks.
But he criticised the inadequacy of accounting techniques, disclosure and
reporting of derivatives. This deprived buyers of derivative products of
essential information, he stated.
The Basle committee was concerned 'a market failure' had occurred in
disclosure because no participant wanted to be first to publish information
for fear of losing an advantage. The committee was considering allowing
banks to adapt internal risk management models to calculate capital charges
which they will soon have to apply to market risks, he added.
Banks argue they should be allowed to use such models rather than the
committee's own proposed guidelines. The committee is trying to introduce a
framework for market risk similar to its 1988 accord on credit risk.
Mr Robert Merton, professor of business administration, Harvard Business
School, urged development of new forms of accounting to capture the risks of
derivatives by reporting derivatives exposures.
Mr Robert Leon, general manager of the Financiere Agache Group, affiliated
to the drinks group LVMH, said the company 'very much liked' derivatives and
wanted them to last and grow as a risk management tool. He called for
shareholders of companies to be given more information by managements about
off-balance sheet commitments on derivatives and 'the philosophy which
inspires these'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday decided to activate all emergency consultative
procedures with the US to guard against a possible military response by
North Korea as US and South Korean forces remained on a high state of
readiness.
The procedures include sharing of intelligence on North Korean troop
movements and co-ordination at a military and political level.
South Korean President Kim Young-sam is expected to brief senior officials
and political leaders tomorrow on the dispute over North Korean nuclear
inspections.
Meanwhile, the United Nations Command has asked for a meeting with North
Korean delegates to discuss the North's unilateral withdrawal from the
military armistice commission that supervises the 1953 truce that ended the
Korean War.
North Korea yesterday repeated its warning that UN economic sanctions
imposed on Pyongyang for its failure to accept full international nuclear
inspections would be considered an act of war.
But no unusual North Korean military movements have yet been detected in
spite of increased tensions on the Korean peninsula, according to South
Korean officials.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, has arrived in New York to
consult with the US and Japan on the preparation of a sanctions resolution
that is likely to be introduced this week in the UN Security Council.
The three nations have reportedly already agreed on the timing and degree of
sanctions, which are expected to include Japan stopping at least Dollars
600m (Pounds 399m) in cash remittances sent to North Korea by pro-Pyongyang
Korean-Japanese.
The money is North Korea's largest source of hard currency, which is needed
to buy vital oil and food supplies to prop up its struggling economy.
'The sanctions the UN Security Council will apparently impose would be so
substantial as to cause pain to Pyongyang and would be enforced on a phased
basis,' said a senior South Korean official as quoted by the country's
national news agency.
The gradual introduction of sanctions would give North Korea time to back
away from a confrontation.
The dispute could be solved if the International Atomic Energy Agency is
allowed to examine two suspected nuclear waste sites that could determine
whether Pyongyang diverted plutonium from its reactor to a suspected nuclear
weapons programme in 1989.
The North is believed to have already destroyed other evidence of its
nuclear activity by removing spent fuel rods from its 5MW reactor without
international supervision.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Car importers take record share of Japanese market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car importers in Japan profited from the yen's strength last month to
increase their share of the Japanese market to a record 8.6 per cent.
This completed the seventh consecutive monthly rise in car imports, helped
by aggressive price cutting and an increase in the number of dealers
prepared to break links with Japanese car makers and handle foreign marques.
Foreign producers were, by volume, the main beneficiaries of a 36.2 per cent
rise in car imports in May, from the same month last year, and a 48.4 per
cent rise in all kinds of vehicles, to 21,579 units.
Overall vehicle imports reached 6.6 per cent of the Japanese market, another
record.
The figures come after US and Japan ended a fresh round of talks in
Washington last week without agreement on how further to open the Japanese
car market to imports. Officials are planning to reopen the car talks in
Tokyo on Friday.
As in the past, Japanese producers' overseas car plants also benefited, with
a 50.5 per cent rise, to 4,558 vehicles imported back to their home country.
US car companies, however, were the best performers, up 60.6 per cent, led
by Ford, whose sales nearly tripled by comparison with May 1992, thanks to
the popularity of its Taurus estate car. German producers lifted their
Japanese sales by 25.7 per cent, followed by France with 24 per cent and
Britain - led by Nissan - with 16 per cent.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Local politics drains Nigeria's oil: Violence, sabotage and
leaks in the country's oil-rich south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil spurts out of a broken pipeline and seeps into the tropical bush of the
Niger delta. There is not an oil worker within 10 miles to stop it.
It is the latest spillage at Ebubu, 30 miles east of Port Harcourt, one of
62 oil fields operated by Shell in south-eastern Nigeria.
According to the local Ogoni people, there have been several other oil
spills on their land since November from the exposed pipes which snake along
roads and past houses in the Ogoni's area of Rivers state.
In January, they say, a gas leak at Kpor led to a fire in which a villager
was badly burnt. At another site at Ebubu, about 2 1/2 acres of land has
been caked in oil since a blow-out in the 1970s and in the rainy season it
pollutes one of the streams which are the main source of fresh water in the
area.
A joint venture in the area between the Nigerian government, which owns 55
per cent, Shell (30 per cent), Elf (10 per cent) and Agip (5 per cent)
produces half of Nigeria's 2m barrels a day of oil.
All Shell's oil fields in Ogoni, which used to produce 28,000 barrels a day,
have been closed and some of the flow stations have been vandalised since
mid-1993 when Shell withdrew its staff and contractors from the area in the
face of rising hostility from local communities.
Shell claims that 60 per cent of the spills in Ogoni in 1992 were 'the
direct result of sabotage made to claim compensation'.
Militant leaders in the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People
(Mosop) say that since Shell started Nigeria's oil industry on their land
more than 30 years ago, the company has damaged the environment and
neglected the communities. They also blame Shell for interventions by the
security forces which have led to civilian deaths over the past 12 months.
The oil companies in Nigeria estimate that they lost production and
equipment worth Dollars 200m last year as a result of community disputes.
Last year Shell alone recorded 168 incidents affecting production, lost
1,400 project days and deferred production of 14m barrels of oil. The joint
venture is spending more than Dollars 20m this year on helping the oil area
communities with agricultural extension, scholarships and basic
infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, drinking water and roads.
As the military government tries to launch its constitutional conference,
the minority tribes in the oil-rich delta are trying to wrest control of the
oil wealth from the central government, traditionally dominated by northern
Nigerians, and from the commercial centre of Lagos.
The Ogoni are one of many groups in a rising wave of protest and disorder
across the Niger delta which threatens the security of the staff and
equipment of the multinational oil companies which produce 95 per cent of
Nigeria's exports.
This oil wealth is in striking contrast to the condition of many of the
communities who lack basic amenities. There are almost no environmental laws
to control the pollution from the oil industry.
In 1992 the government set up the Oil and Minerals Producing Areas
Development Commission (Ompadec), with 3 per cent of the revenue and a free
hand to provide infrastructure, jobs, education and better environmental
standards in the area.
Its chairman, Mr Albert Horsfall, says his agency is making a good start but
its budget of Dollars 90m a year is inadequate. He estimates that it will
take Dollars 4.5bn over five years to meet its target, but such investment
looks unrealistic.
The government is cutting back its investment in the oil industry, which
will depress future production and revenues. At the same time the
international donors have suspended aid to Nigeria. Shell plans to stay away
from the Ogoni area until the dispute has been settled peacefully, a distant
prospect.
Since Mr Ken Saro-Wiwa became its leader, Mosop is demanding that Shell
by-pass central government, which collects the nation's oil revenue, and pay
royalties and rent direct to the half million Ogonis, beginning with Dollars
6bn in back pay.
Mr Saro-Wiwa insists on environmental and social impact studies, sponsored
by Shell, on the effects of the past 30 years and says the oil companies
must raise their standards to those elsewhere in the world.
Mosop demands the Ogonis' right to 'self-determination in which they will
freely determine their political destiny, use their resources for their own
development . . . while contributing to the Nigerian kaleidoscope.'
This touches a raw nerve with Nigeria's military rulers, as Nigeria is made
up of more than 200 ethnic groups.
Mosop claims that the destruction of the village of Kaa on Ogoni's southern
border last August, which left hundreds homeless or dead or homeless, was
the work of security forces. An Ogoni council chairman has protested to the
Rivers state governor over the 'destruction of lives and property of Ogoni
people by Nigerian soldiers' in five villages near Afam.
Last month Mr Saro-Wiwa was arrested in connection with the murder of four
rival Ogoni politicians. The Rivers state commissioner of police has asked
for 400 troops to tighten security in the area. US diplomats approaching the
area have been turned back. A visiting foreign journalist has been deported.
Half Shell Nigeria's 5,000 workforce are employed as security staff at a
cost of Dollars 18m a year. Rather than spending more and more on security,
the oil companies and the government should try to cure the root causes of
the community attacks, argues the company's chairman, Mr Brian Anderson.
In January, Nigeria's ministers of oil, internal affairs and trade toured
all the oil producing areas of Nigeria and promised a report of their
findings.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Driving those yellow dog blues out of the Old South: George
Graham finds the US Republican party trying to advance on what used to be
unpromising ground in the state of Mississippi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have to be at least 74 years old, and white, to have taken part in a
congressional election in Mississippi's first district when Congressman
Jamie Whitten was not running.
The veteran Democrat has represented the district, which stretches across
the north of the US state, since 1941, rarely facing any challenge and, even
when there was opposition, only once gaining less than 60 per cent of the
vote.
Mr Whitten's retirement from the House of Representatives, at the age of 84,
has brought six Republican and three Democratic candidates to fight primary
elections today. They are seeking the right to contest, in November, a seat
where the Republican party has high hopes of extending its resurgence in
what used to be the solidly Democratic South.
Identification of the Republicans with President Abraham Lincoln and the
Reconstruction period after the Civil War of the 1860s is no longer a
drawback, and the South's social conservatism aligns closely with the
Republican party platform.
'It has historically been a yellow dog Democrat area - they'd rather vote
for a yellow dog than for a Republican. With Whitten out of the race, I
think we've got a better shot,' says Mr Billy Powell, the Republican party's
Mississippi state chairman. 'Given how the district is changing, it clearly
fits the profile of a Republican congressional district,' says Professor
Leslie Burl McLemore, a political scientist at Jackson State University in
the state capital.
Mr Whitten's birthplace is in the hamlet of Cascilla - two groceries and a
petrol pump besieged by kudzu vine on the edge of the Delta, the flatlands
between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers. His district once included a part
of the Delta, but reapportionment moved this mainly black area into another
constituency.
Today, the district's centre is Tupelo, a burgeoning business centre known
for its furniture making and as the birthplace of Elvis Presley. It
encompasses the university town of Oxford and rapidly growing De Soto
County, a dormitory suburb for Memphis, just across the border in Tennessee.
Mr Whitten, too, has changed over the years. Once a rabid segregationist, he
became, after blacks had started, from the late 1960s, to be allowed to vote
in Mississippi, one of the most liberal members of the state's congressional
delegation - with the exception of Mr Mike Espy, now President Clinton's
agriculture secretary, and Mr Bennie Thompson, who have in turn represented
the majority black Delta district.
The congressional seniority system gave Mr Whitten great power in
Washington. As chairman of the agriculture appropriations sub-committee for
more than 40 years, and of the full appropriations committee from 1978-93,
he controlled federal government purse strings and made sure that, when they
were loosened, his district and his state won their share.
No new member of congress is going to be able to match Mr Whitten's ability
to bring home the bacon and it is not certain that voters in the 1990s, more
attuned to the federal budget deficit, rank this ability at the top of their
list.
'I think they have done a little too much for us already,' said Mr Lee
Inman, a barber in Calhoun City.
The Republicans' task is by no means easy, however. They have won the
Mississippi governorship and both its senate seats, but made less headway at
the local level. They hold none of the state's five congressional districts.
For one thing, in a state where virtually every politician poses as a
conservative, it is sometimes hard to distinguish one party from the other.
'It's kind of hard to tell the Democrats from the Republicans in this
district,' says Ms Barbara McDonald, a campaign aide to Mr Tim Ford, speaker
of the Mississippi legislature and one of the candidates for the Democratic
nomination.
'Quite frankly, we only have two Democrats in the Mississippi delegation,
Bennie Thompson and Jamie Whitten, and we are about to lose Jamie Whitten.
The rest of them are in fact Republicans,' says Prof McLemore.
Local penetration for the Republicans is hampered by the Democratic
stranglehold on county-level government. 'The real power has been at the
county supervisor level, the courthouse crowd. I don't know if there is a
single Republican county supervisor in the first district,' says Mr Powell.
He believes many local politicians are almost ready to switch parties. In
the last year, seven county supervisors and five state legislators have left
the Democrats.
But although it is possible to run in Mississippi as a Republican and win,
it is still a risky choice for local politicians. This has much less to do
with 'yellow dog Democrat' resentment of the Republicans, dating back to the
Civil War, than it does with the fact that anyone running as a Republican
can say goodbye to virtually all black voters - and they make up a third of
the state's population.
The Republican party's success in state-wide elections has been won, to a
great extent, by advertising. But here, too, the district poses problems:
much of the most fertile ground for the Republicans is in the Memphis
suburbs of De Soto County, whose inhabitants are often recent arrivals in
Mississippi and who, in any case, read Tennessee newspapers and watch
Tennessee television - whose advertising rates are much higher than for
broadcasters in the Tupelo area.
Money from the national Republican party could overcome this problem, as it
did in the recent by-election in Kentucky, which the Republicans won. At the
November election, however, every promising congressional district will have
to compete for national funding with all the other Republican prospects.
That money might well be forthcoming, even so. The Republican party trails
by 42 seats to 59 in the 11 south-eastern states of the US, and this region
offers some of the party's best chances of eating into the 256:178
Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Reich on a 'third way' to jobs: David Goodhart records the
US labour secretary's 'flexible' views
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creating not only more jobs but better jobs, in an increasingly insecure
economic environment, was one of the promises that propelled a Democrat into
the White House 18 months ago.
This week, Mr Robert Reich, the loquacious US labour secretary, is touring
Europe with a progress report on that promise and advocating a 'third way'
between the low unemployment/low social protection US model and the high
unemployment/high social protection European model.
Mr Reich, with a flair for coining phrases reminiscent of his fellow
economist, Professor J K Galbraith, paints a bleak vision of the future
unless the gap between the labour market's privileged and its deprived is
closed.
He describes how US society is already divided into an elite 'over-class' of
15 per cent of the population, increasingly segregated from the rest of
society, and a deprived 'under-class' of a similar proportion. This division
has been a blessing for the US private security industry, which has more
employees than the public police forces.
Squeezed between the over- and under-class is the 'anxious' class, what used
to be called the middle-class, whose incomes have been static for 20 years
and who are increasingly prey to demagogues demanding an end to free trade.
'The coming political battle will be for the souls of the anxious class,'
says Mr Reich.
So how is the Democratic administration doing in this battle? Some 3m mainly
private-sector jobs have been created in the past 16 months, an improvement
on the previous four years but one that is substantially cyclical in nature.
The 'structural' reforms - aimed at raising the quality of the workforce and
creating more good jobs - take longer. There are three basic ideas: to
improve the school-to-work transition with better vocational training, to
provide more tax credits for low earners, and to turn the social safety net
into a lifelong learning 'springboard' to re-employment.
'Legislation we now have before Congress will begin to turn our unemployment
system into a re-employment system that launches workers into new jobs.
Security comes from maintaining a flexible set of skills,' says Mr Reich.
He insists that it is not just a matter for the state - rather for
government, employers and employees.
What relevance does this have for the Europe Mr Reich is visiting -
yesterday in London, today in Paris at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, and on Wednesday at the International Labour
Organisation conference in Geneva?
Yesterday, to his hosts in London, the left-of-centre Institute for Public
Policy Research, he stressed that increased flexibility is not the same as
the labour market de-regulation favoured by British Conservatives. But he
did not only say things that raise a cheer from a left-of-centre audience.
He argued against traditional job subsidies, saying that, in 70 per cent of
cases, employers are being subsidised for employees they would have hired
without a subsidy.
Mr Reich was also circumspect about whether trade sanctions are the right
means to enforce basic labour and human rights standards in the developing
world. He does believe it is legitimate to press developing countries on
some basic standards but he believes this pressure should be exerted through
'a menu' of levers, not just through trade.

FT  07 JUN 94 / California dominates primary day in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
California dominates the heaviest mid-term primary round today in the US,
where eight states choose candidates to contest four governorships, five
senate seats and 87 House of Representatives places.
Mr Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, and Ms Kathleen Brown, the
Democratic state treasurer, are strongly favoured in California to emerge as
opponents in the country's most important race in November. The outcome will
have a heavy bearing on the 1996 presidential election  - a Republican
victory would be a clear setback for President Bill Clinton and the
Democrats.
Mr Wilson must first beat Mr Ron Unz, a computer magnate from the far right
whose campaign has been mostly self-financed. The governor holds a lead of
upwards of 20 points.
Ms Brown's father, Edmund G. Brown Sr, known as Pat, and her brother Jerry
each served two terms as governor of California. She must overcome
challenges from Mr John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, and Mr
Tom Hayden, now a state senator, once an anti-Vietnam War activist and once
husband of Jane Fonda, the actress.
Six months ago, with California still in recession and Mr Wilson unpopular,
Ms Brown seemed certain to continue the family political dynasty. But, with
her campaign lacking definition and the economy improving, the governor,
prominent in rebuilding efforts after the Los Angeles earthquake in January,
has recovered.
Mr Wilson has also benefited politically by riding with the Californian
backlash against illegal immigration. A Los Angeles Times poll last week
found 59:32 per cent support for a proposition that may be on the November
ballot and would bar illegal immigrants from many public services, including
education. Ms Brown opposes such a move.
Also closely watched is the race for the Senate seat held by Ms Dianne
Feinstein, a Democrat. Her likely Republican challenger is Congressman
Michael Huffington, if he beats former Congressman Bill Dannemeyer, another
ultra-conservative.
Mr Huffington's main claims to fame are less his political record than his
vast oil wealth - he spent a national record of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) to
win his House seat two years ago - and ambitious wife. She is the former Ms
Arianna Stassinopoulos, an author who cut a wide social swathe through
Britain in the 1970s and now seems intent on propelling her husband to the
top of the US political tree.
Again, Ms Feinstein had looked unbeatable, but her approval ratings have
dropped below 50 per cent and she now holds poll leads of only 5-14 points.
As in the Wilson-Brown race, Ms Feinstein and Mr Huffington have already
begun directly attacking each other.
In other races across the country, there is less opportunity for the
fundamentalist right to make a clear mark, as happened last weekend with the
nomination of Mr Oliver North as Republican senatorial candidate in
Virginia. Senator Bob Dole, Republican minority leader in the Senate, was
concerned enough about the broader message of that selection to say he might
not welcome Mr North to the chamber.
Most closely watched will be the Democratic senate primary in Montana, where
Senator Conrad Burns is one of the few vulnerable Republicans for November.
Mr Jack Mudd is favoured to beat former Senator John Melcher, but the
Democratic race has been complicated by the presence of a third candidate,
Ms Becky Shaw, girl-friend of a former close aide to Mr Melcher. She may
draw votes from Mr Mudd.
In Iowa, Governor Terry Branstad, in pursuit of a fourth term, is in a tight
Republican primary against Congressman Fred Grandy.

</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has expanded its top level of management,
naming three new deputy managing directors to take the place of Mr Richard
Erb, the outgoing deputy managing director.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, yesterday appointed Mr Stanley
Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the
US, along with Mr Alassane Ouattara, former prime minister of Ivory Coast,
and Mr Prabhakar Narvekar, an IMF official.
Since the IMF's top position is usually held by a European, the deputy's
post has been, by tradition, in the gift of the US. In recent weeks, US
Treasury officials have been at pains to ensure that they retained this
pre-eminence.
Mr Fischer was accordingly named first deputy managing director, with broad
responsibilities across all the issues facing the IMF.
All three deputies have worked for many years in international financial
institutions. Mr Fischer used to be chief economist at the World Bank, just
across the road from the IMF in Washington, while Mr Narvekar has spent more
than 40 years at the IMF.
Mr Ouattara, meanwhile, has twice before worked for the IMF. He left in 1988
to become governor of the central bank of the African franc zone and, later,
to take charge of the Ivory Coast's economy.
The decision to enlarge the IMF's upper hierarchy has been greeted by some
suspicion within the organisation.
Some IMF officials fear that it will simply add another layer above that of
the regional directors, who now report directly to Mr Camdessus.
He said yesterday that the reorganisation was the first since a deputy
managing director was appointed in 1949, and was necessary to deal with the
rapid expansion in the IMF's membership.

The campaign leading up to next Sunday's referendum in Austria on European
Union membership has reached fever pitch, as the latest opinion polls
indicate the vote could go other either way. A poll taken in recent days
indicated that 31 per cent of voters favoured joining, with a similar number
opposed and 38 per cent undecided. The socialist-conservative coalition
government has been betraying increasing signs of anxiety. The ATX index of
19 leading shares on the Vienna bourse has lost 5 per cent of its value in
the past week, with investors jittery about the referendum outcome.
In Norway, also a candidate for entry, resistance has reached new heights,
just five months ahead of a national referendum, according to a poll
published yesterday. Opposition to joining rose by one percentage point to
56 per cent, at the expense of support for membership which fell to 32 per
cent from 33 per cent in May, the lowest level this year. Norway rejected
membership in 1972 in a bitterly devisive referendum, but is to hold a new
vote on November 28, after Austria and the other two applicants, Finland and
Sweden.

Talks on a comprehensive ceasefire in Bosnia got under way yesterday ,four
days late and in an atmosphere of belligerence and suspicion. The mainly
Moslem Bosnian government ended its boycott of the United Nations-sponsored
talks yesterday, following the withdrawal of armed Serbs from a 3km
exclusion zone around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. However, Mr Yasushi Akashi,
who heads UN operations in Bosnia, failed in his effort to bring the two
sides to the same negotiating table, damping hopes that a nationwide
ceasefire was a real possibility. Mr Akashi put to each side separately a
draft UN plan which reportedly includes an initial four-month ceasefire,
withdrawal of heavy weapons from front lines and the separation of forces by
interposition of UN troops. The plan would require at least 5,000 extra UN
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. The Bosnian government favours a short truce,
fearing that a four-month ceasefire would effectively freeze existing battle
lines and leave the Bosnian Serbs in possession of territory seized by
force. The Bosnian Serb side wants a permanent ceasefire, or one lasting at
least six months.

<TEXT>
Officials from Germany's federal criminal police office and the Frankfurt
state prosecutors' office will today start conducting inquiries in Geneva
into money transfers made by Mr Jurgen Schneider, the businessman whose
disappearance in March triggered Germany's biggest property collapse since
the second world war. The prosecutors' office said yesterday it suspected Mr
Schneider of transferring DM245m (Pounds 98m) of Schneider group cash out of
Germany during March at a time when the group's liquidity problems were
mounting. The money is believed to have been transferred via London to
Nassau in the Bahamas before ending up in Geneva. As a result, said the
prosecutor's office, the fugitive businessman was under suspicion of
conducting 'fraudulent bankruptcy on a massive scale'. He already faces
charges of tax evasion and fraud. The Schneider group collapsed in April
owing more than DM5bn. Despite several reported sightings, his whereabouts
are still unknown.

Newspapers continue to thrive across Europe despite increased competition
from the electronic media, according to Pira International, the printing
industry research organisation*. Its report shows that, overall, newspapers
maintained the largest share of advertising revenue in western Europe and
generated total revenues in 1992 (the last year when figures are available)
of Dollars 38bn (Pounds 25bn). 'Television has expanded the amount of time
people spend consuming media. It has not transferred that time from
newspapers,' the report concludes. During 1992 more than 92m newspapers were
bought every day in the European Union and European Free Trade Association.
In Austria, daily newspaper sales rose by 14.6 per cent between 1988 and
1992, reflecting the launch of a new national newspaper. During the same
period, however, sales of Greek dailies fell by 34.7 per cent, mainly, it is
believed, because publishers tried to raise cover prices too high.
The two biggest markets by far in western Europe are Germany where 26m
copies are sold every day, followed by the UK with 20.7m. France is third
with 8.8m. Most investments in eastern Europe by western publishers have
been in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary but the first moves into
Bulgaria and Romania are expected this year. The largest newspaper publisher
in Europe measured by newspaper sales is Germany's Axel Springer, followed
by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International and the private German group
Holtzbrinck. * European Newspaper Industry, Pira International, Randalls

FT  07 JUN 94 / Ankara seeks to soothe debt concerns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Turkey yesterday sought to reassure foreign bankers that it will meet its
international debt obligations, amid tentative signs the government's
liquidity crisis is easing.
Speaking to a conference in Istanbul, Mr Bulent Ozgun, head of the
government's debt department, said the country would meet the Dollars 9.1bn
in capital and interest owed on its Dollars 67bn foreign debt this year.
The government last week eased its immediate liquidity worries, successfully
returning to local debt markets, selling 3-month paper at 50 per cent
interest. The tighter monetary conditions helped stabilise the lira, which
yesterday was trading at around 33,000 to the dollar compared with 41,000 in
mid-April.
Turkey's growing foreign debt burden is a function of last year's fiscal
strategy, which relied on heavy offshore borrowing in an effort to ease the
pressure on domestic interest rates, reduce budget costs and avoid crowding
out the private sector. But after pulling a Dollars 900m global issue in
March, and repeated credit downgradings by both Standard &amp; Poor's and
Moody's, the US rating agencies, Turkey will need the help of bilateral and
multilateral official creditors if it is to avoid a debt rescheduling.
Mr Ozgun yesterday criticised international credit agencies for being too
hasty in downgrading Turkey in January, the event which triggered the run on
the currency and plunged the country into this five-month crisis. 'We paid
our debts during the worst times, and we will continue doing so,' he said.
He ruled out an early return to the bond markets, however the government is
looking to secure agreement with the International Monetary Fund early next
month on a standby facility, in an effort to boost investor sentiment.
With an economic slowdown likely and the devaluation, officials expect a cut
in imports. With tourism revenues about the same as last year's, officials
are projecting a balanced current account in 1994. On the capital account,
as long as Turkey is able to roll over existing lines, the government
expects zero net borrowings this year. 'We don't think it's in the interests
of the foreign lenders to go to a rescheduling instead of keeping their
trade lines open,' says Mr Necati Ozfirat, head of the state planning
organisation (SPO).
With Dollars 4.7bn worth of medium- and long-term principal maturing in
1994, Turkey is looking to some Dollars 3.7bn of new drawings this year.
Direct foreign investment is projected at Dollars 600m. Portfolio
investment, which includes both privatisation receipts and planned sale of
convertible stock in PTT the state-owned telecommunications company, is
targeted at Dollars 2.1bn. The SPO is forecasting a Dollars 2.5bn net
short-term capital outflow, as Turkish banks and corporations reduce their
foreign exchange exposure following the lira's 50 per cent fall against the
dollar. The change in official reserves, now at just Dollars 3.4bn, or less
than two months' import cover, is projected at Dollars 2bn.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister, announced the Dollars 1.2bn Gulf defence
fund - Arab and US funds lodged in the Bank of New York to finance Turkey's
F-16 fighter aircraft programme - is to be transferred to the Turkish
central bank, boosting reserves. Turkey is also looking at credits from the
Council of Europe's social fund, and is calling for the release of the
European Union's fourth financial protocol, an aid package for Turkey which
Greece is blocking in an attempt to wring concessions on the Cyprus dispute.

orders rose 35.5 per cent in the first quarter. Demand for housing doubled.
Commercial orders rose 20.8 per cent, and public orders were up 19.5 per
cent. As a share of the overall eastern German market, housing grew to 27.8
per cent from 18.8 per cent. Reuter, Wiesbaden
Car sales in Italy rose 7.53 per cent year-on-year to May, with 178,869
units delivered during the month, the car industry association, Anfia, said.
Spain's official currency reserves fell Dollars 394.3m (Pounds 262m) in May

FT  07 JUN 94 / Hungary looks down the Polish road: Warsaw's economic moves
are attracting interest as a role model in Budapest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>

   WARSAW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As Hungary prepares for the return of a Socialist government, Polish voters
are finding that, nine months after their own elections, the Socialist-led
Polish coalition government has delivered little in the way of economic
pain-relief.
On the contrary, the Socialist finance minister, Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, has
promised to press ahead with reforms which will cut welfare spending and
focus social and pension payments more closely on the truly needy. At the
same time he has promised to tighten the struggle against inflation and
strengthen the institutional underpinning of the capitalist economy through
the development of investment and pension funds.
Market reformers in Hungary's Socialist party, led by Mr Laszlo Bekesi, its
economic spokesman, would like a Socialist-led Hungarian government to
follow similar policies. But the overall majority given to the Hungarian
Socialists at the second round of voting last month, means that the party
will be under much stronger pressure from rank-and-file voters to deliver on
its electoral promises to ease the economic pain.
Unlike Hungary, whose conservative post-Communist government decided to
honour its inherited foreign debt obligations to the letter, Poland's former
Communist government reneged on its official debt in the early 1980s and the
first post-Communist government did likewise on its eventual Dollars 13bn
bank debt shortly after taking power. Now the new Socialist-led Polish
government is benefiting from Paris and London Club debt reduction and
rescheduling accords.
International bankers believe one of the risks inherent in the Hungarian
election result could be pressure from below for the new government to
follow Poland's example and seek some form of debt relief, a temptation
absolutely rejected by Hungarian governments in the past.
Thanks in part to its impeccable credit record Hungary has been the biggest
recipient of foreign equity capital, more than Dollars 7bn since 1989. The
new government will be extremely reluctant to put future flows at risk by
changing its attitude to foreign creditors. But past borrowing has left the
incoming government with a Dollars 25bn gross debt burden on the country's
just over 10m inhabitants and a heavy repayment schedule. It therefore has
less room for manoeuvre than the Polish government, but will probably be
under greater pressure to satisfy demands for improvements in standards of
living than the Polish government where responsibility is shared between
coalition partners and economic growth is raising incomes across a broad
front.
Lower debt payments, and shock therapy reforms begun in 1990, helped Poland
achieve a return to economic growth by 1993 while Hungary is still
struggling to resume steady growth. Warsaw expects growth to continue at 4-5
per cent a year over the next two years and possibly accelerate if, as
expected, foreign investment increases.
As long as Poland's coalition partners, the PSL farmers party and the
post-Communist SLD stay together, they have time to push through
controversial reforms of the welfare system and still run for re-election
successfully in 1997, hence their willingness to continue with tough
measures now.
The Polish government's economic plan for the next four years, to be
unveiled in parliament shortly, includes cutting the link between pensions
and average wage rises for 7m senior citizens and switching the indexation
formula to a less generous inflation-linked system. It also tightens the
criteria for disability pensions and unemployment benefits.
The government's strategic choice to go for the long haul and avoid
short-term palliatives has disillusioned many voters but cost little in real
political capital. The coalition's refusal to ease monetary and fiscal
policies, which it hinted at but never actually promised during the election
campaign, has caused the protest vote that swung it into power to evaporate.
Its core support is still there but the government is now viewed by the mass
of voters as differing little from that which ran the country after 1989
when the Communist system slipped from the stage with barely a whimper.
The failure of an attempt by the Solidarity trade union, now back in
opposition, to get a general strike under way in April left the government
feeling confident that it could ride out future discontent as it awaits the
economic upswing to translate into tangible improvements for the man in the
street.
The benefits of tough financial and monetary policies are already becoming
more apparent. For a start, Polish unemployment is beginning to fall.
Registered unemployed have fallen for two months in succession to 2.9m or
13.7 per cent of the workforce, while industrial output in the first four
months of the year was running 10 per cent higher than in the same period
last year.
Corporate profits are also improving as productivity grows and costs come
under control. Industrial companies earned 9,000bn zlotys (Pounds 265m) net
in the first three months of the year compared to a 1,138bn zloty net loss
in the same quarter of 1993. Foreign currency reserves, at more than Dollars
4bn, also continue to grow, even though the country registered a payments
deficit of Dollars 438m in the first quarter as exports continued to lag
behind imports, producing a trade deficit which the government expects to
continue until 1997 at least.
Meanwhile, the budget deficit remains under control and inflation is falling
to an expected annual rate of 25 per cent this year, down from 35 per cent
in 1993. This has allowed the bank to lower base interest rates by a point
or two last month. This has left the NBP confident enough to press ahead
with introducing a 'hard zloty' next January. The change will erase four
zeros so that one US dollar will no longer be worth around 25,000 but only
2.5 zlotys.
Critics of the Polish government, however, question its performance and
argue that the positive outcome of the past nine months is the result of the
policies of previous Solidarity coalition government led by Ms Hanna
Suchocka. They fear that the present government, led by Mr Waldemar Pawlak
from the PSL farmers party and sensitive to protectionist and other claims
from the powerful farmers' lobby, will sooner or later turn to more
inflationary policies.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Nato arms pour into Greece and Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arsenals of Turkey and Greece, nominal Nato allies whose chronically
tense relations have come under fresh strain in recent weeks, are being
upgraded at an unprecedented pace, according to an independent study.
Last year alone, Turkey received a total of 1,017 main battle tanks - almost
as much as the entire holdings of the British army - from the US and
Germany, while Greece took delivery of 725, the study shows.
Figures on the two countries' arms imports were extrapolated by researchers
in Britain, the US and Germany from the United Nations Register of
Conventional Arms, which has been tracking the weapons trade since the
beginning of 1992.
They indicate that total deliveries to Greece and Turkey in 1992-93 from
Germany and the US included 2,822 tanks, 1,084 armoured combat vehicles, 303
large calibre artillery systems, 28 attack helicopters and 14 warships.
The statistics were compiled by the British American Security Information
Council and the Berlin Information Centre for Transatlantic Security. Both
are independent lobby groups that promote disarmament.
A spokesman for the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research, another arms
trade watchdog, said its researches also pointed to a heavy flow of
armaments to Greece and Turkey.
Most of the deliveries were made free of charge under a programme known as
Cascade, under which the smaller Nato countries can receive weapons from
allies who are obliged to slash their arsenals under arms control agreement.
Even though much of the equipment being transferred is secondhand, it
represents a huge improvement over existing Greek and Turkish stocks.
Most of the tanks involved have been US-built M-60s or German Leopards, both
of which carry much more sophisticated electronic equipment than the M-48
which has been a mainstay of both armies until recently.
During the cold war period, the leading Nato members worked energetically
behind the scenes to put some limit on the intensity of Greek-Turkish
rivalry, but this effort has now slackened.
An initiative to promote confidence-building measures among the countries of
southeastern Europe - launched in Vienna under the aegis of the Helsinki
process - was quietly abandoned after one meeting in March, diplomats say.
Greece and Turkey now find themselves sympathising with opposite sides in
former Yugoslavia, with Turkey one of the strongest supporters of Bosnia's
Moslem leadership and Greece a traditional friend of the Serbs.
Relations between Athens and Ankara have deteriorated in recent days
following allegations in the Turkish media that supporters of the Kurdish
insurgency which has claimed around 12,000 lives in eastern Turkey were
trained in Greece.
Without directly blaming the Greek government, the Turkish authorities have
pointedly drawn the attention of several western governments to these
reports.
The Greek government has angrily rejected the allegations, and the Athens
media have quoted a Kurdish prisoner in Turkey as saying, in a message
smuggled out of jail, that his account of training in Greece was extracted
under duress.

FT  07 JUN 94 / SPD vows to stop squabbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) yesterday admitted that
the wind had gone out of its campaign to win the October elections but vowed
it would close ranks for the last leg. Mr Rudolf Scharping, its leader, said
that the party had been unable to achieve a 'significant lead' in recent
months, a setback which he blamed on internal squabbles. 'Everyone has
finally sworn to end this process,' he said after a meeting between the
party leadership and SPD members from all 16 Lander governments. A series of
recent opinion polls have shown Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union pulling level with or overtaking the SPD, bolstered by
signs of an economic recovery and stronger support in eastern Germany.
Going back on earlier comments, the SPD also said that 'for technical
reasons' it would keep the so-called 'solidarity surcharge' - a 7.5 per cent
tax to finance investment in eastern Germany - until 1996. The party had
earlier said the surcharge would be scrapped and replaced with a 10 per cent
charge on single people earning over DM60,000 annually. This will now be
introduced in 1996.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Ferruzzi's finery goes under the hammer: Auction marks end
of an era of corporate extravagance in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the trials, the auctions. Today, in Milan, Sotheby's will begin a
three-day sale of paintings, furniture, tapestries and ornaments which
adorned the boardrooms, company flats and country residences of
Ferruzzi-Montedison, before its industrial empire collapsed last year amid
allegations of bribery and fraud.
The items belong to the company, now going through painful restructuring,
and the sale should raise between L3bn (Pounds 1.2m) and L5bn (Pounds 2.1m),
making a tiny dent in the L31,000bn of debt built up at Ferruzzi-Montedison
under the chairmanship of the flamboyant Mr Raul Gardini, who committed
suicide last year while under investigation.
The sale marks the formal end to an era of extravagant Italian corporate
spending in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In addition - in spite of
Sotheby's and Ferruzzi's attempts to play down the link - the whiff of
scandal is bound to attract a few buyers on the look-out for collectable
souvenirs of Italy's Tangentopoli bribery and corruption investigations.
It is still only six weeks since Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial intermediary
to Ferruzzi-Montedison, was jailed for corruption and false accounting, and
less than a month before the trial of top politicians from the discredited
old regime, many of them suspected of receiving bribes from the group.
In terms of quality, the auction probably has more in common with last
year's nine-day auction of items from the Thurn und Taxis estate, which
raised DM31.5bn (Pounds 12.6bn) for Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis to
pay inheritance taxes, than with recent British auctions of trinkets
belonging to Mr Robert Maxwell, the discredited media magnate, and Mr Asil
Nadir, the fugitive businessman.
Mr Giuseppe Ceccatelli, managing director of Sotheby's Milan office, says he
is hoping for international interest in the top item in the sale, a Roman
landscape by the 18th century Flemish-born artist, Jan Frans van Bloemen -
guide price: L250m-L350m.
On the other hand, he does not try to play down the novelty value of a 19th
century games table - a cross between snooker and pin-ball - which Mr
Gardini would have used when entertaining at the company's Tuscan hunting
lodge. For those unable to stump up its estimated price of up to L40m, there
are more modest lots made up of glass from the Ferruzzi-controlled Venini
factory, which could sell for as little as L350,000.
Patient collectors may yet wait for what could be even more spectacular
sales as the Tangentopoli investigations run their course. Last year, for
example, police seized 60 paintings, including several modern masterpieces,
from the apartment of Mr Duilio Poggiolini, a senior health ministry
official alleged to have taken bribes. At the time, the value of the
paintings alone was estimated at L5bn. For an Italian art market now in the
doldrums, the irony is that it was probably the purchase of such works which
helped fuel the buoyancy of the late 1980s.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Montell plastics venture may go to court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Challengers to a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) plastics joint venture between
Anglo-Dutch company Royal Dutch/Shell and Italy's Montedison are likely to
take the European Commission to the European Court of First Instance, one
step below the European Court of Justice, if it approves the deal.
A final decision on the fiercely contested case is likely to be given
tomorrow. The Commission is expected to give its approval after having
considered concessions put forward by Montedison and Royal Dutch/Shell that
they say will limit the strength of the joint venture.
But the deal's main challengers - principally US-owned Union Carbide - are
not satisfied that the undertakings will prevent the joint venture, Montell,
from dominating the European polypropylene market and hindering competition.
'There is a lot at stake,' said one observer of the case. 'The complainants
would have to consider their position.'
The challengers to the Montell deal argue that concessions - hastily
presented by Montedison and Royal Dutch/Shell to the Commission last week -
do not answer the objections raised by the Commission in the first place. An
advisory committee to the Commission last month recommended that the deal be
blocked. It is understood that their objections related to the prospect of a
near monopoly on polypropylene technologies.
The creation of Montell would be one of the biggest of a series of joint
ventures and asset sales in the European chemicals industry in the last two
years. Manufacturers are restructuring to cope with recession and strong new
competitors in eastern Europe, the Middle East and east Asia.
Montell would be easily the world's biggest polypropylene manufacturer.
Thanks to a separate arrangement between Shell Oil, the US arm of the
company, and Union Carbide, it would also give Shell control over two of the
most important polypropylene manufacturing technologies.
A decision by the contestants to continue the challenge in the European
Court of First Instance would be an unusual step.
The Commission has only rarely been challenged, the best known case being
when Air France challenged British Airways' acquisition of UK airline
Dan-Air. Earlier this year, the court rejected Air France's appeal against
the European Commission's finding that British Airways' acquisition of Dan
Air was outside the scope of the European Merger Regulation.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Tories may win 30% of vote in Euro-poll survey says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An opinion poll for the Labour party suggested yesterday the Conservatives
may do better than many expect in Thursday's European parliament election,
winning up to 30 per cent of the vote and 20 seats.
The poll, which is broadly in line with private polling for Conservative
central office, suggests that core Tory voters have been reassured by Mr
John Major's Euro-sceptic handling of the election campaign.
However, divisions emerged over the prime minister's concept of a
'multi-speed' Europe, as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
summoned up the D-Day spirit for the last few days of electioneering.
In a rallying call to activists at Conservative central office, Mr Heseltine
gave full backing to Mr Major's stress on Britain's pursuit of self-interest
in Europe.
He said the multi-speed concept reflected the political reality of the
decades since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which launched the European
Community in 1957, and applied to all EU member states.
But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the cabinet's most prominent
pro-European, said Britain should retain a leading role in the Union. 'I
believe that Britain should set the running, can set the running, and we
should exercise our full weight in the Union,' he said after talks with EU
finance ministers in Luxembourg.
Mr John Gummer, the pro-European environment secretary, also said in London
that it was 'absolutely clear' that Britain could not move at a slower speed
than the rest of the EU.
The opinion poll, by NOP, indicated that 43 per cent were likely to vote
Labour, 30 per cent Conservative and 21 per cent Liberal Democrat. Labour
officials said such a turnout would give the party 50-55 of the 84 British
mainland seats. The Conservatives would win about 20, and the Liberal
Democrats would win some seats in the south-west, where their support is
concentrated. Labour currently holds 45 seats and the Conservatives 32.
Labour strategists believe the NOP poll is more accurate than a Gallup
survey for the Daily Telegraph, which last week put the Conservatives in
third place on 21 per cent of the vote. A Gallup poll in today's Telegraph,
puts Labour on 53 per cent, the Tories on 23 per cent and the Liberal
Democrats on 17.5 per cent.
A poll of polls in today's Guardian suggests the Tories will win only six
seats, Labour 65, and the Liberal Democrats 12.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Unilever hits back in detergents battle
</HEADLINE>

The wrangle over Unilever's revolutionary new detergent showed no sign of
easing yesterday as the Anglo-Dutch giant claimed sharp increases in UK
market share despite accusations from a rival that it damages clothes.
But in the Netherlands a leading supermarket chain said it was considering
whether to stop stocking the product.
The detergent, launched across Europe last month under various brand names
such as Persil Power and Omo Power, has been attacked as harmful to clothes
by manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble.
Unilever said yesterday that Persil Power's share of the total UK detergent
market had jumped from 7 per cent to 10 per cent in recent weeks. Its UK
share of the fast-growing market for concentrated detergents, in which
Unilever has lost ground to Procter &amp; Gamble in recent years, is estimated
to have risen from about 20 to 30 per cent.
Mr Andrew Seth, chief executive of Unilever's UK detergents business, said
this was a larger and faster increase than the company had expected.
Albert Heijn, the biggest Dutch supermarket chain, yesterday asked Unilever
for further information about the detergent so that it could decide whether
to continue stocking it. Heijn said it expected to hear from Unilever today.
'There have been reports in the media that the product is not reliable, but
it is only fair and polite for us to give our supplier a chance to clarify
the situation,' the supermarket group said.
Mr Seth dismissed Procter &amp; Gamble's research findings about damage to
clothes as 'irrelevant'.
He said: 'If you pick the right combination of dye, stains, material and
basic colour, you can get results which will show severe damage. If I want
to, I can do the same with competing products.'
Unilever confirmed that it was to modify the formula of the new detergent,
chiefly through reducing the quantity of its novel manganese-based catalyst,
which Procter claims causes the damage. Procter retaliated by arguing that
even at one-tenth of present levels, the catalyst caused abnormal wear and
tear.
The Netherlands' largest consumer protection group called on Unilever
yesterday to make a clear distinction between the old and new Omo Power when
it launches the modified version there later this month.

FT  07 JUN 94 / Boost seen for main economies: OECD forecasts for growth in
industrialised countries revised upwards to 2.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has revised
upwards its projections of economic growth in the industrialised world this
year to reflect stronger-than-expected US expansion and improved European
exports.
The organisation, which last night released highlights of its latest
forecasts ahead of today's annual meeting of OECD ministers in Paris, now
expects the industrial countries will grow by 2.6 per cent this year. This
is half a percentage point more than in its last forecast in December.
Its projections - which exclude Mexico, which joined the OECD last month -
suggest that the 24 longest-established member states will achieve overall
growth of 2.9 per cent next year, up slightly from 2.7 per cent forecast six
months ago.
Officials said the upward revision reflected strong US growth in the final
quarter of last year, better-than-expected exports from Europe and the
Japanese government's economic stimulation package of February.
The organisation now expects robust 4.4 per cent growth of US domestic
demand in 1994 to lift gross domestic product by 4 per cent this year,
compared with its previous forecast of 3.1 per cent GDP growth.
Although it expects US GDP growth next year will slow to 3 per cent, this
rate of expansion would still be faster than the 2.7 per cent growth
forecast for 1995 in December.
In Germany's case, the organisation now expects GDP growth of 1.8 per cent
this year compared with 0.8 per cent previously. While exports are expected
to be buoyant, Germany's domestic demand will not see a fast growth and is
expected to increase by only 1 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent next
year.
German GDP is now projected to grow 2.6 per cent next year compared with the
2.2 per cent forecast last December.
Germany is the only European country for which detailed forecasts are
included. It is understood, however, that the UK outlook is little changed
from December when growth of 2.9 per cent was projected for this year and
next.
The OECD disclosed slight upwards revisions to its projections for Japanese
growth. It now expects Japan's economy will expand 0.8 per cent this year,
against 0.5 per cent previously, and 2.7 per cent in 1995.
The OECD forecasts a continuing divergence of employment trends between the
US and Europe. It now expects average unemployment in the US to drop below 6
per cent of the labour force next year while in Europe it is expected to
average nearly 12 per cent in 1995.
While inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, is expected to decline in
Europe and be broadly steady in Japan over the next 18 months, it is
forecast to quicken in the US to 3.1 per cent by the end of 1995 from 2.1
per cent in the first half of this year.
The OECD has revised its expectations of short-term interest-rate
developments. It now expects US 3-month rates will rise to 5.6 per cent by
late 1995, about 0.5 points higher than projected in December. German
short-term rates are expected to fall over the next 18 months, but less
sharply than expected. The OECD expects German 3-month rates will be 4.3 per
cent by the end of next year, against its earlier forecast of 3.8 per cent.

FT  07 JUN 94 / UK consumer borrowing slips but trend is firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borrowing by British consumers fell back slightly in April but the figures
were welcomed in the City where it has been feared spending was growing too
quickly.
However, the trend over three months remains strongly upwards suggesting the
UK is on track for a healthy recovery.
Net lending to consumers through finance houses, bank credit cards with the
Visa and Mastercard system and non-mortgage building society loans fell to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 413m in April, down from Pounds 518m the previous
month.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the figures may have been
distorted by the timing of the Easter holiday, which fell in both March and
April, and stressed that three-monthly figures were a better guide to the
trend.
These showed that net lending reached record levels in the three months to
April, running at Pounds 1.282bn. The level of new credit advanced to
consumers in that period was also a record, at Pounds 15.105bn.
The figures were welcomed by the Treasury, which suggested they provided
hints that consumer borrowing had not yet been dented by April's tax rises.
'It is too early to say what the full impact of the tax increases will be.
But clearly it is encouraging that the trend remains upwards - this is
consistent with an upward trend in consumer spending,' a spokesman said.
The figures also received a warm reception among City analysts, who noted
that April's dip followed an exceptionally strong level of consumer credit
in March.
Analysts had predicted April's net lending figure could fall as low as
Pounds 300m, after a survey by the Finance and Leasing Association earlier
this week reported a small drop in consumer credit in April.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist with investment bank SG Warburg, said: 'This
is almost the perfect set of numbers for the government and markets. It
shows that the recovery is continuing but not overheating - it would be
difficult to argue for a base rate rise on these figures.'
But with the economic figures still painting a slightly uneven picture of
consumer behaviour, analysts warned it was too early to predict the full
impact of the April tax rises.
Although recent retail sales and narrow money supply figures have pointed to
strong consumer activity, housing figures have suggested a slowdown in
mortgage lending.
Consumer confidence surveys have also pointed to relatively muted levels of
confidence - a factor that may be feeding through to consumer borrowing
figures.
The main factor in the drop in April's net lending figure was a fall in
borrowing from finance houses, the form of finance normally used to buy cars
and large consumer goods, such as fridges.
Car credit, which represents about half of total finance house lending, fell
to Pounds 871m in April, its lowest level since October. This was partly
offset by other data released yesterday, which showed car sales rebounded
sharply in May, after weakening earlier in the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Alexander &amp; Alexander, the US-based insurance broker, were
suspended from trading in New York yesterday pending what it promised early
in the day would be a 'significant corporate announcement', writes Richard
Waters in New York.
By late afternoon, though, the company's board, which had been convened for
a special meeting, remained locked in debate and had failed to make any
public statement.
The company's recent financial difficulties, and the nature of its
announcement in the morning, prompted widespread speculation that it had
become the subject of a takeover approach. Its shares have slid from Dollars
22 1/4 on February 3, the day before Federal Reserve action to raise US
interest rates hit all financial sector stocks, to Dollars 14 in mid-May,
before recovering slightly to Dollars 16 3/8 by the end of last week.
The world's second largest insurance broker behind Marsh &amp; McLennan,
Alexander &amp; Alexander's earnings have consistently failed to match stock
market expectations in recent periods. The company has also suffered big
losses in liability insurance. In January, the company's board acted to
replace long-time chairman and chief executive Mr Tinsely Irvin.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Direct selling of insurance gets continental break
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich Insurance's plans to launch a telephone-based direct sales subsidiary
at first appear unexceptional. After all, the investment is unlikely to dent
the balance sheet of Switzerland's best capitalised insurance company.
Yet the new business, which Zurich intends to extend rapidly to EU
countries, indicates the arrival of direct selling in conservative
continental markets, where agents - usually selling exclusively for
companies such as Allianz, Union des Assurances de Paris and Generali - hold
sway. 'Direct writing' bypasses middlemen and instead reaches customers
through mass media advertising and telephone sales.
This sales method is firmly established in the UK, where the original
telephone insurer, Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland,
has become the country's largest motor insurance company in less than 10
years.
Deregulation of the European market will give further impetus to the
development of direct writing. Next month EU members must abolish rules
which require minimum prices to be set for some lines of home and motor
insurance, and local regulators to approve policies.
Zurich's Swiss rival Winterthur has been quicker off the mark in direct
writing: its Churchill subsidiary is the second biggest direct writer in the
UK.
Yet Mr Rolf Huppi, Zurich's president and chief executive, is now a fervent
advocate of the technique. Zurich Municipal, a UK subsidiary which
specialises in local authority insurance, has achieved an expense ratio
(expenses as a percentage of premiums) of 12 per cent, way below the
industry average, by selling policies direct rather than through a broker.
Telephone links will allow Zurich greater contact with customers, which Mr
Huppi is prepared to underline brutally. 'Anybody who says that our customer
is the broker gets shot where he stands.' Above all, direct sales methods
reduce costs. 'The new ways of distributing our product are more effective
than traditional ways. The opening up of the market will mean an enormous
pressure on costs,' adds Mr Huppi.
Zurich is signalling its confidence by launching Zuritel in the Swiss
market, which is highly traditional even by the standards of Germany and
Italy - probably the most conservative in the EU. Swiss motor and home
policies are typically five or 10-year contracts. Only seven of the 26
cantons - mainly French-speaking ones - allow private insurers to offer
buildings insurance.
Even so the company believes Zuritel will establish a foothold in
Switzerland and expand rapidly. The key tests will come in Germany, the
continent's most lucrative market, where hitherto direct writers such as
Tellit and Kosmos have made only limited headway; and in France, where a
number of low-cost mutuals control large swathes of the personal lines
market.

The Italian state oil concern is expected on Wednesday to unveil losses for
the second consecutive year. The 1992 losses of L1,108bn (Dollars 700m)
reflected both the poor state of the chemicals sector and write-downs
because of the corruption scandals. The latest accounts will be affected by
restructuring costs and ongoing chemicals losses.

Finland's leading commercial bank is expected to have remained heavily in
the red, when it reports figures for the first four months today. Continuing
high credit losses and the impact of rising long-term interest rates have
led analysts to predict a loss of FM400m-FM500m (Dollars 93m) for the
period, compared with a FM626m deficit a year ago. KOP, which has reported
three consecutive years of losses, has already predicted another deficit for
1994 before an expected return to profit next year.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Colosio theories fail to satisfy Mexican opposition:
Prosecutor's claims that assassin probably acted alone criticised
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's main opposition parties have criticised the special prosecutor's
claim that the assassin of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the slain presidential
candidate of the ruling party, probably acted alone and was not part of a
conspiracy.
Mr Miguel Montes, the government's special prosecutor, last week backed away
from his original contention that several people aided the assassin, saying
there was no new evidence to bolster the conspiracy theory.
Without calling for the release of three men arrested for helping the
gunman, he said: 'The hypothesis is strengthened that the murder was
committed by one man alone: Mario Aburto Martinez'.
Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the presidential candidate of the
centre-right opposition, said: 'They should get to the bottom of this. What
Montes has said so far does not satisfy me or my party.'
The leftist opposition said that there were severe doubts about the
impartiality of the special prosecutor and 'we are now seeing the
consequences of this'.
The three men accused of assisting the assassin had been hired by Mr
Colosio's own party to control crowds at the campaign rally where he was
slain.
Their arrest contributed to political instability and nervousness in
financial markets in the weeks following Mr Colosio's death, with polls
showing that about one-third of respondents believed the ruling party was
behind the killing.
The evidence against the accused appears to have been largely based on
photographs and video footage which, in the prosecutor's original view,
showed them helping Mr Aburto, who has confessed to the assassination.
However, Spanish police called in to help the investigation later concluded
that the photographic evidence was inconclusive.
Earlier last week the five members of the independent commission appointed
by President Carlos Salinas to verify the findings of the special prosecutor
resigned, saying they were not given sufficient legal authority to carry out
their task.
A government official said the widow of Mr Colosio would select a new
commission. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the
left-leaning opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party, has received a death
threat, according to the state newspaper El Nacional yesterday.
The threat came in a letter, which said: 'We are disposed to eradicate
social ulcers. Cuauhtemoc is one of those. Remember what happened to Colosio
and say goodbye to Cuauhtemoc because this week he will die.'

<TEXT>
Germany's Free Democratic party will seek to introduce an immigration law if
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition is returned to power after the
federal election in October. Germany is one of the few countries in the
European Union which has no immigration legislation.
During its three-day congress in the northern city of Rostock which ended
yesterday, the FDP also agreed in principle to reform Germany's outdated
1913 citizenship laws, and give foreigners easier access to voting in local
government elections.
Under current legislation, a child is granted automatic citizenship if one
of its parents is German. This excludes over 6.5m foreigners living in the
country.
The need to reform Germany's outdated laws received a boost after Ms
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, head of the Federal Office for the Problems of
Foreigners, was elected by the congress to the FPD presidium, the top
echelon in the party's organisation.
'It is high time we introduced change,' said Ms Schmalz-Jacobsen, who has
campaigned for a reform of the law and dual citizenship. 'How can we
integrate foreigners if we do not give them rights? Germany, in any case, is
de facto a country of immigration. It is time we faced up to it.' The
Bundestag, or lower house, last month threw out a bill allowing dual
nationality. Mr Kohl's CDU and even some FPD deputies opposed it.
Although the FDP had voted at the weekend to continue to support the CDU-led
coalition, in which it is the junior partner, it agreed to oppose any
attempts by the government to extend security surveillance by bugging
private homes. It also voted to scrap a law requiring registered churchgoers
to pay tax. Church membership has sharply fallen among east Germans since
unification because the tax levy is deemed excessive.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain has finally written off five partly-built nuclear power stations,
whose construction was frozen 10 years ago, at a cost of Pta730bn (Dollars
5.3bn), under a new law aimed at reorganising the domestic electricity
sector.
The legislative initiative, which was approved by the government at the
weekend and will now be debated by parliament, adjusts Spain's electricity
industry to meet Brussels' competitiveness guidelines. In line with similar
norms in other EU states, it breaks up the powerful domestic utilities,
which both generate and market electricity, into separate production and
distribution units.
One of the controversial aspects of the new law concerns the phasing out of
the nuclear power sector, which currently represents some 35 per cent of all
domestically produced energy and which had attracted large investments on
the part of all the main domestic utilities 25 years ago.
The nuclear build-up, modelled on that in France, was stopped in 1984 when
the Socialist government, meeting a groundswell of opposition to such
energy, ordered a moratorium on all new reactors. The shortfall engendered
by the freeze will to a great extent be made up by natural gas and in
particular by a new pipeline linking Spain to the Algerian gas fields via
Morocco, scheduled to be operational in 1996.
The Pta730bn debt bill accumulated by the utilities which own the unfinished
nuclear power stations is to be paid off by a charge that will be
incorporated into the domestic tariff.
The government claimed that the charge, representing 3.54 per cent of the
total electricity charge paid by consumers, would not involve any extra
cost, as it has already been levied over the past 10 years that the
moratorium has been in force.

FT  06 JUN 94 / China plans ways to bridge 57km sea channel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China plans to build what would be the world's longest sea-crossing project
 -a chain of bridges and a tunnel, linking the Shandong and Liandong
peninsulas in the north-east of the country.
Feasibility studies, expected to take several years, have already started on
the Yn60bn (Dollars 6.9bn) project to bridge the 57km Bohai channel, said an
official in the Liaoning government.
Work is unlikely to begin before early in the next century and the project
would take about 10 years. Meanwhile, Liaoning and Shandong are planning a
Yn1.3bn train ferry linking the two provinces. This would run between
Dalian, the main port in Liaoning, and Yantai in Shandong. Both are
important ports and railheads connected with China's interior.
The ferry is expected to be operational by 1998, and would be capable of
handling 10m tonnes of freight a year. Capacity would double by 2005.
The plans to bridge the Bohai channel and improve transport between Liaoning
and Shandong, two of China's most important provinces, reflect a new drive
to boost economic development in the north-east.
The official China Business Weekly reported last month that efforts were
under way to improve the economic integration of the Bohai rim which
encompasses 680,000 sq km and includes the provinces of Shandong, Shanxi,
Hebei and Liaoning, and the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin.
This followed a government decision in 1992 to declare the Bohai rim an
independent economic zone under China's strategic economic development plan.
An important aim is to match explosive economic growth in southern China.
Development in the north-east, home to much of China's heavy industry, has
been lagging behind programmes around the Pearl River and Yangtze River
deltas in the south.
Some of China's largest cities are located around Bohai Bay, including 11
cities with populations of more than 1m.

MONDAY 6
UN considers North Korea
UN Security Council members in New York this week continue consultations on
a response, including possible economic sanctions, to the nuclear dispute
with North Korea. The council may give Pyongyang a deadline to open its
nuclear facilities to full international inspection or face sanctions.
German-Spanish consultations take place in the north German town of
Schwerin. Germany's chancellor Helmut Kohl will no doubt be seeking support
from Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez for the candidacy of Jean Luc
Dehaene as president of the European Commission. The Spanish premier may
urge more caution from Germany on opening the EU to the states of eastern
Europe.
Latvia's foreign minister Mr Georgs Andrejevs is expected to step down after
admitting collaboration with the Soviet KGB before the republic gained
independence. Another four cabinet ministers, plus Latvia's president, have
been accused of such links.
OAU meeting: A ministerial meeting takes place in Tunis this week ahead of a
summit there attended by South Africa's President Nelson Mandela. South
Africa recently became the 53rd member of the organisation.
International bankers gather in London for the three-day International
Monetary Conference. The heads of 103 of the largest banks in the world
today discuss banking in the world economy and the growth of financial
derivatives. Wednesday sees a discussion among senior central bankers
including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
UK accountants: Britain's largest six accountancy firms publish their latest
fee income figures and staff numbers. The information will give an
indication of whether they are recovering after the recession - they
persistently refuse to give details of profits.
D-Day anniversary: Celebrations of the Allied invasion of occupied Europe in
1944 reach their climax with a ceremony on Omaha Beach in Normandy.
Chess: The Intel world championship quarter finals open at New York's Trump
Tower (to June 18). Britain's Nigel Short and Michael Adams are favourites
to defeat Boris Gulko (US) and Sergei Tiviakov (Russia).
FT Survey: Canada.
Holidays: Ireland, New Zealand, Poland, South Korea, Venezuela.
TUESDAY 7
OECD ponders joblessness
The annual ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, the rich countries' club, takes place in Paris today and
tomorrow. With 35m unemployed in the industrial world, jobs will be topping
the agenda.
The OECD secretariat has spent two years producing a study containing 57
detailed recommendations intended to form the basis of tailor-made
programmes for tackling unemployment in the 25 member states.
An American in Paris: US President Bill Clinton, fresh from the D-Day
celebrations, holds talks with French leaders and addresses the French
National Assembly.
German economy: First-quarter figures for gross domestic product should
confirm the gradual revival of the German economy. The markets expect to see
that GDP rose by 0.5 per cent, after falling by 0.7 per cent in the last
quarter of 1993. However, May's unemployment figures, also released today,
are expected to show little drop in unemployment levels, highlighting the
poor economic background for German consumers.
ILO meeting: The International Labour Organisation starts its celebratory
75th annual conference in Geneva. It will debate an agenda drawn up by
Michel Hansenne, its director-general, calling for 'social justice in a
global economy'. The ILO is under pressure to become a more focused and
high-profile body now the Cold War is over and its activities are not
dominated by the US-Soviet struggle.
Lloyd's of London: Derek Walker, leading underwriter for loss-making
syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker group, is scheduled to give
evidence today when proceedings in a case brought by 3,095 Lloyd's Names
resume in the high court.
The Names, individuals whose assets support the insurance market, are
claiming some Pounds 600m in compensation from their agents, alleging
negligence. The losses were incurred between 1987 and 1990 and the case
began in April.
Italian corruption: The former health minister Francesco De Lorenzo, who is
already serving a prison sentence for his part in the country's corruption
scandal, is due to stand trial for alleged corruption in connection with the
building of car parks.
Ferruzzi fire sale: A three-day sale begins at Sotheby's Milan of the
artworks, furniture and objets held in the corporate collection of the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group, Italy's second largest private empire which
collapsed last June. The 650 items are being sold to raise money to pay off
Ferruzzi-Montedison debts.
FT Survey: Danish Food Industry.
Holidays: Malta.
WEDNESDAY 8
Youth celebrates amity
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 64 (top in picture), will welcome France's
President Francois Mitterrand, 77, to Heidelberg for a European youth
festival, intended to counteract any impression of lingering national
antagonism generated by the D-Day celebrations.
The avowed aim is to encourage greater contacts among Europe's youth. There
will be French and German pop music in the open air, and lots of
photo-opportunities for TV cameras.
Russia's government signs a co-operation agreement with the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that should promote
the flow of western economic expertise.
Also parliament is expected to examine the 1994 budget for final approval
after much delay and strident demands from many deputies for big increases
in defence spending.
UK economy: The release of UK industrial production figures today are
expected to show that UK output bounced back in April, after weakening
slightly in March. Analysts predict that output will have risen by 0.5 per
cent in April, month on month. This would tally with other recent business
surveys which have all reported rising business confidence and output.
US President Bill Clinton receives an honorary doctorate of law at Oxford
University.
Euro Disney, operator of the struggling theme park outside Paris, holds an
extraordinary general meeting for shareholders to approve its proposed
FFr13bn (Dollars 2.27bn) rescue package. It will also announce the terms of
a FFr6bn rights issue. There will be good news to discuss following last
week's surprise announcement that a Saudi Arabian prince plans to buy a
stake in the company of up to 24 per cent.
Think-in: Kyoto hosts a two-day International Forum on the Wisdom of
Humanity. It will be addressed by seven wise men including former UK prime
minister Sir Edward Heath.
FT Survey: New Zealand.
THURSDAY 9
European elections begin
Elections to the European parliament in Strasbourg open with voting in
Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and the UK. The results will be declared
from Sunday night, when counting starts after polling closes in the other
eight countries, and will decide the make-up of the 567-seat body that now
plays a significant role in European Union decision-making.
The election will also give important pointers to the outcome of political
leadership contests and forthcoming elections in a number of member states,
led by Germany, UK, France and Spain. Additionally, the score polled by
anti-Maastricht protest parties - particularly in Germany and France - will
be closely watched.
UK by-elections: Five by-elections are timed to coincide with voting for the
European parliament. Four are in safe Labour seats in East London and
Bradford, but the Liberal Democrats are expected to win Eastleigh,
Hampshire, from the Conservative government.
Nato and Russia
Nato foreign ministers begin a two-day meeting in Istanbul to consider
Moscow's request for a formal statement that would acknowledge Russia's
political and military importance. Russia is also asking for a high-level
dialogue with Nato on nuclear and other security issues, prompting fears in
central Europe that Moscow will acquire a virtual veto on alliance policy.
A southern African summit, sponsored by the Geneva-based World Economic
Forum, takes place in Cape Town today and tomorrow. It brings together 280
international businessmen and prominent African and South African leaders to
discuss the future economy of southern Africa after momentous political
change in the largest regional economy, South Africa.
Pakistan budget: Benazir Bhutto's government is due to present the first
budget of the prime minister's second term in office. Interest will focus on
how well the government is controlling spending, given the competing demands
of high military expenditure, debt repayments and measures to improve
education and welfare.
Saleroom: Two 18th century carpets are the highlights of a series of sales
at Christie's in London devoted to French art. One was woven at the Royal
Savonnerie factory and could sell for Pounds 500,000; the other, from
Aubusson, has a Pounds 300,000 forecast. Napoleon's travelling dental set,
in a gilt box, is also on offer at up to Pounds 30,000.
Holidays: Bolivia.
FRIDAY 10
Leader of UK Labour party
Formal nominations open for an election to succeed the late John Smith as
leader of Britain's opposition Labour party.
Tony Blair, 41-year-old leader of the party's social democratic
'modernising' faction, is runaway favourite but may be challenged by John
Prescott, a more traditional socialist, Margaret Beckett, acting leader, or
Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary. The result is due on July
21.
Europe's air traffic control system is to be reviewed at a meeting of
transport ministers of 32 European countries in Copenhagen.
Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko start a two-week visit to the US
at the invitation of President Bill Clinton, the first there by a Japanese
emperor for 19 years.
The Aldeburgh Festival, one of the UK's leading music festivals, begins (to
June 26).
Holidays: Algeria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Portugal, Tunisia,
United Arab Emirates.
WEEKEND 11-12
Polls close in Europe
On Sunday, the eight European Union members who did not vote on Thursday
hold their elections for the European Parliament.
Germany is also holding local elections on Sunday in Baden-Wurttemberg,
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Saxony,
Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia.
Luxembourgers also vote in a general election on Sunday.
Alpine referendums: Austrians vote on European Union membership on Sunday.
Opinion polls indicate a close call.
Swiss voters look set to snub international institutions once again, when a
majority will probably frustrate the government's wish to supply 'blue
helmet' troops for United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Rugby: England play South Africa in the second test in Cape Town on
Saturday.
Motor racing: The Canadian Grand Prix is in Montreal on Sunday.

As OECD ministers gather in Paris for their annual meeting, Japan is set to
be a key market focus, with the Tankan survey due to be released at the end
of the week and the Japanese parliament expected finally to approve the 1994
fiscal budget.
Tuesday: US consumer credit figures should show that US consumer confidence
remains high.
Thursday: The Bundesbank council meets, with the markets pessimistic about
the likelihood of further German rate cuts. Although the gross domestic
product figures, released on Tuesday, are expected to show that the German
recession has bottomed out, this week's retail sales figures may indicate
that the recent pick-up in consumption remains fragile.
Meanwhile, French output figures are expected to show a small rise in
industrial production.
Friday: The Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey will be scrutinised for
signs that the worst of the Japanese recession is over. The previous survey
in February showed low business confidence and tough financial conditions.
This one, however, is expected to be more upbeat.

An exhibition of rarely-seen Van Gogh self-portraits goes on show at
Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum on Friday. The 20 paintings and two drawings all
date from the artist's stay in Paris in 1886-7, when he was confronted for
the first time with the range of colours used by the Impressionists. Five of
the paintings have never been seen in public before. They were painted on
the backs of earlier works, and have been reframed so that both sides can be
viewed.

The spirit of Benjamin Britten remains the presiding genius at the Aldeburgh
Festival, which begins on Friday, This year's programme pairs Britten with
Stravinsky, contemporaries and complimentary composers who shared some
musical interests, but set out to explore very different personal issues.
Both wrote fine medium-scale works for which the intimate atmosphere of the
Maltings at Snape is best suited.  A handful of premieres and some
interesteing recitals are other highlights of the festival, which runs until
June 26.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: A whiff of short-term optimism - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About the only people smiling in the London stock market last week were the
equity chartists who looked with quiet satisfaction as share prices
collapsed and then with bored disdain when they rallied. But the chartists
are not the only players in the market. There are now clear signs that some
equity market participants are at least willing to take a more optimistic
view on the prospects for a market recovery, albeit for the short term.
The optimists may need to rein in their confidence a little. There cannot be
too much reason for celebration while the June future contract on the
Footsie, which did so much to drive the stock market ahead in its glory
days, prefers to remain at a discount to the underlying equities. And it was
the futures market that saw the business when the market rallied; trading
volume in equities proper remained as unimpressive on the uptick as it had
been on the way down. Any upset in Frankfurt or New York bond markets found
a swift reaction in UK stock futures and then in share prices.
It has become clear that the hike in key interest rates by the Federal
Reserve has not resulted in the calmer global bond markets regarded as the
platform for a genuine recovery in UK equities. Both S. G. Warburg and
Strauss Turnbull draw attention to the impact on valuations of the equities
in the wake of the latest sell-off, Warburg commenting that the failure of
equities to yield any premium over index-linked gilts 'must be the cause of
some concern'. The yield relative on conventional gilts has risen to 2.28,
around the highest level since 1992.
Until gilts settle down - and that requires similar moves in German and US
bonds - UK equities must remain highly volatile and chances of a genuine
recovery in jeopardy.
Last week's bounce has sent investors searching for stocks likely to
outperform in any recovery. The leisure sector in general has underperformed
but traditionally responds to earnings momentum. Smith New Court, using a
technique of seeking out shares on which market expectations and analysts'
views are changing, has put the tape over leisure and hotel shares.
Smith has rated the FT-SE 100 stocks from 1 to 100 in terms of changes in
market share earnings estimates over the past three months - 100 being top
of the list. Rank Organisation rates well at No 79 and Smith strengthens the
case by predicting that there are further earnings upgrades ahead. Smith is
prepared to overlook the recently strong outperformance in the stock.
When the same technique is applied, shares in Forte come off less favourably
with a rating of 50, although Smith says that analysts' share earnings
estimates are trending slightly upwards. The shares have mildly (3 per cent)
underperformed over three months so there is room for conjecture as to
whether the estimates rating justifies the present share price or indicates
that some recovery is due. Smith takes the more positive line.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Money managers see new asset class in raw
materials - Risk and Reward

Any way you look at it, commodities are hot. Key indices of commodity prices
have risen 3 per cent to 13 per cent this year, and price appreciation in
some markets, such as coffee, cotton or copper, has outstripped lagging
valuations in most government bond markets and many stock markets.
Although commodities are far less important to the economy than they used to
be, they are suddenly the focus of world financial markets. They are
important as raw materials, the stuff that economic expansions are built
upon.
Since many commodities are traded in public futures markets, price increases
show up more quickly, and more dramatically, than in other economic sectors.
Statistics on employment gains or manufacturing orders tend to be reported
with a lag, and are slow to exhibit convincing trends.
The US Federal Reserve was clearly watching commodity prices as it lifted
interest rates this spring, seeking price stability in its efforts to head
off inflation. However, commodities, economists say, are not reliable
barometers of the magnitude of an inflationary cycle, and historically have
been only a semi-reliable indicator of inflation's direction.
In the first quarters of 1992 and of 1993, for example, prices of some
physical commodities rose, but levelled a quarter later, and the US economy
did not overheat, as some observers had feared. However, with prices for
soft commodities and grains near benchmark highs and base metals turning
higher after bumping along in a decade-long, supply-burdened trough, the
signals are much stronger.
Several important inflation indices have begun a rare convergence. The
Knight-Ridder Commodity Research Bureau Index of 21 commodities, which tends
to reflect its heavy weighting of grain and soyabean prices, has begun to
track the Journal of Commerce index of industrial commodities, a basket of
raw materials that includes hemp, cardboard cartons, and plywood.
The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which has a bias toward oil and other
energy products, has been trending higher.
Whether rising commodity prices translate into inflation is another matter,
says Mr. Samuel Kahan, chief economist for Fuji Securities. He argues that
global competition could act to keep inflation in check.
Because commodities prices have been moving conversely to bonds, money
managers have begun to view the whole sector as an attractive new asset
class that offers an inflation hedge and portfolio diversification.
These money managers comprise a new class of deep-pocketed speculators in
what have historically been relatively small and tightly held markets.
Bankers and derivatives brokers are generating a plethora of new
commodity-linked products, and exchange-traded commodity markets are
experiencing unprecedented volume rises.
The new commodity speculators tend not have or need a deep understanding of
the fundamental supply and demand features of the commodity, and their bent
toward technical trading is changing the rules for traditional traders.
'What we are seeing are large and unusually active speculators,' says Mr
Donald Mitchell, a senior economist in the International Trade division of
the World Bank and a commodities specialist.
'This is a new demand class for futures, a group of people who have no use
for the commodity. It could increase the prices of commodities over time,
but it does not mean there will be a corresponding increase in final demand.
What it does add is price volatility,' Mr Mitchell says.

FRANKFURT
Results are due from two defensive stocks, Henkel in household goods on
Monday and Gehe in pharmaceuticals on Wednesday. The Estimate Directory
registers consensus forecasts of a fall of 3 per cent each in
earnings per share for 1993 but looks for much bigger things from the
building and construction group, Bilfinger &amp; Berger, from which an earnings
lift of 66 per cent is expected - although analysts are more circumspect
about 1994. The average prediction is an earnings rise of only 2 per cent
AMSTERDAM
First-quarter figures come from Amev, the insurance company, and Fortis, the
financial services group, on Thursday. Hoare Govett estimates Amev's net
income will rise 9 per cent to Fl 118m, and earnings per share 8 per cent to
Fl 1.66. The brokers say the consolidation of the Belgian banking and
insurance group, ASLK, for the first time will have a large impact on
Fortis's net income.
MILAN
Today begins the last full week of the June account and investors will
probably be holding back liquidity for the cash calls over the July and
August accounts from Mediobanca and Ifil, and the privatisation of INA.
Brokers expect volume to remain low and the Comit index to trade between 700
and 750 over the summer.
HELSINKI
Finnish equities were lifted last week by a 136 per cent jump in operating
profits at Nokia, the electronics and industrial conglomerate. Traders are
hoping that progress reports this week will extend the process: on Monday,
from KOP, Finland's leading commercial bank; on Tuesday from Huhtamaki, the
consumer products combine; and on Friday from Instrumentarium, which divides
into health care, optical retailing, catering equipment and electronics
distribution.
TOKYO
Enthusiasm for last week's breakthrough, with the Nikkei 225 index clearing
the 21,000 mark in high volume, receded slightly on Thursday and Friday and
left sentiment nicely balanced. Most traders were optimistic by the weekend,
but there was general agreement that domestic institutions and individual
investors were far from ready to return to the market as net buyers.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Focus likely to remain on commodities - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Friday's employment report, the most closely scrutinised economic data
of the month, was supposed to clear the air and establish a fresh direction
for equities. In the event, the numbers had the opposite effect,
exacerbating the sense of confusion on Wall Street about the economy's
strength and the implications for interest rates and corporate profits.
If uncertainty was a force driving down share prices for most of the spring,
it has held stocks in a state of near-paralysis more recently. Last week,
the bellwether Dow Jones Industrial average opened at 3,758.37 and closed at
3,772.22, for a net gain of only 14 points.
No sharp movements are expected this week, though a negative bias is likely
to settle over stocks until the next important economic data - industrial
production and capacity utilisation figures - are released in a fortnight.
Friday was a topsy-turvy day on Wall Street. Initially, the May jobs report
appeared to be highly favourable for stocks. The headline figure  - an
increase in non-farm payrolls of 191,000 - was much weaker than analysts had
thought. Bond prices jumped and share prices seemed sure to follow when
trading began, because the weak number could delay for months the next move
by the Federal Reserve to tighter money.
However, investors gulped when they read past the first line. The Labor
Department had made a big upward revision in its initial estimates of April
and March payrolls. 'If anything, when you include the revisions, job
creation was somewhat stronger than we had thought,' says Mr Hugh Johnson,
chief investment officer at First Albany in New York.
A surprising drop in the monthly unemployment rate, from 6.4 to 6.0 per
cent, was even more disturbing; 6.0 per cent is considered by many
economists to be in effect 'full employment', at which point upward pressure
on wages would intensify. Indeed, the May report showed a slight gain in
hourly earnings, which suggested wage inflation had started last month.
'To put it into simple terms, it looks as if conditions in the labour
markets are starting to tighten up,' says Mr Johnson. 'That means the Fed
may need to raise rates again to cool the economy.'
What, then, is the explanation for the mood swing that swept the markets as
Friday's session progressed, lifting share prices amid a bond rally?
Commodity prices, to cite one of several unconvincing explanations, showed
further declines, in keeping with a pattern that helped support share prices
last week.
Wall Street will continue to focus on commodities this week, but their
recent volatility leaves in doubt the likely impact on stocks.
Meanwhile, investors are looking ahead to this Friday's producer price data
and the consumer numbers, due next Monday. The data are expected to reveal
that inflation remains subdued, but such confirmation is unlikely to impress
investors.

FT  06 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Canada suffers in spite of itself -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in a country with almost no inflation, a healthy trade surplus and
one of the highest returns in the world should be a one-way bet. But if the
country is Canada, you bail out as fast as you can.
Canada has suffered in spite of itself - to the dismay of Treasury managers
in the Canadian provinces, which are among the biggest borrowers in the
Eurobond market, and to the bemusement of City economists. As one investment
banker puts it: 'Investors in the Canadian market have lost on the currency,
lost on the spread and been killed in the bond market.'
At end-1991, the Canadian dollar was CDollars 1.12 against the US currency.
By last January it had fallen to CDollars 1.31 and late last week was
Dollars 1.3850, a near eight-year low.
At the long end of the Canadian government bond yield curve, spreads against
US Treasury bonds have widened dramatically in recent months. Wild
volatility in the markets has pushed the yield on Canadian 10-year
government bonds as far as 168 basis points above Treasuries compared to a
low of 63 basis points in February. Spreads on debt issued by the provinces
are even wider.
Also, the yield on the Canadian benchmark government bond maturing in 2004
has risen by 166 basis points to 8.8 per cent compared to a rise of 140
basis points for the equivalent UK government bond yield over the same
period.
All this turmoil comes at a time when, in some respects, Canada has never
had it so good. According to Mr Randall Powley, senior economist at
ScotiaMcLeod, brokers, the purchasing power parity of the Canadian dollar is
13 per cent better than the current exchange rate would suggest. Headline
inflation was 0.2 per cent in April, and real rates of investment return are
the highest in the Group of Seven industrialised countries. He cites 8 per
cent bonds maturing in 2023 as offering a real return of 8.79 per cent.
'Clearly the spreads have widened but it has nothing to do with
fundamentals,' he says.
The Canadian government is sufficiently concerned by the negative attitude
towards the currency that on Friday it is expected to publish its own
estimate of the Canadian dollar's purchasing power parity for the first
time.
To understand the market's worries, one has to go back to the national
budget in February. The newly-elected Liberal party upset international
investors by estimating the deficit for fiscal 1993 at CDollars 45.7bn
against the previous government's forecast of a CDollars 32.6bn deficit.
Disappointment turned to concern as the drive for separatism in Quebec
snowballed. A recent visit to France by Lucien Bouchard, the leader of the
federal Bloc Quebecois, focused the attention of European investors on the
possibility of a split. Opinion polls show the regional Parti Quebecois (PQ)
as most likely to win the provincial elections later this year and then call
a referendum on secession in May next year.
Many international economists believe a win for the PQ will be merely a
reaction against the governing Liberals and that secession is improbable.
But the uncertainty has caused the spread on Quebec's bonds to widen
recently.
'If Quebec has to borrow in the markets it will cost a lot more money,' says
one syndicate manager. 'Spreads have widened by 10 to 15 basis points in the
past week. When you translate that into dollars and cents, for an extra 10
basis points each Dollars 100m borrowed costs Dollars 100,000. The
additional annual interest payment on Dollars 500m is between Dollars
500,000 and Dollars 750,000.'
The fact that 40 per cent of Canada's debt is held by foreign investors has
exposed it to sudden changes in investment strategies. Late last year,
international investors had bought Canadian bonds in the hope that the yield
spread with US Treasuries would narrow. 'However, in bear markets, credit
spreads always widen out,' says Mr Powley.
In spite of the assault on their bonds, the provinces' Treasury managers are
keeping their cool. Mr John Madden, deputy finance minister for Canada's
biggest province, Ontario, says he has no funding worries. 'It has been a
volatile market but we issue in various markets around the world,' he says,
noting that the yen market has been the most attractive lately. 'We have a
borrowing requirement of CDollars 7.7bn and expect to pre-borrow a further
CDollars 2bn to CDollars 3bn for next year.'
The Quebec Treasury is confident. It has raised CDollars 1.5bn of its
CDollars 4.2bn programme for the year and says a further CDollars 2.7bn will
come from sources other than public bond issues. 'Of course funding is more
expensive than three months ago but we are not concerned,' says a senior
Treasury official.
Many economists argue that Canada has been treated too harshly by the
markets and by the credit rating agencies which have downgraded the
foreign-currency ratings of the sovereign and some of the provinces. Recent
research on the Canadian provinces by Salomon Brothers says: 'Provincial
credit is stabilising: in some cases it is improving from the fiscal
deterioration of the past three years.'

US bond prices proved more resilient than the European capital markets which
were battered by fears of rising inflation last week. The Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond ended the week a point higher than it began it after
the market took an optimistic view of mixed signals from Friday's employment
data.
If US bond prices are more stable than European ones, it is because they
have suffered months of downward pressure. This was caused by fears that the
US economy was growing too quickly, culminating in last month's half-point
increase in interest rates. Now, they are looking for a fresh direction.
This may not be the week in which they get it. Although data for instalment
credit and capital spending are due out tomorrow and Thursday respectively,
the figures that will be most closely watched are those for the May producer
price index, due out on Friday. But economists predict that, after the 0.1
per cent decline in April, the index will be barely changed.
If so, that would be taken as a sign that inflationary pressures further
back in the supply chain remain absent. Even so, stripping out the more
volatile prices of food and energy, the index for finished goods may have
risen by 0.3 per cent.
If the figure is higher than that, it could be a cause for alarm.

Gross domestic product figures for western Germany (due tomorrow) are
unlikely to cheer the bund market. The consensus is that GDP will grow by
0.5 per cent on the fourth quarter of last year, suggesting the economy is
well and truly on the recovery track. The year-on-year growth would be 1.5
per cent.
The stronger the economy, the greater the fear that the Bundesbank will
respond to the inflationary threat with a tightening of monetary policy.
This scenario may seem unlikely to domestic observers who believe short-term
interest rates will fall further. But foreign investors, who have been
disconcerted by Germany's ballooning money supply and whose selling has
inspired the sharp rise in bund yields in recent months, may seize upon the
GDP figures as another excuse for selling.
April's retail figures, on the other hand, may encourage the market: they
are expected to be sharply down from March. This may be due to seasonal
factors but will underscore that the German recovery is export-led and not
driven by domestic growth.
The Bundesbank policy-making council meets on Thursday. No rate cut is
expected but the market will study statements by council members before or
after the meeting for evidence of disagreements on how to deal with money
supply growth.

A strong stock market performance and better-than-expected economic data has
drawn some investors from bonds and caused a sell-off. Late Friday sales
dragged government bond futures down for the sixth day in a row and cash
government bonds also remained under pressure.
There is some indication the Japanese economy is on the mend, but bond
market sentiment remains bearish. Traders and analysts are looking for
direction from the Bank of Japan's June 10 announcement of the Tankan index
of business sentiment, a quarterly survey of 7,400 companies.
The biggest news last week was Mitsubishi Corporation's blow-out sale of
Y200bn in 5-year maturity AA-rated bonds in less than two hours. According
to a spokesman at Morgan Stanley, one of 16 dealers that handled the
offering, the Mitsubishi offering was more than just a big bond sale.
Mitsubishi's plan was to create a secondary market for the bonds issued. In
the past, the 5-year market was the exclusive domain of long-term credit
banks. So well established was the market that the long-term prime rate was
set simply by adding 90 basis points to bank debenture coupons.
Mitsubishi hopes it has created an equally liquid vehicle to meet its own
future financing needs.

FT  06 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: ISMA conference settles on three days -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the mood at last week's annual meeting in New Orleans of the
International Securities Market Association (ISMA) was slightly dampened by
the continued turmoil in the world's bond markets, this year's difficult
conditions had little impact on the turnout for the conference. Delegates
numbered about 950, down from just over 1,000 at last year's gathering in
Copenhagen.
More cynical Eurobond traders commented that they had not felt it necessary
to stay at their desks and nurse their books because dealing in the Eurobond
market had dried up as a result of the extreme volatility in the government
bond market.
A new rule that delegates who fail to turn up to vote at the conference of
international bond market participants will be reported to their firms also
appeared to have a salutary effect on attendance in the conference hall.
The conference centred around the ISMA board's decision to change from the
current standard of seven-day settlement to three-day settlement for
international bonds, in spite of concerns voiced by representatives from the
Belgian region about the impact of this change on retail investors.
Belgian retail investors have a strong preference for physical delivery of
Eurobonds, largely for tax reasons. However, under the new standard, which
will come into force in June 1995, a longer settlement period can still be
agreed between counter-parties.
Although estimates about the size of the retail market are approximate, it
is believed that as much as 10 per cent to 15 per cent of primary offerings
may be placed with retail investors. However, the retail component of
secondary market turnover is much lower - certainly less than 1 per cent,
according to Cedel, the European clearing house which clears the bulk of
retail trading business.
The debate raised an important disclosure issue.
Mr Alain Servais, of Belgian broking firm Dewaay, Servais &amp; Cie complained
that the documentation of some new issues did not clearly state that bonds
would not be available in physical form, and suggested that ISMA should
publicise problems with individual issues.
Mr John Langton, ISMA's chief executive, said the association was looking at
the legal implications of such a step. Guidance from the International
Primary Market Association (IPMA) - which sets out rules for new issues, but
has no regulatory authority - is expected in the next few weeks, it said.
ISMA continues to monitor the dispute over whether holders of a News Corp
subsidiary's issue of preference shares, convertible into Pearson shares,
would also receive Royal Doulton shares, according to Mr Willy Watt, who
heads ISMA's market practices committee.
The conference was also enlivened by a strong panel of speakers, including
veteran Wall Street trader Mr Alan 'Ace' Greenberg, president of Bear
Stearns, the Wall Street securities firm.
According to Mr Greenberg, the firm has found a novel way of tackling the
problem of losses on derivatives as a result of traders failing to report
positions accurately: rewarding staff for shopping their colleagues.
Mr Greenberg dispatched one of his famous memos last September. 'Investment
banking firms have been plagued over the years by traders mis-marking
positions and we have not been spared.'
The memo set out a new policy for dealing with the problem: 'We will give 5
per cent (of its value) to anyone alerting us to a mis-mark. All suspicions
will be treated confidentially.'
The memo added: 'We would frown upon the tatler sharing the reward with the
mis-marker.'
In April, a second memo, further refining the process, appeared. It
specified that 'in no case will the reward exceed Dollars 1m'. The limit is
designed, according to Mr Greenberg, to discourage any delay in reporting by
a trader hoping that the size of the mis-mark - and thus of the reward -
will increase further.
According to Mr Greenberg, in the last two months, Bear Stearns has paid two
cheques to traders who reported lapses, the largest for Dollars 65,000.
In both cases, traders shopped their bosses, whose jobs they have since been
appointed to. Mr Greenberg described such promotions as an 'added incentive.
This may seem brutal (but) we are engaged in a war'.
Mr Greenberg told the conference that the new system was working, and
recommended its introduction at other firms.
He suggested that existing difficulties in ensuring that traders report
losses have been exacerbated by the growth of the derivatives market, where
the value of positions is much more difficult to calculate. Bear Stearns is
well known for its aggressive stance on this issue: it has spies on every
trading floor.
Mr Jose Angel Gurria, head of international affairs for Mexico's Partido
Revolucionario Instituciona (PRI) and well known to international bankers
for leading Mexico's successful foreign debt restructuring, sought to
reassure traders that, in spite of the turmoil earlier this year, Mexico is
still an attractive investment.
He expressed confidence that a 'squeaky clean and transparent' election was
the only remaining barrier to an upgrade for Mexico's debt to investment
grade. 'The fundamentals for an investment grade rating are there. Our
fixed-rate bond issues now reflect interest rates lower than for a
non-investment grade country - but higher than if we already had the
investment grade rating,' he said.
However, he added that the main incentive for gaining an investment grade
rating was access to a broader investment base, including fund managers who
are not allowed to buy sub-investment grade debt. 'Access is the prime
consideration, not cost, although access will be translated into cost
savings,' said Mr Gurria.
Finally, former US president George Bush met an enthusiastic reception from
an audience only slightly less welcoming than for former UK prime minister
Margaret Thatcher, who spoke at ISMA's Munich conference two years ago.

The gilt market remains nervous and volatile and there is little in the
economic diary this week to suggest scope for a sudden rally.
Inflation fears were not helped by last week's M0 numbers, although the
market bounced back on Thursday and Friday, indicating that there are bond
buyers when long yields start approaching 9 per cent. According to Mr Peter
Fellner, gilt strategist at NatWest Markets, 'the markets need a period of
relative calm and stability so people can regain their composure'.
Wednesday's meeting of the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Kenneth Clarke
and the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, is not expected to
result in any immediate change in the level of interest rates. However, Mr
David Walton, UK economist at Goldman Sachs, thinks that the governor may
use the meeting to try to steer the chancellor away from the previous 'bias
towards easing' and towards a more neutral stance.
With only industrial production and consumer credit figures out this week,
politics may be a key factor. Results of the European elections will not be
revealed until Sunday, but exit polls should be available.
'If the political news is bad for the Conservatives, that might be an excuse
for a sell off,' said Mr Fellner.

   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peru's first ever over-the-counter primary offering is scheduled for June
15, when the state's 39 per cent stake in Cementos Lima, the cement
producer, will be offered simultaneously in New York and Lima, writes Sally
Bowen in Lima.
The allocation will be by Dutch auction and the reference price is expected
to be about Dollars 200 for each of the 308,843 voting shares on offer. Lead
managing the issue is Bankers Trust/Peruval, with Bankers, Baring, Bear
Stearns and JP Morgan Securities handling the New York end, where the offer
will be restricted to qualified institutional buyers. Lima brokers may
register to participate on auction day, but will be required to deposit
letters of guarantee for 97 per cent of their bid. Amounts are likely to be
much higher than they usually handle.
Cementos Lima is Peru's leading cement producer with more than 40 per cent
of the domestic market.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Privatisation is a big issue for Colombia
 -The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the active investors in Colombia's stock market had their way, Mr Andres
Pastrana would probably be the country's next president.
Mr Pastrana, the Conservative candidate, polled about 20,000 votes less than
his rival from the governing Liberal Party, Mr Ernesto Samper, in the first
round of the presidential election on May 29.
Because neither managed to garner more than half the vote, the two face a
run-off on June 19.
Although President Cesar Gaviria is a Liberal and his government was
responsible for the economic modernisation programme which has opened the
country to foreign trade and investment, many investors suspect Mr Samper
would backtrack on some of Mr Gaviria's policies, or at least not push ahead
with them.
'Basically, the market thinks that Samper would stop privatisation and
Pastrana would go ahead with it,' said one financier in Bogota.
His pledges to raise the minimum wage and to try to ensure that benefits
spread to the poor 'may be commendable but may not send the right signals to
foreign investors,' said Mr Geoffrey Dennis, chief emerging market economist
at Bear Stearns in New York.
'My guess is that the market would probably prefer Pastrana to win, but
we're really talking about shades of grey here, not black and white.'
From the stock market perspective, privatisation is important, although the
Colombian government was never as big a stakeholder in industry as other
Latin American governments.
There is a large unfulfilled potential demand among international investors
for Colombian shares, and privatisation offers the possibility of expanding
the traded float.
A majority of the Dollars 18bn market capitalisation never trades, because
the families and other groups which run the companies keep a tight grip on
their shares so as not to lose control of their companies. Of the 176
companies listed on the exchanges of Bogota, Cali and Medellin, only about
20 trade in any volume.
The unwillingness by family groups to cede control is a phenomenon impeding
stock market development in many Latin American economies. But it is
especially important in Colombia because of a rule that gives holders of 30
per cent of a company veto power over decisions.
These groups are, if anything, attempting to tighten their control on their
companies, said Mr Mauricio Botero, a partner in Corredores Asociados, the
biggest stock broker in Colombia.
The overhang in demand may, however, help to explain the relatively modest
declines of the Colombian market compared to the rout in emerging markets
earlier this year. Last week the market was only about 4 per cent off its
March all-time high.
As a further indication of the demand, 'out of the Dollars 2.3bn of approved
foreign investment in shares, only about Dollars 350m has been invested,'
said Mr Roberto Santa Maria of the Bogota Stock Exchange, which claims about
half of the country's equity trading.
Foreign investors must register with the government, a measure intended to
prevent drugs traffickers using front companies to bring back money into the
country's stock market.
When Cementos Diamante decided to take advantage of this foreign demand a
few weeks ago, it issued not common stock but the presumably less attractive
non-voting preferred stock in the form of American Depositary Receipts.
Even so, such is the rarity of Colombian paper - it was only the third ADR
issue by a Colombian company and the first from a non-financial enterprise -
it was still heavily oversubscribed.
More ADR issues are likely. Carulla, the supermarket group, is could make an
issue of perhaps Dollars 30m. Banco de Colombia and Banco Ganadero are
expected to launch issues and the latter may be the first Colombian company
listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Banco de Bogota is also said to be
considering an ADR offering.
Privatisation could further add to the float. With its popularity high, the
government is no lame duck and it is widely expected to move ahead on some
privatisations. These could include Banco Popular and other government
shareholdings such as Promigas, the gas transportation company, now part of
the Ecopetrol state energy company.
Mr Paul Weiss of Corredores said that all should be privatised through the
stock exchange and listed, and 'should make a sizeable difference to the
market'. Yet even these may be taken over by big private groups.
Stockbrokers would like the government to force companies to consolidate
their balance sheets, although some companies, such as Cementos Diamante,
already do.
To the chagrin of international investors, this is not done at the moment
resulting in higher p/e ratios than would otherwise be the case. The market
is about 24 compared to an estimated 16 if accounts were consolidated.
Foreign investors have been allowed into the market since late 1991, but
they are not the only new force. There is substantial competition among the
managers of the newly-allowed private pension funds.
The system is voluntary but in two months, 160,000 people have signed up, an
estimated 5 per cent of the market dominated by the state-run Institute of
Social Security. 'In the long-term the pension funds are going to be very
important institutions in this market,' said Mr Weiss.
Nonetheless, this will merely accentuate the lack of a large float of
Colombian equities which can be traded. Mr Santa Maria believes that over
time Colombian companies will begin to see advantages in 'sharing some of
the risks of ownership with others'.
In the mean time, he is clearly frustrated that when companies do raise new
equity, many of them prefer to do it in the US or international markets.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA
South Africa is to be included in the IFC's global index of emerging markets
in the next few months, with a weighting of 13 per cent.
Justine Roberts of SG Warburg said that a 13 per cent weighting implied
considerable inflows of foreign money. With estimates of holdings by foreign
investors in emerging markets globally put between Dollars 50bn to Dollars
160bn, the potential inflows to South Africa could be anything from Dollars
6.5bn to Dollars 21bn, he added.
Even including last year's Dollars 650m of purchases, the implication is
that most emerging markets funds are seriously underweight (in South Africa)
and many have no exposure at all'.
The IFC said that the Czech Republic will be added to the list by the end of
the year.
FUND LAUNCH
A new open-ended fund for investment in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri
Lanka is being launched by Regent Pacific, the Hong Kong-based financial
services group. One of the features of the fund, said Mr Charles Lunsford,
will be the ability to switch assets quickly from country to country. The
initial launch values the fund at some Dollars 30m.
Mr Lunsford, in London last week, said that the countries included all had
increasing political stability, had begun to make the shift from state to
private enterprise and companies there had some of the cheapest p/e's with
the Asian region, together with forecasts of good earnings growth.
SEOUL
Foreign investment in South Korea during the first five months of the year
rose by 60 per cent to Dollars 648m, the country's finance ministry said.
New foreign investment amounted to Dollars 436m, up from Dollars 125m, while
fresh injection of investment into existing projects was Dollars 212m, down
from Dollars 282m.
A ministry official said relaxing investment restrictions and a recovering
economy were big reasons for the increase.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The initial concern for foreign exchanges this week will be whether the
dollar can continue the rally prompted last Friday by the release of the May
US labour market report.
The inflationary implications of falling unemployment and rising average
hourly earnings, assisted by comments from senior US officials suggesting
the dollar might be undervalued, helped the US currency to its highest level
for a number of weeks. It closed in London at DM1.6665 and Y105.245.
Confusing the picture, however, was a fall in manufacturing jobs and hours
worked which led some analysts to conclude that the report showed a
moderation in the rate of US economic growth.
Much will depend on the performance of US bonds. A continued rally would be
helpful but a slide in prices would weaken the currency. The April consumer
credit numbers, to be released tomorrow, and the May producer price
inflation figure, which emerges on Friday, will help the market make up its
mind.
Also coming out on that day is the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey.
Confirmation of continued economic weakness could presage a lowering of
interest rates, which would help the dollar. But some observers think the
survey will show that the economy is past the worst.
Trade framework talks between the US and Japan will continue this week. The
focus will be the telecommunications and medical equipment sectors. Progress
in these talks would support the dollar.
In Europe, meanwhile, markets will be keeping a watchful eye on the outcome
of the European elections, with countries voting on Thursday and Sunday. In
Germany, Chancellor Kohl also faces municipal elections in seven states. A
severe rebuff would probably weaken the D-Mark, but recent polls show his
support rising so markets will be less concerned about the prospect of a
change in government.
Another politician anxiously facing the electorate is Mr John Major, the
British prime minister. A very poor result for the ruling Tory party is
widely discounted, but a third place finish would certainly reignite
discussion of a leadership challenge in the spring.
The political uncertainty this would provoke needs to be set against the
view that any change in premier would be market positive. Results will only
emerge on Sunday and Monday, but markets will doubtless have earlier exit
poll information to chew on.
The market is expecting poor March trade figures when they are released on
Friday, and this will undermine sterling. UK output data, however, should
confirm that another fall in interest rates is unlikely.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Markets: Chaos in economics - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
"It will rain on Southwark Bridge at 11.05am on July 13 1995, for precisely
9 minutes and 5 seconds'. Imagine that perfectly accurate forecasts of this
kind could be provided for any place and time. Living would become
unbearable. Fortunately, it is not merely difficult to achieve such
accuracy, it is inconceivable.
As David Parker and Ralph Stacey note in their brave attempt to explain the
implications of chaos theory to the mathematically illiterate: 'Non-linear
feedback systems are highly sensitive to initial conditions, which means
that some imperceptible noise in the system can escalate into major
qualitative changes in the behaviour of that system. In such systems we
cannot safely assume that small errors are unimportant . . . In fact, the
links between cause and effect disappear in the complexity of interactions.
In consequence, the long-term future of the system is inherently
unpredictable'.*
Even though weather is chaotic, it is not random. We will never know when
precisely it will rain (until it has happened), but we do know that London's
temperature in July will be neither minus 20 degrees centigrade, nor plus
50. 'Non-linear systems generate forms of behaviour that are neither stable
nor unstable. They are continuously new and creative.' They operate in a
state of 'bounded instability', which is qualitatively different from either
stability or instability.
The chart, which comes from a book by the mathematical physicist, Professor
Roger Penrose, illustrates what this means for a simple, non-linear
mathematical relationship. The patterns are recognisable, but irregular.
Tiny differences in initial sets of numbers lead to different, 'yet
recognisably similar patterns to the original shape'. Such patterns are no
mere mathematical curiosity. They can be seen in many natural systems: not
just in the weather, but also in turbulent liquids and gases.
What does this mean for human affairs, particularly for economics? A great
deal, argue the authors, who note that 'all human systems are feedback
systems. Furthermore, these systems always involve non-linear
relationships'. Consider the way proud businesses like IBM and General
Motors seem suddenly unable to control their fate. Consider the apparent
failures of Keynesian demand management in the 1970s and technical
monetarism in the 1980s. Consider, more astoundingly, the collapse of Soviet
Communism after seven decades of expansion.
These all seem excellent examples of what chaos theorists call a 'phase
transition' - a sudden qualitative change in a system's behaviour. But the
last is the most symbolic. This is not just because this empire collapsed,
but also because of what it stood for. It was grounded on the conviction
that societies could be planned. The goal was a rich society in which happy
comrades would lose their capacity for self-interested behaviour. The
result, millions of corpses later, is impoverished countries in which
dispirited people act quite as selfishly as anywhere else. So much for the
construction of socialism, ignis fatuus of our century.
The failure of socialist planning was most clearly foretold, in the 1920s
and 1930s, by economists of the Austrian school, notably Ludwig von Mises
and Friedrich von Hayek. This is not an accident. For the authors of the IEA
pamphlet suggest that the Austrian vision of the economic process is both
more in accord with reality and more justifiably critical of planning than
standard neoclassical orthodoxy.
Both schools agree on the value of markets. But neoclassical theorists tend
to see a market economy as a sort of giant calculator, with equilibrium
outcomes pre-determined by maximising behaviour, subject to given resources,
knowledge and tastes. Economics, for them, is just the logic of choice.
Austrians, by contrast, see the economy as an evolutionary system, propelled
onwards by creative entrepreneurship. To work, such an economy must be based
on private property, they would argue. Moreover, it cannot be planned, even
in principle.
The difference between these visions is profound. Neo-classical general
equilibrium theorists argue that the market outcome is optimal only if all
spot and future markets clear simultaneously. But the vast majority of such
markets do not even exist, an 'imperfection' used to justify government
interventions.
To Austrians, this so-called imperfection is not merely unavoidable, but
precisely what justifies reliance on the market. For them, markets are the
only way to secure adaptation to the inherently unforeseeable future.
Fortunately, orthodox economics does not need to be thrown overboard, argue
Mr Parker and Mr Stacey. It remains invaluable in thinking about the effects
of particular economic processes, such as exchange rate over-valuation or
monetisation of budget deficits. But in a chaotic system, accurate
quantitative prediction is impossible.
If chaos theory does provide a mathematically sophisticated justification
for the Austrian vision, that is good news, largely because professional
economists can be persuaded only by arguments of that kind. But that vision
has long seemed compelling. As with the rain, we will never know precisely
what the economy will look like 10 years hence. But we do know what kind of
economic system will adapt best to the changes we cannot predict.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Markets: Little pressure to trim cocoa output -
Commodity Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the world's cocoa producers meeting in London this week will throw
the focus on a market which has been overshadowed this year by the dramatic
increase in coffee prices.
Producing countries will be discussing their efforts to manage output as
part of a new 5-year pact which came into force in February. However, with
cocoa prices at their highest levels for 6 years, producers are under little
pressure to trim output.
Cocoa prices at the London Commodity Exchange have risen since the beginning
of the year by Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,040 a tonne. While this increase has
been dwarfed by coffee's Dollars 1,000 a tonne upswing, traders report that
hedge funds are increasingly turning their attention towards cocoa.
World demand for cocoa is expected to outstrip supply by at least 160,000
tonnes this year and many commentators are predicting a shortfall of 300,000
tonnes for next year. Tight supplies should underpin prices for some time
since it takes several years for newly-planted bushes to mature.
Fears in the gold market about central banks dumping some of their huge
holdings of the precious metal have been subsiding. Nevertheless, the market
will be studying carefully some of the papers to be presented by bankers at
the FT Gold Conference today and tomorrow in London.
According to the latest market review from the Gold Fields Minerals Services
consultancy, central bank sales added a net 475 tonnes of gold to supply in
1993. This was down from a net 626 tonnes in 1992 - but that was the year
when the Belgian and Dutch central banks between them sold 600 tonnes.
Meanwhile, officials from the International Primary Aluminium Institute
(IPAI) will be in Moscow on Thursday and Friday to continue negotiations
about Russia supplying aluminium production statistics to add to those
provided by western producers to the institute.
The International Zinc Association has organised an 'international zinc day'
in Paris tomorrow and Wednesday.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Markets: Weevils in the infrastructure carrots - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A 20-25 per cent return for investing in a stable utility such as a power
station, or a toll road? A way into the emerging markets of Asia without
pumping more cash into what have proved highly volatile stock markets?
These are the sort of carrots being dangled in front of pension funds and
other long-term investors in the US and other developed nations. Sooner or
later, no doubt, many members of pension schemes or holders of mutual funds
will indirectly own part of a toll road in Guangdong, a power plant in
Malaysia or a telephone company in Indonesia. But when and how will those
investments be made - and at what sort of return?
Private investment in infrastructure in the developing world - mainly Asia -
is running at about Dollars 15bn a year, according to one international
development agency. That is a drop in the ocean compared with the Dollars
200bn being spent annually on power, water, telecommunications, transport
infrastructure and drainage.
A large part of the Dollars 200bn is going on projects, such as sanitation,
which will never attract private money; but there is still a huge demand for
capital which even the fabled savings rates of Asia's populations cannot
satisfy. Much of it will simply have to come from international investors
and western commercial banks. This is likely to be one of the conclusions
drawn by the World Bank, which is publishing a study on infrastructure needs
this month.
That suggests one possible answer to a nagging question: if utility projects
are so safe, why promise such big returns? In part, because capital from the
developed world has not yet been mobilised on a significant scale. That
places an immediate premium on those investments that are being made.
There are signs that the money is starting to flow. Last week, the biggest
fund of its kind - a Dollars 1.1bn Asian infrastructure fund backed by
American International Group, the US insurer - was finalised. Peregrine
Investments, a Hong Kong-based firm, is close to completing the first half
of its Dollars 1bn fund.
Portfolio investment may have been the most visible aspect of the renewed
capital flows to developing nations this decade, but it has not been the
most significant. Direct investment makes up the lion's share (see charts.)
Bypassing the markets has obvious attractions: fewer valuation problems and
less volatility. For long-term investors, there is also an attraction in the
annuity-type returns of a utility.
But these projects carry their own risks, aside from the obvious problems
such as political upheaval or a balance of payments crisis, or the
difficulties of completing the technically advanced projects.
First, the high rates of return envisaged at present may simply not be
available. They amount to an extra tax on local consumers - a concern that
the Chinese are beginning to raise. One power project is reported to have
been put on ice this year after the authorities refused to countenance an
annual return for the equity investors of more than 15 per cent.
A typical independent power station in the US earns a return of some 12-13
per cent a year. China (with a 13 per cent growth rate and commensurate
growth in the demand for power) can be forgiven for asking why its consumers
should reward foreign capital at twice the US rate.
The projected equity returns are also dependent on the sort of gearing
levels seen in developed-world projects, where debt usually makes up some 75
per cent of the finance. Will debt be available on that scale in the
developing countries?
One day, perhaps, bonds backed by a toll road in Guangdong will be as
readily available in the US as ones secured on a toll road in Orange County.
Rating agencies such as Standard &amp; Poor's point out that the model already
exists: more than half of all municipal bonds issued in the US each year (or
more than Dollars 100bn) are backed by specific projects. Right now, though,
such vehicles are a long way off.
That leads to the second risk. In most developing countries, the public
policy debate over the rights and duties of privately owned and operated
roads or telephone companies is in its infancy. It's all very well to run a
power station: but on what terms will it be connected to the national grid
system? How are the tariffs set, or the regulations which govern access to
electricity? Until there are clear answers to questions like these, many
investors will stay away.
Third, there is the question of picking the right investment partners. Much
of the private money has been channelled through contractors or equipment
makers. Should portfolio investors stand shoulder to shoulder with them as
co-investors? The commercial interests of a contractor-investor are broader
than those of a pension fund: they include selling, say, power generating
equipment, not just making an investment return.
One of the most ambitious plans to date has been the venture between GE
Capital, part of General Electric (a big supplier of power systems),
financier Mr George Soros and the International Finance Corporation. These
people make curious bedfellows. To date, says GE Capital, they have made no
efforts to raise the Dollars 2.5bn they talked of back in January: the
projects must come first, the finance later. How eager will investors be to
back a fund which seems at least in part to be acting as a vehicle for
supporting GE sales?
And fourth, where is the exit? It all comes back to those stock markets.
Sooner or later, many private utilities will find their way on to local
bourses, as their shareholder-developers seek a way out. It all adds up to a
huge demand for new investors somewhere down the line. But at least by then
the emerging stock markets will have had a chance to grow up a little.

FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz expands in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercedes-Benz of Germany, the world's leading heavy commercial vehicle
maker, has started production in Indonesia of a new range of light-duty
trucks and buses aimed at weakening the Japanese stranglehold on Asian
commercial vehicle markets.
The launch of the MB 700 marks a change in Mercedes-Benz's approach to
developing new vehicles for the global commercial vehicle market, as it
seeks to overcome the disadvantage of its high cost base in Germany.
The MB 700 range of light-duty trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) has
been developed to meet Asian cost levels with a system of global sourcing of
components.
The vehicles will be assembled in Indonesia by PT German Motors
Manufacturing, a joint venture company in which Mercedes-Benz holds a stake
of 33.3 per cent. It will be for the local domestic market and for export to
other countries in south-east Asia and the Middle East.
Output is planned to rise to about 5,000 trucks and midi-buses a year with
sales of about 2,000 a year in Indonesia.
Engines for the vehicles will be assembled in Indonesia from components
produced by Mercedes-Benz's commercial vehicle subsidiary in Brazil.
Transmissions and front axles are to be supplied by Tata Engineering and
Locomotive (Telco) in India, while the rear axles will come from India from
AAL, a licensee of Rockwell, the US automotive components supplier.
Brakes and shock absorbers will be supplied from India, propeller shafts
will be made by Spicer in the US, Mercedes-Benz Argentina will supply the
mechanical steering system, optional power steering will come from Koyo in
Japan, while cab parts will be supplied by Mercedes-Benz's Spanish
subsidiary.
The chassis frames and cabs will be assembled in Indonesia, and local
components producers will supply wheel rims and tyres, the exhaust system,
springs and truck and bus bodies.
'The supply of major components from a country with high wage levels such as
Germany could not satisfy the cost target. New ways had to be found,' said
Mr Klaus-Dieter Vohringer, Mercedes-Benz components production director.
As part of its expansion in Asia the German group is also investing DM85m
(Dollars 49.4m) to establish a central parts distribution centre in
Singapore, which eventually will have the capacity for supplying more than
15,000 different replacement parts and components to markets in Asia.
Mercedes-Benz is aiming to use the MB 700 range to expand its presence in
several regions of the world with production of similar vehicles planned for
Saudi Arabia, Turkey and South Africa. It is seeking a general manufacturing
licence to begin assembly in Vietnam, and is targeting emerging markets in
China and in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
While Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading producer of trucks over six tonnes
(gross vehicle weight), has a share of of 30 per cent of the west European
market, 40 per cent in Latin American countries and 25 per cent of the US
heavy truck market, it has an overall market share of only 1 per cent in
south-east Asia.
In addition to the MB 700 range of trucks and midi-buses from Indonesia,
Mercedes-Benz is planning to supply a range of light commercial vehicles to
Asian markets from South Korea.
A version of its MB100 panel van, currently produced in Spain for sale in
Europe, is to be manufactured by Ssangyong, the Korean vehicle maker in
which Mercedes-Benz holds a small minority stake.

policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Kaputin, Papua New Guinea's mining and petroleum minister, cast a
new shadow over the future of mining projects in the country when he
announced at the weekend that he intended to review national mining and
petroleum policy and would need the next six to 12 months to do so.
Speaking to mining executives at PNG's annual geology, exploration and
mining conference in Lae, Mr Kaputin indicated that after the large ADollars
1.2bn (USDollars 857m) Lihir gold mine project was finalised, there would be
a moratorium on further mining project decisions.
'Let me advise you that after this project (Lihir), we will hold everything
and I have been instructed to use the next six to 12 months to come up with
a new policy,' Mr Kaputin said.
'I am not, at this stage, in a position to let you know what my terms of
reference are going to be, but we will be visiting a number of countries to
examine their respective mining and petroleum policies in order to
re-examine our own national policies.'
Already, the PNG government has kept the international investment community
on tenterhooks over Lihir. Originally, there were hopes that the necessary
special mining lease for the project - a joint venture between Britain's RTZ
group and Niugini Mining, which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain -
would be granted by the government at the beginning of 1994.
However, the matter has subsequently been bogged down in the PNG cabinet for
months, with the dispute apparently centred on whether the state-owned
Malaysian Mining Corporation should be brought into the project at an early
stage, and what share of the equity should be given to local landowners.
Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, recently told parliament that the
deal would be concluded 'properly and . . . at the right time'. He added
that 'we will not be pressured by lobby groups.'
The decision by Mr Kaputin, who took over the mining portfolio in a
ministerial reshuffle at the beginning of this year, to put future projects
on hold while he reviews PNG's mining policy seems likely to jeopardise
further PNG's already-strained relations with parts of the international
investment community.
RTZ in London could not be contacted for comment.

<TEXT>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, the US arm of Britain's Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
advertising group, is parting company with its most senior managers as part
of a shake-up to bring the struggling New York operations back to life.
The company said Mr Harvey Hoffenberg, who became chairman of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising only last year, would be leaving at the end of June. Mr
Hoffman has been the New York office's chief creative officer for the past
five years.
The other departure is that of Mr Rich Pounder, the US company's
vice-chairman. He had been with the company for 21 years.
A reshuffle of the New York office had seemed likely following the decision
by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in London to send over Mr Bill Muirhead, previously
head of the company's Charlotte Street offices, to become chairman and chief
executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America.
While the British parent company has been engulfed by a power struggle
between Mr Maurice Saatchi, its chairman, and Mr Charles Scott, its chief
executive, many of its financial difficulties are due to the poor
performance of its US operations.
Several big accounts have been lost, including one from Chrysler's
Jeep/Eagle division and for Brown &amp; Williamson's Kool cigarettes. More
important, it has been slow to attract new billings. According to Adweek
magazine, it won only Dollars 101.5m worth of business last year, leaving it
12th in the rankings.
The US company announced its reshuffle late on Friday after the markets had
closed, and could not be contacted for comment. But according to its
statement, Mr Michael Jeary, chief executive officer of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's
San Francisco office, will become chief executive in New York. Mr Muirhead
had previously been looking after the job.
On the creative side, Mr Stanley Becker, vice-chairman and chief creative
officer of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS Pacific Los Angeles, will be given
responsibility for 'the restructuring and regeneration of the Saatchi New
York creative department'.

FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: German banks prepare to launch
money-market funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German banks are preparing to launch money-market funds in Germany this
summer following the Bundesbank's surprise decision last month to drop its
opposition to the funds.
The German government plans to implement legislation allowing the funds as
part of the second Financial Markets Promotion Act due to become law at the
beginning of August this year.
'There are plenty of details to be worked out but we plan to introduce new
funds as soon as is practicable,' said Mr Christian Strenger, chief
executive of DWS, the Deutsche Bank affiliate which is Germany's largest
fund manager.
Money-market funds are short-term investment vehicles which are very popular
as a highly liquid alternative to fixed-term deposits in countries such as
the US and France. Units in the funds can be bought and sold on a daily
basis and investors can enjoy a better return than for straightforward
deposits.
The Bundesbank has long argued that the funds, which invest in short-term
government bonds, certificates and bank debt of less than one year, would
diminish the effectiveness of its monetary policy. This was chiefly because
they would have circumvented its minimum reserve policy, which requires
banks to lodge a proportion of their deposits with the central bank on an
interest-free basis.
The central bank's opposition to the funds has waned in the past 18 months,
during which time it has cut its main minimum reserve requirements from 4.95
per cent to 2 per cent.
Over the long-term, the introduction of funds is likely to put pressure on
banks' funding structure as customers shift their savings from deposits - a
source of cheap financing for banks - to the new funds. But bankers said
that current low short-term interest rates would ensure only a limited
interest in the products when they are introduced.
A study from DB Research, the Deutsche Bank research arm, said last week
there is considerable investment potential for the funds. They will be able
to invest in DM300bn (Dollars 174bn) worth of short-dated bonds with a
residual life of one year or less, as well as other short-dated instruments
such as floating-rate notes and commercial paper.
In other countries, short-dated government securities are the chief
investment vehicles for money-market funds. The Bundesbank objects to the
government borrowing on a short-term basis but DB Research argues that the
funds will remove resistance to such short-term borrowing.

FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: GMA launches ADollars 182m bid
for Dominion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An ADollars 182m (USDollars 130m) bid for Dominion Mining, the Australian
gold producer, has been launched by Gold Mines of Australia, another Western
Australia-based miner.
GMA, which said it had picked up a 5.4 per cent stake through recent stock
market purchases, plans to offer three of its own shares for every four
Dominion shares. If the deal goes ahead, it would roughly double the size of
GMA, which is currently capitalised at about ADollars 150m.
GMA said this was one of the reasons for the bid. The greater size of the
group would make it more attractive to investors.
GMA was formed by the merger of three mining companies, Eastmet, Metana and
Paragon Resources, and estimates that production will stand at about 100,000
ounces of gold in the year to June.
Most of its current projects are in either Western Australia or New South
Wales, and a new underground mine at the Youanmi project in Western
Australia is due to come on stream in October.
Dominion has been beset by concerns over its reserves and operating costs,
and has suffered a bumpy earnings record in recent years.

plans

<TEXT>
Australia's institutional investors have thrown their support behind the
suggestion that the Australian Stock Exchange should introduce a new listing
rule for 'best practice' in the corporate governance of listed companies,
writes Nikki Tait.
The Australian Investment Managers Group, which represents most of the
country's institutional fund managers, said yesterday that it 'strongly
supported' such an initiative by the ASX, which would be modelled on the
London Stock Exchange.
This would require listed companies to disclose if they were not complying
with the best practices guidelines incorporated into the listing rule.

FT  06 JUN 94 / International Company News: Litigation costs accountants
Dollars 1.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Litigation last year cost the big US accounting firms over Dollars 1bn for
the first time, according to figures published by the six biggest firms. The
amount, just short of Dollars 1.1bn, compares with Dollars 783m the year
before and is made up of judgments, out-of-court settlements and legal
defence costs, writes Richard Waters.
Publication of the figures, for which no detailed breakdown was given, is
part a campaign by accountants in the US for legislative reform to limit
their exposure to malpractice suits.
Most of the increased costs last year were met by insurance. Payments from
insurance companies (after deducting premiums) came to Dollars 416m, up from
Dollars 185m in 1992 and only Dollars 8m in 1991. After insurance
recoveries, litigation costs amounted to 12 per cent of their accounting and
audit fees, according to the firms - Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG Peat Marwick and Price Waterhouse.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A legal wrangle has broken out between US Steel and NKK, the Japanese steel
group, over NKK's success in poaching a group of top managers to run its 76
per cent-owned US subsidiary, National Steel, writes Richard Waters in New
York.
Among other things, US Steel has sought an injunction to prevent the five
managers who defected to National Steel last week from divulging trade
secrets or other commercially sensitive information.
The five were all poached from US Steel's plant at Gary, Indiana, the
largest steel mill in the US. The group is led by Mr John Goodwin who is
widely respected in the industry for turning the Gary works into one of the
US's most efficient plants. Mr Goodwin was last week named president and
chief operating officer of National Steel.
On Friday, US Steel said it had filed a complaint in Lake County Superior
Court in Hammond, Indiana, seeking the injunction against the five and
damages from NKK and National. It said it had asked for a temporary
restraining order to prevent NKK and National from approaching any of its
employees.

FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Biocure raising Pounds 0.8m in USM float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biocure Holdings, the pharmaceut-ical research company which produces
diabetic healthcare products, is coming to the Unlisted Securities Market
next month.
It is raising Pounds 810,000 net through a placing of shares at 40p and is
offering shareholders the chance to subscribe for extra shares under an open
offer. The proceeds will be used for working capital.
Having initially raised money through a BES, Biocure joined the third market
in 1989. After this was wound up in 1991 its shares were traded under Rule
535 (2). Ahead of the USM flotation this facility has been withdrawn at the
company's request.
Biocure was formed in 1984 in Aberdeen to research anti-cancer and healing
compounds discovered by Mr Neil Hendry, its main shareholder. In its early
stages it was funded by Barratt Developments, the housebuilder whose former
deputy chairman, Mr Bill Bruce, chairs the company.
In 1992 Biocure acquired Hypoguard, a Suffolk-based company which makes
blood glucose monitoring meters and test strips for diabetics. It exports to
30 countries. Hypoguard plans to double production capacity over the next
year.
Biocure Holdings incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds
1.9m in the year to June 30 1993 but is now forecasting profits.
The placing and open offer is being sponsored by Allied Provincial
Securities.

FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Seeking funds to open window of opportunity
 -Alan Cane considers the flotation of VideoLogic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The demerger and flotation of VideoLogic, the electronics company developing
some key components of the coming multimedia revolution, is expected to be
announced this week.
Analysts believe the company could be capitalised at up to Pounds 70m.
The company is a subsidiary of Avesco, a broadcast equipment and services
group whose trading performance has been adversely affected by VideoLogic's
voracious appetite for research and development funds. It bought the company
in 1989 for about Pounds 10m on the rationale that the companies' activities
were complementary.
For the six months to September 30 Avesco incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
2.32m and at the time of reporting the figures announced a placement to
raise about Pounds 5m, chiefly to fund VideoLogic's multimedia research.
VideoLogic incurred a loss of Pounds 2.34m on sales of Pounds 4.56m in the
same period.
This week's flotation, analysts estimate, should raise up to Pounds 25m of
new money, much of which will go to repay debt to Avesco. Up to Pounds 15m,
however, should be available as much needed working capital.
The flotation, likely to take the form of a preference application to
existing shareholders coupled with an open offer, is eagerly awaited both by
Avesco shareholders and VideoLogic's senior management.
Mr Derek Maclaren, VideoLogic's chairman, said: 'We have been investing
heavily for the past two years to exploit a window of opportunity in
multimedia which is just beginning to open.
'Now we need public money to take advantage of the opportunity. Avesco
cannot afford it. It bought a Formula One stable: very racy and very
expensive.'
Industry analysts believe a properly funded VideoLogic would be in pole
position to make an impact in multimedia, the delivery of media services of
all kinds through a single interactive channel to home or office.
Other forces in the industry agree. VideoLogic has either joint ventures or
alliances with International Business Machines, British Telecommunications,
Motorola and Matrox.
The company's strategy is based on the proposition that the receiver for
multimedia services, essentially the screen on which information will be
displayed, will be the personal computer rather than the television.
An essential part of multi-media, however, is the ability to handle full
motion video and here personal computers are deficient. Video clips in a
typical multimedia programme play in a window the size of a postage stamp.
VideoLogic's microchips and printed circuit boards can give the computer the
ability to display full screen, full motion video.
The potential market is very large. Dataquest, the US market consultancy,
estimates the global installed base of multimedia personal computers will
grow from 7m last year to 19m in 1995.
Suggestions that the company has at least a six month lead over its
competitors are given credibility by the fact that the company's earlier
video product, the DVA400, led the world in combining flexibility with low
cost.
VideoLogic's products are sold to other manufacturers to build into their
systems, to corporate customers and, through retailers, to the public.
Warburgs, VideoLogic's adviser, is predicting operating profits of between
Pounds 4m and Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 50m to Pounds 90m in 1995-96.

FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Finance director leaves Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise announcement by Wellcome that Mr John Precious, its 51-year-old
finance director, is leaving 'to pursue other opportunities' has again
focused market attention on the pharmaceuticals group.
Wellcome's shares fell 13p to 543p on Friday after the announcement which
added that Mr Precious would, 'continue with his current responsibilities
for the time being while a successor is sought.'
The company said his departure was amicable, but analysts noted that this
was the latest in a string of management and boardroom changes and it comes
at a critical time for the group whose fortunes have ebbed over the last few
years.
Wellcome has gone through a series of senior management changes since the
company sold 270m shares at 800p in 1992.
Mr John Robb, chief executive since 1990, took over the chairman's post last
August from the unwell Sir Alastair Frame and was confirmed in this
additional role this year.
In April, the director of research and development outside the US, Mr Trevor
Jones, moved 'to become an adviser to John Robb.' His job was absorbed by
the US director of research development, Mr David Berry.
Now the departure of Mr Precious adds another discontinuity to Wellcome's
management strategy.

Eleco Holdings, the building products and construction group which returned
to the black at its December interim after restructuring, has announced
further disposals and warned that its full year results will be adversely
affected by a poor performance at Davis Group, its cable management
subsidiary.
Davis' second half results were hit by difficult market conditions in
Germany and the UK, and are expected to have a significant impact on group
results as a whole for the year ended June 30.
The company is now up for sale and preliminary negotiations are in progress.
Eleco's subsidiary Webster Homes has completed the sale of parts of its
Orsett site, valued at Pounds 2.35m in the group accounts at June 30 1993,
for Pounds 772,500 and Pounds 1.67m respectively, both for cash.

WH Smith, the retailing and distribution group, has signed its biggest US
airport deal so far, expected to add Dollars 25m to its current annual
turnover of Dollars 65m (Pounds 43.3m) from its 93 US airport shops.
The company has been awarded a contract to operate eight news and gift shops
at Los Angeles International, the world's fourth largest airport.
The contract is the largest news and gift concession in a US airport,
representing about 40 per cent of all concessionary business at Los Angeles
International,
Smith beat competition from the existing incumbent, Duty Free Shoppers, and
Allders International, the duty and tax free retailer.
The Los Angeles contract follows recent awards of concessions at Denver,
Atlanta and Louisville airports.
It takes the number of US airports where Smith has outlets to 15, including
Chicago, Orlando and Las Vegas.
The biggest airport where it is not yet represented is Dallas-Fort Worth,
but Smith says it will pitch for a contract there as soon as there is an
opportunity.
'We have broken through the sound barrier in terms of getting ourselves
established as a name in US airport retailing,' the company said. 'We now
have critical mass.'
Smith has been expanding in the US since 1985. In addition to airport shops,
it has 270 hotel outlets as well as the 170-store music chain The Wall, and
Waterstone's bookshops in Boston and Chicago. Other openings are planned.
While most of its airport outlets are news stands and gift shops under the
WH Smith name, it is keen to expand The Wall and Waterstone's formats into
airports, and has already done so at Pittsburgh airport.
With 60 more large US airports where it is not represented, and passenger
volumes expected to double in the next 15 years, the company sees
significant expansion opportunities. The business is lucrative, with sales
densities of more than Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 660) a square foot last year.
The company's ambitions are in line with forecasts by experts such as
Professor Gary Davies of Manchester's International Centre for Retail
Studies. He predicts that large travel termini, with their high customer
densities, will become increasingly popular sites for retailers.
Smith is also monitoring airport developments in east Asia with a view to
opening retail outlets there.

FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Smith New Court research is 'best overall'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith New Court is providing the best overall research service in the City
of London, according to an annual survey carried out by Greenwich
Associates, a US-based consultancy.
The report shows that Smith New Court has managed to nudge ahead of James
Capel and Warburg Securities.
The three investment houses tied in first place last year.
The report is compiled by Greenwich Associates staff.
One of the key tables shows how 53 institutions paying more than Pounds 1m
of commission view the research service provided by the firms.
The institutions are asked which brokers they rank as a 'top 15 firm'.
This year it shows that UBS has slipped from joint fourth to joint seventh
with Hoare Govett.
Behind the top three of Smith New Court, James Capel and Warburg comes Nat
West Securities which has moved up three places after finishing seventh last
year.
BZW ranks joint fifth with Kleinwort Benson, Cazenove comes in ninth and
Credit Lyonnais tenth. The five others making up the top 15 firms are:
Charterhouse Tilney, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Panmure Gordon and
Henderson Crosthwaite.
Another key table shows how all 135 investment institutions rank broking
research.
Here both James Capel and Warburg are seen as providing the joint best
service followed closely by Smith New Court.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Worries surface as Swatch marks
time - SMH
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SMH, the Swiss watchmaking group best known for the Swatch, will receive
journalists and investment analysts at its annual results presentations
tomorrow in Berne.
In contrast to the festive mood of the last two presentations - following
profit rises of 32 and 64 per cent - tomorrow's affair is likely to be
sober, possibly even quarrelsome.
The SMH bearer share has lost a third of its value in the past year in
response to unfavourable rumours and developments that have not yet been
fully explained by the group's usually voluble chairman, Mr Nicolas Hayek.
Fears that Swatch sales were stagnating appeared to be confirmed in February
when the group announced flat sales for 1993 of SFr2.86bn (Pounds 1.4bn) and
net income up only 7 per cent to SFr440m. Although SMH makes several other
highly profitable brands, including Omega and Blancpain, Swatch provides the
vital volume.
Meanwhile, SMH's strategy of applying the Swatch brand name to other
consumer products is looking a bit frayed.
The withdrawal of the industrialist Mr Stephan Schmidheiny from the
controlling shareholder pool has sharpened suspicions that Mr Hayek prefers
to run the group single-handed. Many analysts wonder if he is putting in
enough effort to secure the group's place in the post-Swatch mass market.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Long distance call in place
despite local difficulties - Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mobile communications group Vodafone has been pushed off its pedestal,
its shares falling from an all-time peak of 637p in February to 517p at the
end of last week. But analysts expect its 1993-94 pre-tax profits, due for
release tomorrow, to be in the range of Pounds 350m-Pounds 370m and its
medium-term prospects are still seen as healthy.
At Pounds 360m, Robert Fleming's mid-way projection, Vodafone would be 12
per cent ahead of last year's Pounds 322m, with earnings per share of 24.2p
up 9 per cent. 'The UK cellular market is becoming more competitive, but
Vodafone is holding its own,' says Mr Kevin Langford, Fleming's mobile
communications analyst. 'The main concern is about prospects for its new
digital networks and the expansion of its overseas business.'
Vodafone's shares have been depressed by the recent malaise in the telecoms
sector, with added volatility caused by the launch of two new national
cellular networks in the last eight months - Mercury One-2-One and Hutchison
Microtel's Orange. None the less, Vodafone enjoyed record numbers of new
connections in both December and March, and now boasts 1.2m UK subscribers.
Slow growth in its new UK digital networks has not mattered while capacity
on the analogue network remained abundant, but analysts are looking for
evidence of a viable Vodafone strategy to move customers across to its
enhanced - but more expensive - GSM digital network.
Vodafone is well on the way to realising its goal of acquiring overseas
franchises with an aggregate population equal to the UK, adjusting for
income and the company's share of consortia. But it has yet to make much
return on overseas investments.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Signs of an end to merger wave: Brussels will this week
decide on the Dollars 3bn Shell-Montedison venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday, a meeting of European commissioners is scheduled to decide
whether to allow a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) plastics joint venture to be
created by Royal Dutch/Shell and Montedison, the industrial arm of Italy's
troubled Feruzzi empire. To try to secure approval, the companies are
prepared to offer concessions that will limit the strength of the joint
venture. But if the deal is blocked, it could signal an end to the round of
chemicals industry restructuring that dominated the early 1990s.
Called Montell, the joint venture would plug gaps in each company's
strategy. Both are strong in polypropylene, a material with annual global
sales of about Dollars 10bn. Montell would have a global market share of
about 19 per cent, four times its nearest competitor, and a European share
of 24 per cent.
Montedison's forerunner, Montecatini, pioneered the development of
polypropylene in the 1950s and the company's plastics subsidiary Himont
remains a world leader with a technology licensed to companies in North
America and Asia.
But Montedison is hampered by a debt mountain of L13,600bn (Pounds 5.6bn) -
even after a L5,177bn rights issue in January - and by the high cost of
buying in feedstocks. Shell has financial strength and petrochemical
feedstocks. It is strong in markets such as northern Europe and Australasia,
but weak in southern Europe and east Asia where Montedison is well placed.
Montell would also be a strong player in the Dollars 25bn-a-year market for
polyethylene, best known for plastic bags and film. Himont has developed a
technique for making linear low density polyethylene, or LLDPE, which has
some advantages over older methods.
The proposed Shell-Himont venture is just the latest in Europe's
industry-wide restructuring. The biggest moves in the past two years include
Hoechst's merger of its PVC and plant protection businesses with those of
Wacker-Chemie and Schering, in Germany; Snia of Italy's fibres deals with
France's Rhone Poulenc and with Courtaulds of the UK; and ICI of the UK's
nylon-for-acrylics swap with Du Pont of the US.
Such deals have been a response not only to recession but to the rise of
three groups of global competitors:
Eastern European manufacturers are exporting cheap commodity chemicals to
western Europe, taking advantage of low labour costs, weak currencies and
lax environmental controls.
The Middle East is now a source of petrochemicals and plastics with the
advantage of abundant local feedstocks. East Asia has emerged as a force in
chemicals as exports from Europe and the US have been displaced by local
plants large enough to supply customers in Europe and North America.
The strength of these competitors is reflected in the relatively slow growth
of western European chemicals exports: from 1985 to 1992 exports rose 13 per
cent to Ecu 48.9bn (Pounds 38bn), but imports climbed 29 per cent to Ecu
24.3bn, according to the European Chemical Industry Council.
Rationalisation of the western European industry may or may not reverse this
trend, but it has at least helped to rescue corporate earnings.
First-quarter pre-tax profits at Germany's BASF, a big polypropylene
producer, rose 46.6 per cent to DM349m (Pounds 140m). Strong performances
were also revealed by Hoechst and Bayer, another German company. There was
optimism too from Akzo Nobel, created by the Dutch group Akzo's takeover of
Sweden's Nobel Industries.
Shell acknowledges that the industry's emergence from recession may slow the
restructuring drive. Companies and politicians are more amenable to
cost-cutting ventures when profits are under pressure. 'It's easier to put
together a deal when times are brutal than when they are not,' says one
Shell executive.
This week's Commission decision could confirm that time is indeed running
out for industry mergers. A committee of national competition experts has
recommended that the joint venture be vetoed. Shell says the main issue is
control over polypropylene technology and, as a result, the past few days
have seen last-minute concessions by both parties.
'There is a point at which the price of concessions makes the fundamental
synergies not beneficial enough,' says Shell. But failure would be hard to
swallow. 'We have invested three years in coming to this point. We faced a
lot of naysayers inside and outside the organisation, arguing that it would
be too complex to get done. But strategically it is a beautiful fit.'

FT  06 JUN 94 / Astra satellite group plans Pounds 1bn float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg company behind the Astra
satellite television system, is planning a flotation which it is believed
will value it at more than Pounds 1bn.
The company, which already broadcasts 50 television channels over Europe,
would be floated on the London Stock Exchange and a number of other European
exchanges, probably before the end of next year.
A formal decision to float and the date will depend on the successful launch
of the fourth Astra satellite, due in September, and the marketing of
channels on the fifth and sixth satellite, which will be devoted to digital
television services. Digital compression technology will enable the two
satellites to deliver more than 400 channels of television.
Flotation has been brought a step nearer by last week's agreement that
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the soon to be privatised German telecoms
group, will buy a 16.6 per cent stake in SES for Pounds 180m - much higher
than previously expected. DBP agreed to buy 25 per cent of the two-thirds of
SES held privately. The remaining third is held by Luxembourg state-owned
financial institutions.
The German stake amounts to around 20 per cent of the financial assets of
SES (because the private investors put up about 80 per cent of the finance).
This suggests a current notional value of around Pounds 900m for the
satellite group, which made profits of Pounds 55m last year. The DBP deal
was accompanied by a Pounds 100m capitalisation to pay for the new
satellites.
The German deal and the new value it helps to establish for SES is important
for Thames Television, an early investor in SES and now part of Pearson, the
information and entertainment group that also owns the Financial Times.
In 1986 Thames paid Pounds 7m for a 10 per cent stake and has had most of
that back in dividends. Thames will also get Pounds 10m compensation for its
stake in the enlarged SES falling to 6 per cent. Altogether, the value of
Thames's SES stake could now be around Pounds 75m. Pearson paid Pounds 99m
for Thames, where the other assets include Pounds 40-Pounds 50m a year in
revenues from independent production, Teddington studios, a programme
library and stakes in two satellite channels.
DBT remains the largest shareholder in Eutelsat, the satellite 'club' of
Europe's telecoms groups, and the main rival to SES.
DBT's stake is a tacit admission of the success of SES but also an
indication that the group wants to take advantage of SES plans to go digital
next year. The DBT deal could also give SES a relationship with Bertelsmann,
the international media group, and with the Kirch organisation which
dominates German film rights.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Veterans relive day of destiny: Queen and western leaders on
voyage of D-Day remembrance

<TEXT>
A dazzling commemoration of the allied invasion of France, full of carefully
organised pomp and small moments of pathos, got under way yesterday as the
royal yacht Britannia carrying the Queen led a flotilla of ships across the
Channel from Portsmouth.
In Normandy, 40 US veterans defied conventional wisdom on the limitations of
old age and repeated their parachute jumps of 50 years ago. In a salute to
fallen comrades, they jumped from a vintage DC-3 Dakota aircraft near the
town of Sainte Mere-Eglise. One was hurt after his parachute twisted.
Another 550 serving US paratroopers followed.
To the east 1,000 British, Polish, Canadian and French paras dropped near
the Pegasus bridge, the first piece of France to be freed on D-Day.
The ceremonies, which come to a climax today on the beaches where the allies
landed, began yesterday morning with a religious service on Southsea Common
outside Portsmouth. Leaders of the allied nations, bound for France on
Britannia and a variety of warships, were given a tumultuous send-off by a
flypast of second world war aircraft.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, who officiated at the service
along with Roman Catholic and Jewish leaders, recalled some of the
sensations experienced by the biggest invasion force ever assembled.
He spoke of 'the smell of self-heating soup that did little for
sea-sickness; the fear in the pit of the stomach as the beaches loomed
ahead; the devastated orchards of Normandy and the stench of dead cattle;
and the individual acts of bravery and brilliance'. But 'those we remember
today', said the Archbishop, 'gave their lives not only for the liberation
of occupied Europe, but also for the German nation - to free itself of the
dark tyranny that was destroying its soul'.
At a rain-swept ceremony on Saturday, the head of the German war graves
committee, Mr Hans-Otto Weber, held a service at the La Cambe cemetery where
21,250 Germans are buried. German and French bishops yesterday held a joint
service in Caen.
French president Francois Mitterrand said France was 'happy and proud to
welcome the veterans of the allied troops who, 50 years ago, came to mingle
their blood with that of her sons'.
The flotilla of small boats shadowing Britannia mirrored in miniature the
vast invasion fleet mustered on D-Day. Mr John Major, the prime minister,
said: 'I cannot remember anything as big or as spectacular as this. I'm very
proud.' US president Bill Clinton, one of the youngest of the government
leaders aboard the royal yacht, said: 'I never dreamt I would be here, doing
this sort of thing.'
Earlier, landing craft came ashore near the Southsea Common war memorial to
collect the national flags of the allies for transfer to another ship, the
HMS Fearless, which took them to Normandy.
In mid-Channel, the allied leaders on the Britannia took the salute of some
40 allied ships. Wreaths were laid at sea and a vintage Lancaster bomber
dropped two million poppies, symbols of the war dead.
One unusual ceremony was a joint memorial mass in the small town of Periers
between veterans of the 90th US infantry division and the 6th German
parachute division.
This German unit gave the battered 90th a truce in which to collect their
wounded, prompting some Americans to find the Germans after the war. They
have already held several joint memorials together.

FT  06 JUN 94 / UK backs off veto to block Dehaene from top EU job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is refusing to threaten its national veto against the
candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene for the European Commission presidency amid
acknowledgment in Whitehall that it may eventually have to accept the
appointment of the Belgian prime minister.
But the risk of a political backlash on the Conservative back-benches could
force Mr John Major to ensure that a decision on the succession to Mr
Jacques Delors is postponed beyond this month's European Union summit in
Corfu.
Ministers insist the competition for the post is still wide open despite the
endorsement of Mr Dehaene by both Germany and France. They also point out
that the Belgian prime minister, an avowed supporter of a federal Europe,
has not formally announced he will run.
But Mr Major yesterday publicly acknowledged the risks of seeking to use
Britain's national veto to block Mr Dehaene. Speaking on BBC television he
recalled that the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher had vetoed the candidacy of Mr
Claude Cheysson, the former French foreign minister, in 1984. The result had
been the appointment of Mr Delors.
Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Major's preferred candidate, and Mr Ruud Lubbers, the
Dutch prime minister, have both indicated their determination to stay in the
race.
Among EU governments to declare their positions along with France and
Germany, Spain has so far supported Mr Lubbers and Greece Sir Leon. But Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, is expected to face pressure
from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to switch his backing to Mr Dehaene.
British ministers believe Mr Dehaene's reputation as an advocate of a
centralised European superstate has been greatly exaggerated. The Belgian
prime minister is seen in Whitehall as a 'political fixer' rather than a
'European visionary' in the mould of Mr Delors.
There is also a view that Mr Lubbers' well known 'Atlanticist' instincts
have obscured the fact that he might prove a more powerful advocate of
further European integration.
But Mr Major knows that to accept the candidacy of Mr Dehaene immediately
after an expected heavy Tory defeat in this week's European elections could
provoke a serious rebellion on the Conservative back-benches.
After his retreat earlier this year on the issue of majority voting in the
Council of Ministers, some rightwing Tory MPs see the Commission presidency
as a litmus test of Mr Major's credibility in Europe.
So while studiously avoiding any threat of a veto, the prime minister will
hope that deadlock at the Corfu summit could halt the Dehaene bandwagon and
rekindle the chances of Sir Leon's eventual appointment.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors traditionally view British utilities as bond surrogates. As gilt
yields have shot up this year, so have utility yields. The rise in utility
yields of 1.02 percentage points is sharper than the 0.54 points rise in the
yield on the all-share index. Another way of looking at the same phenomenon
is provided in the accompanying chart. It shows a marked correspondence in
movements in utility yields relative to the market and shifts in the
gilt/equity yield ratio.
This habit of treating utilities as bond surrogates is odd. True, utilities'
income streams are relatively predictable. But there the correspondence with
bonds ends. Gilt yields have risen this year because of higher real interest
rates and increased inflationary expectations. The utilities, by contrast,
are effective hedges against increases in both real interest rates and
inflation.
The real interest rate hedge stems from the way that utility regulators
decide permitted profitability levels. Their starting point is to determine
a utility's cost of capital, which is calculated by taking real interest
rates and adding a company-specific risk premium. So if real interest rates
rise, the company's permitted profitability goes up too - albeit with a lag,
as price caps are reviewed only every four or five years.
The inflation hedge also stems from the regulatory system. Price caps are
explicitly related to the retail price index. Higher inflation means higher
revenues and higher profits. One cannot say the same for an ordinary bond.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: European equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental European equity issues are about to reach flood proportions. As
bankers and brokers seek to cram in deals before their summer holidays, five
issues of Dollars 1bn or more and several of a lesser size are due to hit
the market. Given the recent poor performance of equities and the waning
appetite among international investors for new issues, some offerings could
be in for a difficult run. A warning sign came in last week's Dollars 1.1bn
Endesa sale by Spain. Not only was the issue price at the low end of
expectations. The shares initially traded below the issue price.
The next big issue is the Dollars 3.5bn sale of shares in KPN by the Dutch
government. Pricing is expected to be announced this morning. After that
comes the Dollars 1.3bn Pharmacia offering by Sweden and the Dollars 3bn INA
sale by Italy. Also in the pipeline from Italy are Mediobanca's Dollars 1bn
share issue, Cariplo's Dollars 1.2bn issue and Mondadori's Dollars 500m
offering. It seems unlikely that any of these issues will be pulled. Once
such large offerings get under way, they acquire a momentum of their own.
Moreover, when governments are privatising companies, the loss of political
face from cancelling a flotation would be huge.
Still, US and UK institutions - which in the past have been the mainstays of
international equity offerings - are no longer so keen. US investors are not
as flush with cash as they were at the end of last year, while UK
shareholders have recently had to cope with an excess of domestic
flotations. Investors may not boycott the European issues but they will
expect generous prices.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Shell/Montedison
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's approval for their joint venture in plastics is
probably more important to Montedison than to Royal Dutch/Shell. While the
latter would dearly love to cement its position in polypropylene - one of
the fastest-growing plastics - Montedison is counting on the opportunity to
inject Dollars 2bn debt into the new company. That would help relieve
pressure following the financial restructuring of its parent, Ferruzzi, last
year. After three years of detailed planning, though, failure to gain
approval this week would be a blow to both prospective partners.
It is hard to see the joint venture as inherently anti-competitive. While it
would account for about 24 per cent of European polypropylene capacity,
prices are set in the world market. Imports of either raw plastic or simple
finished goods would be sucked in if European prices were pulled out of
line. Neither is Shell/Montedison's dominance in technology as threatening
as it might first appear. About 70 per cent of world polypropylene capacity
is based on technology licensed from Shell or Montedison, but alternatives
are available. BASF, which bought ICI's polypropylene interests earlier this
year, uses technology licensed from the UK company.
Besides, the joint venture would encourage restructuring in an overcrowded
market by reducing the number of producers and allowing overheads to be cut.
On that view it is in the wider interests of the European chemicals industry
that an acceptable deal can be struck.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Cash in hand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government may be inclined to blame the demands of institutional
investors for high dividends, but rising pay-outs are now being fuelled by
companies' improving balance sheets and cash flow. The aggregate gearing of
the equity market is probably now below 30 per cent, having fallen from more
than 40 per cent at the trough. Against that background it is hardly
surprising that dividend growth has outstripped the most optimistic City
forecasts this year, even though earnings are growing in line with
expectations.
But aggregate figures disguise the number of companies which have - or will
soon have - net cash. Many are in sectors such as retailing or
pharmaceuticals which invested heavily in the 1980s. Utilities privatised on
favourable terms, such as the regional electricity companies and power
generators, and established hoarders such as Associated British Foods are
also on the list. But companies as diverse as De La Rue, BET, Tomkins and
Whitbread must also be included. On the fringes are industrial giants such
as Imperial Chemical Industries and RTZ which now boast very low levels of
gearing by historic standards.
While that points to big dividends to come from some companies, including
one-off payments, the overall position could change quickly. Despite the
government's concerns, investment intentions are not especially weak for
this point in the economic cycle. If physical investment starts to rise and
acquisitions return to the corporate scene, dividend growth across the
market would soon revert to a more normal rate.

A group of young Arabs is engaged in heated discussion in a West Bank cafe.
As the chat takes a political turn, an older man taps one of the group on
the shoulder, beckoning him aside.
'You are an Israeli soldier in disguise,' says the village elder. 'Unless
you admit it and make yourself scarce I shall expose you to the rest of the
gathering.'
The younger man is visibly distressed. 'All right, I admit it,' he replies.
'But please, how did you recognise me? I've always been assured my Arabic
accent is perfect.'
'Quite right,' says the elder. 'It is perfect. But you are the only man in
that group who has said nothing critical about Yassir Arafat.'

The UK government is planning to privatise - 'contract out' is the official
euphemism - the Careers Service, from April 1995. You may like that or not,
but what does seem more than a trifle absurd is the choice of some of the
department of employment's 43 'franchise areas' for which bids are invited.
Number three on the list is the county of Cleveland, and number ten is the
County of Humberside. But those thinking of bidding for the contracts to
provide Careers Services to those places should think again; the government
has plans to abolish them, starting with Cleveland on April 1 1995.

Instead of the Aid India Consortium the two-day meeting starting on June 30

Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger has never taken kindly to
criticism. Now that it is coming via a dead man he is becoming quite
apoplectic.
The object of his ire, expressed in letters to the New York Times and Wall
Street Journal last Friday, is H R Haldeman, whose posthumously published
diaries of President Nixon's first term are as riveting a read as those of
Alan Clark, despite the lack of sex.
It is not so much Haldeman's revelations about linking US withdrawal from
Vietnam to the US electoral timetable which upset the elder statesman. It is
the presumption that Nixon dared to discuss vital policy with Haldeman, his
chief of staff, rather than Kissinger, the national security adviser.
'Nixon was just blowing off steam rather than changing strategy for Haldeman
was concerned with public relations, not substance, and any change in
strategy would have been discussed with me,' says Kissinger.
The problem is that there is a lot more in the Haldeman diaries about 'K'
than Vietnam strategy, such as his bitter rivalry with Bill Rogers, then
secretary of state, who is still alive. The letters columns threaten to be
compelling reading in the weeks ahead.

Whilst the world's media is focusing on the D-Day ceremonies another group
of veterans slipped into London over the weekend. The big cheeses of the
banking world are in town for a week of conferring and merry-making and
keeping them happy is almost as big a challenge, in terms of logistics and
protocol, as organising the Normandy beach parties.
Forget Royal Ascot, Wimbledon and Henley. The highlight of the summer season
for a banker is the International Monetary Conference where the bosses of
the top banks hob-nob with central bankers behind closed doors whilst their
spouses hit the tourist sights.
Hosting an IMC meeting is the banking equivalent of winning the Olympics.
Last year Stockholm did it, and it was Seattle's turn this year. But London
jumped the queue because the IMC wanted to honour the tercentenary of the
Bank of England with its presence.
London's bankers have responded magnificently. The Bank of England has laid
on a concert (including a specially commissioned Geoffrey Burgon number) and
NatWest chairman Lord Alexander has got the Queen and her husband to throw a
cocktail party at Buckingham Palace. Bankers are even being allowed to turn
up in lounge suits.
However, the British hosts are not allowing standards to slip too far. Not
only are they insisting on a proper seating plan for the dinner at
Whitehall's Banqueting House but they're also presenting each delegate with
a special gift from Garrard &amp; Co, the Crown jewellers - a silver spoon. How
very appropriate.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Brinkmanship over Korea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis over North Korea's suspected covert nuclear weapons programme is
entering a new and dangerous phase. This week the UN Security Council may
move towards imposing economic sanctions on Pyongyang for impeding
International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities.
North Korea, which has always said it would regard sanctions as an act of
war, may withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in
protest.
As international crises go, this must rank among the most frustrating. On
the one hand, the issues it raises are of immense significance; on the
other, the record does not suggest there is much the rest of the world,
faced with a regime as erratic and mysterious as that in Pyongyang, can do
peacefully to resolve it.
If North Korea is allowed to develop an atomic bomb, the reverberations will
be felt for years. In Asia, Japan would be tempted to review its
constitutional aversion to nuclear weapons, prompting an inevitable
resurgence of old regional insecurities. In the world at large, the campaign
to prevent the further spread of such weapons - now focused on the
prospective renewal of the NPT in 1995 - would suffer a blow from which it
might not recover.
Carrots and sticks
Thus for the past 18 months, Washington has been busily waving carrots and
sticks to persuade Pyongyang to open up its nuclear programme to inspection.
So far, the carrots - principally offers of international recognition - have
been to the fore, on the theory that the North Korean regime, fearing for
its survival, was using the possibility of an A-bomb to extract political
concessions from the west. The events of the past week - with the IAEA
saying it could no longer reliably ascertain whether nuclear materials from
North Korea's Yongbyon reactor had been diverted to weapons production -
have tipped the balance towards the stick of eventual trade sanctions.
The west probably has no alternative now but to call North Korea's bluff and
proceed towards imposing some form of sanctions if it is to prevent further
erosion of the NPT's credibility. But if so, it should hasten slowly, with
the clearest of objectives and with the fullest awareness of the pitfalls.
First, the US needs to strain every sinew to retain the co-operation of the
regional players. South Korea and Japan both support sanctions with varying
measures of enthusiasm and likely effectiveness. But to render an embargo
even partly effective, China - a nominal ally and North Korea's biggest
source of imported fuel and grain - will also need to be persuaded not to
veto a sanctions resolution.
Quiet persuasion
That argues for continuing to play the issue long, and for giving Beijing
ample opportunity to demonstrate that its preferred strategy of quiet
persuasion can work. In particular, any measures should be preceded by an
ultimatum giving North Korea a deadline to open up to inspection the two
suspected nuclear waste sites at Yongbyon that now constitute the sole
verifiable clue to the nature of its nuclear programme.
Second, the western powers should not lose sight of the continuing need to
offer Pyongyang diplomatic escape routes. In this respect, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's suggestion of a conference involving the two Koreas, the US,
Russia, China and Japan would be worth considering. Such an initiative's
chances of success would admittedly be slim. But only if all efforts to
engage North Korea are shown to have been exhausted will it make sense
actually to use the sanctions ratchet.
Third, the west should recognise that North Korea's isolation is already
intense, and that an unduly precipitate move to isolate it further could
provide a desperate regime with either an alibi for its own economic
failings or a convenient distraction in conflict.
The US clearly needs to maintain its military umbrella over South Korea and
to warn the North that if it initiates hostilities it will face immediate
destruction. But war on the Korean peninsula, with or without nuclear
weapons, is in no one's interests. The west should beware of inadvertently
suggesting to the paranoid regime in Pyongyang that it has no way out but
through waging one.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The Schneider imbroglio
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, a
leading French electrical engineering company, must be troubling many other
top executives in Europe. Mr Pineau-Valencienne has spent the past 10 days
in a Belgian jail, after travelling to Brussels to make an ostensibly
routine statement concerning an official investigation into two of
Schneider's local subsidiaries. By all accounts, he seems likely to face a
long and difficult legal battle.
The incident has some of the nightmare qualities of The Bonfire of Vanities,
the 1980s novel about the downfall of a wealthy New York investment banker
trapped by an unforgiving legal system. It has outraged the French business
establishment and unleashed a wave of defensive nationalism in Belgium.
Beyond that, it points to hitherto unsuspected risks in doing business
across borders. If this can happen to the head of one of France's biggest
companies, is anybody safe?
There are obvious limits to generalising from a case in which formal charges
have yet to be brought, and about which many details remain murky. It does
seem clear, however, that events would not have reached this stage if
Belgium's financial markets were more effectively policed. The case grew out
of court actions by former minority shareholders in the two Schneider
subsidiaries, alleging that the French group undervalued their stakes when
it bought them out in 1992. Proper regulation would have made it more likely
that such allegations could have been dealt with at the time.
Shareholders' rights
That Belgian minority shareholders have begun to assert their rights more
aggressively is partly a reaction to the raw deal they have traditionally
received. In an effort to redress the balance, they were recently allowed
greater recourse to national courts. However, that decision has been
criticised for calling into question the role of the Commission Bancaire and
Financiere, the already weak regulatory authority.
Though some regulatory reforms were introduced after the bitter battle in
1988 for control of Belgium's Societe Generale holding company, they were
timid. Authorities now recognise that more needs to be done, particularly to
ensure proper disclosure and equal treatment of shareholders in takeovers.
The Schneider case should encourage them swiftly to set their house in
order.
The case also raises a second, broader, issue. The Schneider investigation
is examining whether other financial and fiscal irregularities occurred at
the two subsidiaries, which Mr Pineau-Valencienne chairs. However, no
evidence has yet been produced that he personally ordered, or was aware of,
any illegal activities. In its absence, is it right that he should be made
to carry the can?
Personal liability
Some European legal systems already hold chief executives personally liable
for certain types of corporate violations, notably of health and safety
laws. Such sanctions undoubtedly concentrate minds. But they seem unduly
onerous. No senior manager can be fully-informed about every aspect of his
business. Still less so, when companies are increasingly diversifying
globally and decentralising authority from head office to often far-flung
subsidiaries.
A more difficult question arises where a company's culture, or the style of
the chief executive, encourage those at lower levels to cut corners or even
to break the law. In such cases, statutory penalties on individual top
managers might act as a deterrent. But they could just as easily lead to
more energetic efforts to conceal wrongdoing in erring companies, while
unnecessarily inhibiting managers in law-abiding ones.
In the longer run, the most effective checks are those which companies
impose on themselves: rigorous internal audit systems, codes of conduct and
scrupulous monitoring by supervisory boards or independent non-executive
directors. These are more likely to be encouraged by regulatory systems
which require fairness and transparency in corporate dealings than by
statutory sledgehammers. Whatever the outcome of the Schneider case, it
should give companies and governments across Europe a powerful incentive to
examine how well they match up against these objectives.

FT  06 JUN 94 / A layman's guide to US Fed policy: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to find rational explanations for the height of bond yields in
Europe where unemployment averages about 11 per cent. But the direction of
movement is determined by events in the US, where the risk of inflation is
greater because the business cycle is further advanced.
The key to understanding bond markets thus lies in grasping the modus
operandi of the US Federal Reserve, which triggered the global rise in
yields by starting to tighten monetary policy in early February, sooner than
many investors expected. The Fed has not fully explained the principles that
govern its decisions, but it appears to have two main criteria for action:
Rule one. The Fed will raise short-term rates if economic growth appears
likely to exceed an annual rate of 2 1/2 -3 per cent, the rate it deems
sustainable in the longer-term.
This rule was made clear in the minutes, released last month, of the March
meeting of the Fed's policy-making open market committee. The Fed said it
was aiming for a 'neutral' monetary policy. It defined this not in terms of
a target real interest rate but rather as a monetary stance that would
achieve 'sustained non-inflationary expansion consistent with the economy's
potential'. What is this? Well, the labour force is growing at an annual
rate of about 1.3 per cent and Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, believes
productivity is growing at about 1.5 per cent. Potential non-inflationary
growth is thus 2 1/2 -3 per cent. The Fed will raise rates to whatever level
is required to prevent growth exceeding this rate.
Rule two. The Fed will raise short-term rates if inflation shows any sign of
rising above the current level of just under 3 per cent.
Mr Greenspan spelled this out in his May 27 testimony to the Senate banking
committee. 'If we are successful in our current endeavours, there will not
be an increase in overall inflation, and trends toward price stability will
be extended.' In the written statement, the word 'not' is underlined.
Observers should ponder this commitment carefully because most seem to
assume that US inflation will be permitted to drift higher, say to 3 1/2 -4
per cent. Mr Greenspan is saying, in effect, that this will happen only over
his dead body.
What do these rules tell us about past and prospective Fed policy? The
lifting of short-term rates from 3 per cent to 4 1/4 per cent was an
application of rule one. The Fed was not responding to actual evidence of
higher inflation but was rather trying to reduce growth, from an
unsustainable annual rate of 4-5 per cent in the second half of last year.
It also wanted to prick a speculative bubble in financial asset prices
caused by its own failure to heed good advice - for example the plea to
raise rates last September from monetarist economists led by Professor Allan
Meltzer of Carnegie-Mellon University.
The perception that policies inspired by rule one are having the desired
effect explains the revival of confidence in the US bond market  - most
evident in Friday's rally despite news of a fall in the jobless rate to 6
per cent ('full employment' in many economists' eyes). The market took that
number in its stride partly because labor department officials hinted it was
probably an aberration and partly because other recent data appear to point
to a modest deceleration in economic growth.
Housing starts and home sales are down from the peaks hit late last year.
Growth of consumer spending seems to be declining after several strong
quarters, partly because mortgage refinancing is no longer providing much
impetus. Factory orders and the Purchasing Managers Index - guides to the
health of manufacturing industry - appear to be stabilising, albeit at
robust levels. And the payroll side of Friday's ambiguous employment report
pointed to a somewhat slower pace of job creation.
It would be dangerous, however, to conclude that the Fed has done enough to
reduce US growth to a sustainable 2 1/2 -3 per cent. Lulls occur in all
business cycles. There is no evidence that interest rates are yet high
enough to deter business investment, one of the engines of this recovery.
Growth will probably accelerate again later this year as consumers get a
second wind and as economic recovery in the rest of the world stimulates US
exports. When Mr Greenspan said he had substantially withdrawn the monetary
accommodation prevailing last year, he did not mean to imply rates had
reached an equilibrium level. As he hinted on May 27, the right inference
was that 'the degree and frequency of tightening' might be less in the
future.
Even if growth does decline to a sustainable rate, rule two may come into
play. The leading index of inflation compiled by researchers at Columbia
University - one of the best available - surged in May, having risen
continuously for eight months. Key components - such as industrial material
prices - point unequivocally to an upturn in inflation this autumn. If the
price data do indeed deteriorate, the Fed will tighten again regardless of
growth trends.
None of this necessarily spells doom for bond markets. Long yields of about
7.5 per cent in the US, and higher in most European markets, should provide
a cushion against future shocks. Indeed, the most disturbing event for
investors would not be a further increase in US short term rates, but a
perception that the Fed was again behind events because it was failing to
heed its own monetary logic.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Fox among the television giants: Martin Dickson and Raymond
Snoddy say Murdoch is taking on the big US broadcasters - and making gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coming this autumn from Fox Broadcasting, America's upstart fourth
television network: a new comedy series Hardball, which promises to take a
'rowdy, locker room look' at a baseball team, led by a 'no-nonsense'
manager, which will try anything and everything to make it into the big
league.
Mr Rupert Murdoch, Fox's own no-nonsense boss, is playing a real-life game
of hardball as he tries to push the company into the US broadcasting big
league, alongside the established network trio of CBS, ABC and NBC.
Last December he shook the television establishment when he won an auction
to broadcast for the next four years American football games featuring one
of the two leagues, the National Football Conference. Fox bid Dollars 1.6bn,
more than Dollars 400m higher than CBS, which has shown NFC games for almost
40 years.
Two weeks ago Mr Murdoch followed that up with another shocker: 12
television stations owned by media group New World Communications are to
shift affiliation from the big three to Fox, broadcasting its national
programming along with their own local content.
Once again, the main victim is CBS - the number one network in the US
audience ratings for the past three years - which is losing eight affiliates
to Fox.
A change of loyalties by 12 stations may not sound particularly dramatic,
given that the big three networks have nearly 650 affiliates between them.
But a switch of this magnitude is extremely unusual - Mr Murdoch claims it
is unprecedented - and it could have a far-reaching impact on the US
broadcasting industry.
It is likely to set off a struggle for affiliate loyalty between CBS, NBC
and ABC. It could also prompt CBS to review its strategy of remaining a
one-medium broadcaster at a time when NBC and ABC have diversified into
cable. Some observers suggest Mr Laurence Tisch, CBS chairman, might even
consider merging the group with another entertainment company.
But the most immediate effect of the New World deal is to give a big boost
to Fox's credibility. It marks a milestone in Mr Murdoch's efforts to build
it into the leading network in the US. 'Partly as a result of this and
partly what was going on already you will see another six or eight VHF
stations joining our line-up between now and Christmas,' Mr Murdoch says.
Fox has come a remarkably long way since 1987, when Mr Murdoch launched the
network with two nights a week of programming and just over 100 affiliates,
many of them small, independent stations broadcasting on UHF frequencies,
which are less powerful than the VHF signals used by the stations which
dominate most big US cities.
The latest deal was typical Murdoch opportunism. New World approached
Murdoch about making programmes together for daytime schedules and launching
them across half the US. 'Then the conversation led into this rather bigger
deal and it was all done in three weeks,' Mr Murdoch says.
Fox, however, is still far from achieving Mr Murdoch's ambitions. In the
broadcasting season that ended in April, the market research agency Nielsen
gave it a rating of 7.2 in the prime evening television hours, far behind
NBC with 11, ABC with 12.4 and CBS with 14. (Each rating point represents
942,000 viewing households.)
Fox only began broadcasting seven nights a week last year. It has no
national news service and it only broadcasts 15 hours of prime time
programming a week - made either in-house or under contract - compared to
the big three's 22 hours.
Last year Wall Street began questioning whether Fox might be running out of
steam. Its prime time ratings dipped for the second year running and two of
the network's most important creators - Mr Barry Diller and Mr Jamie Kellner
 -had quit the group.
Mr Murdoch's recent coups have dispelled much of the scepticism. Capturing
the NFC contract gives Fox its first big scheduled sports programming. He
will almost certainly lose money on transmission of the games - as CBS did
when it aired them - but since winning the NFC contract Fox's number of
affiliates has risen from 138 to 184, though 34 of the new stations are
partial affiliates, interested mainly in feeds of the NFC games. By
comparison, ABC has 227 affiliates, NBC 213 and CBS 206. The deal with New
World will not add to the network's number of affiliates, since the stations
are in cities where Fox already has an outlet, which it will now discard.
The importance of the deal is that it will substantially increase Fox's
reach in the 12 markets - which include important cities such as Detroit,
Dallas and Atlanta - because the New World stations are high powered VHF
ones, while those Fox is discarding are UHF ones.
Fox reckons its prime time ratings will improve by 40 per cent in the cities
involved, though observers suggest a 20 per cent improvement. CBS will
probably try to steal the VHF affiliates of NBC and ABC in cities where it
has lost stations, rather than settling for Fox's UHF cast-offs. That in
turn could unsettle the financial relationship between the networks and
affiliates which has long underpinned the US television industry.
The networks make much of their money from selling advertising space during
the national programming they supply to their affiliates. The affiliates
make their profits from selling local advertising, but they also get paid
'compensation' by the networks for carrying national programming.
To win new affiliates the networks may now need to increase compensation,
buy additional stations outright or emulate Fox and take minority financial
stakes in some. Mr Howard Stringer, who heads the CBS network, is promising
to 'open the network's wallet' to replace defectors. The Big Three may also
have to make the timing of programmes more flexible to accommodate
affiliates' demands for local advertising slots.
Yet in spite of such constraints on its rivals, Fox still faces big
challenges. The Federal Communications Commission, the regulator, is looking
into a complaint that Fox's ownership of six television stations - the basis
of its network - violates federal laws prohibiting foreigners from owning
more than 25 per cent of a broadcast outlet.
Mr Murdoch, who changed from Australian to US citizenship in the 1980s to
build his television empire, holds 76 per cent of the voting power in the
company that owns Fox's stations, but News Corporation, his publicly quoted
Australian company, holds more than 90 per cent of the equity. News Corp
said on Friday the ownership structure has not changed since permission was
first given in 1985. The minority stake Fox is taking in New World seems
certain to produce fresh complaints from rivals that Mr Murdoch is
exploiting loopholes in the law.
With the ratings slip of the past two years, Fox also has to prove that it
can keep producing fresh programmes, introduce some national news content to
its service and extend its appeal among older Americans. The New World deal
may be the first step towards 'relaunching our late night programming, maybe
national news, certainly daytime programming,' Mr Murdoch says.
All four networks also face competition for viewers and affiliates from two
networks being put together by Warner Brothers and Paramount Pictures, the
Hollywood film and television studios.
Whatever the outcome of this struggle, the money flowing into broadcasting
shows that some very canny entertainment industry investors disagree with
the widespread idea that cable television is gradually killing off the
networks. Mr Murdoch says: 'All four (networks) will survive and do very
well. We'll be the most economic way for mass marketers to reach the
American public and that will remain so for a very long time.' He is putting
a great deal of money where his mouth is.

FT  06 JUN 94 / The 'policy is dead' theory arrives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not long ago, I heard a Labour economist peer outflanking the most extreme
free market advocates by declaring that national economic policy was dead.
His argument was that, in a world of completely free capital movements,
governments and central banks were not able to make independent decisions on
the virtues of alternative macroeconomic policies.
There are two ways of looking at such a world. One is to cry: 'Woe, woe,
woe. Governments are at the mercy of the financial markets and all
possibility of rational policy is dead unless we have world government, and
perhaps not even then.' But there is an alternative, more optimistic,
response. It is based on the view that attempts to promote output and
employment by artificially low interest rates, budget deficits or other
manipulations will not achieve their objectives but threaten inflation of
the kind which was at its worst in the 1970s and which cannot be corrected
without a painful recession. The financial markets, on this view, cut short
the whole malignant process by making it impossible for national authorities
to inflate in the first place.
This can be illustrated by events in the last year and a half. As the chart
shows, the whole UK yield curve fell in the course of 1993, not only because
of cuts in official short-term interest rates but because of much-reduced
expectations about inflation in the longer term. Since then, however,
greater pessimism - or realism - has returned. There have been similar
developments in other centres; and there is now a steep upwardyield curve,
which is itself making for dearer money throughout the world.
On any interpretation, the market has behaved in such a way as to make more
inflationary policies difficult to follow, whatever the urge to do so. The
check works through several channels. Obviously, a fall of many billions in
the value of bonds itself reduces the propensity to spend because wealth is
reduced. This effect is reinforced if equity values fall together with bonds
as they have.
But the correction does not rely on these wealth effects alone (the 1987
Wall Street crash, for example, did not prevent inflationary overheating in
several countries in subsequent years). It also works by inhibiting monetary
policy. A monetary authority that tried to cut short-term interest rates now
would be arguing with the market in a big way. A British chancellor would
find it hard to cut base rates in the face of the present yield curve.
Even if he succeeded for a while, it would not have any worthwhile
stimulative effect. For it would be apparent to any borrower - or pointed
out to him - that the likelihood was that short-term loans would be renewed
at higher and higher rates over the coming months and years.
There are several questions about this apparently beneficent circle. One
would like to know whether it would be as efficient in the face of
deflationary fears of the kind which were rife only a year ago. Clearly,
bond rates would fall; but would they fall enough, and would financial
markets tolerate a large fiscal stimulus if interest rates could not fall
sufficiently to stop a slump?
There are other questions, even in the more conventional context of
containing inflation. Just as the markets are constraining central banks the
latter are also affecting the markets. An important influence on market
behaviour is the belief that the Bundesbank and the Fed will in the end
tighten policy in the face of an inflationary threat; and markets are simply
betting on when this will occur. At present, only the Fed and the Bundesbank
seem able to lead markets in this way; and other central banks have
discretion only about the pace at which they follow.
There are also more technical questions about how far any central bank can
really determine even short-term interest rates. At present, the Bank of
England's influence depends almost entirely on the overnight rates at which
it lends to the money market. Reforms are being studied which might shift
the focus of official policy to one-month interest rates. This would have
the advantage of separating deliberate monetary action from day-to-day moves
to help the banks and discount houses balance their books.
Such reforms would help to clarify policy. But they would not resolve the
question of the central banks' ability to argue with markets if they thought
that the latter were badly misguided. The present mood is not to force the
question to the test.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Reluctant to give up its grip: Stefan Wagstyl explains why
India's government is only slowly shaking up state-owned industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the control room of the Hindustan Fertiliser plant at Haldia near
Calcutta three men watch dials for eight hours a day. When they are
finished, another shift of men in grey uniforms takes over, and then
another, keeping watch 24 hours a day - just as they might in any other
modern chemicals plant.
Except that at Haldia the plant produces nothing. It has produced nothing
since attempts to commission the state-owned complex failed in 1986 because
of fundamental design flaws. Needles on control room dials never move.
Some 1,550 people report for work at Haldia. There is a canteen, a personnel
department, and an accounts department. There are promotions, job changes,
pay rises, audits and in-house trade unions. Engineers, electricians,
plumbers and painters maintain the equipment with a care that is almost
surreal. Signs are freshly-painted, the roads swept and the grass verges
cut.
The absurdity of their position has driven some workers to mental illness.
Many workers have been idle so long they have become unemployable.
The origins of Haldia's failure lie mainly with Mrs Indira Gandhi's
ill-conceived pursuit of economic self-sufficiency in the 1970s: the complex
was built by inexperienced Indian engineers with an inadequate budget and
with insufficient expert foreign supervision.
But the fact that Haldia, which loses about Rs150m (Pounds 3.2m) a year, has
been allowed to survive until the mid-1990s is also a telling criticism of
the present government's reluctance to deal with the legacy of the past.
With prime minister Mr P V Narasimha Rao's economic liberalisation programme
now in its third year, there is still little sign that he will drastically
overhaul the country's bloated publicly-owned industries through
rationalisation, privatisation or the rapid introduction of competition into
state-run monopolies.
The main reason the government fears to act is that serious reform would
mean deep job cuts. India's labour laws give workers an almost impregnable
defence against compulsory dismissal. The insolvency laws are so restrictive
that it takes an average of over 10 years to liquidate a company. A serious
attempt to tackle the labour or insolvency laws would be seen as an attack
on jobs - so Mr Narasimha Rao is understandably reluctant to act,
particularly with the 1996 general election on the political horizon.
Moreover, full-scale privatisation would destroy the network of patronage
which politicians have built throughout the public sector. While the
government is selling shares in 31 state companies, it is committed to
retaining 51 per cent and managerial control. Similarly, where private
companies are being permitted to enter markets dominated by state
monopolies, there is much foot-dragging and back-sliding. Mr Manmohan Singh,
the reform-minded finance minister and his supporters in the government,
know what needs to be done - but the prime minister will not let them act
for fear of political turmoil.
To be fair, the prime minister's quiet approach has yielded some results.
The government has introduced voluntary retirement schemes which are slowly
reducing employment. Total employment in the 237 centrally-controlled
industrial enterprises (excluding state-owned banks and services such as
telecommunications) has dropped from 2.23m in the late 1980s to under 2m.
Government subsidies are also falling, though more slowly than planned. Mr
Manmohan Singh intended to eliminate public financial support for
loss-makers from April 1994. But when the 1994-95 budget was published it
contained another cash injection: Rs6.3bn altogether.
Privatisation may be half-hearted but the entry of strong state-run
companies into the stock market has encouraged investment, including foreign
portfolio investment. It was not a private company but the government's
Videsh Sanchar Nigam, India' international telecommunications monopoly,
which attempted the country's largest Euroissue - USDollars 1bn. The offer
had to be postponed because of the turmoil in world stock markets earlier
this year - but the group is considering a second bid later this year.
Perhaps the government's biggest success in public sector reform has been in
shaking up domestic air travel by permitting the entry of private operators
in late 1992. Their competition has forced great improvements in
time-keeping and quality from Indian Airlines, the state-owned carrier.
But when it comes to other industries, the interests of consumers seem to be
of little account. Indeed, for some government ministers, the fact that the
launch of private air lines has been accompanied by some teething troubles,
including strikes, poaching of staff and arguments over routes, is taken as
a reason for treading carefully in other markets.
Private investment is being allowed in power generation but competition from
private stations will have little effect on existing state-run plants.
Moreover, private companies are mostly being kept out of electricity
distribution, where political patronage is pervasive. Dispensing cheap power
to privileged groups such as farmers is a right few politicians will abandon
lightly.
Mr Rao argues that by deregulating the economy, including liberalising
foreign trade and investment, he has created more than enough opportunities
for private companies without the need for upheavals in the public sector.
But poorly-performing public enterprises impose a heavy burden on the rest
of the economy, not only by siphoning public funds but also by often
providing high-cost, low-quality goods and services. As Mr Aditya Birla,
head of a leading business grouping, says: 'If the public sector is not
competitive, then we can't be either.'
People suffer as well as companies. Legal job protection extends only to
workers in the public sector and in large privately-owned enterprises -
about 30m people, or 150m with their families out of a total population of
890m. The economic cost of providing the safeguards falls on other Indians,
many of them very poor and permanently jobless.
State-owned units still dominate transport, telecommunications, banking,
oil, electric power and other basic services. They are also important
producers of raw materials. Of the the central government's 237 active
industrial enterprises, 104 lost a total of Rs39.5bn in the year to March
1993. The profits of most of the rest were inadequate - the total return on
capital was just 2.4 per cent.
Hand-outs for loss-making public enterprises contribute to government
borrowing helping to raise the fiscal deficit last year to 7.3 per cent of
GDP. Further support comes from state-controlled financial institutions in
low-cost loans. Also, even though the government has cut import duties and
relaxed internal price controls, the remaining protection is biased towards
protecting public enterprises.
Some state concerns perform well, despite the uncompetitive environment.
Bharat Heavy Electrical, India's dominant maker of generating equipment, has
won export orders, so has the Steel Authority of India, the steelmaker.
Others could join them if they were free to compete, cut costs and run
themselves independently. But Delhi's influence over senior appointments is
stifling - Air India, the international carrier, is one of about 10 big
enterprises currently without a chairman because politicians and bureaucrats
cannot agree on a candidate.
Nevertheless, some enterprises are beyond redemption: obsolete textile
mills, steelworks and bicycle factories as well as fertiliser plants,
including Haldia. The latter is a unit of Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation,
which is one of 49 centrally-run public enterprises referred to the
government's Board for Financial and Industrial Reconstruction, the agency
established to expedite restructuring or liquidation. But only one public,
centrally-run enterprise has ever been recommended for liquidation.
The government hopes that it will avoid big closures until the
newly-liberalised economy grows fast enough to absorb the unemployed -
perhaps in the late 1990s. Even then, ministers will bite the bullet only
under pressure. As Mr P B Krishnaswamy, secretary of the fertilisers
ministry whose responsibilities include Haldia, says: 'This kind of picnic
should not be allowed to go on for ever. But things won't change in this
country unless it's the hard way, through sheer economic compulsion. Until
then, politicians will keep making statements and keep alive the hopes of
the dead.'

FT  06 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Too early to talk of government
victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TINO HERNANDEZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If I were a government minister, I wouldn't be celebrating yet
('Government near victory on contracting-out', May 31).
Your correspondent, David Goodhart, normally the most reliable of
authorities, fails to report the whole of the story on this occasion.
While it is true that the European Commission is considering amending the
Acquired Rights Directive, the law which protects workers' terms and
conditions when their jobs are market tested, the revision, if accepted,
will not have the impact suggested.
I have a copy of the full text of the latest revision of the directive. This
does state that the transfer of only 'part of a business' does not in itself
trigger the regulations, as reported. However, the next sentence qualifies
this by highlighting that the key test is always whether or not 'an economic
entity, which retains its identity' has in fact been transferred.
This is exactly the same test that has been used over the past 18 months in
each of the landmark European Court of Justice cases, which have
demonstrated that workers are protected in virtually any market test or
contracting-out exercise.
Furthermore, while the UK government may wish to see the directive severely
weakened, because of the way it has affected its own market testing
programme, any revision at all of this particular piece of European Union
legislation requires the backing of each member state. This is very unlikely
given the support for the principle of protecting employment rights which
exists among the majority of our European partners.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: World Bank support for Indian
blindness control programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From RICHARD L SKOLNIK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your May 14 article on the World Bank credit to the Indian
National Blindness Control Programme ('World Bank cash to help the blind')
and to Professor R A Weale's letter (May 20). The World Bank agreed to
finance this project at the request of the government of India. Similar
requests from other countries would be welcomed and considered on their own
merits. Cataract blindness constitutes a big public health problem in India.
A disproportionate number of blind people are the rural poor, particularly
women, who have little access to health care. The social and economic
returns of dealing with cataracts in India are very high. In addition, as
the population of India ages, it will be even more important for the country
to have an effective and efficient cataract programme in place.
Projects assisted by the World Bank are prepared and implemented by the
borrowing countries. This project was prepared over two years with the
involvement of local experts, numerous Indian and international voluntary
organisations, the Eye Care Institute of the United States National
Institutes of Health, World Health Organisation, and the Danish Development
Agency (DANIDA). WHO does not implement projects of this type.
Most of the training under the project will be in-service training. The aim
will be to raise the quality and productivity of service providers, as well
as to help train people in surgical techniques using intra-ocular lenses.
Alternative schemes were considered. The project's final design supports a
variety of service delivery models, based on a number of criteria, including
location of the people to be served, size of the problem, availability of
facilities, and availability of trained personnel. Based on the application
of these criteria at the district level, services will be rendered in both
mobile camps and in fixed facilities.
Project implementation will be carefully monitored at the district, state,
and national level. World Bank staff will also review progress against
project objectives through field visits two to three times per year. In
addition, the project will be subjected to big technical reviews by
competent Indian and international experts every two years.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: VSO not an elite scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEN CALDWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart's article 'Army of volunteers may be called up' (June 2)
refers to VSO (Voluntary Service Overseas) as an 'elite scheme . . . for
middle class young people'. If that description was ever accurate, it has
certainly been out of date for some years now. VSO started out as a scheme
for young people, but these days only accepts skilled people aged above 20 -
and up to the age of 70; the average age of a volunteer is now 34, and
nearly 10 per cent of the people now overseas are above 50. Nor, I think,
could it be described simply as 'middle class', since those 1,750 volunteers
include bricklayers, carpenters, technical instructors, water engineers, and
many others who do not necessarily fall into that socio-economic bracket.
Equally importantly, volunteers are not expected to fund themselves; they
receive an allowance equivalent to a local level wage.
VSO is in the business of supplying skills which have been requested by
governments and community organisations in 57 countries, in the pursuit of a
more equitable world. New volunteer schemes would offer complementary rather
than supplementary, opportunities for people in Britain.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hualon textiles plant deal should be
reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES MCADAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Recent coverage of the decision by the European Commission to approve
the award of substantial public funding for the Hualon textiles plant in
Northern Ireland has served to highlight inconsistencies in the policies of
the European and UK authorities.
First, there is a difference of view as to whether there is over-capacity or
not in this sector of trade. Clearly Tim Smith, the UK economy minister for
Northern Ireland, feels that there is unsatisfied, and indeed growing,
demand for the product, whereas the European textile industry believes the
opposite, a position the Commission initially agreed.
Second, the Commission is quoted as saying that the project is of a
low-technology nature, whereas the UK government is saying the opposite.
Third, the project envisages the creation of 1,850 jobs whereas others
contend that this level of employment is improbable. In this regard it is
interesting that Tim Smith, in his detailed contribution to the debate in
the FT ('A respectable and respected public corporation', June 3), makes no
reference to the number of jobs that will be created.
I should emphasise that the British Apparel &amp; Textile Confederation is
strongly supportive of inward investment in the textile industry in all
parts of the UK. However, each case must be judged on its merits and surely,
given the contradictions surrounding the Hualon investment, the whole case
should now be reviewed by both the Commission and the Industrial Development
Board before contracts are signed.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts: Don Quixote is sadly well off tilt - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Remote and ineffectual Don' wrote Hilaire Belloc - in different
circumstances, certainly, but under no less real provocation. The Royal
Ballet has marked its return to Covent Garden after an American jaunt by
offering us Don Quixote. Is it bravado, menopausal caprice, desperation,
that dictated this choice? The staging is wrong on every count. Text, score,
performances, design, are equally dreadful, equally guilty in deforming a
jolly old ballet and showing the company at a total loss, facing drama and
dance with the desperate air of people trying to cope with a plague of
hornets.
Nothing must save this insolently inadequate production from the breaker's
yard, although on Saturday night Sylvie Guillem seized gladly upon it as a
show-case for her best qualities. That, in the process, her performance -
witty, exultantly brilliant, amused and amusing - made the rest of the cast
look even more funereal, like a convention of disaffected corpse-washers and
plague-nurses, is no surprise. She darted and flirted, cut every step with
exactly the right sophistication (how dowdy our local misses looked by
contrast) and enjoyed herself hugely. So did we - when she was on stage.
Mlle Guillem understands how much too far to go in galvanising a ballet
which must be lit by a kind of charming sauciness in step and in playing.
Russian ballerinas - Plisetskaya, Maximova, Kurgapkina, Semenyaka - have
taken this choreography and by their own pleasure in the piece have fired
their colleagues to join in the fun. Mlle Guillem did her very best on
Saturday night, and her partner, Oliver Matz from Berlin, matched her in
vivacity, but they could not strike sparks from the dank activities
surrounding them. I do not think I have ever seen the Royal Ballet look less
like a national ensemble: muffed dancing (the matadors in the first act on
desperate form; the Queen of the Dryads and her girls trudging through their
dances; mimsiness of style an epidemic), and comedy that was about as
amusing as a baby's coffin.
Matz, returning as a guest partner for Mlle Guillem, provided breezy
virtuosity, and made Basilio unabashedly cheerful - there's little else to
do with the role - with a neat line in groping during his supposed
death-scene (albeit this Kitri knew how to keep him under control). The only
other performance worth considering is that of the mysterious drunk, master
of tremulous balance, who skirts the edges of the stage in Act 1. He is
funny, which no-one else in the ensemble remotely is, but entirely
unconnected with Petipa's Don Quixote. He is, unjustly, not identified in
the programme.
Don Quixote is in repertory at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts: Danger of linking life and art - Jackie Wullschlager
argues against one move for political correctness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Nous Accusons]' began the letter sent to critics covering the recent Dublin
Pinter Festival. The Daughters of Eve, a feminist group which gives its
address as the University of Southern California, announced the forthcoming
trial of three writers: Harold Pinter, John Osborne and Ted Hughes. Their
crimes? 'Fatal damage' to three women - Vivien Merchant, Jill Bennett and
Sylvia Plath, all of whom died, two by suicide and one of alcoholism, after
broken marriages with the writers.
'Age has withered their talent,' says the letter of Pinter, Osborne and
Hughes, 'but the continuity of their spite, damage, self-seeking is so far
unbroken.' Although a feminist trial of Harold Pinter is as offensive to
most people as the Islamic fatwa against Salman Rushdie, the Daughters of
Eve - who see art as an extension of personality - reflect a wider shift
towards the politicisation of an artist's life.
'Perfection of the life, or of the work?' Yeats once asked. When he wrote,
few readers cared about the facts of the writer's existence. In the past 15
years, however, there has been a surge of literary biographies and an
explosion of interest, which is changing the fundamental way we think about
the relation between life and art.
'Biography is listening to backstairs comment and reading people's mail,'
says Janet Malcolm, whose controversial book The Silent Woman, about the
battle between Hughes and the 'cultist' biographers who see Sylvia Plath as
a feminist martyr, has just been published in the US. Last year, after
Andrew Motion's biography of Philip Larkin, and the publication of Larkin's
own letters, revealed racist attitudes - 'too many fucking niggers around' -
and sexist tastes - a penchant for schoolgirl bondage - there were calls for
his poems to be banned.
To trace this movement is to see a cloud of censorship emerging from our
most liberal and individualistic traditions. In an individualistic society,
it is natural that the writer becomes the celebrity, almost a consumer icon,
as well as in some sense our representative - an Everyman whose life tells
us about our own. Hence the bestselling status of recent biographies such as
Richard Ellmann's Oscar Wilde or Victoria Glendinning's Trollope. And in a
culture which flatters itself on its lack of repression it is also
inevitable that we assume the writer's private life, like his work, is our
public property.
In so far as this effects our aesthetic responses, it is usually to enrich
them - most literature is grounded in personal experience, and is a better
read when we know what that experience was. But recently other cultural
trends have come into play - political correctness, the tendency to
conformism, to simplify and to be over-literal. Together, these encourage a
conflation of an artist's life and work, and the passing of an inappropriate
moral judgment on both.
There are the modern giants whose books we are constantly trying to explain,
but who are above moral criticism, such as Joyce. His books are driven by
personal experience. When he wanted to write about infidelity, he covertly
urged his wife Nora towards an affair, but she saw through him. 'Jim wants
me to go with other men so that he can write about it,' she explained baldly
to the suitor he found for her, 'but I want only him.' Brenda Maddox's Nora
is a model of a biography which illuminates Joyce's work through a
fascinating account of two lives.
But at the other end of the spectrum are the more recent authors whose lives
happen to embody current political myths. The hijacking of Sylvia Plath, who
gassed herself in 1963 leaving bread and milk by her sleeping children, as
an early feminist icon, has prevented serious evaluation of her work beyond
those terms. Thus Ronald Hayman's 1991 study reads like a detective story
('had there been a suicide note? What had it said? . . . was it true that a
doll had been found . . . with pins stuck into it?') in which Plath's poems
are used to solve questions about her life.
Where Plath is the good girl, Larkin is the bad guy in the new Life stakes.
But both are badly served because appreciation of their work risks being
subsumed into tokenism. So when Larkin began to be seen - retrospectively -
as politically incorrect, a flurry of critics who had previously been
respectful suddenly called him a minor poet and there was a new hint of
dismissal from the literary establishment. This trend is not limited to the
literary world. Something similar happened, to the popular reputation of
Woody Allen; many fans vowed never to see another movie after revelations
that Allen had betrayed Mia Farrow for her adopted daughter.
Here is ideological revisionism in strong new form. It is a fearful and
irrational interpretation of the link between life and art. It masks an
intolerance of those we don't agree with, the suspicion of what is not the
moral fashion of the day. Enjoyment of Larkin's poetry or Allen's films does
not depend on the moral purity of their creators.
'Women who assist in realising the fantasies of Pinter/Osborne/Hughes in any
medium are in complicity with them and their crime,' say the Daughters of
Eve. But fantasies are not separatist sub-committees, and you can't
legislate over artistic inspiration, which is an haphazard, sub-conscious
amoral affair. Andrew Motion defends Larkin by saying that 'art exists at a
crucial distance from its creator'. Art is timeless and universal, and means
different things to different people in different ages, whereas an artist's
life is conditioned by his time, and by the morality of the moment when we
interpret it.
It may be true that Osborne has exploited his public image as the angry
young man of his plays and that this has made his later writing immature,
self-indulgent, vacuous: a casualty of his and our cult of the artist. But
William Burroughs is an equally powerful case: a writer whose morality few,
in any age, would share. He really did kill his wife - he shot her dead at a
party - yet the tragedy then inspired one of his best works, the magical
lyrics for the rock musical The Black Rider, about a marksman who shoots his
lover. The piece opened in 1990, and, as the most innovative of recent
musicals, has been a popular hit across Europe, while some of the poetry -
'I'll shoot the moon out of the sky for you' - seems likely to last beyond
its commercial success.
Artists rarely lead lives which we would call normal; how ironic, in our
tolerant, post-Freudian society, to criticise their work because they fail
an emotional health test. Artists have always stood on the edge of society:
loners like Larkin or radicals like Pinter or angst-ridden neurotics like
Allen. The paradox is that, from this position as outsiders they distil, in
art, experiences which we can all share - they touch the loner, the radical,
the neurotic in all of us. If we allow the straightjacket of conformity or
political correctness to tighten, we risk losing the richness of such
vision. It is an absurd and horrific form of censorship.

Reporters on local newspapers spend their lives doodling in their notebooks

session; and urging the secretary of the WI to remember who won the 'Most

when Michael Palin finally fulfils a boyhood ambition and joins the staff of
the Isle of Wight County Press, what is his first assignment? Occult
rituals, of course. Still, Palin is an engaging presenter and director Roger
Mills has a good track record, so Palin's Column should be entertaining
(8.00 C4). BBC1 fights D-Day all over again, with a two-hour slab in the

with a 60-minute 'nostalgic tribute' of words and music called We'll Meet

which Sue Lawley presents the news of 50 years ago today as though it were

FT  06 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Moore inherits stirred pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pity Eugene Freedman, writes Richard Waters. The chairman of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand in the US since 1991, he has had a lot to contend with: a weak
economy in which many companies cut spending on accountancy and consulting
services, sagging profitability and the need (never popular in a
partnership) to slash partner numbers. An abrasive style didn't help, making
him many enemies inside the firm.
Life should be easier for Nicholas Moore, the man just elected by Coopers'
partners to take over when Freedman retires in October. A 52-year-old
Californian, Moore has an altogether more diplomatic manner. Refusing to be
bounced into commenting on Freedman's style, he will say only: 'He stirred
the pot, and we will be forever grateful to him for making some difficult
decisions.'
With the US economy now growing strongly again, Coopers' revenues are up
around 8 per cent in the current financial year (which ends in September),
double the rate of growth of a year before, says Moore. 'Business is looking
better than it has for a number of years, especially in the consulting
line.'
For Moore, the first and most important job will be to rebuild morale. 'The
downsizing has had some impact on the psychology of partners,' he says. 'My
number one objective is to rally partners and move them forward.'

FT  06 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Ellwood marks Visa's card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another leading figure from the UK retail banking industry has emerged at
the top of an international payment organisation, writes Richard Waters.
Earlier this year, Gene Lockhardt took over as chief executive of
MasterCard. An American, Lockhardt was behind the launch of Midland Bank's
First Direct, which pioneered telephone banking in the UK.
Now Peter Ellwood (below), former boss of Barclaycard, has been selected as
part-time chairman of Visa, the big brother of the payment organisations.
The choice of Ellwood - presently chief executive of the TSB Group - hints
at where the future of Visa may lie. In 1989, exactly half of all payments
made through the system were in the US; last year, that had slipped to 42
per cent.
Over the same period, the European share climbed three points, to 34 per
cent. Though growth in plastic payments in Europe has sagged with its
economies, it still presents a better medium-term growth prospect for the
payment organisations.
Ed Jensen, Visa's chief executive, seemed to acknowledge as much, paying
tribute to Ellwood's 'vast European experience'. A little-noticed
announcement the same day confirmed it; Visa, it said, was setting up its
first European product development office, to tailor its products for the
European market.
Ellwood's selection, after seven years under Henry Benacerraf, president of
the Banco Union of Venezuela, completes a sweep of Visa's top echelon.
Jensen himself took over from ten-year veteran Charles Russell earlier this
year, while Carl Pascarella was only recently selected to head the US
operation, where Visa has been losing ground to MasterCard.

FT  06 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): 'Hopeless romantic' for Seagram
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edgar Bronfman Jr epitomises both the benefits and the drawbacks of being
born into a rich and powerful business family, writes Bernard Simon. Without
his lineage, it is doubtful whether Bronfman could have rocketed from being
a New York high-school drop-out set on a career in film-making and
song-writing, to chief executive of one of the world's biggest beverage
companies at the age of 39.
Bronfman replaced his father, Edgar Sr, as ceo of The Seagram Company last
week. But having reached the top, he now faces the tough task of proving
that he deserves to be there.
Outsiders can be forgiven for wondering whether show business remains
Bronfman's first love. Several of his closest friends are from the
entertainment world, as was his first wife. 'Beneath a veneer of reserve,
Edgar Bronfman Jr is a hopeless romantic,' observed a recent profile in New
Yorker magazine.
The depth of Bronfman's attachment to Hollywood has become relevant since he
spearheaded Seagram's purchase over the past 16 months of a 14.9 per cent
stake in Time Warner, the entertainment and communications conglomerate. He
asserted last week that 'the reason for Seagram's interest in Time Warner
had nothing whatsoever to do with my personal ambitions beyond my role as a
steward for Seagram's shareholders'. Seagram insists that it has no plans to
raise its Time Warner stake beyond 15 per cent. 'There is nothing wrong, in
my view, with anyone being interested in what is clearly the
fastest-growing, most global industry in North America,' Bronfman said.
Seagram has been a Bronfman family business since 1928. Edgar Bronfman Sr,
who turns 65 later this month, remains chairman and his brother Charles
co-chairmen. Edgar Jr's elder brother Sam heads Seagram's US wine division.
But the new ceo is also expected to lean heavily on a number of non-family
members in Seagram's upper ranks. The most influential is Stephen Banner, a
New York lawyer hired three years ago as Seagram's senior executive
vice-president.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Chinese accidents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More attention to safety has been ordered by Chinese civil aviation
officials after dozens of near-accidents have been reported so far this
year.
The China News Service said yesterday that 'several tens' of near-accidents
had occurred, including aircraft going off the runway or landing at an
angle, aircraft wings brushing and engines 'stopping in mid-air'.
China's airlines have been trying to improve their reputation after a
succession of crashes in 1992 and 1993 killed nearly 400 people. The
government regulatory body, the Civil Aviation Administration of China,
announced plans late last year to improve maintenance and safety training.

Public order in Albania has improved but the Foreign Office advises that it
is best to have a guide outside of Tirana, the capital.
Health risks are high and medical facilities are poor. Hepatitis A and B are
particular problems.
Petrol stations can be few and far between and visitors using private cars
are advised to have full jerrycans on long journeys. Spare parts are in

FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Bangladeshi strikes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition parties may continue to call strikes at short notice in
Bangladesh and visitors may find travelling around the country even more
difficult than usual.
Strikes can suspend normal business throughout the country and make
travelling hazardous. People ignoring strikes can become targets for
violence and cars or buses may be damaged or destroyed.
There has been a marked increase in night - time armed banditry on main
roads between large towns in recent weeks and travel is not recommended
after dark.

<TEXT>
Visitors to remote parts of Taiwan this week should contact its embassies if
they are concerned about any repercussions of the strong earthquake,
measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, which shook the island yesterday, writes
Lisa Wood.
The earthquake killed at least one person, injured two, and triggered a
landslide in the northeast of the island and a fire in Taipei.
The quake, centred near the coast about 34km south of the northeastern
county of Ilan, shook buildings in Taipei and other cities.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Avoidance tactics in Manila
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It does not take long for visitors to Manila to realise they have arrived in
one of Asia's most violent societies.
Uniformed men brandishing pump-action shotguns stand guard outside
high-street banks. Bars and restaurants remind patrons not to carry guns
inside. A sign on the door of one bistro in the Philippine capital's main
business district says politely: 'Kindly endorse your deadly weapons to the
house detective.'
The reputation of the Philippines for violence is well-founded. But as in
Washington or Bangkok, the victims of shootings or kidnappings are usually
local residents, rather than visitors.
Nevertheless, foreigners should be cautious when arriving at the Ninoy
Aquino International Airport. Visitors have faced demands for money from
corrupt customs officials or been robbed by rogue taxi-drivers. The safest
bet is to take a car provided by your hotel (they leave from the 'hotel
counter' outside the terminal) or an Avis limousine.
Other hazards include sophisticated conmen (and women) who invite you to
drink a cup of coffee or Coca-Cola, into which they pour a soporific drug;
victims of this method of robbery, also used in Singapore and Bangkok, wake
up hours later without their wallets, if they wake up at all.
Yet everyday life in the traffic-clogged streets of the townships that make
up Metro-Manila is generally peaceful. Makati, the business district, is
particularly clean and safe.
A penchant for guns is only one aspect of a society that has absorbed much
from the US and Spain, its two colonial powers. The 'Jeepney', the
ubiquitous, workshop-assembled vehicle, is loosely based on the front end of
the US wartime Jeep. Festooned with baubles, bright lights and Catholic
slogans, it is used for both private and public transport.
A refreshing change from some other parts of Asia is the variety of
newspapers. You can usually find something entertaining to read in a traffic
jam, while wondering whether you dare roll down the window and give money to
the street children tapping on the roof of your taxi.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Free flights of fancy - Jenny Luesby
examines the prospects for Air Miles now that BA owns the scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an office in Crawley, Sussex, that deals in dream tickets. Every
day it books 2,000 of them, free, to destinations all over the world.
The Air Miles company last year had a turnover estimated at Pounds 60m. Yet
last month, Mr Keith Mills and Mr Liam Cowdrey, the creators of Air Miles,
sold their 49 per cent stake in Air Miles Travel Promotions to British
Airways, which now owns the whole scheme.
The administration of the scheme is complex. Companies pay the Air Miles
company for vouchers; it pays British Airways for flights; British Airways
earns revenue on its unfilled seats; companies offering Air Miles increase
their market share; and customers - who save up points through the vouchers
 -get free flights.
The appeal for BA may lie in the fact that only 8 per cent of the British
population has begun to collect Air Miles. The rise has been rapid - for a
product dreamt up seven years ago on a train from London to Liverpool - but
the potential is huge.
In Canada, unlike in the UK, an Air Miles scheme launched two years ago does
not include a frequent-flyer scheme, where regular travellers are awarded
bonus flights. But Air Miles are now being collected by 37 per cent of
Canadians.
BA aims to invest heavily in attracting loyalty among general consumers,
with Air Miles issued against an increasing range of products. The scheme is
exclusive to companies within a product area - with, for example, only one
petrol retailer or one credit card offering Air Miles. But the variety of
products in the scheme is still narrow.
Air Miles will not renew contracts with companies if it has received
complaints about their quality of service.
There have been fears that growth in Air Miles would be constrained by the
number of empty airline seats. This is not the case, says BA. The 2.75bn Air
Miles held by customers in the UK would fill just 10 per cent of its empty
seats, it says.
Meanwhile, Messrs Mills and Cowdrey have retained their intellectual
copyright, and control over the international operation. In September, they
plan to launch Air Miles in another European country, thought to be the
Netherlands.
'The astonishing thing about Air Miles is that no one has copied it,' says
Mr Mills. 'It has so much more going for it than a standard frequent-flyer
scheme, which incurs all of the cost, but gets none of the revenue for the
airline.'
The use of Air Miles as an incentive for employees is an incidental
sideline, says Mr Mills. Air Miles issued by employers count as a taxable
perk, whereas there are no plans to tax ordinary Air Miles, which are
classed with other consumer incentives such as 10p off, or a free glass.
In the meantime, he says, he still gets a tingle when he sees people at
aiport check-in counters with Air Miles baggage tags. 'First-time users
never cease to be astonished and delighted that it works. There are no
catches, it is easy, they get real tickets and they pay no money,' he says.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Architecture: On show at the RA - the tip of a fascinating
iceberg / Colin Amery reviews work at The Summer Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Architecture is at the centre of things at the Royal Academy Summer
Exhibition this year. Not only do the striking exhibits extend into the
Central Hall so that they are the first things a visitor sees, but they also
occupy a key room that is on everyone's route through the exhibition.
This strong presence of architecture cannot be unconnected with the fact
that the new president of the Royal Academy is Sir Philip Dowson - from the
well known architectural firm of Arup Associates. He has clearly brought a
discerning influence to the selection of exhibits and made them
representative, not just of the work of the architect academicians, but of
the state of architecture in Britain today.
There are 18 architect academicians, including one honorary foreign one  -
Jorn Utzon - the architect of the Sydney Opera House. All the leading
architects of the current generation are members: Sir Norman Foster, Sir
Richard Rogers, Richard MacCormac and Michael Hopkins, and Edward Cullinan.
The older generation is also there: Sir Philip Powell, Sir Denys Lasdun, Sir
Leslie Martin and Colin St. John Wilson.
The annual opportunity to exhibit the work of these leaders, mixed in with a
cross section of the work of current practice, does give a clear picture of
the profession at work. It is an opportunity for the public to see
architecture at work - and as large numbers do flock to the Summer
Exhibition it is an opportunity the profession should seize energetically.
This year the standard is high but, as is the case every year, the visitor
is not helped by the pedestrian display and the lack of information about
the exhibits. It is not as easy to exhibit a work of architecture as it is
to show a painting or a sculpture. You are not looking at the real thing,
only a representation at a small scale in model or drawing form of a
full-scale building. This needs interpretation and architects (or is it the
Academy?) resolutely refuse to do this. The result is that what you are
shown at the RA is just the tip of a fascinating but nearly incomprehensible
iceberg.
The first architectural exhibit to catch the eye is what looks like a
peepshow on the left hand wall of the Central Hall. Look into the
illuminated box and you will see the maquettes of the work of the artists
who worked with the architect, Richard MacCormac on the new residential
building for St. John's College, Oxford. You are looking at miniature
versions of an engraved glass wall and a sculpted iron screen. It is
intriguing but makes little sense without some representation of exactly how
they were used in the buildings. A beautiful model of elegant steel
staircases by Eva Jiricna does, however, stand alone, because it is
immediately comprehensible and can be enjoyed in exactly the way you would
enjoy a glimpse inside a futuristic dolls house.
Models convey information quickly and effectively - the model of a proposal
for new Thames Bridge by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava - is of
such clarity and elegance that you wish it could be slung across Thames at
Bankside tomorrow. Another brilliant model of a scheme that looks very
promising indeed, is the eye-shaped building for Ruskin Library at the
University of Lancaster. Even in model form it does have a sense about it of
the stones of Italy - a fragment of Venice reinterpreted for the campus.
A less comprehensible model, but one that does work as a tortured work of
art is the representation by Daniel Libeskind of his extension to the Berlin
Museum with its controversial Jewish Museum. The model has an uncanny
resemblance, presumably intentional of a shattered Nazi swastika.
Sir Norman Foster has also designed what he calls, a 'Centre de la memoire'
 -a tribute to victims of the Nazis in the town of Oradour-sur-Glane in
France. It is sublimely simple and less tormented than the Libeskind work
for Berlin. A circular pool reflects the sky and is surrounded by a curved
wall carved with the tragic victims' names. Anyone doubting the ability of
Sir Norman to achieve an architectural triumph in the most minimal way, only
has to leave the Summer exhibition and take the glass lift to the Sackler
Galleries in the Academy itself. Perhaps less profound but equally elegant
is the little school in France, the Lycee Albert Camus at Frejus that is
shown in photographs.
British architects working abroad would be a good subject for the next Royal
Academy architectural exhibition. It is a tribute to British talent and
living proof that architecture is an international art that so many good
architects from the UK now work worldwide. Offices for the Max Planck
Institute in Munich by John Partridge, a stadium in Johannesburg by Arup
Associates, a competition design for the the new Royal Library in Copenhagen
by Paul Koralek (did it win? We are not told), and a monorail station at
Wuppertal in Germany are only some of the examples shown in this year's
show. Of course they can all be reached from Britain via the Channel Tunnel.
A painting by Brendan Neiland and a model by the architects Grimshaw and
Partners of their Waterloo Terminal show the high quality and architectural
excitement we can expect when the trains start their subaqueous journeys.
This year's Royal Academy Summer Exhibition is a demonstration of the high
quality of work that is being achieved by British architects. I hope that
the architect President with his ambitious plans for an Architecture Centre
in what is currently the Museum of Mankind, will start closer to home and
make the small changes to the architectural display at the Summer Exhibition
that will make it immediately more accessible. The projects need clear
displays and careful captions, architectural models do not work when hung as
pictures, and photographs of buildings do help. Over to you Sir Philip ...

FT  06 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Tokyo 'dearest airport'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo's Narita airport has become the world's most expensive, while London's
Heathrow and Gatwick remain among the cheapest.
Heathrow, the world's biggest international passenger airport, continued to
slip in the annual index of charges at the world's top 40 airports,
published by the UK Travers Morgan consultancy group. It fell to 31st
position from 24th last year and 18th in 1990, when the first review was
done.
Airports are ranked according to landing, parking, passenger and terminal
navigation charges. The 1994 review takes into account changes in the world
airline fleet: an increasing number of noisy airliners such as DC-10s and
737-200s have been replaced by quieter jets. This trend will intensify
during the next 10 years as airlines seek to avoid paying surcharges for
noise.
Noise charges at Berlin's Tagel airport had placed it at the top of the
index last year. It has now slipped to fifth.
London's Gatwick airport dropped to 34 from 30 last year. The competitive
charges at the two London airports, operated by the privatised BAA group,
reflect the UK Civil Aviation Authority's pricing formula for them. Dublin
dropped four places from 15 to 19, reflecting in part a discount on charges
for flights into the UK.
Charges at Heathrow's main European rival airports are higher. Frankfurt has
become Europe's most expensive airport and lies fourth in the index.
Amsterdam is ninth and Paris Charles de Gaulle 11th.
'Overall, we are seeing a trend of airports introducing new charges, with
the exception of BAA, rather than increasing existing charges,' said Mr
Peter Mackenzie-Williams, Travers Morgan principal aviation consultant.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: Shirt tale - Style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You have to be a bit careful with short-sleeved shirts at work during the
summer: wearing a collar, a tie and sleeves that end just above the elbow
can make you look dangerously like the man who comes round to service the
photocopier. Indeed, to some, a formal short-sleeved shirt that you wear
with a business suit is a contradiction in terms. On the other hand, a
short-sleeved business shirt, with its implications of transatlantic style,
can make you look a real go-getter, if a go-getter image is what you're
after. The thing is, to chose a shirt with care.
At one end of the scale, there is Littlewoods: they will let you have a
shirt for only Pounds 8.50, or Pounds 6.99 if you buy two or more - in
white, colours and stripes. An Oxford weave with a button collar, comes cost
Pounds 9.99 in white or blue and is quite tasteful. The biggest problem is
that all are made of polycotton mixture and are completely indestructible.
You can never wear them out and throw them away, even if you decide you hate
them.
At the other end of the price scale, Paul Smith of Covent Garden, will do
you something unique and stylish for upwards of Pounds 80. His soft,
hand-stitched cotton and linen mixture shirts come with long or short
sleeves, and with a variety of collars, buttons, flaps and mysterious Paul
Smith details. A white, short-sleeved Paul Smith shirt worn under a jacket
will be about as commonplace as a talking oyster, but every bit as desirable
to rich exhibitionists.
Then there is the middle ground. Simpson's of Piccadilly does its own-label
white cotton shirt with front pocket and stiff collar for Pounds 35. Marks
and Spencer, on the other hand, has a vast range of short-sleevers
including: a plain easy-care cotton, or Oxford weave with a button collar
(both at Pounds 19); a cotton-linen mix with button collar at Pounds 22.50
and a soft design in Italian cloth, also at Pounds 22.50.
Then again, there is always Hilditch &amp; Key, in Jermyn Street. At Pounds 55,
their short-sleeved shirts are more than twice the price of the M and S
variety, and with less choice of style. They are, however, extremely
satisfying shirts, and not the most expensive from this part of town. Their
striped short-sleevers (blue, red and green) are ready-to-wear, but they
will tailor you a plain white one from a longer-sleeved shirt at no extra
cost. All have robust collars, placket fronts, fine stitching and use the
best cotton poplin. In the end, the choice between M&amp;S and H&amp;K is between
honest practicality and restrained luxury. Duck the decision: buy two of
each.

<TEXT>
Last Wednesday, on Derby Day at Epsom racecourse, I became a social
revolutionary. I was walking back to the grandstand from the paddock when I
discovered that my way through was completely barred. Phalanxes of policemen
had formed a square around an empty, open car and were holding up those who
wished to pass. There was a clear path back to the grandstand but this - was
through the Members' Enclosure. Here, too, the way was barred.
After a few minutes of enforced immobility amid a throng of non-members, I
confronted a security man. 'You have got to let us through that enclosure,'
I said. No, he couldn't do that. We were not members. 'We have just as much
right to be here as they have. You cannot stop us moving about the course
just because somebody is leaving ..'
'The Queen is leaving,' he said, in a shocked and pompous tone. 'Listen,' I
said, 'there are about a hundred of us and three of you. How are you going
to stop us?' And, beckoning to the crowd behind me, I walked through the
members' enclosure, past the morning dress, the millenary and the little
badges that said 'We belong.'
I probably made a ridiculous figure, getting fiery-eyed about my racegoer's
rights; but I felt like Wat Tyler, marching my band of peasants upon the
nobility. And yet not one of the people that I was fighting for followed me
into the enclosure. They had, I think, been told too many times that they
had no business being there.
Most race meetings promote a glow of egalitarianism as all present submit
themselves to the sport itself; they annihilate class differences. But the
big occasion race meetings, those that attract the stars of royalty and
their attendant satellites, just as surely propagate them.
At the Derby, at Royal Ascot, I find that instead of thinking about horses,
I am obsessively revolving around my mind the question of the English social
structure. There are few better ways of spending an afternoon than in the
atmosphere of worldly bonhomie which pervades, say, Newmarket or Goodwood;
but the glamour meetings, which should be even more fun, are almost ruined
by the fact that class, not racing, is the central issue.
Last week's Derby Day crowd was playing up to its various class stereotypes
for all they were worth. The non-members that I had tried to lead in
revolution were swearing and shouting, wrenching the rings out of lager cans
with formidable force and stripping off their shirts. One of them, a
dangerously drunk girl in an unbuttoned suit, stumbled across the invisible
electric fence which separated the grandstand from the members' enclosure.
'Rosie]' screamed her beleaguered beau, 'you can't go in there, you silly
cow] You'll get banged up]'
Meanwhile, the members were staring at Rosie as if she were a seaside donkey
that had infiltrated the parade of Derby entrants in the paddock. There eyes
were cold, full of conscious superiority. They were in, we were not, and
they were loving it. Every time I fell among their rigorous tailcoats and
the elliptical resonance of their squeak and bray, I felt diminished, down
at heel, common as muck. Every time I emerged from their territory into the
miasma of the grandstand, I felt like an aristocrat. Both feelings were
completely absurd, yet temporarily both were real.
In everyday circumstances - at an everyday race meeting - neither set of
people would conduct themselves in such exaggerated fashion. But there is
something about the segregation at these big events which has an almost
fatalistic effect upon people, turning them into parodies of their class as
if there was no other way that they could behave. You think we're hoi
polloi? Right, mate, we'll give you hoi polloi. Upper class? Yes, my man,
certainly we are upper class.
It is impossible to expect anything else, given the difference in the way
that members and non-members are treated. I have attended Royal Ascot both
in and out of the enclosure, and I have seen the metamorphosis of the course
officials from camp commandants to cap doffers. I accept that members have
paid more money, and that for this they are entitled to a little more
luxury, but not to be treated as superior beings.
It used to be that all England would go to occasions like the Derby for the
joy of experiencing the race itself. Now it seems that attendance is a more
self-referential business, in which people reinforce meaningless ideas about
themselves and play their part in a crude pageant. How silly this is; and
how much it detracts from the event, which should be more important than the
people that attend it. Especially an event which can produce a moment like
the smooth explosion of acceleration from Erhaab as, his coat black and oily
in the sun, he moved into a different dimension from the horses ahead of
him: the moment when the obsession with top hats and baseball caps fled the
mind of every person present.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: The ins and outs of al fresco dining in London
 -Eating Out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the last week of May you could not get a table outside in any London
restaurant. The weather was so cold that the few permanent outdoor tables
were not laid out.
During the first week of June you could not get a table outside in any
London restaurant but for a very different reason. Suddenly the sun shone,
the temperature rocketed to 20 degrees C and everybody wanted to eat
outside.
These two consecutive weeks neatly encapsulate the dilemma facing any
British restaurateur who wants to offer open-air dining, and any customer
who wants to take advantage of those restaurants with relatively quiet
pavements and secluded gardens. The British public, may be becoming more
European in its eating habits but the British weather remains firmly British
 -unpredictable even in the short term.
This unpredictability also makes it difficult for the restaurateur to know
what to offer. When May and June are fine nothing can better a truly British
meal of fresh asparagus, cold poached salmon and the first of the summer's
strawberries with Devon clotted cream. The dilemma is how many to cater for.
If the sun shines then everyone wants this combination. If it does not, then
nobody orders it and a lot of unwanted food goes to waste. When, as I did as
a restaurateur, you prepare 30 meals such as this for a restaurant that can
seat 100, you are sure to please the first 30 customers who will have
ordered this by 13.15 - but you will disappoint many of the other 70.
When the sun does shine there is a mad panic among cafe owners,
restaurateurs and publicans to move every available chair and table with
four stable legs out of doors and on to a relatively level piece of
pavement. It is, while it lasts, great fun but sadly illegal. When
restaurants apply for a liquor licence the magistrates grant them on the
basis of a defined licenced area within which drinks must be served. This
naturally, takes account of the normal British climate not those hot days
and balmy nights that sadly do not prevail for too long.
What follows is a list of just some of the London restaurants, across a
broad range of cuisines, which have tables outside or open to the air. It
comes with a health warning - take a jacket or a cardigan]:

FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: Share option tax options - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When UK executives make a killing overnight out of their share option
schemes, their smiles can be wiped away at the thought of the tax they will
incur on cashing in their windfall. Gains are liable to capital gains tax 40
per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer.
What can be done to bring down the tax burden?
A share option gives the holder the right today to acquire tomorrow shares
in his company, at today's price. In a conventional Inland Revenue-approved
executive scheme, this can be any time during the period of seven years
following the third anniversary of the day he was given the right.
The main tax-planning tool is the annual CGT exemption of Pounds 5,800 - not
enough to shelter substantial gains. For these, David Cohen, partner in the
City law firm of Paisner &amp; Co, suggests spreading disposals over more than
one tax year and involving a spouse.
He gives the following example: 'Suppose that Judith has an option to buy
10,000 shares for 150p each and she exercises it in June 1994 when the price
has risen to 400p. Full CGT on Judith's gain of Pounds 25,000 (10,000 x
250p) would amount to Pounds 10,000, pushing back her net profit to just
Pounds 15,000.
'On the assumption that Judith has no other taxable gains, she can sell
tax-free approximately 2,300 shares in this tax year and (assuming no change
in the share price) a further 2,300 in the tax year which begins on 6 April
1995.'
However, he warns executives against exercising in each tax year only the
number of shares which they plan to sell in that year, in preference to
exercising the whole option (that is, buying the shares) and then selling
them over a number of years. 'To do so would be a painful blunder. If an
executive option is exercised twice within a three-year period, the profit
on the second option will be fully taxed as income, thereby scuppering any
chance of using the CGT exemption.'
Instead, it is possible for those who are married to exploit their spouse's
CGT-saving potential. A gift of shares will generally be treated as a
disposal by the donor at market value but this rule does not apply to
transfers between spouses.
So Judith's husband, Alan, can receive and sell 2,300 shares in this tax
year and in 1995/96 without incurring any CGT.
'As a result of a combination of patience and marital teamwork, 9,200 shares
will have been cashed in tax-free. Even if the remaining 800 shares are
taxed, the taxable gain will have been reduced from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds
2,000 thereby boosting the net profit from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 24,200 -
a 61 per cent rise.'
Holders of savings-related options have even more flexibility. 'Up to Pounds
3,000 worth of shares acquired on the exercise of such options can be
transferred annually into a single company personal equity plan,' says
Cohen. 'The transfer will be tax-free provided it takes pace within 90 days
of exercise and from then on the single-company Pep will give complete
protection against income tax on dividends and CGT on sale.' Unfortunately,
this privilege does not apply to holders of executive options.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: Outside help for troubled workers - Jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A statistical portrait of employees today does not amount to a cheery
picture.
Consider that one in three marriages breaks down. One in seven people will
have a degree of mental illness during their working life. One in ten
employees suffers from an alcohol problem.
These difficulties are not left behind when an employee comes to work.
'Frequently stress in domestic life has knock-on effects at work,' says Dr
Michael Turner, chief medical officer at Texaco, the oil company.
To help workers deal with personal and professional anxieties, more than 80
per cent of companies in the UK offer some form of stress counselling. About
4 per cent now use specialised external counselling services, known as
Employment Assistance Programmes.
EAPs function as one-stop shops for employees to phone for legal, financial
or psychological help. Each employee is given a telephone number where EAP
staff are permanently on-call. Most services also offer face-to-face
counselling which can be arranged within 48 hours of a phone call.
The company pays for a specified range of services on a per capita basis and
all employees and their families can use the EAP for free. Services cost
about Pounds 18 to Pounds 45 annually per employee.
All services are confidential. The employer may receive statistical feedback
about employee up-take and types of services requested, but individuals who
use the EAP are never identified.
Such anonymity helps employees who fear black marks on their personnel
records if they discuss anxieties with their managers. 'If people are going
to receive counselling they do not want to have it from within the company,'
says Cheryl Mann, training and development consultant at Sun Alliance, the
insurance company, where almost 20 per cent of staff use the services of
Independent Counselling &amp; Advisory Services, the company's contracted EAP.
EAPs are also able to draw upon a pool of counsellors, rather than depending
on one or two company medical officers. 'The difficulty with having services
in-house is that the nature of enquiries are very varied - financial, legal,
domestic,' says Turner. 'To find one person who is an expert in all these
areas is impossible. The point of EAPs is that they have many experts.'
ICAS, which has 45 EAP contracts, has 400 contracts with counsellors around
the country. Personal Performance Consultants, another EAP which serves 96
companies, has 55 counselling staff and calls upon an additional 150
freelance therapists.
Currently 10 to 20 per cent of employees in companies with EAP contracts
phone for help at least once. Alistair Anderson, managing director of PPC,
believes the number of employees seeking counselling help, as well as the
number of companies contracting with EAPs, will increase sharply in the next
decade.
'There are a whole range of pressures in the workplace and the level of
awareness of counselling and its value is increasing,' he says. 'Suddenly
external counselling services are seen as the answer.' But external services
are not always perfect for companies. 'The potential downside of outside
EAPs is that they do not know about the organisation,' says Prof Cary
Cooper, Professor of Organisational Psychology at the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. 'So they are treating the
individual but they cannot see if there is something grossly wrong in the
organisation that is causing illness.'
Cooper, who is studying the effectiveness of EAPs in the UK for the Health
and Safety Executive, believes psychologists with both clinical and
occupational skills will be trained in the future and be hired by EAPs.
Improving the value of EAPs will no doubt be fueled by bottom-line
considerations such as reductions in levels of sickness absence, which costs
the UK around Pounds 27bn a year, and increases in employee performance.
'Now line managers are beginning to see connections between EAP and
performance, rather than just seeing it as a part of the company's duty of
care,' says Michael Reddy, chief executive of ICAS.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: Mind games - Reading matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today is June 6, and here is your homily for the day. 'Expand your
perspective by expanding your mind. Vizualize in rich detail. Involve as
many emotions and feelings as possible.'
There are plenty more where that one came from, 364 to be exact, one for
every day of the year in a handy pocket-sized volume that promises to help
executives through life's difficult moments.
Self help books for managers are two a penny, but Daily Reflections for
Highly Effective People is a little unusual. Most have the virtue of
offering clear guidance - do x, y, z, they say, and you'll be successful. By
contrast, this book is so obscure that the reader may find it hard to
decipher the 'daily reflections', let alone find a way of incorporating them
into the working day.
'Anything less than Win/Win in an interdependent reality is a poor second
best that will have impact in the long-term relationship', the book preaches
for September 8. What on earth does that mean?
It would be tempting conclude that you can publish any old rubbish these
days so long as you claim on the dust jacket that it will make managers more
successful. However, 3m people can't be wrong. At least that number, from
the US to China to Germany, own a copy of author Dr Stephen R Covey's most
famous work, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. This said all you needed
to do was to acquire seven habits - including 'begin with the end in mind'
and 'be proactive' - and the world would be your oyster.
The latest work is aimed at the further millions out there for whom the
earlier one was too long and heavy. It promises to provide the same
'holistic sense of personal effectiveness and purpose' in a more succinct
format. And those of us who doubt its worth, we must need the book most. Dr
Covey would no doubt tell us that we are sadly lacking that win/win habit.
Daily Reflections for Highly Effective People, By Stephen R Covey. Simon &amp;
Schuster, 369pp, Pounds 4.99.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How do businesses get on the Internet? The answer to this FAQ (frequently
asked question, in 'netspeak') depends to a great extent on the size of an
organisation, the number of people who will be using the Internet and how
much use they plan to make of it.
The basic requirements are simply a personal computer, with a modem, and an
account with one of the numerous companies that offer Internet access. Two
that offer their services internationally are ANS (313 663 7610) and
SprintLink (703 904 2230), both of the US.
To take advantage of the latest software, such as Mosaic, which makes access
to Internet resources relatively simple, a high-powered PC such as those
based on Intel's 486DX or Pentium chips is recommended. The modem should be
designed to send and receive data at 14.4 kilobauds. Slower modems, although
cheaper, will keep you waiting interminably if you attempt to access any
document containing graphics.
Also, to use Mosaic you must have a direct link to the Internet, known as a
PPP or Slip account. This enables your computer to exchange data in
'packets' directly with other computers on the Internet. Prices vary, but in
the US they are typically about Dollars 20 per month plus Dollars 2 per hour
connect time.
Businesses with several users tapping into the Internet may choose to
install a dedicated, high-speed telephone line, which makes access more
efficient. Routing equipment is needed to link local area networks to the
Internet. Security systems may also be desirable.
There are numerous books about the Internet. Most, however, are aimed
primarily at individual users. An exception is Mary Cronin's Doing Business
on the Internet; How the Electronic Highway is transforming American
Companies, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold at Dollars 29.95. Written for
business managers, rather than computer experts, it offers a readable
introduction to the Internet's business potential.

<TEXT>
Businesses venturing into cyberspace are well advised to observe the
'netiquette' established by the community of researchers and computer
enthusiasts who still dominate most of the 'newsgroups', or special interest
discussion groups, on the Internet.
Rule number one is that any attempt at unsolicited business promotion is
unacceptable, except in areas of the Internet specifically designated for
commercial activity. Violators of this rule are regarded as the on-line
equivalent of vandals who daub buildings with graffiti, and they are likely
to provoke angry responses, known as 'flame mail'.
In extreme cases, this can effectively force violators off the Internet. A
US legal firm, for example, has been ostracised by the Internet community
for posting on thousands of newsgroups messages that advertised its services
to immigrants seeking US visas.
Outraged Net users bombarded the law firm with over 35,000 messages, most of
them complaints, crashing the computer of the local Internet access service
through which the law firm accessed the Internet.
This incident, together with rising concern about the distribution of
sexually explicit messages on the Internet, has created broad debate about
freedom of speech in the world of electronic communications. Until more
specific guidelines are developed, businesses looking for customers on the
Internet should tread carefully.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Doing cyber business - Every two minutes a
new user hooks into the Internet, a system that could revolutionise global
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Solo travellers on the Internet 'information highway' are being overtaken by
the digital equivalent of 16-wheel juggernaut trucks, as businesses begin to
transport large quantities of data through cyberspace. The system is being
transformed into a global electronic marketplace that could change the way
world trade is conducted.
The Internet, a global system of computer networks, now links an estimated
2.2m computers and over 25m users in 137 countries. New users are hooking up
at the rate of about one every two minutes.
Originally a US government-funded programme in the late 1960s, to
electronically link researchers at US universities and government
laboratories, the Internet was in theory closed to commercial activity until
about two years ago.
Now companies are rushing to take advantage of the system as a low-cost
route for international electronic mail. Computer companies have led the
way. Digital Equipment, one of the heaviest users, has over 31,000 computers
linked to Internet and exchanges an average of 1.7m e-mail messages per
month with people outside the company.
To date, however, very little commerce is actually being transacted in
cyberspace. Most companies have been reluctant to trust sensitive business
data, purchase orders or credit information to the unregulated network. But
that could be about to change. A group of Silicon Valley companies and
organisations has joined forces in an attempt to pioneer the use of the
Internet as a new medium for trade among high technology companies by
creating an electronic marketplace called CommerceNet.
If successful, this 'could revolutionise both regional and foreign trade',
says Marty Tenenbaum, chief executive of Enterprise Integration Technologies
(EIT), a research firm leading the development of CommerceNet, together with
Stanford University's Center for Information Technology and the Western
Research and Educational Network (West Ren), a non-profit group that
operates the Northern California portion of the Internet.
The CommerceNet consortium is funded by a Dollars 6m US government grant,
through the Department of Commerce' Technology Reinvestment Program which is
being expanded by the Clinton administration as part of its technology
development policy. The group will obtain matching funds from the companies,
state and local agencies that have agreed to sponsor the service.
CommerceNet is tackling the problems that have discouraged companies from
using the Internet for buying and selling goods and services, notably the
complexity of navigating the Internet and lax security.
The first problem can be overcome with a new 'point and click' interface
program called Mosaic, developed by the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Distributed free via the Internet, Mosaic is rapidly gaining popularity as
an easy-to-use method to gain access to information resources on the
Internet.
Mosaic will enable companies to place 'virtual store fronts' on the
Internet. Buyers can tap into these store fronts, browse through catalogues
of products - which may include pictures, diagrams and even video clips -
call up order forms and transmit their orders directly to the seller.
However, security remains a serious concern for business users. The public
network is particularly vulnerable to computer 'crackers', as demonstrated
by a recent rash of password interceptions involving tens of thousands of
Internet users.
To address this problem, EIT is working with RSA Data Security, the leading
US encryption technology company, to develop a 'secure' version of Mosaic.
CommerceNet will provide participants with authentication, authorisation and
data encryption programs so that buyers and sellers can safely exchange
sensitive information such as credit card numbers and bid amounts, sign
legally enforceable contracts, maintain audit trails, and get paid through
co-operating banks.
Until such software is available, CommerceNet participants will proceed
cautiously. Most say they will provide on-line product catalogues and
literature and enable orders to be placed via the Internet. For now,
however, they will stop short of completing financial transactions.
Nevertheless, CommerceNet is an important testbed for 'commerce in
cyberspace', say participants.
'We expect to gain valuable insights and experience concerning electronic
commerce, and to offer a broad range of business information and services
via CommerceNet,' says Peter Meekin, of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
Hewlett-Packard and other manufacturing companies that are already using
private networks for exchanging order information with their customers and
suppliers see CommerceNet as a potentially cheaper alternative that could be
used to expand their electronic selling activities.
'It will be another mode of electronic commerce, another tool in our tool
kit,' says Sandy Whitson, EDI business manager at HP. The company will move
cautiously, she says, but is keen to explore the potential of public network
electronic sales which could reach a broader range of customers than
existing systems. While CommerceNet is currently focused on
'business-to-business' transactions within a tightly-knit group of about two
dozen companies, its founders have ambitious goals.
'I believe that in two to three years you will see as many as 100,000
companies using the Internet as a principal sales and service channel,' says
Tenenbaum. CommerceNet itself will be handling business transactions for as
many as 3,000 companies by the turn of the century, he predicts.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Media Futures: New billboard on the highway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mecklermedia, a US technology publishing group, last week launched
'MecklerWeb', an electronic communications and marketing system aimed at
businesses that want to have a 'corporate presence' on the Internet.
For Dollars 25,000 per year, MecklerWeb will provide companies with a
billboard on the electronic highway; a place to present their product
information, corporate messages and news.
This is unlikely to cause offence in the anti-advertising culture of the
Internet, however, because the group will not distribute promotional
materials. Instead it will provide a commercial catalogue that users may
choose to browse at will.
'Cyberspace is not a mass market,' says Christopher Locke, president of
MecklerWeb. 'You don't have to target audiences, they self select. The real
opportunity here is not traditional advertising, but rather a new method of
building business relationships and achieving market presence.' MecklerWeb
will be organised into broad topical areas of interest such as law,
medicine, sports and technology. Within each, sub-groups and specialties
will be arranged in an hierarchical structure. As well as the corporate
information, MecklerWeb intends to create discussion groups that could lure
potential customers. The group is inviting professional associations to
serve as 'hosts' to the various subject areas, moderating discussions and
organising multimedia content. Such groups will receive a share of the fees
paid by companies that participate.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Dual security gates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the US computer group, last month announced an Internet
security service based on the technology and expertise that it has developed
to protect its own networks.
The decision to establish links between a company's computers and the
Internet involves balancing risks and benefits, says Jim Hogan, vice
president of global communication and information processing services at
Digital. For many companies, protecting the integrity of internal computer
systems is paramount, but the advantages of Internet access are also
compelling.
Digital's system incorporates two 'gateways' that in effect build
'firewalls' around internal networks, protecting them from unwanted
intruders.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Management: Is your boss Britain's meanest?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a new generation of British bosses out there. They are egalitarian,
intelligent and highly principled. They are hardworking and meritocratic.
They live by their corporate mission statement and strive to offer their
customers the very best value.
So says City journalist William Kay who has just interviewed two dozen of
the new guard for his book The Bosses. After hearing ad infinitum about
their flat management structures and modern management methods, he has
jumped to the conclusion that the flashy old captains of industry are gone,
and a more homogenous group of deserving high-flyers has replaced them.
I don't buy it. The average boss may be brighter than before - after all,
business has got harder, so also-rans tend not to make it. But are our
corporate leaders really more fair minded? More egalitarian? Human nature
being what it is, surely there are as many boors in the boardroom as ever
before?
For every executive with the admirable qualities that Kay has found in his
research, I bet there are just as many successful bosses who are bullies,
tyrants or impossible to work for. I could list a few off the top of my head
but that would get me into trouble. Therefore, I am passing the buck and
inviting readers to nominate their own candidates for Britain's meanest
boss.
The rules are as follows:
The bosses must be chairmen or chief executives of Britain's biggest 350
companies.
Relevant criteria include: intimidating or unreasonably demanding behaviour;
tantrums, abusive language, failure to listen, impatience, ruthlessness,
bullying, intransigence, intolerance, unpredictability, arrogance,
vindictiveness.
Readers may nominate up to three bosses each, listing them in order of
meanness. It is not necessary to have worked for any of them directly, but
anecdotal evidence should have been collected. All nominations should state
in a few words why each candidate deserves to be considered for the
Financial Times Mean Boss Award.
Nominations sent in anonymously will be accepted. Signed nominations will be
treated with the utmost discretion.
My decision will be final.
Nominations should be sent by post to: Lucy Kellaway, Financial Times,
Number One Southwark Bridge, London SW1 9HL, or by fax to 071 873 3196.
If anyone from the Economist is reading this, they may be feeling
vindicated. That periodical has just published a leader complaining that the
British view 'trade' with suspicion and liken all entrepreneurs to that
shady character Arthur Daley in the TV comedy Minder.
Let me set the record straight: I do not hold British businessmen and women
in low esteem. On the contrary, some of my best friends, etc etc.
My point is that some of the people who have got to the top in business  -
as in politics, and any other area you can mention - are power- crazed and
difficult to work for. The magazine's view is at least a generation out of
date. Businessmen are better known and better respected than ever before.
People at the Economist must watch nothing other than sitcoms or they would
have noticed the popular new genre of business documentaries on subjects
such as venture capital which are watched by millions. If they still need
convincing, they should invest in Kay's glowing book.
Our nanny has just regaled me with the story of a friend who has got a job
looking after one docile baby for Pounds 140 a week net plus a two-bedroomed
flat and a car.
It was not the unfavourable comparison with her own terms and conditions
that took me aback. It was that the balance of power between us had shifted:
throughout the recession it was she who was lucky to have an acceptable job.
Now it is I who am lucky to have a (more than) acceptable nanny.
When I advertised in The Lady a year and a half ago I had 70 desperate
replies. A friend who last week placed a similar ad received only four. The
story at London's nannying agencies shows this to be no freak. They say they
are finding jobs for 30 per cent more nannies every week than they were six
months ago.
This is the most tangible sign I've seen that the economy is picking up, and
that confidence is well and truly back - among London's professional classes
at least.
During the recession, freelance women fired their nannies as soon as they
feared their work might be drying up, only to reemploy them once they
started feeling more optimistic. Similarly, women who do not work get rid of
the nanny the minute their husband's job looks precarious, but once he seems
more secure, they are on the phone to the nanny agency in no time.
Anyone who is not impressed by this powerful new economic indicator should
try to book a table at Quaglino's. A few months ago you could have walked in
off the street. Now two weeks' notice is required.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Management: Tips for a moving experience
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If you lose your job tomorrow, at least there is a network to help you pick
up the pieces. Break off your career to follow your husband or wife to an
overseas posting, though, and things are very different. Not only do you
lose your job, income, colleagues, perks and pension; you lose an important
framework to your life and part of your identity.
Living in Moscow for four years, from 1987, taught me a lot about myself and
my inner resources. At the time I saw my attempts to find work in terms of
filling the gaps in my cv. Now, I realise that I was training myself for
life back in the UK to which my husband and I both returned in the middle of
a recession without a job.
Moscow was a hostile city at the time: no map, no telephone directories, no
public libraries, no information on offer and 'no entry' signs everywhere.
A previous posting in Madrid had already taught me some important
guidelines: set yourself goals before you go. Network all the time, even
back home on leave. Tell everyone what you are doing and what your plans
are. I never cease to be amazed at people's generosity with contacts. Keep
working on your image. Always dress in a business-like fashion and you will
be taken seriously. Have visiting cards printed on day one and call yourself
what you are planning to be. It helps to put you in the right frame of mind.
Channel your anger, frustration and feelings of powerlessness into positive
actions. Start on a project of your own as soon as you can - anything, as
long as it really interests you. I researched Soviet publishing houses and
because I marketed myself hard on leave in the UK, Publishing News soon
asked me to be its Moscow correspondent. I built up work as a publishing
agent, freelanced as a journalist and enjoyed doing photography to back up
my articles.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Management: And my spouse came along too - International
companies increasingly find that employees are married to people who have
their own job, career, and income which they don't want to leave behind.
Bobby Meyer considers the implications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOBBY MEYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may not be the biggest constraint on their global expansion, yet a
growing challenge for the personnel departments of international companies
is how to accommodate the so-called 'trailing spouse'.
One of the most common reasons for an employee's refusal of an overseas
posting is the disruption caused to his or her partner. Not only is the
spouse's career jeopardised, the dual income disappears, too.
Failure to tackle these issues has significant implications for companies.
There is the obvious headache of finding someone else to go in their place
when executives turn down an international assignment - as one in three in
Britain does, according to the consultancy Organisation Resources
Counsellors. But there is also a financial impact. The Confederation of
British Industry estimates that restricted mobility is costing UK companies
as much as Pounds 500m in lost business opportunities a year.
By 2000 an estimated 75 per cent of relocating executives will be involved
in dual-career partnerships, and yet few companies give the issue the
attention it deserves. ORC found that while almost three-quarters of a
sample of American and European companies admitted to a dual-career
relocation problem, few had plans to tackle it.
Many companies still use policies developed in the 1970s and 1980s, with the
result that little or no account is taken of the spouse's career. The spouse
is seen as the back-up, expected to organise the move, entertain and be
prepared to uproot the family again, often at short notice.
Companies too often assume that the only remedy is to compensate for lost
income, but there are other ways of dealing with the issue. Employers, for
example, have easy access to training expertise and recruitment information,
as well as their overseas networks. They can help spouses obtain work
permits; ORC found that 42 per cent of European companies are already doing
this, compared with 15 per cent of US companies.
The companies can provide career counselling, which can be valuable
preparation for a new life abroad. Too often the spouse is left to fight for
help; that takes a strong personality, particularly when speaking out may
jeopardise the partner's prospects.
The more enlightened companies advise against a blanket approach. Realising
that each case must be assessed on a highly individual basis, and that the
conditions in the host country also need specific consideration, the
international chemical company Monsanto in Brussels has developed what it
calls a 'cafeteria approach'. Kristien Debougnoux, responsible for Expat
Policies, explains: 'The intention is to eliminate as many barriers as
possible to an international assignment for dual-career families.'
Monsanto offers some compensation for loss of income to the trailing spouse
(linked to the employee's salary level). It also tries to help spouses
develop skills in their own field or a new endeavour. Perhaps most important
of all, the spouse gets help re-entering the home job market when the
assignment is over. Monsanto also helps indirectly as one of the corporate
sponsors of Focus in Brussels, a networking and career resource centre
operated by volunteer expatriate spouses.
The oil company Shell, with 5,600 expatriate staff in 100 different
countries - is currently analysing the outcome of a large survey
commissioned from the independent organisation International Survey
Research. A long, detailed questionnaire was sent to expatriates and their
spouses in 35 countries, as well as to couples who had been or might be
expatriates. The 70 per cent return rate was 'exceptional', says Mike
Cloughley, special projects manager for human resources at Shell.
Overall, Shell expatriates seem to be a happy bunch, with 88 per cent
expressing satisfaction. The company's handling of expatriation, however,
drew some criticism, with only 60 per cent saying they were satisfied. At
this point there were some revealing comments from spouses.
The dual-career problem and separation from school-age children were two of
six main issues highlighted. For Cloughley, a big worry is that these two
factors have emerged as the main reasons for restricted mobility among staff
aged under 30 - the ones specifically recruited for their willingness to 'go
anywhere, anytime'.
Not everyone, though, thinks that the answer is to bow to UK expatriate
needs. On future mobility trends, Alan Chester, operations director of
Employment Conditions Abroad, suggests that 'mobility may have to come from
parts of the world where people are still prepared to be mobile'.
Meanwhile, the spouses themselves have not been idle. In cities such as
Brussels, The Hague, Geneva and Paris, women have set up counselling and
advisory services of their own. London, too, has a non-profit resource
centre for international residents, Focus Information Services, run by a
voluntary staff of expatriate wives.
Focus runs a monthly job group and a series of seminars on interviewing
techniques, CVs, cultural adjustment and other issues. Multinationals such
as AT&amp;T and General Electric of the US provide sponsorship.
Working Partners, co-ordinated from Belize by Gill Mackilligin, uses the
United Nations network as a worldwide link for expatriate spouses. 'The
talents and efforts of thousands of trained professional people are going to
waste, often in countries where the very skills they possess are in
desperately short supply,' she says.
There is a strong emphasis on project and job creation and the training of
local people, rather than taking jobs away from them. Working Partners began
in 1990 as Spouses for Development and was adopted as a programme of the
World Federation of United Nations Associations in November 1992. Pilot
Working Partners programmes are already in operation in the UK, Switzerland,
US and Belize and by 1995 it is hoped that expansion will cover a further 23
locations.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - John Hegarty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Should John Hegarty be stuck on a desert island there would be a lot of
upset entrants in the London Evening Standard's fantasy advertising league.
Such is his reputation within the industry that the creative director of
advertising agency Bartle, Bogle, Hegarty figures as star striker in the
vast majority of top team selections.
If you could take one person with you who would it be?
Michelangelo would be good because he was one of the great art directors.
But then the church was one of the first great advertising clients. He and I
could have good conversations about how we visualise things.
Which additional item would you need for the beachside office, apart from a
fax and telephone?
A lay-out pad so that I could put ideas down. If ideas stay in your head
they forever perambulate around. The frustration of not being able to put
them on paper would drive me mad.
Which extra sanity preserver would you opt for?
I would probably learn about the flora and fauna. I detest gardening. My
father was a gardener and I think you always rebel against what your parents
did. So although I loathe it, I realise I am missing out.
What would you dislike about being on the island?
Perennial sunshine. The fact that it rains a lot in Britain makes us think
more. I would hate constant sunshine although it is nice to have on
occasions.
And like?
An uncomplicated life. The ability to concentrate and not be diverted, to be
able to focus your mind.
Some food and drink that you would enjoy?
If I'd asked Michelangelo, I would probably go for pasta because it would
suit him, although with my Irish heritage I would also like to go for the
potato. They are underrated and seen as a commodity. But then, sitting there
with Michelangelo we would have some pasta and I would have a nice bottle of
chianti.
A film for after dinner?
The Godfather, and I would hope to cheat and take the trilogy. It is the
most perfect film in terms of photography, music and the themes it explores.
Something to read?
James Stephens's The Crock of Gold which is all about two philosophers
arguing about the meaning of life. It contains a line which I have always
found very profound: 'What the heart knows today, the head will know
tomorrow.'
You can send a message in a bottle from the island, what would it be?
'Remember that good is the enemy of great.'
On your island, you can impose one condition:
That I would only be there for a limited time. Knowing we have a limited
amount of time makes us productive. I've always thought a great description
of hell would be eternal life because there would be no reason to do
anything then.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (10): Johnson leads fight to stop breakaway
 -Robert Gibbens looks ahead to an important provincial election in Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quebec's coming election will bring Canada's only French-speaking province
face-to-face with a choice between the mainstream and some form of breakaway
from the rest of the country.
Mr Daniel Johnson, the 49-year-old premier, who was acclaimed leader of the
federalist Quebec Liberals last December after the ailing Mr Robert Bourassa
resigned, is battling to persuade nervous voters that he can revive a
sluggish economy with tighter management, co-operation with Ottawa and
resurgent private sector investment.
His Parti Quebecois opponent, Mr Jacques Parizeau, 63, the province's
finance minister from 1976 to 1984 and a hardline nationalist, says
political separation is the only way out of the confederation straitjacket.
Were he to win the election, Mr Parizeau promises an independence referendum
would follow within a year.
He knows, however, that the Quebec electorate is older and more cautious
than in the 1970s and 1980s, and that first-past-the-post in 1994 does not
mean the subsequent referendum is won. Both sides have sought the blessing
of international investors and politicians. Mr Johnson has won approval so
long as he keeps a tight rein on budget spending. Mr Parizeau has met the
same scepticism as in 1977, just after the PQ first took power: The typical
US view is that Quebec can get what it wants from Canada and cannot afford
to go it alone.
Mr Jean Chretien, the federal prime minister, in the tradition of his
mentor, Mr Pierre Trudeau, is implacably against separation or sovereignty.
The election will probably come in September. Quebec, with 7m people, is
Canada's second biggest province after Ontario and 99 per cent
French-speaking outside Greater Montreal. Montreal's Francophone population
is about 70 per cent of a total 3m; the balance is Anglophone and
'Allophone', in other words, those whose mother tongues are neither English
nor French.
Both Mr Johnson and Mr Parizeau lack seasoned supporting talent and inherit
a heavy baggage of past mistakes. Voters remember the PQ government's
disintegration after failing to carry the 1980 referendum on sovereignty.
But they blame the Liberals for 12 per cent unemployment and the decline of
Montreal - key to the province's economy.
The PQ's 1979 legislation to protect French, make it the language of work
and restrict immigrants' access to English schools, retains solid
Francophone support. The Liberals can make only token concessions.
Since 1990, the economy has been hit by the North American recession and
depressed world commodity prices, accelerated Canada-US free trade, defence
cuts and the soaring costs of health and other public services. Old
industries have withered. A new economy, based heavily on research,
aerospace, communications, software, electronics and pharmaceuticals, is
taking shape slowly.
A wave of investment in hydro power and primary aluminium plants has tapered
off. Many new industrial projects are delayed by political uncertainty.
The PQ won five by-elections in a row before the Liberals turned the tide in
March. The polls have consistently shown the PQ ahead, though Mr Johnson
leads Mr Parizeau in personal popularity.
But Quebec's most popular politician is the charismatic Mr Lucien Bouchard,
leader of the Bloc Quebecois, which promotes the separatist cause at the
federal level. The BQ took 54 of Quebec's 75 seats in the October 1993
federal election and Mr Bouchard became Opposition leader in Ottawa.
Many PQ supporters would prefer Mr Bouchard as their leader, saying he could
best lead them to victory in the coming election. His 'sovereignty' and
'independence' options sound more palatable to anxious voters than Mr
Parizeau's hardline 'separation' and his curt dismissal of Canada and all
its sins.
The Quebec Liberals have studied the 1993 rout of the federal Conservatives
and a come-from-behind victory by Mr Ralph Klein's Conservatives in Alberta.
They have consulted the Conservatives in Britain. But no Quebec party has
won a third successive majority mandate since 1952.
Another handicap is that 35 of the 92 Liberals elected to the national
assembly in the last election in 1989 are not running again - including some
big names. The Liberals at present hold 79 of the 125 seats in the national
assembly, compared with the PQ's 33.
The Liberals see the risks quite clearly. Though the economy is slowly
turning, spurred by the US upsurge, real growth may not reach the predicted
3 per cent or enough to meet job-creation promises. Moreover, public sector
cutbacks, overseen by Mr Johnson as Treasury Board head, are not yet
complete.
'If we could translate Mr Johnson's personal popularity into voter
intentions, we'd be talking about how many seats we're going to win,' says
Mr John Parisella, Liberal campaign chairman. He claims the Liberals have
some big names ready to run in several 'safe' Montreal ridings.
Mr Parizeau's strategy is clear. If the PQ forms the next government, he
says, the national assembly will pass a resolution starting the process of
separation and the division of Canada's assets and liabilities. A referendum
will follow.
'People who vote PQ will have thought it through and I want no ambiguity,'
Mr Parizeau says. He promises the referendum question will be simple and
clear this time. But the 'new' Quebec would aim to retain the Canadian
dollar as its currency and accept Bank of Canada policies.
The PQ remains the only alternative and attempts to set up a third party
have failed miserably.
Mr Johnson says Quebec must remain an important part of the federal system
to prosper in the era of global trade. It must actively spur private sector
investment and cultivate the new economy. 'We must remain outward-looking
and benefit from world trade,' he says.
About one-third of the electorate is undecided. It is still not clear
whether Mr Johnson can overcome history and win the Liberals a third term.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (12): Safety net catches too many - Reform
of the social security programme is on the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN WISENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada is a rich country - but the social safety net which successive
governments have devised over five decades has become unaffordable.
Nearly CDollars 40bn a year is spent by the federal government alone on
social programmes ranging from unemployment insurance and welfare benefits
to student loans and training for the disabled. The country's 10 provinces
and two territories spend billions more.
Canadians have become tired of paying high taxes. They also fear the foreign
borrowing that has made the spending possible in recent years will become
impossible as lenders succumb to concern about high debt levels.
What is worse, there is almost universal agreement that many of the
country's very expensive social programmes do not work.
Ms Judith Maxwell, associate director of the School of Policy Studies at
Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, says both the unemployment
insurance and welfare (social assistance) programmes were designed for the
1950s and 1960s when there was full employment.
'The original design of unemployment insurance was that it was to help
people who were on temporary lay-off and expecting to return to the same
job,' she says.
'The intent of social assistance was that it was for people who were
unemployable. Now half of the people on social assistance are fully
employable.'
Ms Maxwell is one of the experts on a social services task force set up by
Mr Lloyd Axworthy, the federal human resources minister. The task force is
about to come up with reform proposals, from which a parliamentary committee
is expected to produce recommendations in the autumn.
'It's especially difficult in Canada,' Ms Maxwell says of the search for
reforms to the social safety net. The powers and responsibilities of the
federal and provincial governments are clearly set out in the Canadian
constitution, and jealously guarded by politicians at each level.
For example, the provinces are responsible for education and social
security, but unemployment insurance comes under the federal wing.
Over the years, however, the federal government has used its taxing powers
to entice the provinces into various social programmes such as universal
health care and welfare.
'It's very difficult for one level of government to institute reforms
without having big spill-over effects on another level of government,' says
Ms Maxwell. 'If the federal government makes changes (to unemployment
insurance), then it pushes people onto the welfare system, which is
provincial jurisdiction, Ms Maxwell says.
Conversely, provincial governments will sometimes tailor job-creation
programmes to make people eligible for unemployment insurance, which is a
federal responsibility.
Social assistance has even become a political football between provinces.
Recently, British Columbia claimed it was experiencing an influx of welfare
claimants after the neighbouring province of Alberta cut its level of
benefits.
Mr John Richards, an economist in the business faculty at Simon Fraser
university in Burnaby, British Columbia, says that Canada has among the most
generous unemployment benefits of countries in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development. But the Canadian insurance scheme 'certainly
has a number of perverse incentives'.
Mr Richards makes a distinction between 'passive' measures that hand money
over to the unemployed, and programmes such as training and mobility grants
designed to make people work.
'Canada spends relatively more on the passive than on the active,' he says.
Other countries such as Sweden and Germany that spend heavily on social
programmes place more emphasis on the active.
Ms Maxwell says spending on job creation and training will have to be
increased. 'We have to find more efficient ways to do what we do but we also
have to fill some glaring holes in the social safety net,' she adds. 'We
don't have any kind of adequate system for child care or parental leave.'
As social safety reforms are rolled out over the next year or two, training
and other programmes may be introduced, but the problems will not be solved
without attacking the unemployment insurance and welfare programmes.
Unemployment benefits cost about CDollars 19bn a year. The fiction that the
system is self-insuring is becoming harder to sustain as Canada experiences
a jobless recovery with unemployment stubbornly stuck at about 11 per cent.
The fund is now more than CDollars 5bn in the red. The likely solution is
that it will become more difficult to claim benefits.
The current implicit subsidy to seasonal industries is also likely to be
reduced or eliminated. At the moment, an employee in a sector such as
fisheries can work as little as 10 weeks a year and claim for the other 42.
Social assistance, which was originally supposed to help the most desperate
and unemployable, is costing the federal and provincial governments about
CDollars 21bn a year.
Mr Derek Brackley, an economist with the British Columbia and Yukon branch
of the Canadian Ministry of Human Resources Development, says that the
biggest change to social assistance in recent years has been in the profile
of people collecting benefits.
'The number of single males has gone up astronomically over the past few
years,' he says. However, most of these get off welfare fairly quickly,
while families tend to collect benefits for a long time.
Mr Brackley says the heads of single-parent families find they are better
off on social assistance. Minimum-wage jobs do not pay enough to cover such
work-related costs as daycare, extra clothing and transportation.
Experts expect the system will be redesigned to make it more financially
attractive to return to the workforce.
'I think there's a consensus that we need a different incentive system,' Ms
Maxwell says. But she warns that governments will have to take care to
cushion the blow for the casualties of the adjustments.
'If you start tearing down an existing social structure, you create losers.
You can't simply write off the people who are unable to adapt,' she warns.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (11): US investment rises sharply - Laurie
Morse on the impact of multinationals on trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investment in Canada has begun to swing up again, bolstered by
exchange rate advantages, new trade agreements that will open more
international markets to products made in Canada and a healthy recovery in
the US economy.
Nearly 45 per cent of Canada's manufacturing output was exported to the US
last year, making the economic health of Canada's huge southern neighbour an
inescapable consideration when it comes to investment. Canada is currently
running a Dollars 12bn international trade surplus, and is in the midst of
an export-led economic recovery.
Companies wishing to broaden their presence in North America are
increasingly turning to Canada for specialised manufacturing operations,
capitalising on the benefits of a cheap currency, a highly-educated
workforce, good labour relations and proximity to the largest consumer
market in the world.
These factors for many companies offset the negative influences of high
taxes and the risks associated with the threat of a political split between
Canada and francophone Quebec.
A survey of current business conditions published in March by the US
Commerce Depart- ment described Canada as one of the biggest beneficiaries
of a Dollars 5.3bn, or 8 per cent, worldwide increase in investment planned
by US companies in their affiliates abroad in 1994. Canada will receive a
full Dollars 1.3bn of the increase, second only to investments planned for
affiliates of US companies located in Asia and the Pacific.
US companies plan to spend Dollars 8.7bn in improving or adding to their
Canadian operations this year, the highest since 1990, and a 16 per cent
increase over 1993. The jump in US investment follows a difficult
restructuring period in Canada, which saw a number of multinational
companies rationalise operations and streamline marketing and manufacturing
strategies.
'What's happened here over the last 15 years is that there has been a
greater degree of specialisation,' says Mr Jason Myers, chief economist for
the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. 'Ten years ago, a multinational
company would have manufactured 10 or 12 products in Canada and imported
several others. Now, the same company will produce one or two products in
Canada, but will do it on a large scale for worldwide distribution.' This
consol- idation, he says, has forced the small Canadian suppliers to
rationalise as well.
The new interest in multinational investment in Canada, then, is more to
expand and modernise existing operations than to open new facilities.
Merger and acquisition of Canadian companies by foreigners has remained
relatively stable over the past two years, representing about Dollars 5bn,
with US, UK and Hong Kong interests making the largest deals in 1993,
according to global investment statistics complied by KPMG Peat Marwick.
Three industries are seeing the bulk of the new capital infusion - oil and
gas; vehicles and transportation equipment, and mining. In vehicles, a
recent surge in North American car demand has caused Ford to invest about
Dollars 3bn at its Canadian plants in the past two years, and Chrysler
another Dollars 2bn, according to Mr Slawek Skorupinski, director-general of
the automotive section at Canada's Department of Industry. Eighty per cent
of cars produced in Canada are exported.
Ford and Chrysler are adding third shifts to their Canadian plants to meet
surging demand. All the big three car manufacturers have modernised their
factories in Canada and are launching products, according to Mr Skorupinski.
Ford, for example, has retooled its old Tempo Topaz plant in Oakville,
Ontario to be the sole producer of its new family mini-van, which is
expected to compete with Chrysler's popular Voyager model.
US-owned carmakers will together increase their investment by 53 per cent,
or Dollars 1.7bn, in Canada in 1994, a boost that looks particularly strong
considering it follows a 42 per cent increase in 1993.
However, not all vehicle manufacturers are sharing equally in the rise in
demand for new cars. Hyundai recently shut a Quebec plant that had been
producing its Elantra model, leaving 700 people without jobs. Hyundai's
problem, Mr Skorupinski says, is that it was not successful in generating
demand in the North American market.
Canada's western provinces have been thriving on expansion in the energy
industry. In 1992, Canada's federal government revised its regulations
regarding foreign investment for oil and gas exploration and development,
putting foreigners on an equal footing with Canadian companies and opening
up the industry to outside capital.
With exploration success rates in Canada averaging about 50 per cent,
compared with about 25 per cent in the US, multinational oil companies have
expanded their operations here. Eastern provinces are not entirely left out
of this movement. Several US oil companies will plough about Dollars 2.5bn
into their Canadian operations this year to develop crude oil reserves off
the coast of Newfoundland.
Natural gas investments are also on the rise. Existing North American
natural gas pipelines are currently operating at high load factors, making
several expansion projects necessary. With Mexico's entry into the North
American energy grid, Canadian companies will produce and export related
equipment as the US develops the Mexican market.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (9): Drought may be over - The Nuclear
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two events last April underlined the volatile mood in Canada's nuclear
industry.
Mr Zou Jiahua, China's vice- premier, visited the suburban Toronto offices
of Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL), reinforcing hopes that Beijing will
use its Candu heavy water reactor to meet part of its fast-growing power
needs.
The high-profile Chinese visit symbolised AECL's optimism about the Candu
programme's future. A 700-megawatt Candu unit installed at Wolsong, South
Korea, in 1983 has won acclaim for two years in a row as the world's
best-performing nuclear reactor.
AECL has won orders for three more units at Wolsong since 1990, and expects
to be a front-runner for reactors in Romania, Turkey and Indonesia, as well
as China, over the next few years.
Two weeks before, however, came the latest of many upheavals within AECL's
ranks. Its chief executive quit after less than a year at the job. Over the
past four years, the government-owned company has had three chief executive
officers and four chairmen, while 10 of its 12 government-appointed
directors have been replaced.
AECL has been through several painful restructurings over the past decade as
the prospects for nuclear energy have waned, and government funding has
contracted.
In particular, AECL has battled to bring a sharper, more commercial focus to
its research arm, whose payroll is about three times bigger than the Candu
division.
Uncertainty about the future of nuclear power has taken a toll on the Candu
programme. This division's payroll has shrunk from 3,600 to 1,000 employees
over the past decade. Much of its effort during the 1980s was directed at
service work on existing Candu and other reactors.
AECL announced another round of cuts late last month, including a 15 per
cent reduction in its total payroll over the next two years. Nonetheless, Mr
Don Lawson, who heads the Candu operations, is optimistic that the new
orders from Korea herald the end of the long drought for the nuclear
industry.
Construction of a Candu reactor at Cernavoda in Romania is again in full
swing after being interrupted because of the 1989 revolution. AECL and its
Italian engineering partner, Ansaldo, now have complete charge of the site.
'The quality of work has been as good as anywhere else,' Mr Lawson says.
'What we've done is to put a fence around the site, with western work
practices within the fence.'
Drawing on staff from several Canadian utilities, AECL will run the plant
for the first 18 months. About 150 Romanian operators are being trained at a
Candu power station in New Brunswick.
AECL's marketing efforts are at present focused on Turkey, where the
government is expected to call for bids later this year for one - possibly
two - units at Akkuyu, on the south coast.
TEK, the Turkish utility, signed a letter of intent for a Candu reactor in
1983. But financing problems related to the unusual ownership and operating
structure of the project scuppered that deal. The transaction is likely to
be more straightforward this time around.
Mr Lawson says that AECL has already arranged CDollars 1.5bn in financing
for the Canadian content of its renewed bid for the Turkish contract. Its
partner, the Dutch arm of John Brown, the UK engineering and construction
group, has brought in support from the UK, Netherlands and Spain.
Asia will be the biggest source of business over the next few decades,
predicts Mr Lawson. AECL is banking on its success in Korea to win orders
from Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and China.
But the company is also crossing its fingers for a revival in nuclear
power's fortunes closer to home.
One prospect is Saskatchewan, the prairie province which is the world's
biggest uranium producer but has so far steered clear of nuclear power
generation.
AECL hopes that Saskatchewan will order a smaller version of the 700 MW
Candu 6 reactor. A relatively simple 450 MW model, with a construction time
of less than three years, is at present on the drawing boards.
Elsewhere in North America, several first generation nuclear reactors are
nearing the end of their planned 40-year life.
Environmental groups are certain to fight any move to replace them with new
nuclear units.
However, the power station sites have already been approved for nuclear use,
and the infrastructure is in place. Mr Lawson predicts that orders from
North American utilities will restart within 15 years.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (6): Trying to do more with less - Foreign
Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign policy, traditionally an area of little public interest in Canada,
is quietly returning to the national agenda. For the first time since the
1970s, Ottawa is embarking on a major review of its international relations.
The challenge is to determine priorities abroad and ensure the means to meet
them at home. The end of the cold war, the rise of Asia, and the advent of
North American free trade have dramatically changed the assumptions which
have governed Canada's defence and foreign policy since 1945.
Uncertain of which direction to take, the Liberal government has begun
seeking advice. Since last October's election, the House of Commons has held
debates on the North American Free Trade Agreement, US cruise missile tests
over Canada, and the future of Canadian peacekeeping omissions. Two
parliamentary committees are studying defence and foreign issues. A public
forum, organised by the government, has convened leading experts in Ottawa.
In the old bipolar world, Canada's international activism gave rise to many
labels: for instance, helpful fixer, honest broker and middle power. They
generally reflected the activist but conciliatory role which Canada has
sought to play in the post-war era.
As a warrior, Canada fought early and often in both world wars, Korea and
the Gulf. As a peacekeeper, it has participated in every mission undertaken
by the United Nations. As a trader, earning one quarter of its income from
commerce, Canada has supported global free trade.
As a donor, Canada has run one of the world's most generous aid programmes.
As a diplomat, Canada helped create the architecture of the new world order,
joining all the major international organisations including the Group of
Seven, the Commonwealth, La Francophonie (the organisation of
French-speaking countries) and the Organisation of American States.
Whatever the government's review concludes, Canada is unlikely to embrace a
new isolationism or protectionism. While the traditional consensus on
federalism and social welfare is fraying at home, Canada remains committed
to the liberal internationalism of Lester Pearson, the former prime
minister.
Still, money is a constraint. With the federal government running an annual
budget deficit of Dollars 40bn, many foreign policy experts question whether
Canada can still afford to do all that it has in the past.
For a decade or more, for example, Canada has been reducing military
spending by cutting the size of the armed forces. Yet it still maintains too
many bases and carries out too many functions.
Meanwhile, the demand for peacekeepers has soared. Canada has always agreed
to serve; it once comprised 10 per cent of the world's peacekeepers. But the
former Conservative government withdrew Canadian troops from Cyprus after 28
years and asked other countries to share more of the burden.
Canada is still the world's seventh largest aid donor. But aid as a
percentage of gross domestic product has now fallen to around 0.45 per cent,
and the Canadian International Development Agency has been called wasteful
and inefficient.
The government is under pressure in all areas to find new ways to do more
with less.
In defence, for example, some suggest turning the military into a
peacekeeping army. The argument is that Canada no longer needs a traditional
force equipped for high-intensity warfare and should prepare its forces for
more limited needs, such as civil order and surveillance.
'Our defence policy is  .. rational no longer,' says a recent report by a
group of prominent Canadians. 'Unless the policy is changed quite radically,
the result will be that Canada will have a miniature model of a general
purpose force - one with just a little bit of everything but not enough of
anything to be effective.'
One proposal is to abandon high-intensity combat. This would mean slashing
Canada's fighter aircraft fleet by two-thirds, closing bases and dropping
armoured formations, heavy artillery and ground-to-air support.
To modernise its aid programme, critics propose that the government redirect
aid to only the poorest countries, abandoning those which no longer need it.
Ottawa has also been urged to stop supporting costly megaprojects, and
concentrate more on developing human resources through micro-business loans
and education.
In reviewing foreign policy, the government will have to consider a host of
other questions: whether to remain in Nato, even after withdrawing forces
from Europe; whether to take a softer line on human rights in the third
world and concentrate more on trade and investment; whether to remain a
member of so many international organisations; whether to try again, as
Canada did in the 1970s, to diversify trade beyond the US, which accounts
for more than 70 per cent of Canada's exports.
For all the discussion, though, Canada's objectives in the 1990s remain
similar to those of the 1950s. If opinion polls are correct, Canadians want
to do more in the world, not less.
But that does not mean the government will embark on bold initiatives.
Foreign policy is not a priority for Mr Jean Chretien or his government, and
the expectation is that it will be cautious in cutting defence spending and
reallocating aid.
What is more, if the secessionist Parti Quebecois is elected in the province
of Quebec later this year, the federal government will have its hands full
with the national unity issue, leaving little time for the rest of the
world.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (8): New faces in Ottawa - All change in
the corridors of power / Bernard Simon identifies the up-and-coming names to
note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compilers of the federal government telephone directory have had to change
an unusually large number of entries since the last edition was published in
April 1993.
The new Liberal cabinet, which took office after last October's general
election, is the most obvious change in the corridors of power in Ottawa.
But it is no means the only one.
The Bank of Canada has a new governor. For the first time, a woman holds the
job of Clerk of the Privy Council, the most senior position in the federal
civil service. Names of several government departments have been changed.
More than two-thirds of the 295 members of parliament returned in last
October's general election are newcomers.
Furthermore, the way that business is done in Ottawa has undergone some
changes since the Liberals came to office. 'The previous 10 years were
government by the friends of (former prime minister Brian) Mulroney,' one
lobbyist says.
He adds that the Liberals have so far been 'very open and very forthcoming.
They're not willing to talk about 'I scratch your back, and you scratch
mine'.'
The Liberals have launched top-to-bottom policy reviews of such contentious
and wide-ranging areas as defence, social security and transport. Some
lobbyists report that politicians and civil servants are calling on them as
the new government feels its way.
Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, has discouraged cabinet members from
assembling the large political staffs which became a fixture of ministerial
offices during Mr Mulroney's tenure.
While decisions were channelled through a maze of ministerial committees and
a pyramid of advisers during the Mulroney years, the centre of power in
Ottawa is now a small group of senior cabinet members.
Besides Mr Chretien, the group includes Mr Paul Martin, finance minister; Mr
Lloyd Axworthy, human resources minister and Mr Roy MacLaren, trade
minister. Any important decision involving Quebec is likely to have the
stamp of approval of Mr Andre Ouellet, the wily foreign affairs minister.
Though Ms Sheila Copps was renowned as one of the Liberals' most forceful
debaters on the opposition benches, she has yet to make a mark as deputy
prime minister. She also holds the environment portfolio.
One consequence of the leaner political decision-
making process is that senior civil servants have regained some of the clout
they lost during the Mulroney years. The most influential department heads
include Mr David Dodge (finance), Mr Jean-Jacques Noreau (human resources
development), Mr Harry Swain (industry), Mr Allen Kilpatrick (international
trade) and Mr Reid Morden (foreign affairs).
'The number of people you have to talk to is still relatively small,' says
Mr Tom D'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, a big
business lobby group.
Nonetheless, life has changed for the army of lobbyists which sprang up in
Ottawa during the 1980s. Liberal ministers and MPs have put out word that
they prefer to deal directly with companies and individuals seeking favours,
rather than with professional arm-twisters.
Many lobbyists' work now centres more on research and advice than directly
pleading clients' cases. But some of the firms which were most successful at
opening doors in the Mulroney years remain widely respected. They include
Hession Neville &amp; Associates, and Parker Norquay, whose head, Mr Rob Parker,
has the unenviable job of representing the interests of Canada's tobacco
companies.
At the Bank of Canada, Mr John Crow was replaced last February as governor
by the less prickly Mr Gordon Thiessen. Mr Thiessen was formerly senior
deputy governor, acting in effect as the bank's chief operating officer.
Perhaps the biggest change is in the House of Commons, where two of Canada's
three national parties, the Progressive Conservatives and the left-of-centre
New Democrats, were all but annihilated in the election. The opposition
benches are now filled by two regional parties - the Bloc Quebecois, whose
54 MPs are all French-speaking and all from Quebec, and the Reform party,
all but one of whose 52 members represent constituencies west of Ontario.
The BQ has so far proved to be a more effective and cohesive opposition than
the Reform party. Although their concerns are centred on Quebec, BQ members
have carved out a left-of-centre position on some national issues, such as
social security reform. But the Liberals have so far had the field largely
to themselves.
With all these changes, anyone planning to do business in Ottawa would be
well advised, as a first step, to pick up a copy of the government phone
book. The Government Telecommunications Agency has just produced a new
edition that incorporates the comings and goings of the past six months.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (7): Leader who shunned a Cadillac -
Bernard Simon profiles Jean Chretien, the federal premier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the months leading up to last October's general election, some senior
members of the Liberal party quietly began to plot the downfall of their
leader, Mr Jean Chretien.
Mr Chretien had been a big disappointment in the three years since he won
the party leadership. He had failed to capitalise on the unpopularity of Mr
Brian Mulroney's Conservative government.
The opposition leader's heavily-accented English and less-than-perfect
French helped fuel the impression that he was out of his depth. His
fellow-Quebeckers had not forgotten or forgiven his role as justice minister
in outflanking the francophone province's separatist government during
constitutional talks in the early 1980s.
However, the dissatisfaction has evaporated since the Liberals' election
victory. The would-be plotters are now senior cabinet ministers. Most
Canadians - including non-Liberals - have come to regard their new prime
minister with respect, and even with quiet affection.
Mr Chretien's down-to-earth manner and his common sense approach to
government are a sharp contrast to Mr Mulroney's regal style. They have
proved an effective antidote to the revulsion felt by many Canadians against
their politicians and the political process.
Mr Patrick Gossage, a Toronto public relations consultant who has close
links with the Liberals, describes Mr Chretien as 'somebody who is by nature
not the slightest bit puffed-up, arrogant or self-satisfied'. Referring to
his home town in rural Quebec, Mr Chretien calls himself 'the little guy
from Shawinigan'. He has eschewed the official, armour-plated Cadillac
limousine used by Mr Mulroney for a taxi-like Chevrolet Caprice.
Mr Chretien is sometimes compared to former US President Harry Truman. But
like Mr Truman, the Canadian leader's folksy style masks a finely-honed
political compass.
Aged 60, Mr Chretien is one of Canada's most experienced politicians. He
celebrated his 30th anniversary as an MP last year, and his cabinet
experience stretches back to 1967.
He held almost every senior portfolio in the 1970s and early 1980s when Mr
Pierre Trudeau was prime minister. At times of despair in the Liberal camp
over the past few years, Mr Chretien's supporters would take solace that,
for all his drawbacks, their leader had never been tarred by a major mistake
or by scandal.
Since the start of last year's election campaign, Mr Chretien has steered
clear of the debate on Quebec sovereignty by insisting that the Liberals'
top priority is to create jobs, not squabble about the constitution.
But as another poll in Quebec draws nearer, he will find it increasingly
difficult to remain above the fray.
Like Mr Trudeau, his mentor, Mr Chretien has never made any secret of his
disdain for Quebec separatists. But in contrast to Mr Trudeau's coldly
logical arguments in favour of a united Canada, Mr Chretien wears his
patriotism on his sleeve.
'Whatever happens, I am personally convinced that it is possible to be a
proud Quebecker and a proud Canadian at the same time,' he wrote in his
recent autobiography. 'Far from being exclusive, they are complementary, for
without Canada Quebec cannot survive.'
Mr Chretien recalls his 93-year old father saying after the separatists'
defeat in the 1980 sovereignty referendum: 'I can die now, the Liberals are
back in power and Quebec will remain in Canada.'
Such views have not been popular, however, in Quebec where Mr Chretien is
portrayed in the media and by influential intellectuals as a bumbling Uncle
Tom.
According to a recent opinion poll in the Globe and Mail newspaper, almost
two-thirds of Quebeckers think the prime minister should remain neutral in
the looming battle over the province's place in Canada. However, it would be
out of character if he did so.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (4): Some progress in the provinces -
Laurie Morse looks at moves to dismantle internal trade barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's federal government has sealed historic international trade
agreements this year, but is still without a solution to the pervasive
inter-provincial non-tariff trade barriers that stifle growth and the free
flow of goods, services and capital within its own borders.
Intense negotiations between provincial ministers, the territories, and the
federal government may finally produce a solution to these internal trade
blockades this summer.
A certified accountant in New Brunswick, for example, is not allowed to
practise in neighbouring Prince Edward Island because professional licensing
requirements differ. Manitoba procurement agencies, in charge of the
province's liquor stores, will not purchase regional beers brewed elsewhere
in Canada. A forest products company in Ontario must buy electric power from
Ontario Hydro, even though electricity produced by neighbouring Manitoba
Hydro may be one-third the cost.
The lack of uniform trucking codes between provinces often forces Canadian
freight companies to make coast-to-coast deliveries via the US. Until
recently, a cable manufacturer wishing to sell wire to a provincial utility
had to have a factory in that province.
These are just a few examples of how protectionist attitudes in Canada's 10
provinces disrupt the free flow of internal trade. The problems these
barriers cause, long a festering issue at the federal level, have been
exacerbated recently by new international trade agreements like Nafta.
'With the Free Trade Agreement (with the US) it is sometimes easier for
people to trade north-south than east-west,' says Mr Robert Knox, executive
director of Canada's Internal Trade Secretariat in Ottawa.
'Canada's problem is that we're a relatively small domestic market. We want
to thrive in a global economy, but government practices have kept many
businesses from growing a strong domestic base. We've got to a point where
we can't afford it any more,' says Mr Knox.
Canada exported about Dollars 200bn in goods and services last year, and its
internal trade, while more difficult to measure, is nearly the same size,
economists say.
A study by the Canadian Manufacturers' Association in 1991 found that
provincial constraints in just two areas - government procurements and
agricultural marketing practices - cost Canadian taxpayers some Dollars 7bn
a year. However, Mr Jason Meyers, economist for the CMA, says that if one
could quantify the dynamic effects of lost trade, the figure would be much
higher.
As Canadian companies struggle to be internationally competitive, there is a
growing realisation in government and business circles that the benefits of
liberalised domestic trade could be higher than those offered by
protectionism.
But the process of achieving a common market is more difficult than issuing
a federal edict from Ottawa. Internal trade talks, initiated in 1987 when
Canada's federal government appointed a Committee of Ministers for Internal
Trade, have proved as difficult as those undertaken to cement international
trade compacts.
When the provinces and the federal government last seriously tried to solve
internal trade issues at constitutional talks two years ago, the effort fell
flat. Interest groups were so effective that the pact, had it passed, would
merely have preserved the status quo.
Since then, a persistent recession and objections to liberalised trade by
the NDP governments of Ontario and British Columbia - two of Canada's
largest commercial provinces - have further stalled talks. However, the CMIT
persisted and last year set a deadline of this month for concluding a
comprehensive agreement on internal trade, to be implemented in June 1995.
With the deadline looming, the ministers agreed two months ago to refine a
draft of a new internal trade agreement that addresses non-tariff trade
barriers in 11 industry sectors and contains a mechanism to arbitrate on
internal trade disputes.
Although the talks are not public, negotiators say that ministers from nine
of the 10 provinces have endorsed a draft agreement.
Whatever the final form, analysts agree that the CMIT's efforts will produce
progress in certain areas, if not a comprehensive free trade zone. An
agreement that would open up provincial procurement - a huge area that
encompasses everything from liquor to road, school and hospital construction
 -is under consideration, but may be difficult to ratify.
However, analysts say that at the very least Canada will get an agreement
that provides for uniform standards and regulations for professional
services, trucking and other industries, bringing the country a step closer
to an open market.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (2): The Liberals' good fortune - Bernard
Simon considers the government's economic policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chretien government has tried to steer a middle course in its economic
policies, balancing financial markets' demand for fiscal and monetary
discipline with the Liberals' campaign pledge to create jobs.
The result is that while the new government has not made any serious
mistakes during its first half-year in office, it cannot yet boast of any
dramatic achievements.
However, the Liberals have had the good fortune to take office at the best
possible time. They have escaped blame for the pain of high interest rates
and the initial shock of the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement, which
helped drive the Canadian economy into a deep recession from 1990 to 1992.
Now the benefits of these policies have started to become apparent.
Interest rates fell to their lowest levels in three decades before the US
Federal Reserve started tightening monetary policy last February. The banks'
prime lending rate had tumbled to 5.5 per cent from a peak of 14.75 per cent
in mid-1990, and the gap between US and Canadian interest rates was at its
narrowest since the late 1970s.
Inflation is virtually non-existent. Thanks partly to a cut in cigarette
taxes earlier this year, the consumer price index crept up by only 0.2 per
cent in the year to April.
Recession and free trade have also sharpened the competitive edge of many
Canadian companies. Workers now consider themselves lucky to get a 2-3 per
cent pay increase and productivity has improved markedly in recent years.
But the price has been stubbornly high unem- ployment, which stood at 11 per
cent in April.
The upturn has so far centred on the export sector which has been helped by
strong demand from the US and the slide in the Canadian dollar (from a peak
of 89 US cents in late 1991 to 73 US cents in late May).
These gains are gradually filtering through to the rest of the economy. With
luck, they will be reinforced by a further rise in prices for such key
exports as pulp and paper, metals, wheat and natural gas. ScotiaMcLeod, the
securities firm, forecasts that real GDP growth will accelerate to 3.4 per
cent this year and 4 per cent in 1995, from 2.6 per cent in 1993.
However, the outlook varies markedly across the country. British Columbia,
which has already benefited from record lumber prices, is expected to be
pushed further ahead by a recovery in other forest product and metal
markets, and by a continuing influx of immigrants from south-east Asia and
other Canadian provinces.
At the other end of the country (and the growth spectrum), Newfoundland's
economy has been devastated by the virtual disappearance of North Atlantic
cod stocks. Some 20,000 jobs have been lost in the east coast fishery,
putting one in five Newfoundlanders out of work.
Despite the forces working in their favour, the Liberals have not had an
entirely smooth ride. In particular, financial markets have been unsettled
by uncertainty over Quebec's future and the new government's priorities.
The Liberals initially sent a number of signals that their economic policies
would be kinder and gentler than the Tories, with job creation as important
a short-term goal as low inflation or deficit reduction.
The message was reinforced by the replacement of Mr John Crow as governor of
the Bank of Canada by his deputy, Mr Gordon Thiessen. Mr Crow carved out a
reputation as one of the industrial world's most ardent inflation fighters
during his seven years in office.
One of Mr Thiessen's first acts was to spell out slightly more flexible
inflation targets than those set by his predecessor. The present aim is to
hold inflation in a 1-3 per cent a year range until at least 1998.
The new finance minister and central bank governor threw financial markets
off balance again with a hesitant response to the US Federal Reserve's
tightening of monetary policy last February. Not only did the Canadian
dollar slide by three US cents between February and April, but interest
rates ended up rising far more steeply than in the US. The banks' prime
lending rate jumped back to 6.75 per cent by the end of April.
The consensus, however, is that interest rates are likely to stay flat or
decline a little in coming months, and that the economic recovery will
remain on track.
On fiscal policy, the Liberals pledged during the election campaign to bring
the federal deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP within three years, from a
projected 5.4 per cent in the fiscal year to March 31 1995.
The previous Conservative government badly underestimated the impact of the
recession on government revenues. Within two months of taking office, Mr
Paul Martin, the finance minister, revised the 1993-94 budget estimate
upwards from the Tories' rosy projection of CDollars 32.7bn to a record
CDollars 45bn.
Mr Martin's first budget, tabled last February, aims to cut the deficit to
CDollars 39.7bn in 1994-95 and CDollars 32.7bn the following year. He
announced the closure of a string of politically sensitive military
installations and renewed a freeze on civil servants' wages.
The biggest contribution to deficit reduction could come from a planned
overhaul of the once-sacrosanct social security net. These programmes, some
of which are administered by the provinces with financial support from
Ottawa, are by far the biggest single spending item in the federal budget.
The Liberals aim to spell out their reform proposals in next year's budget.
Financial markets have yet to be convinced, however, of the new government's
steadfastness. Analysts are encouraged that Mr Martin's economic assumptions
are more realistic than those of his Conservative predecessors.
But they worry that much of the drop in this year's deficit will be thanks
to measures announced by the previous government or accounting changes,
rather than brave new Liberal spending cuts.
The minister is sticking to his guns. 'There is no doubt that we are not
going to be able to solve our deficit problems by growth alone,' Mr Martin
said in late April. 'And what that means is a complete restructuring of
government. It is going to mean major, major cuts which will affect every
segment of our society.'
Despite the recent increase in borrowing costs, he remains confident of
meeting his deficit targets. Mr Martin has also pledged that his 1996 budget
will spell out a game plan to eliminate the deficit entirely. International
investors however, are likely to judge him by actions rather than words.

Impact of the North American free trade agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any Canadian businessman will agree that while ratification of the North
American free trade agreement (Nafta) late last year was important, it was
secondary to the US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA) sealed in 1989 during
Mr Brian Mulroney's period as prime minister. In its five-year life, the FTA
has had a far-reaching impact on the structure of Canadian business and on
Canada's commercial links with its biggest trading partner, the US.
However, free trade advocates who had hoped that the new US-Canada-Mexico
trade bloc would address some of the FTA's flaws have been disappointed.
Over the longer run, Nafta will open Mexican markets to Canadian exports,
but its most important function will be to cement trading practices between
the US and Canada already defined by the FTA. Mexico last year accounted for
less than 1 per cent of Canada's total exports, while the US absorbed 80 per
cent. Together, trade flows across the US-Canadian border totalled nearly
Dollars 400bn in 1993.
Free and open international trade is crucial to Canada, which is in the
midst of a export-led recovery after a long and trying recession. A country
of only 27m people with an economy a tenth the size of its southern
neighbour, it cannot afford costly trade disputes.
However, for all its promise, Nafta has not offered a means to resolve
subsidy and dumping disputes that have arisen between the US and Canada
under the FTA. Thus, the two governments are close to an embarrassing trade
war over Canadian wheat exports, just months after the Nafta accord was
reached.
Mr Roy MacLaren, the minister for international trade, told North American
business leaders recently that Canada's government was committed to
negotiating clear and agreed definitions of subsidies and dumping with its
Nafta partners. Had these existed, he said, it would have averted the wheat
controversy and other US-Canada trade disputes. 'They constitute a crucial
missing element necessary to secure market access within North America for
our companies,' he declared.
Regardless of the disputes, the sheer size of trade between the two
countries has shaped Canadian business, part- icularly since the FTA was put
in place. Total value of merchandise trade between the US and Canada has
jumped 42 per cent since 1989, and the integration of North American
operations for big inter- national companies such as Ford and General Motors
has been remarkable.
Mr Gerry Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers, says that Nafta 'was not a huge win' for his industry.
'Liberalisation of energy trade between the US and Canada was already
occurring at a very rapid rate,' he adds. 'Nafta insures that develop- ment
will continue to expand.'
If the FTA provides a clue, Canada's energy business will boom as trade
becomes freer. Canada's exports of natural gas to the US, for example, have
increased 25 per cent in five years. Its oil export revenues exceed Dollars
10bn and comprise more than 40 per cent of total Canadian production.
Under Nafta, Mexico's state oil company, Pemex, will keep its monopoly over
most of the country's oil production. However, Mexico will allow foreign
investment in petro- chemicals, pipelines, refine- ries, electricity
generation, and other 'downstream' energy activities. This, Mr Protti says,
will open up many opportunities for Canadian energy companies, which also
stand to benefit from increased exports to the US as US production companies
pursue natural gas exports to Mexico.
And, he is confident, as Mexico becomes accustomed to life under Nafta,
'upstream' oil and gas exploration and extraction will gradually open to
Mexico's Nafta partners.
Canadian telecom- munications and trans- portation companies are already
feeling renewed benefits in Mexico, with companies such as Northern Telecom
entering agreements to provide telephone equipment to the newly opened
market.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (1): A weary wait for Quebec's verdict -
The economy is on the mend, but the political scene is becoming more stormy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most nations only dream of emulating Canada's recent achievements. How many,
after all, can boast that they have signed free trade agreements with their
biggest trading partner and with one of the world's most vibrant emerging
economies; that they have pushed inflation down virtually to zero; changed
governments after a free and peaceful election; and, to cap it all, produced
North America's champion baseball team two years in a row?
Canada has done all these things, and is starting to reap the rewards.
Before the US Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in February,
Canadian interest rates had slid to their lowest level in 30 years. Equally
significant, the gap between Canadian and US interest rates was at its
narrowest in decades. With exports leading the way, the economy is on track,
at least for the time being, for a steady, non-inflationary recovery.
At the same time, Canadian workers' productivity has improved dramatically.
Companies have sharpened their competitive edge, broadening their horizons
in the US, Mexico, Latin America and south-east Asia.
Canada also deserves credit for at last starting to tackle some of the
structural handicaps which for years have kept the economy from reaching its
full potential.
One is the generous unemployment insurance and welfare system which has kept
Canadian cities remarkably free of beggars and slums, but has raised public
sector deficits and trapped thousands of able-bodied people at the bottom of
the social ladder. The new Liberal government, which came to office in last
October's general election, has launched a vigorous overhaul of the
once-sacred social security programmes.
The government plans to unveil reforms within a year which are likely to
link benefits more closely to training and work. In a remark which would
have been unthinkable even as recently as last year's election campaign, Mr
Jean Chretien, the prime minister, observed in mid-April that 'it's better
to have (people) at 50 per cent productivity than to be sitting at home
drinking beer'.
Meanwhile, the 10 provinces are inching towards an agreement to dismantle
the pervasive non-tariff barriers which have kept British Columbia wine out
of Ontario liquor stores, and New Brunswick workers from Quebec construction
sites. A growing number of influential Canadians realise that their
education system is badly in need of repair - though progress so far in
fixing it has been slow.
Regrettably, these signs of renewal do not tell the full story of Canada in
spring 1994. A gloomier dimension is evident in the stunning results of last
October's general election.
The Liberals won a comfortable majority, returning to office for the first
time since 1984. But Canada's two other national parties, the Progressive
Conservatives (which had won the two previous elections) and the
left-of-centre New Democrats, were virtually annihilated. Despite gaining 16
per cent of the popular vote, the Tories won just two seats.
The opposition benches are now filled by two regional parties which did not
exist seven years ago, and whose policies are the antithesis of the
qualities of compromise and tolerance for which Canadians are justly famous.
The Bloc Quebecois, whose avowed priority is to turn Quebec from a province
of Canada into an independent country, holds the incongruous title of Her
Majesty's Loyal Opposition.
The Reform party, all but one of whose MPs come from the four provinces west
of Ontario, wants to scrap national bilingualism and opposes any special
deal with Quebec which might prevent the francophone province from breaking
away. Reform's economic policies are well to the right even of the defeated
Conservatives.
The two new opposition par- ties have undeniably brought some fresh air to
Canadian politics. The BQ has so far been the more effective of the two.
Although its MPs spend most of their time as Quebec's cheerleaders in
Ottawa, some have also been thoughtful critics of national policies,
especially of the proposed
cuts in social programmes.
Reform's penny-pinching MPs seldom allow a Question Period to pass without
politely reminding the Liberals of the long shadow cast across Canada's
economic prospects by the towering budget deficit. The federal deficit
reached a record CDollars 45.7bn, or 5.4 per cent of gross domestic product,
in the year to March 31 1994.
Aside from the occasional skirmish, the governing Liberals and the two
opposition parties have yet to lock horns on their profoundly different
visions of Canada. Mr Chretien, for his part, has so far sought to avoid
confrontation on the Quebec issue, in favour of setting the new government's
economic, social and foreign affairs agenda.
The political scene is becoming more stormy, however, as a provincial
election draws nearer in Quebec. The vote, which will most likely be held in
September, will determine whether Canada must endure yet another period of
hand-wringing and navel-gazing over the future of Quebec.
A victory by the separatist Parti Quebecois, the BQ's provincial cousins,
would pave the way for an unsettling period lasting at least a year, and
probably much longer.
The PQ, which currently leads in opinion polls in Quebec, plans to start the
breakaway process immediately after the election. It has promised to hold an
independence referendum within 12 months.
The separatists have spread a soothing message, reassuring Quebeckers that
independence would eliminate the inefficiencies of a 10-province federal
system while maintaining the benefits of the North American free trade
agreement and close economic ties with Canada.
Proponents of national unity, led by Mr Daniel Johnson, Quebec's new Liberal
premier (with the federal Liberals in the wings), are using a differ- ent
tactic from earlier constit- utional wrangles. During the 1980s, federal
Tories and Quebec Liberals pandered to Quebec nationalism by promising
greater autonomy for the province within the Canadian federation.
But Mr Johnson has taken a more aggressively federalist approach. He has
told Quebeckers that the best way to create jobs and to safeguard their
future is through a strong, united Canada.
Business leaders generally endorse that view, but are nervous about speaking
out. Those that have raised their voices in recent years - including Royal
Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, and most
recently, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare products group - have found
themselves accused of blackmail.
The conventional wisdom in Montreal is that, while many Quebeckers are keen
for a change of government after nine years of Liberal rule, they will not
be willing to take the much bigger gamble of breaking away from Canada.
But the longer the squabble over Quebec's future continues, the greater the
chances that the separatists will eventually prevail. With defenders of a
strong, central government thin on the ground in recent years, the transfer
of one power after another from Ottawa has seemed almost inevitable.
Outside Quebec, the willingness of Canadians to keep fighting for a united
country cannot be taken for granted.
Many English-speaking Canadians have become weary with the bickering, now
spanning almost two decades, over Quebec's place in Canada. The view is now
widespread, especially in the Reform party's western stronghold, that while
Quebec is welcome to stay, it should be wished good riddance if it decides
to go its own way.
Mr Mike Harcourt, British Columbia's premier, told the Globe and Mail
newspaper in mid-May that 'Quebec and BC are natural allies in a renewed
Canada and would be the best of friends. But if they decided to separate, we
wouldn't be the best of friends, we'd be the worst of enemies.'
A victory by Mr Johnson's Liberals in the forthcoming election would
seriously weaken the PQ, and probably cripple the Bloc Quebecois. If the PQ
wins, however, the 1994 poll may mark the ironic point in history where,
just as Canada was starting to revitalise itself, it also started to fall
apart.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Obituary: Lord Thorneycroft - cabinet minister and party
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A lost cabinet battle over curbing public expenditure and the brilliant
generalship which helped to achieve the 1979 general election victory
launching Baroness Thatcher on her 11-year premiership were the two peaks in
the distinguished political career of Lord Thorneycroft, who has died at the
age of 84.
His firm advocacy of monetarist policies was central to both those
outstanding events - separated by an interval of 21 years - during his terms
as chancellor and as chairman of the Conservative party.
Lady Thatcher's initial insistence that the palliative of printing money
could no longer be used to treat the nation's economic ills reflected the
unheeded warnings given by Peter Thorneycroft when he resigned as chancellor
in January 1958, just 12 months after he had succeeded Harold Macmillan as
the occupant of 11 Downing Street.
The resignation was timed to achieve maximum effect. It was tendered on the
eve of Macmillan's departure on the first extended tour of the Commonwealth
undertaken by a British prime minister after the second world war.
Thorneycroft, with strong support from his two ministerial lieutenants at
the Treasury, Mr Enoch Powell, financial secretary, and Nigel Birch,
economic secretary, had sought to hold down the estimates so that current
expenditure in 1958-59 did not exceed the total for the previous year.
In cabinet Thorneycroft was out-manoeuvred by Macmillan, whose pro-Keynesian
attitude mirrored the memories of the hardships resulting from mass
unemployment in the 1930s, which he had seen at first hand as MP for
Stockton-on-Tees.
The prime minister's persuasive arguments for a more flexible approach left
Thorneycroft isolated in a cabinet still struggling to restore the
equilibrium of the Conservative party after the Suez crisis.
The chancellor said in his resignation letter: 'I recognise that in order to
achieve my aim some combination of politically unpopular courses would have
been necessary. I never-theless regard the limitation of government
expenditure as a prerequisite to the stability of the pound, the
stabilisation of prices and the prestige and standing of our country in the
world.'
Mr Powell and Birch left office at the same time. Macmillan went ahead with
his Commonwealth tour, dismissing the resignations of the three Treasury
ministers as 'a little local difficulty'.
It was two decades later, and after another Tory chancellor (the then
Anthony Barber) had acquiesced in policies which resulted in sterling M3
rising by about 25 per cent in 1972 and 1973, before Thorneycroft, as party
chairman, saw the monetarist principle he had espoused endorsed by the then
Mrs Thatcher and her shadow cabinet.
During his tenure as chancellor, Thorneycroft was at the centre of another
damaging political storm. In September 1957 there were allegations that his
decision to increase the bank rate by 2 percentage points - it went up to
the then crisis level of 7 per cent, its highest point for 36 years - had
been 'leaked'.
Mr Harold Wilson (now Lord Wilson), then the shadow chancellor, led a
sustained campaign for a public inquiry in which he relied heavily on what
he called 'very disquieting reports in a number of responsible newspaper and
City circles'. Those suggested that there had been considerable selling in
the gilt-edged markets on September 18 and 19 as a result of advance
information about the bank rate increase.
Innuendo abounded as Thorneycroft strongly repudiated any suggestion of
impropriety. A tribunal presided over by Lord Justice Parker found that
there was 'no justification for allegations that information about the
raising of the bank rate was improperly disclosed to any person'.
Thorneycroft, who first entered the cabinet as president of the board of
trade in Churchill's 1951 administration, spent more than two years on the
Tory backbenches, amid rumours that he was about to renew an earlier
flirtation with the vocal but politically impotent Liberals.
Macmillan, in an adept exercise in political management, persuaded
Thorneycroft to return to office in July 1960 as minister of aviation. He
moved closer to the upper reaches of the cabinet when appointed minister of
defence in 1962.
Thorneycroft was widely praised for the skill and tact with which he
overcame old inter-service rivalries to integrate the three service
departments into a unified Ministry of Defence. He became the first
secretary of state for defence in April 1964.
After the Tory election defeat in October 1964 Thorneycroft occupied a
prominent place on the opposition front bench in the Commons. He was seen by
some of his parliamentary colleagues as a possible alternative to Mr Edward
Heath (now Sir Edward) and Reginald Maudling in the somewhat confused
atmosphere which marked the approach to the leadership contest after the
resignation of Sir Alec Douglas-Home (now Lord Home) in 1965.
His opportunity depended on the emergence of a deep division in the
parliamentary party with the choice between the two principals ending in
deadlock. Maudling's decision to withdraw after the clear preference shown
for Mr Heath in the first ballot left Thorneycroft a non-runner in the
leadership stakes.
Thorneycroft became a life peer in 1967 and quickly proved to be as
formidable a debater in the calmer atmosphere of the upper chamber as he had
been when the Commons was at its most boisterous. His harmonious
relationship with Mrs Thatcher, however, did not last indefinitely. He was
replaced as party chairman in 1981 after suggesting that some of her
policies were unduly harsh.
His ministerial experience was buttressed by a detailed knowledge of company
management. At different times he was chairman of Pirelli General and
Trusthouse Forte.

FT  06 JUN 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Apathy rules on Hurd's
home ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 9pm and Mr Douglas Hurd is on home ground. About 40 people, not his
best crowd, have come to hear the foreign secretary at a public meeting in
the Oxfordshire town of Witney.
Europe is not a subject calculated to persuade the people of the surrounding
Cotswolds to abandon their sitting rooms for the draughty auditorium of the
town's ancient Corn Exchange. Much better to watch on television the
ceremonies commemorating the D-day landings 50 years ago. Anyway, Mr Hurd
has represented the area in parliament for 20 years. Familiarity breeds
apathy.
Mr Hurd, ending a day on the campaign trail, decides to strike a positive
note. With his eye on a group of inquisitive teenagers shuffling in the back
row he reminds us what the EU is all about.
We take for granted there will never be another D-day. 'Britons and Germans
and Frenchmen and Italians will never fight each other again.' He adds: 'We
don't want to go back to the days when it wasn't so - and to start filling
the cemeteries again.'
It is a change of tack. For much of the day he has been echoing the more
familiar themes of the Conservatives' campaign for Thursday's European
elections. The government will prevent Britain's national identity being
submerged in a centralised European Union. It will preserve the veto. It
will promote a multi-speed, multi-track Europe in which governments can opt
in or out of further integration.
This is the message that Mr John Major's government has decided will play
best on the doorstep. Its strategy has a single purpose: to galvanise enough
core support to prevent an inevitable defeat turning into a humiliating
rout. That may prove impossible. But waving the Union Jack offers the best
chance.
Mr Hurd the Eurosceptic does not sound as convincing as Mr Hurd the
statesman who knows that Britain's security and prosperity are inextricably
bound to Europe.
But his political authority and his credentials as a good European allow him
to be at once critical of and positive about Europe. He understands the
difference between patriotism and nationalism.
So it is a nice irony that Witney forms part of the sprawling European
constituency where the result will spell the difference between defeat and
disaster for the government.
The Cotswolds seat has been represented by Lord (Henry) Plumb since 1979.
Five of the six parliamentary constituencies encompassed by a boundary
stretching from the west of Gloucestershire to the edge of Oxford are held
by Tory MPs. In other times it would be unthinkable for such a slice of
affluent England to elect anyone but a Tory.
But boundary changes have replaced two Tory strongholds with the Labour
enclave of the Forest of Dean. The Liberal Democrats have marched into the
area's town halls. The risk - as Lord Plumb warns potential supporters at
every opportunity - is that Tory voters will punish the government for
domestic policy mistakes by abstaining.
Travelling with the foreign secretary through the towns and villages, that
risk is all too apparent. As Mr Hurd sips a half-pint of beer in the Beehive
pub in Carterton, Mr Michael Bulley, a local party activist, admits that
there is no real enthusiasm for the Tory effort: 'A lot of Conservatives are
sitting on their hands . . . I haven't seen a poster yet.'
Things have improved in the past few days as Mr Major's message about
preserving British sovereignty has started to get across. But the voters are
keener to talk about local or national issues.
It is the same in Woodstock, the affluent home of Blenheim Palace. Here
elderly local activists are preoccupied with council tax bills, rising crime
rates and their dependency on a single grocery shop.
Mr Hurd exhorts them to focus on issues European, to tell their neighbours
that the choice is 'between voting for sensible people like Henry (Lord
Plumb) who believe in a Europe of nation states and the Libs and Labs who
want to push more power to the centre in Brussels'.
He draws a response of which Lord Tebbit would be proud. Mrs Peggy Morris, a
retired party stalwart, knows where she stands: 'The thing I dislike
intensely is being ruled by the Germans and those others.'
And therein lies the risk to Mr Hurd's careful strategy.
He developed the theme, now taken up by Mr Major, of a multi-speed,
multi-track Europe to reconcile the reality of the nation state with the
imperative of closer European co-operation. In Mr Hurd's mind this so-called
'variable geometry' is a practical expression of the future shape of a union
which may soon embrace 20 nations.
His confidence that others will recognise the case for flexibility rather
than centralisation is real rather than obstructionist. Mr Hurd is agnostic
about a European single currency. He does not see the case for any
significant extension of the union's competences. But he does believe that
in foreign and defence policy Europe must intensify, not weaken,
co-operation.
The problem is that he has handed a powerful weapon to the Euro-sceptics.
His idea has conferred respectability on the notion that Britain can draw a
line in the sand. Whatever the rest of the EU decides in the way of further
integration, Britain can opt out.
Mr Hurd caught a glimpse of the danger on the campaign trail. During
canvassing in a Cotswold shopping complex a passing voter offered
unsolicited approval for the Tory campaign. He was all for defending British
interests. The foreign secretary turned and beamed. Until the middle-aged
man offered a parting shot: 'Bring back Maggie, that's what I say.'

<TEXT>
The comment, voiced after one of the ill-attended press conferences at
Central Office, sums it up: 'The Conservatives have won the Euro-campaign
but lost the election.' The thrusts by the prime minister on beggars, the
national veto and on multi-track Europe - distasteful though they were to
many in his own party - have not yet reaped a reward in the opinion polls.
Indeed the Conservatives are at their lowest ebb since Dr Gallup's invention
came to Britain more than 50 years ago. On Friday the Daily Telegraph showed
the Conservatives in third place. Their support at 21 per cent was 33
percentage points behind Labour. On Saturday the Glasgow Herald put them at
10 per cent in Scotland, 43 percentage points behind Labour (in the first
Euro-election, in 1979, the Conservatives secured 34 per cent of the
Scottish vote, equal with Labour, and won five of the eight Scottish seats).
The omens get worse. In the most sophisticated analysis yet offered, John
Cartice in the Independent on Sunday suggested that the Conservatives may be
heading for only two seats out of 87. He pointed out that, even if the polls
were as wrong as they were in 1992, they would indicate only 12 Conservative
MEPs.
Yet in another analysis, for Kleinwort Benson merchant bank, John Cartice
and Peter Spencer show that, if the electorate was reacting as it once did
to trends in unemployment and inflation and economic growth, Conservative
support should be standing at 42 per cent and not 21 per cent.
They say that the abandonment of the European exchange rate mechanism had as
devastating and fundamental an effect on government support as the
devaluation in 1967 or the IMF crisis of 1976.
The Conservatives are in trouble because voters are polarising.
The opinion polls point to a great Labour surge which should win them the
Tories' residual seats in industrial England and in London. The Liberal
Democrat emphasis on tactical voting threatens Conservative strongholds from
Land's End to Dover and even the mini-thrust of the UK Independence party
endangers the few seats where they have best hopes of clinging on.
Labour has only one seat to worry about seriously: can the Scottish National
party snatch North East Scotland from it? Anxiety which some express about
North Wales and Mid and West Wales is probably misplaced.
Regional variation, low turnout and tactical voting make prediction
difficult. But every Conservative seat is at risk.
The table gives, in rough order, the seats in which the Tories have the best
chance of survival and the 10 best bets for the Liberal Democrats.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Binder partners to go in merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 12 per cent of the partners in BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's
eighth-largest accountancy practice, will lose their jobs before a merger
with Arthur Andersen is finalised during the summer, it emerged yesterday.
About 10 of the 86 Binder partners in the firm's London and Leeds
partnerships will resign or take early retirement in the next few months
before a merger with Andersen, the UK's fourth largest firm.
Similar proportions of jobs will be lost in the other regional Binder
partnerships merging with Andersen - Manchester, Newcastle and possibly
Birmingham in some form of associate relationship.
Binder stressed, however, that those who would leave already knew, and the
job losses were unrelated to the imminent merger.
Andersen entered talks for a merger with Binder earlier this year after
developing plans in secret since last October. The merger will almost double
the number of the firm's audit clients and should provide substantial
opportunities for it to cross-sell its services.
Andersen insists that Binder will remain a separate partnership, with some
'cross fertilisation' of management and shared training, but with Binder
retaining its clients.
Andersen believes it would destroy goodwill and lose clients if it simply
tried to destroy the Binder name and subsume the partnership entirely within
its own organisation.
Under existing plans all Binder partners in the merged firm will continue to
report to Mr Adrian Burn, Binder's current managing partner who helped
broker the merger, - although nothing formal defining this structure has
been put in the contract.
Mr Jim Wadia, Andersen's managing partner in the UK, said: 'The intention is
to retain the Binder brand name in the UK. Our experience of other mergers
is to be flexible, nimble and to respond to the demands and needs of the
market.'
There will be no payment in the merger, but most Binder partners will be
salaried partners of Andersen's UK firm. Some Binder partners will be
shareholders in Andersen's worldwide partnership.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Call for tax curb on forex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange speculators should be taxed to curb their influence on
international markets, says Professor James Tobin, a Nobel prize-winning
economist at Yale University.
Writing in New Economy, the journal of the centre-left Institute for Public
Policy Research, he describes speculation on currencies as a 'threat to
rational policies' and proposes putting 'sand in the wheels' of currency
markets.
Prof Tobin says that the tax would 'direct traders' attention to long-run
fundamentals and away from contagious but transient market sentiment'.
His views were in part contradicted in speech by Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England, at the weekend. He told the Forex 94 conference in
London that 'there is a popular misperception of the foreign exchange
markets as a huge, single-minded pack of wolves, acting in unison to hunt
down and destroy one largely defenceless currency after another in an
insatiable lust for short-term profit'.
Conceding that free capital movements, and short-term speculators, could
complicate the life of central bankers, Mr George went on: 'But there are
legions of others, who look . . . like speculators, often managing other
people's funds, who are seeking to protect the value of the assets they
control against losses, by diversifying risks or covering their currency
exposures.'

FT  06 JUN 94 / Major hangs campaign on integration fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday launched a last-ditch attempt to stave off disaster
for the Conservatives in Thursday's European elections by stepping up his
attack on the dangers of greater European integration.
The prime minister used a wide-ranging television interview to emphasise
that his 'instincts' were not in favour of a single European currency and to
predict that the European Union would 'break' if it did not develop more
flexibly.
Pressed on his own future Mr Major said that the government had a five-year
programme and he expected to carry it through. It would be 'perfectly
proper' for someone to use the party's leadership procedure to mount a
challenge in the autumn. If that happened 'I will take on whomsoever the
contestant may be and I would hope and expect to beat that contestant'.
He said he would 'pick my own time' for the cabinet reshuffle, expected
during the summer. This would not be affected in any way by the date of the
coming Labour leadership election.
But, as the main parties reduced the intensity of their Euro-election
campaigning to accommodate yesterday's commemoration of the D-day landings,
Mr Major declined to predict the election's result.
A recent opinion poll put the Conservatives in third place more than 30
percentage points behind Labour, suggesting the party could be reduced to a
handful of seats.
Such a result, coming within a month of the Tories' local election
humiliation, would revive doubts about Mr Major's leadership and bring
renewed speculation that a challenge to the prime minister could be mounted
this autumn.
The Conservatives hold 32 seats in the European parliament compared with 45
for Labour. A haul of fewer than a dozen seats this time would be regarded
as a serious setback for Mr Major.
Interviewed on BBC-TV's Frost on Sunday, the prime minister said that to
argue for the flexibility of a 'multi-speed' Europe, as he did at a rally at
Ellesmere Port last week, was not to argue against the EU.
Europe had 'slowly, unobtrusively' been moving in that direction for some
time. The EU had to develop 'in a more flexible way', he said. 'I believe if
it doesn't then it will break.'
Sir David Steel, foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats,
attacked the government for being 'shackled' by the Euro-sceptics on its own
back benches.
Labour concentrated its assault on tax, where it hopes the primary focus of
the campaign will rest in the approach to polling day.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Defence unions voice job worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing workers in the defence sector are trying to use the
European election campaign to focus attention on the prospect of tens of
thousands of job losses.
They are challenging the government's claim that support services can be
trimmed without affecting defence capacity, and accusing ministers of
delaying the announcement of sweeping changes in an attempt to reduce the
political cost.
Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary for public services at the TGWU general
union, said: 'Ministers are concealing catastrophe until after the
elections.'
He believes job losses in the defence sector could be a crucial issue in at
least one Lancashire constituency, and throughout the south-west, a
Conservative stronghold with strong military and naval associations.
The unions hope that raising the jobs issue during the election campaign
will deflect the government from postponing a controversial announcement
until just before the summer recess.
Mr Dromey said: 'They must not be allowed to frustrate parliamentary
scrutiny and proper consultation by announcing major cuts to Britain's
defence capacity, and tens of thousands of job losses, just as MPs are
disappearing to Tuscany.'
Mr John Clark, head of the Ministry of Defence section at the NUCPS civil
service union, said the unions wanted a 'proper strategic review' of
military spending. He said: 'The government is trying to carve out a new
imperial role for itself by interfering in wars across the world, yet no
consideration is being given to the infrastructure of our economy or
Britain's own defence needs.'
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has promised a statement soon on
the results of the Defence Costs Studies, an effort to trim Pounds 750m from
the ministry's budget without compromising military capability.
At least 33 studies are in progress, and the proposals are understood to
include closing several ministry buildings in London, shutting Royal Navy
and Royal Air Force staff colleges and cutting the forces' in-house capacity
in areas such as transport, medical care and weapons maintenance.
The MoD trade unions expect 15,000 civilian and 10,000 military posts to be
shed as an immediate result of the DCS, and they are urging members to raise
the issue with all European election candidates.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Currency details 'lacking'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a quarter of British companies with foreign currency exposure provide
any meaningful disclosure, according to Company Reporting, the monthly
Edinburgh-based monitor of company accounts.
In a sample of 520 companies' latest annual reports, 76 per cent showed some
evidence of foreign currency exposure but only 27 per cent of these provided
significant detail.
The analysis comes as there is increasing attention on the potential
liabilities which are incurred by businesses by foreign currency hedging and
other derivatives or financial instruments, such as swaps and options.
Company Reporting says the degree of information provided has risen
considerably since three years ago, when only 15 per cent of companies
analysed their currency exposure in any detail.
The survey considered the analysis of currency exposure for company debt,
assets, cashflow and general treasury management matters. It found that many
businesses rarely provided quantified data.
Most companies offering some analysis considered indebtedness and a small
proportion analysed assets by currency. Only one company - Reuters -
analysed cashflow by foreign currency exposure.
Company Reporting also notes that companies are not showing scrip dividends
 -payment of shares instead of cash to shareholderes - in the spirit of new
accounting standards.
It says FRS4 and FRS5 should require scrip dividends as a charge against
profits, as are cash dividends.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Prescott targets full employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott, the most likely 'traditionalist' candidate for the Labour
leadership, is preparing to put full employment at the centre of his
leadership campaign.
The shadow employment secretary - who refuses to say whether he will run
until after Thursday's European elections - is widely expected to declare
his candidacy the next day.
Such a move would pit him against Mr Tony Blair, the leading Labour
'moderniser' and overwhelming favourite to succeed John Smith as leader.
Other candidates may include Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's present
leader.
Friends of Mr Prescott say the pugnacious MP for Hull East would use a
leadership campaign to press for a much clearer definition of what the
party's commitment to full employment means.
They say he believes that full employment could be turned into the main
issue of the campaign.
Ten days ago Mr Prescott called for a return to the socialist values of the
1945 Labour government in a speech that was billed as the launch of his
leadership campaign.
Last week he said he thought there should be a contest, arguing that an
election was 'an essential part of the democratic process'.
This view is thought to be shared by Mr Blair, whose supporters see a
contest - which they are convinced he would win - as an invaluable means of
shoring up his authority.
The Blair camp has been anxious to let it be known that unsuccessful
challengers would not be punished for opposing him.
They have stressed that no promises have been given to any colleagues
regarding specific future shadow cabinet positions under Mr Blair.
This includes Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor and close confidant of
Mr Blair, who decided to stand aside from the race last week.
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Blair might delay the formal announcement
of his candidacy until early next week rather than on Friday, when
nominations open.
Such a move would avoid attention being diverted from the European election
results, which could be very favourable for Labour.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery is to some extent being hindered by 'significant'
increases in externally imposed extra costs on business, such as crime
prevention, says a survey of financial directors published today by the
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
Financial directors in both the private and public sectors listed health and
safety costs as one of the fastest rising items in their budgets.
While the majority of respondents agreed it was right for health and safety
regulations to be tightened, they pointed out that costs in this area had
risen at a far greater rate than average costs.
Companies in the south-east were also concerned about large rises in
insurance premiums for cover against terrorism.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Positive verdict on impact of Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's technical advisers have decided that it is possible to go
ahead with a new conventional Channel 5 without damaging the prospects of
developing digital television, Raymond Snoddy writes.
A report by the Radio Communications Agency, the specialist agency
responsible for radio frequencies, has decided that it is possible to have
the best of both worlds. The positive verdict on Channel 5 was delivered in
a report to Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary on Friday.
The agency's recommendation, based partly on work carried out by engineers
at National Transcom, the privatised former research and transmission
division of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, will involve an element
of compromise.
Mr Brooke will meet Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
within the next 10 days to reach a joint position before the issue goes to
cabinet for final decision.
The view at the Department of Trade and Industry has been for some time that
the prospects of digital as opposed to the present analogue television
system should not be allowed to be jeopardised by allowing Channel 5 to go
ahead. Mr Brooke has called for more research to see whether the two were
are incompatible.
The precise shape of the compromises involved are seen as a political
decision. Under old plans for Channel 5, for example, the new channel could
have reached about three-quarters of the UK population. By ensuring that
enough frequencies are kept available for the development of digital Channel
5 could lose some of its potential reach.

FT  06 JUN 94 / House conditions 'alarming'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One in 13 homes in the UK is unfit for human habitation under official
criteria, says a report published today to mark the start of National
Housing Week. It says at least Pounds 22bn is needed to deal with urgent
repairs.
The National Housing Forum, an umbrella organisation representing a range of
organisations involved in housing, says the rate of demolition is so slow
that properties now being built will need to last 4,000 years - the age of
Stonehenge. The forum says one in six homes needs urgent repairs costing
more than Pounds 1,000. Urgent repairs are those that would lead to further
substantial damage if not tackled, including water leaks, serious dampness
or dangerous wiring.
The report warns that housing conditions have reached alarming levels, with
the majority of homes in poor condition being owner-occupied.
It calls for an increase in the rate of demolition of unsound and
substandard properties. The rate has fallen from more than 80,000 properties
a year at the start of the 1970s to fewer than 5,000 in 1991-92.
It recommends that owner-occupiers who cannot afford to repair their homes
should be helped with equity-sharing loans and social security payments.
Building societies and other lenders should be more active in encouraging
borrowers to keep their homes in good condition, it says.

FT  06 JUN 94 / CBI urges 25% increase in university education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
University education should be expanded by 25 per cent with parents
contributing much of the extra funds, the Confederation of British Industry
says today.
It says higher education should cover 40 per cent of 18-year-olds, instead
of the present 32 per cent and the government's 33 per cent target.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman of the CBI's education and training affairs
committee and chairman of Cadbury-Schweppes, describes government plans to
halt university expansion for a few years as 'rationing higher education'
and 'a switch from the market-based, demand-led approach which has been such
a success'.
The CBI proposals would create a 'funding gap' of Pounds 3bn a year,
compared with current spending of about Pounds 80m, but the CBI says the
provision of extra places would meet 'strong unmet student demand' while
narrowing the gap in skills compared with the UK's competitors.
It says expansion could be funded from three sources:
More targeted grants for maintenance, with increases for children from poor
backgrounds balanced by cuts for children from wealthy families, who should
not even be eligible for a subsidised loan.
Universities could deliver efficiency savings of 4 per cent a year to reduce
unit costs.
Public funding for higher education should take a constant proportion of
national income, growing in line with the growth of the economy.
Mr Cadbury said students should not have to contribute towards their own
tuition. But the CBI suggests a green paper on possible extra sources of
funds if demand for higher education continues to rise.
Mr Tim Boswell, the higher education minister, said there would be no green
paper as government policy on the issue - to increase maintenance loans
while cutting grants - was fixed until 1997.
He said: 'I do not share the CBI's view that burdens on parents should be
increased. Our policy is to share the cost of student living expenses more
fairly between graduates, taxpayers and parents.' He added that it would be
impractical for universities and colleges to continue to expand 'at the
recent breathtaking rate' while maintaining quality everywhere - hence the
short period of consolidation.
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents
university managements, welcomed the report but denied that continued
efficiency gains were possible.

FT  06 JUN 94 / Selling beer for a smoked-salmon life: Motoko Rich and
William Lewis on the trade driving brewers into disagreement with the
Treasury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In the hot, dusty car park of a warehouse less than a mile from the Calais
ferry port in France three British men loaded 40 cases of German lager into
a tatty red van.
As they shoved boxes between plastic bags of duty-free whisky and wine they
traded insults and braggadacio with the staff of EastEnders, a cash and
carry which caters to bulk buyers. 'This lot will all be gone tomorrow,' a
twenty-something man boasted.
Identified only as Ernie, he lurched forward and declared: 'I make bundles
of money. You want to know how much? Think smoked salmon on Friday, veal on
Sunday.' His friend, about 30-years-old with freckles, a visible belly and a
fading tattoo, talked specifics. 'We sell it around and it's Pounds 1,000 a
week for each of us,' he said. 'It's hard work, but it's worth it.'
These men, and others like them - including an 11-man gang from Cardiff
whose three ringleaders were jailed last week - are taking advantage of the
mammoth duty differential between the UK and France.
A duty ratio of seven to one on beer, nearly 50 to one on wine and just over
two to one on spirits has prompted them to shuttle between the UK and the
Continent to bring back alcohol for re-sale at home.
Such activities have initiated a growing rift between brewers and the
government. Mr Robin Simpson, director of the Brewers and Licensed
Retailers' Association, says the duty differential provides a 'direct
incentive to organised crime'.
Brewers claim sales of smuggled beer are eroding the British drinks market
at the rate of Pounds 1bn a year. They also say the illegal trade costs the
Treasury Pounds 40m a year in beer duty and value added tax alone.
These industry protests have met with scepticism at the Treasury. Sir John
Cope, the paymaster-general, said: 'There has not so far been a
haemorrhaging of duty receipts.' In 1993, the first year of the single
market when travellers in the European Union could bring in alcohol up to
the level of personal consumption, revenue from alcohol duty was up, if only
by less than 1 per cent for beer receipts. Customs &amp; Excise estimates the
dutiable value of all undetected bootleg goods - beer, wine, spirits and
tobacco - at Pounds 35m. But Customs officers on the ground say their
policing efforts only 'touch on the subject' and anecdotes of a burgeoning
black market in excise goods are rife.
So how much is going on and how organised is it?
The recent conviction of the Cardiff gang, as well as a Wolverhampton trio
who admitted evading duty on alcohol and cigarettes worth more than Pounds
73,000 last month, has led to suspicions of a growing organised element.
But most of the stories - and the cases which Customs has dealt with -
concern small-time operators, unemployed or low-paid people trying to make
some extra money.
Mr Don Price, a senior Customs officer in south Wales, said: 'We believe the
entrepreneur type of bootlegger - the guy who hires a van and goes over to
France and then flogs the stuff around the council estates - is the most
prevalent at the moment.'
In two trips to Calais over the past two weeks we found that Transit vans,
assumed by brewers to be used primarily for carrying alcohol for re-sale in
the UK, comprised no more than 10 per cent of vehicles on ferries. One group
we met in Calais said they made the trip from the Isle of Dogs in London to
France or Belgium five times a week. One said: 'The key is having a buyer
lined up beforehand. I have a mate who goes on a milk round.'
John, another Londoner who travels regularly to France and brings back
vanloads of beer or wine to sell to friends and family, seems typical of the
illegal trade. He said: 'As far as I'm concerned it's not organised. It's
just off-the-cuff stuff. We are not great big cartels or anything like
that.'
Customs is keen, however, to crack any group trafficking excise goods on a
regular basis. Since the single market opened 250 excise verification
officers have been deployed to track the trade inland.
The officers make regular visits to clubs, pubs and off-licences looking for
proof of illegal sales. On a recent visit to a run-down workmen's club in
Barry, on the outskirts of Cardiff, three officers found only a one-litre
bottle of whisky and two 25cl bottles of cheap French lager.
Mr Charles Templing, one of the officers, said: 'All we have is a couple
bottles. What you want is cases of it.'
Customs has detected 1,588 cases of cross-channel smuggling to date. The
total revenue value of the goods seized amounts to Pounds 2.3m. The seized
alcohol and tobacco are stored in warehouses in 21 regions around the
country. In Cardiff, Customs has filled three rooms with contraband. In
Dover a week's worth of booty is stacked three feet deep in a 20 sq ft
confinement.
In spite of the volume of goods being seized, excise verification officers
believe there is much they cannot catch. Mr Noel Weare, an officer in south
Wales, said: 'The bootleggers are virtually getting away with it. Unless
Customs increases the enforcement role or decreases the duty then the
problem will increase. I do not think they realise the scale of this thing.'
The scale of the trade is vigorously disputed, but clearly there is some
hype involved. Mr Kostadinoski Goce, manager of a warehouse for Pidou, a
cash and carry in Calais, initially said about 50 vans a day now shopped at
Pidou, but when no vans appeared at his warehouse on our second trip to see
him he revised his estimate to 'anything between one and 25'. He said
business was at its height from October to December, when he claimed more
than 100 vans a day came to the warehouse, spending as much as Pounds 1,200
a vanload.
Mr Dave West, owner of EastEnders, said about 150 vans made a daily 'beer
run' to Calais. Around Christmas, he said, the traffic stepped up to more
than 1,000 vans a day. Many of his customers admitted to selling the
alcohol.
Mr West believes it is the hype, rather than the duty differential, which
has created the trade. 'Every time the brewers and Customs get worried about
it, they give it more publicity,' he said. 'Then the people who did not even
know it was cheaper over here get the idea to come over.'

FT  06 JUN 94 / Brown to call for workers right to education leave
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown will today call for all workers to be given a guaranteed
right to take leave of absence in order to study, as part of a 'permanent
education revolution' to tackle chronic unemployment.
The shadow chancellor will use a speech to the Institute of Public Policy
Research, the left-of-centre think-tank, to put education reform at the
centre of the party's fight to achieve full employment. Claiming that
'trickle-down economics' has failed, Mr Brown will argue that the missing
element in the battle against unemployment is a programme providing
opportunities for everyone to raise their skills.
Mr Brown will say that in seeking to develop such a programme Labour should
not flinch from facing difficult questions about potential new sources of
finance for investment in education and 'the way in which the growing
private education system affects educational opportunities'.
Among other measures Mr Brown will call for more nursery education for
under-fives; education for those aged 16 to 19 which provides 'parity of
esteem' for academic and vocational study and high-quality training for
school-leavers; and tax incentives for people who undertake their own
training.
