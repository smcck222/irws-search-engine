FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: CIBC earnings rise 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second-biggest bank, saw net
profits rise 20 per cent in the second quarter, and 23 per cent in the first
half.
Retail and corporate banking results were strong in the second quarter, said
Mr Al Flood, chairman, and net non-performing loans declined for the fifth
consecutive quarter.
However, the investment banking unit was slowed by volatile markets and
lower trading activity.
CIBC's net profit for the three months ending April 30 was CDollars 217m
(USDollars 156m) or 86 cents a share, against CDollars 180m or 75 cents a
year earlier. The latest period included CDollars 18m from the sale of the
bank's UK mortgage subsidiary.
First-half earnings were CDollars 431m, or CDollars 1.72 a share, compared
with CDollars 349m or CDollars 1.49 a year earlier. Second-quarter return on
assets rose to 0.61 per cent from 0.54 per cent, and on equity to 11.9 per
cent from 10.8 per cent.
Non-interest income was strong. Wood Gundy, the investment banking unit,
could not keep up the pace of the record first quarter, but still registered
an increase on a year earlier. Net interest income rose 4 per cent.
Total assets reached CDollars 147bn, up CDollars 2.6bn.
Net non-performing loans at April 30 were CDollars 1.98bn or 1.9 per cent of
total loans and acceptances, down from 2.9 per cent a year earlier.
Loan loss provisions for fiscal 1994 were unchanged at CDollars 880m, half
of which was charged in the first two quarters. Actual loan loss in fiscal
1993 was CDollars 920m.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft ready to quit
mining - German group could raise CDollars 500m from sale of Canadian stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft has said little about the future of its extensive
international mining interests in the six months since the ailing German
group began its fight to survive heavy oil-trading losses.
The mining assets, held through MG's 50.1 per cent stake in Toronto-based
Metall Mining, have merely been identified as a possible candidate for
disposal as part of the group's scramble to raise cash.
Behind the scenes, however, MG is slowly but surely nearing the point of
unveiling a public offer of its shares in Metall Mining which, at current
market prices, are worth about CDollars 500m (USDollars 360m).
The offer is sufficiently close for MG, Metall and their advisers to be
keenly watching investor response to the forthcoming initial public offering
by Falconbridge, the Canadian nickel, copper and zinc producer. Due to be
priced around June 15, the Falconbridge issue could raise CDollars 750m.
Metall Mining officials will brief analysts in London today on the progress
made in removing the obstacles to MG's withdrawal. They are likely to report
that of three hurdles which needed to be overcome, only one of any substance
remains.
The obstacles date back to 1987, when Metall was taken public as MG's
vehicle for the expansion of its international mining interests.
Metall's varied portfolio includes a minority stake in the big Ok Tedi
copper mine in Papua New Guinea, a controlling interest in Copper Range, an
integrated US producer, and a string of valuable exploration properties
stretching from Turkey to Australia.
Its top priority is to find or buy a big, low-cost copper deposit. In its
non-copper businesses, weak zinc prices have led Metall to shift its focus
to gold. Projects in Turkey and the Canadian province of Quebec are expected
to double annual gold output to 320,000 ounces over the next couple of
years.
Metall also holds significant direct and indirect equity stakes in Teck
Corporation and Cominco, two of Canada's most prominent mining companies.
Last September, before MG's troubles surfaced, the German company parked its
copper smelting and refining interests in Europe and Indonesia with Metall.
Most of these investments are joint ventures. Metall's partners include
Degussa, the German metals group, and Australia's MIM, as well as the Keevil
family of Vancouver, who are large shareholders in Teck and Cominco.
Ironic as it may seem, these partners demanded assurances when the projects
were bundled into Metall that the fledgling Canadian company's stake would
revert to its seemingly robust parent, if MG were to sever its ties with
Metall. Under these agreements, MG would be obliged to pay Metall a fair
market price for the assets.
Since MG's troubles surfaced, Mr Norman Keevil, chairman of Teck, has agreed
to relinquish his right to require it to take over Metall's multiple-voting
Class A shares in Teck if the German company spins off its stake in Metall.
In the event of a third party taking control of Metall, however, Mr Keevil
will acquire voting rights over Metall's interest in Teck as well as the
right to buy the shares himself.
Metall has also completed all but the formalities of an agreement under
which it will peg its interest in Ok Tedi at 18 per cent, in partnership
with BHP of Australia and the Papua New Guinea government.
The government, which will end up with 30 per cent, has pledged not to
exercise its right of first refusal on Metall's shares when MG sheds control
of the Canadian company.
The one outstanding problem relates to Metall's interests in Norddeutsche
Affinerie in Germany and Austria's Brixlegg, two of the copper smelters
which were transferred to it last year. It has yet to reach an agreement
with MIM and Degussa, which have a first right of refusal on Metall's stake
in the event of MG losing control.
Dr Klaus Zeitler, Metall's chief executive, told the annual meeting on May
12 that 'we will either continue to own our shares in these smelters or we
will be paid the fair market value of these assets'.
Metall's attractions to prospective buyers include its string of blue-chip
properties plus its sturdy balance sheet, which includes over CDollars 1bn
in equity and CDollars 300m in cash and short-term investments.
The recent surge in copper markets has improved its prospects. A 10 per cent
rise in prices would have boosted Metall's lacklustre 1993 earnings of
CDollars 1.3m by another CDollars 21m.
Mr Ray Goldie, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, recently
raised his forecast of 1994 earnings from three cents to 16 cents a share,
jumping to 62 cents in 1995.
However,Metall also has some weak spots, notably its 84 per cent stake in
Copper Range. Besides being a relatively high-cost producer, the
Michigan-based company is under environmental pressures either to close its
smelter or modernise it at a cost of USDollars 200m to Dollars 250m.
Metall hopes to double Copper Range's ore reserves and cut costs by
extracting metal from pillars of previously mined-out areas.
Dr Zeitler expressed confidence at the annual meeting that Copper Range can
be transformed 'from a relatively high-cost producer to a modern,
state-of-the-art, medium to low-cost producer within the next three to four
years.' But he acknowledged that progress will depend heavily on the absence
of environmental 'hiccups'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nokia, the Finnish tele-communications group, yesterday outstripped market
expectations when it announced a preliminary operating profit of FM854m
(Dollars 155m) for the first four months, more than double last year's
FM362m.
Rising profits in the group's two main divisions, fixed telecommunications
and mobile phones, were the main reason for the upturn.
There was a sharply reduced loss from the troubled consumer electronics
division and a better result from the cables and machinery activities.
Sales climbed 21 per cent to FM8.56bn from FM7.09bn.
Underlying sales growth - which strips out the effects of currency
movements, acquisitions and disposals - amounted to 33 per cent.
Nokia said fixed telecommunications and mobile phones sales had risen
strongly, although it did not supply figures.
Consumer electronics sales declined slightly, while cables and machinery
sales were largely unchanged.
Nokia, which is the world's second largest supplier of mobile telephones
after Motorola of the US, said last week it planned to raise more than FM2bn
of new equity through an international share issue.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: ING lifted by strong insurance
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ING Group, the Dutch financial services company, increased net profit by
more than 25 per cent to Fl 501m (Dollars 270m) in the first quarter of 1994
from the same period of 1993.
Turnover was down slightly at Fl 9.31bn compared with F 19.40bn, partly
reflecting the deconsolidation in April 1993 of two insurance subsidiaries,
Orion and the NRG.
The profits advance was helped by strong insurance returns.
Pre-tax results from insurance surged by nearly 50 per cent to Fl 354m from
Fl 243m. Sharp increases were reported for life and general insurance, while
losses narrowed in ING's non-life business.
The deconsolidation of Orion and NRG meant ING was able to reduce most of
its exposure to the loss-making reinsurance business.
ING's insurance operations in the Czech Republic contributed to profits for
the first time in the quarter.
The jump in insurance profits contrasts with a more moderate 5.4 per cent
increase in pre-tax banking profits to Fl 314m from Fl 298m.
For the whole of 1994 ING expects its results to at least match those for
1993.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Union opposition delays merger
of Japanese regional banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A plan inspired by the Japanese finance ministry to merge three small
regional banks has been delayed by opposition from staff and clients.
Kita-Nippon Bank, Shokusan Bank and Tokuyo City Bank, all based in Tohoku,
northern Japan, have shelved the accord which was due to be signed at the
end of last month.
To the ministry's annoyance, unions at Kita-Nippon and Shokusan objected on
the grounds that Tokuyo City's estimated Y100bn (Dollars 917m) of bad loans,
larger than their own, would erode their banks' profits.
Mr Hirohisa Fuji, finance minister, had given the scheme his public blessing
and said there would be more like it.
The banks' executives are now struggling to get the merger back on track and
aim to call shareholders' meetings in the autumn in order to get approval.
This is an unusual blow to the finance ministry's strategy of encouraging
stronger regional banks to take over weaker ones. The aim is to bolster
weaker banks' balance sheets without a public bail-out, achieve economies of
scale in the fragmented regional banking industry and avoid a crisis of
confidence in regional institutions.
The government has guided at least three such mergers in the past three
years.
Tokuyo City lost Y1bn before tax last year, down from a Y7.6bn loss in 1992,
due to stock losses. The new institution, to be called Heisei Bank, would
have deposits of Y2,190bn and 225 branches, making it the fifth-largest of
the second-tier regional banks.
In another sign of the industry's continuing debt problems, Apollo Leasing,
an unquoted leasing company with Y530bn borrowings, yesterday admitted that
it was asking its creditor banks for a second cut in interest payments.
Apollo obtained a rate reduction two years ago, but says it cannot sell
property collateral fast enough to finance payments. Like many non-banking
financial institutions, Apollo borrowed to lend on the back of property, the
value of which has collapsed during the recession.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Passenger increase helps KLM
return to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in passenger traffic and continued cost-cutting enabled KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines to swing back into profit for last year.
The Dutch national carrier posted a net profit of Fl 103m (Dollars 55.7m)
for the year ended March, reversing the previous year's heavy losses of Fl
562m.
The improvement stemmed partly from a 17 per cent increase in passenger
traffic. However, the continuing shift towards cheaper fares meant that
turnover from passenger traffic increased by a more modest 8 per cent.
Overall, turnover rose by 5 per cent, well ahead of the 1 per cent increase
in costs. As KLM made clear earlier this year during its Fl 1.2bn global
share offering, it will not pay a 1993-94 dividend.
The strong recovery is also due to the fact that KLM no longer includes on
its book the figures of Northwest Airlines, the US airline in which it owns
a 20 per cent stake. In 1992-93, when KLM still carried Northwest's figures,
the US airline accounted for much of that year's Fl 388m loss from holdings.
Northwest has since moved back into profit.
However, even at the operating level KLM's results improved strongly, moving
back into a profit of Fl 86m from a loss of Fl 252m.
Another reason for the improvement is the pension premiums holiday granted
by KLM's pension funds in April 1993.
Mr Pieter Bouw, president, said the airline would look into extending the
holiday when it expires at the end of 1994.
KLM, involved in last year's abortive attempt to create a global airline
with Swissair, SAS and Austrian Airlines, remained interested in developing
strategic alliances with other medium-sized European airlines, he said.
Mr Bouw said further cost-cutting was needed even though KLM compared
favourably with most European airlines. 'The airlines of the US and the Far
East, which already operate at very competitive cost levels, are attempting
to cut them still further.'
He said KLM's search for greater flexibility was behind yesterday's
announcement of the company's first operational lease for seven new Boeing
767-300s to replace its fleet of 10 Airbus 310s. The lease allows KLM to
increase the number of aircraft and to adjust the length of the agreement.
The longer range of the Boeing 767 also better fits KLM's profile as an
airline with a high proportion of inter-continental flights. Until now KLM
has used financial, but not operational, leases.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Tenneco reduces offering of Case
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco has revised plans for an initial public offering of its Case farm
machinery subsidiary. It has reduced the size of the offering to 25 per cent
of Case common stock, or 17.5m shares.
When Tenneco announced in April that it would sell a portion of Case to the
public, the US energy and industrial group said the offering would represent
at least 35 per cent of Case share capital.
Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's chairman, said the offering was reduced because
stock market valuations for companies in machinery and other cyclical
industries had weakened since the Case spin-off was announced.
'Since the company's performance thus far in 1994 has been strong, we are
reluctant to sell more than 25 per cent at these valuation levels,' he said.
In its preliminary prospectus for the offering, Tenneco set a price range of
Dollars 19 to Dollars 22 a share.
Wall Street analysts said that range was within expectations, though it is
short of the Dollars 25 a share some had suggested in April.
Tenneco said it expected the spin-off to bring in Dollars 335m-Dollars 385m.
This compares with the Dollars 500m anticipated when the deal was announced.
Tenneco intends to invest the proceeds of the sale to enhance its automotive
parts and natural gas businesses. Case is Tenneco's largest division, and
Tenneco intends to retain majority control of the company.
Mr Mead did not rule out a second offering of Case shares. He said Tenneco
was reviewing its options for issuing additional Case shares later this
year.
Tenneco's shares did not respond to the news and stood Dollars  1/8 higher
at Dollars 48 on New York at midday.
Case achieved first-quarter operating income of Dollars 81m on sales of
Dollars 1bn, representing nearly a third of the Tenneco group's
first-quarter sales and operating income.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: HungarHotels sale draws interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's privatisation authorities have put HungarHotels, the country's
largest hotel chain with 15 hotels, up for sale.
The sale, targeted at international hotel groups, looks set to become one of
the most hotly contested privatisation transactions in eastern Europe this
year.
The sale of 51 per cent of HungarHotels is expected to raise about Dollars
50m. CS First Boston, the US investment bank which is advising the SPA
privatisation agency, said that 24 companies had registered initial
interest.
The potential bidders, which have to submit preliminary offers by next
month, are believed to include the Intercontinental, Forte and Holiday Inn
hotel groups.
Intercontinental, owner of the Forum hotel chain, is thought to be
interested in maintaining its connection with the Budapest Forum, which is
operated by HungarHotels under a franchise agreement.
While foreign attention is likely to centre on specific hotels, the SPA is
determined to avoid selling the group piecemeal.
The SPA wants to sell HungarHotels as a single entity and let the buyer take
responsibility for subsequent restructuring.
The transaction represents the international hotel industry's - and other
investors' - last chance to acquire an interest in an established hotel
operation in Hungary.
Intercontinental lost the franchise of the flagship Budapest hotel, the Duna
Intercontinental, when a consortium led by Marriot of the US offered Dollars
53m and won an auction for the property.
Two of Hungary's big three hotel chains have been privatised. Danubius
Hotels was sold to portfolio investors, and Pannonia Hotels to Accor, the
French hotel group.
The privatisation of HungarHotels has dragged on for four years, hampered by
recession in the international hotel market, confusion over title to
property and the need to trim an unwieldy company.
The company's management is known to have pushed hard for a stock market
flotation, but HungarHotels' weak results made this route difficult to
justify.
Profits, at the operating level, halved to Ft431m (Dollars 4m) in 1993 on
turnover of Ft6.93bn.
The slow pace of work on the 1996 world expo in Budapest has begun to dampen
expectations about tourist levels in Hungary over the next couple of years.

FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Speculation boosts Euro Disney

<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday saw its shares rise
FFr1.85 to FFr32.00 amid speculation that Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the
Saudi prince who plans to take a large stake in the company, was buying
shares on the market.
Prince Al-Waleed on Wednesday stunned investors with the announcement that
he intended to buy up to 24.5 per cent of Euro Disney after the company's
forthcoming FFr6bn (Dollars 1bn) rights issue.
The prince, a nephew of King Fahd, has already made his name as an
international investor by taking stakes in Citicorp and Saks 5th Avenue.
In the deal with Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, he will
buy any shares that are not taken up in the rights issue.
Under the terms of the deal the prince is entitled to buy, at the rights
price, a maximum 24.5 per cent stake in Euro Disney by sub-underwriting the
rights issue or buying shares directly from Walt Disney.
The prince approached Disney last summer through Carlyle, his
Washington-based advisers. However, he appeared last autumn to have cooled
on the deal as Euro Disney's financial problems escalated. He renewed
contact with Disney five weeks ago when it became apparent that Euro
Disney's banks would agree to a FFr13bn rescue package.
Market reports suggested the prince was buying Euro Disney shares to
establish a stake before the company announces the terms of the rights issue
at an EGM next Wednesday.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: J W Spear search for white knight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers to Scrabble maker J W Spear were last night still searching for a
white knight to top the Pounds 47m bid for the company from US toy giant
Hasbro.
But it looked increasingly unlikely that their efforts would be successful
ahead of this morning's deadline when acceptances from Spear family trusts
owning 24.9 per cent of the shares become irrevocable.
Hasbro already has a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear acquired four years ago.
Barings has asked the Spear trustees to forward a letter to the
beneficiaries which questions why the bid should be accepted, given that all
the Spear board, barring the chairman Francis Spear, believe it is
inadequate.

Lower palm oil prices, higher costs and a fall in the contribution from

trading result at Rowe Evans Investments in 1993.
Although turnover grew marginally to Pounds 5.68m (Pounds 5.6m) during the

distribution costs rose to Pounds 270,000 (Pounds 204,000).
The share of profits from associated undertakings fell from Pounds 3.4m to
Pounds 1.3m, leaving pre-tax profits down by some Pounds 2.7m to Pounds

Earnings came out at 4.45p (9.63p). The annual dividend is held at 2p.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Management buys Netlon for Pounds 40m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Netlon, which makes plastic nets, mesh and grids for the food packaging,
agricultural, horticultural and construction industries, has been bought by
its management for about Pounds 40m.
The Blackburn-based company, which employs 380 people, was founded in 1959
by Mr Brian Mercer who has sold his 88 per cent shareholding in order to
retire. A six-strong management buy-out team, which had a 9 per cent stake,
has sold its own shares to itself and reinvested the post-tax proceeds in a
bigger stake.
An equity and loan package will give 3i, the investment capital group, and
Electra, the venture capital fund, substantial minority stakes, believed to
be up to a third each. Intermediate Capital Group has provided mezzanine
funding, with senior debt and working capital facilities from Bank of
Scotland.
The final price has not been disclosed, but Netlon is understood to have
been valued at 10 times earnings: pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.2m in the
year ended September 30. This means the buy-out team would have had about
Pounds 2.3m net to invest.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chance of an all-embracing bid - Why RJB
Mining is optimistic about its prospects / British Coal, The Bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If British Coal is to stay in one piece after privatisation - and many
mining executives believe that would be the surest means of preserving a
large industry - then its best hope may lie in Mr Richard Budge and his RJB
Mining company.
With Hanson apparently not interested and RTZ unlikely to make a bid, RJB is
one of the few UK companies that combines the desire and belief in its
capability to operate all five British Coal regions.
Whether it has the financial and political clout to mount five successful
tenders is open to question. But the fact that it can contemplate an
all-embracing bid is testimony to the significant progress it has made in
the two years since Mr Budge split off the mining operations from AF Budge,
the contracting group set up by his older brother Tony.
By the time AF Budge went into receivership in late 1992, its former mining
arm, rechristened RJB, was thriving as a separate company and on its way to
the Stock Exchange.
Investors have warmed to RJB. In spite of a slow start, the company's shares
have outperformed the market by nearly 30 per cent since its flotation last
June. Mr Budge is a big factor in the rating.
Although his initials provide the company with its name, Mr Budge says he
dislikes the cult of the personality, and tells investors and journalists
that his company's success is based on its 1,400 employees and its
executives. 'I may be chief executive but I am just one of a team.'
Colleagues say he is a good delegator but not all outsiders are convinced.
'RJB is not a one man band - it has some reasonable executives,' says one
British Coal executive. 'But I get the impression that when Budge says jump
then everyone jumps. He can sometimes seem rather high-handed.'
It is just as well for RJB, then, that Mr Budge is highly regarded.
A tall and athletic-looking man of 47, Mr Budge has achieved success in
several walks of life. In his teens he made money from painting landscapes;
in his 30s and early 40s he became one of the country's most successful
amateur racing drivers.
But he has put most of his efforts into mining. After joining his brother's
company as a 19-year-old, he was the driving force behind it becoming one of
the biggest opencast coal producers in the country by the late 1970s.
The company won a reputation for innovation. It was, for example, the first
to bring in the 170 tonne Caterpillar dumper trucks. 'Everyone else said the
British industry was too small for them,' says one British Coal executive.
'Budge led the technical scaling up in the industry.'
This helps to explain why RJB's reputation remained relatively untarnished
when its former parent went into receivership. Mr Budge's initial
difficulties in persuading the City of the value of his company may have
been more to do with the grand plans he had for expansion.
The market was weary of an industry which had been incurring losses for
years; companies associated with mining had long ago fallen out of fashion.
Yet RJB was seeking money to develop under licence up to 11 mines that
British Coal had closed because it could find no markets for them.
It has ended up with three, Calverton and Clipstone in Nottinghamshire, and
Rossington in Yorkshire.
'They are not gold mines but they will make very reasonable rates of
return,' says Mr Budge.
RJB can succeed where British Coal failed, he says, because it is more
responsive to household and industrial markets and because it will get far
more productivity out of a smaller workforce at each mine. 'We give our
miners more responsibility and accountability than British Coal and they
have responded well.'
Mr Budge says early production from the mines has been better than expected.
But none of the three have been operating under RJB for more than six
months; other mining companies say a much longer test is needed before any
realistic assessment can be made.
Most believe the core British Coal assets which the government is selling in
five regional packages are a better bet because they have guaranteed
contracts with the electricity generators until 1998.
The problem for potential bidders, RJB included, is that they will require a
heavy initial outlay. Estimates as to the combined value of the successful
bids vary enormously but it is likely to run into several hundred millions
of pounds.
In addition, working capital requirements could easily reach Pounds 300m.
These are large sums for a company that last year made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 12.2m on sales of Pounds 74.8m and is already thought to have gearing
of about 50 per cent.
Politics provides an even larger hurdle to RJB taking over all of British
Coal's assets. Ministers have not ruled out selling all five regions to one
bidder but their desire to inject competition into privatised markets makes
it likely that they will want to split British Coal up if possible.
Nonetheless, Mr Budge and RJB have shown that they are among the most
optimistic about the industry's prospects and have yet to make a serious
mistake in their mining operations. It would be surprising if they do not
end up with at least one of the regions.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Improved trading conditions help Stakis
advance to Pounds 6.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, almost trebled pre-tax profits in the
six months to April 3, reflecting slightly improved trading conditions,
increased revenue from acquisitions and a substantial drop in interest
payments.
Pre-tax profit was Pounds 6.6m for a 26 week period, compared with Pounds
2.3m for the equivalent 27 weeks restated to reflect the FRS 5 accounting
standard on off-balance sheet financing.
Sir Lewis Robertson, who became chairman in 1991 after the Glasgow-based
company got into difficulties following poorly managed expansion, is to
retire next March and hand over to Mr Richard Cole-Hamilton, deputy chairman
and former chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank.
Operating profit from the group's 33 hotels rose 15 per cent to Pounds 9.91m
(Pounds 8.6m) and operating profit from the 21 casinos was up 25 per cent at
Pounds 6.77m (Pounds 5.4m).
Mr David Michels, chief executive, said the average room rate had risen by 3
per cent and occupancy rose from 62.6 per cent to 63.3 per cent in the low
season.
The casinos, boosted by three acquisitions last year, showed a rise in the
gaming win percentage from 17.8 per cent to 18.7 per cent.
Net interest charges fell from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 7.31m reflecting lower
debt after the Pounds 28m rights issue in 1993 and the sale of the
healthcare division. Group overheads were static at Pounds 2.4m.
Stakis raised a further Pounds 67m from a 1-for-4 rights issue in March and
together with new banking arrangements negotiated with four banks now has
about Pounds 100m to spend on purchasing new hotels and casinos.
It bought two hotels in March and last month acquired the Avisford hotel
near Arundel, Sussex, for Pounds 7.1m. It expects to conclude two more
purchases in the next eight weeks.
Earnings per share were 1.58p (0.66p) and the interim dividend goes up to
0.65p (0.45p).

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn 55% ahead to Pounds 33.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong profits performance encouraged Powell Duffryn, the distribution,
storage and engineering group, to lift its dividend for the first time in
four years.
Pre-tax profits increased by 55 per cent to Pounds 33.4m in the year to
March 31, although the headline figure was flattered by a reduction in
exceptional charges from Pounds 7m to Pounds 2.6m.
The underlying performance was also strong, with profits before exceptionals
increasing by 26 per cent to Pounds 36m.
Earnings per share jumped to 31.8p (18.6p). A final dividend of 17p gives a
total of 23.6p (22.6p).
Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said: 'The benefits of recent corporate
restructuring and investment were major contributors to these excellent
results.'
Operating profits from fuel distribution increased from Pounds 5.4m to
Pounds 7.6m, thanks to stronger industrial demand, cooler weather and
last-minute sales in advance of the VAT imposition.
Port services and shipping raised operating profits from Pounds 7.3m to
Pounds 10.3m. Tees and Hartlepool increased their dry goods throughput by
12.5 per cent, helped by growing roll on-roll off traffic.
In engineering, operating profits fell from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 15.4m. Mr
Bill Andrews, chief executive, said sound performances in most areas had
been masked by a decline in the contribution from the group's Saudi Arabian
pump business and continuing losses in parts of its road and rail transport
activities.
Mr Andrews said the rail business, which lost Pounds 2m, had a large number
of inquiries but an inadequate level of orders. He had confidence in the
products, but said the group would have to see firm orders materialising in
the current year or further rationalisation would be necessary.
The group's bulk liquid storage business increased operating profits from
Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 6.9m.
Gearing fell from 19 to 11 per cent. Mr Hubbard said the strength of the
balance sheet provided headroom for further investment.
COMMENT
The rise in the dividend was good news - though not entirely unexpected
given the relatively cool winter, which always helps the fuels side. Less
welcome were the problems on the engineering side, which overshadowed good
performances by Hamworthy's combustion and compressor activities and a
strong showing by the Geesink environmental engineering business. The shares
have outperformed the market by 70 per cent since 1992, so have already
enjoyed a substantial rerating as the group has become more focused.
However, they still offer a 10 per cent yield premium and a prospective
multiple of 14.3 does not look demanding.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Limit seeks approval to amend its
investment policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest Lloyd's investment trust is to seek permission from its
shareholders to amend its investment policies, in line with potentially
far-reaching changes at the insurance market.
The London Insurance Market Investment Trust said yesterday that it would
seek permission to invest directly in both managing agents, which administer
syndicates, as well as in new corporate underwriting entities.
The trust, which obtained a stock market quote last November, currently
supports a wide spread of agents and syndicates. Its Pounds 502.5m
underwriting capacity is allocated to 101 syndicates managed by 33 agents.
The announcement follows a report by Lloyd's last month which envisaged the
creation of 'corporate syndicates', which would draw all their capacity from
one single corporate investor.
In addition, a number of managing agencies - including leading players such
as Brockbank and Kiln - are examining the creation of new 'dedicated'
investment funds which would exclusively back syndicates managed by one
agency. Hiscox Group is currently the only agency to have established such a
fund.
Limit's statement said: 'If these structures are created, Limit may wish to
invest directly in other corporate capital entities.' It added that Limit
may also 'wish to invest a small amount of its capital in minority interests
in managing agents for the purpose of enhancing its underwriting potential.'
In addition, Limit said the amount of capacity - potential underwriting
income - supplied by it to syndicates could increase by up to Pounds 30m in
1995 as a result of recent rule changes by Lloyd's.
Limit made both announcements when reporting its results for the four and
half months between its listing last November and the end of March.
Investment income amounted to Pounds 4.8m. Under Lloyd's three-year
accounting convention, income for the period does not include results from
underwriting. After expenses of Pounds 900,000, pre-tax profits amounted to
Pounds 3.9m.

Net asset value of RIT Capital Partners, the investment trust, grew by 22.4
per cent to 221.6p per share over the year to March 31. Total net assets
were Pounds 437m, up from Pounds 352m.
After tax of Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 1.9m) profits increased from Pounds 1.4m to
Pounds 5.46m. Earnings per share rose from 0.81p to 3.03p, or 2.82p diluted.
A dividend of 1.51p (1.15p) is proposed.
At the year end, quoted equities made up 49 per cent of the portfolio
(Pounds 248m), government and corporate bonds 11 per cent (Pounds 56m),
specialist funds 18 per cent (Pounds 94m), and unquoted companies 17 per
cent (Pounds 89m).
During the year RITCP sold most of its holding in Newmont Mining, realising
Pounds 114m. Its largest unquoted holding is in Amerpharm, half of which is
due to be sold to E Merck.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Leeds edges forward on disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth largest building society, is seeking to
differentiate the life assurance and unit trust operations it will launch
next month by aiming for the high moral ground.
Giving details of the two subsidiaries yesterday, Mr Roger Boyes, acting
chief executive, said staff would be paid mainly - though not entirely - by
salary, and that there would be no 'direct link' between sales and
remuneration.
He added that the life assurance company would provide customers with
information about the charges it would make, and would explain fully to
customers what policies did and did not cover.
However, it will not operate the full commission and pro-duct disclosure
regime demanded by City regulators until the beginning of next year when it
becomes com-pulsory for the whole industry.
Of the 10 largest societies, only Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bristol &amp; West
are now tied to selling the products of one life assurance company without
having said the arrangement will end.
The Leeds subsidiaries will sell a range of pensions, investments and
protection products, concentrating initially on providing a service to the
society's existing customers. The 800 sales staff have been drawn from
Leeds' current employees, in the interests of continuity.
Mr Chris Chadwick, Leeds' commercial director, said: 'The traditional life
assurance sales process is a total anathema to us.'
Mr Ladislav Suchopar, who joined Leeds from Allied Dunbar in 1991, is chief
executive of the life company, and Mr Andrew Watson, formerly of the
Prolific group, will run the unit trust company.
Mr Boyes said that Norwich Union, for which Leeds has been a tied agent, had
not wanted to handle the administration of the new organisation.
Instead, General Accident Life will deal with the administration for the
life assur-ance side, and SG Warburg will be the unit trust admin-istrators.
Gartmore and JP Morgan Investment Management will act as fund managers.

Profits of Rolfe &amp; Nolan, the futures and options computer bureau and

year to February 28.
The outcome included a deficit from the North American operations amounting
to Pounds 1.09m. Losses from this source were significantly reduced in the
second half and further improvements are expected.
Group turnover expanded from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 12.7m, of which Pounds
3.05m (Pounds 3.27m) came from the US.
Earnings per share fell to 12.9p (17.7p) after a higher tax charge of 61.9
per cent (50.4 per cent) due to US losses not relievable against tax.
A final dividend of 5.195p makes an 8p (7.2p) total. A 1-for-1 scrip is also
proposed.

A fall from Pounds 7.17m to Pounds 1.34m in pre-tax profits was announced by
Bertam Holdings for the year to December 31.
However, the oil palm and rubber plantations group, which also has property
interests in Malaysia, said the two years were not comparable following the
sale in late 1992 of 810 hectares to Bertam Properties and the acquisition
of three Malaysian estates.
Profits were affected by lower palm oil prices, although they had rallied
strongly this year, directors said.
Turnover from continuing operations slipped to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 1.61m).
Earnings per share emerged at 4.78p (31.54p) and the single final dividend

The forecast Pounds 21m charge related to the disposal of its Spanish
subsidiary resulted in a loss before tax of Pounds 20.6m at Ashley Group in
the year to December 31 1993.
The window blinds and timber group had warned of the charge in March.
Continuing operations in the period produced sales of Pounds 40.6m (Pounds
48.5m) and operating profit of Pounds 3.07m (Pounds 3.26m).
Provisions in 1993 totalled Pounds 22.1m, mainly due to deferred
consideration related to the Spanish sale. In 1992 provisions of Pounds 52m
were carried, which produced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 61m.
There is no dividend payment. Losses per share came to 15.7p (45.11p).
The annual meeting will be asked to approve a change in the company's name
to Eclipse Blinds.

Turnover from continuing operations was Pounds 93.7m (Pounds 107.6m). Losses
per share amounted to 9.94p (0.83p earnings). There is no dividend (0.2p).

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A McAlpine seeks Pounds 25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alfred McAlpine yesterday joined the growing rank of housebuilders to launch
rights issues to finance land purchases for expansion.
The construction company is seeking to raise Pounds 25m through the issue of
12.6m new shares at 205p on a 2-for-9 basis.
McAlpine made a Pounds 894,000 pre-tax profit during the six months to
end-April, compared to a Pounds 2.48m loss last time.
Turnover increased from Pounds 241.3m to Pounds 316.6m. Earnings per share
were 0.7p (losses of 3.3p). The share price fell 18p to 241p.
The company is changing its year end to December 31 and is expected to
announce its interim dividend policy when it publishes figures for the
period to end-June.
McAlpine plans to increase housing output to 1,800 homes this year, compared
with 1,259 in 1992. It expects to have spent Pounds 80m purchasing land by
the end of this year, increasing net investment in the housing division by
Pounds 30m. In the latest period it spent Pounds 48.7m on land.
Mr Oliver Whitehead, chief executive, said this had led to a sharp rise in
borrowings which, before the rights issue, were expected to average Pounds
75m to Pounds 80m this year, representing gearing of about 50 per cent.
Proceeds from the rights issue should reduce gearing to a more appropriate
level of 30 per cent.
Mr Whitehead said the company's land holdings had increased by 47 per cent
to 4,400 plots. Sites had been bought on the basis of an estimated gross
margin of 18 per cent.
The housing division, which completed 568 (509) private sector homes, made a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 300,000 loss). The average selling
price of a home increased from Pounds 78,000 to Pounds 88,900.
The construction division incurred a Pounds 1m pre-tax loss (Pounds 500,000
profit); aggregates, slate and asphalt made a Pounds 800,000 profit (Pounds
200,000 loss); the US reported a Pounds 500,000 loss (Pounds 100,000 profit)
with a good performance from minerals offset by a disappointing result from
contracting.
COMMENT
It is not a good time to be launching a rights issue with sentiment running
against the stock market and housebuilders and construction companies in
particular. Nonetheless, there is sufficient value in the shares at a
theoretical ex-rights price of 234p, based on last night's close, to get the
issue away - albeit without much enthusiasm. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m
this year followed by Pounds 21m next year would put the group on a
prospective p/e of 11 on 1995 profits at the ex-rights price. The shares,
however, are unlikely to improve in the present climate.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Taking the City road - EuroDollar heads for
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past five years EuroDollar has quietly overtaken some of its
better-known rivals to become the UK's second largest car rental company
behind Avis.
Last year it claimed a 10 per cent share of the fragmented Pounds 583m UK
car hire market, a rise from 7 per cent in 1988.
EuroDollar, the subject of a Pounds 118m management buy-out from the TSB
Group in August, is coming to market through a placing and public offer
expected to value it at more than Pounds 100m. A pathfinder for the issue is
due to be published today.
EuroDollar's relatively low profile as a rental fleet operator is a clue to
its success - growth in the UK has been fuelled by its penetration of the
corporate market where it is now the market leader.
More than three quarters of its Pounds 78m turnover in the year to March 31
came from the corporate sector although in order to maximise fleet
utilisation, the group also cultivates the retail trade at weekends and
during holiday periods.
The main customers among 6,500 corporate accounts include BT, GEC,
Rolls-Royce, Rank Xerox and ICL along with fleet operators such as Cowie
Interleasing and breakdown services like the RAC.
EuroDollar has invested heavily in information technology, spending an
average Pounds 4m a year to build a real-time computer tracking and
reservation system which allows it to pinpoint cars and review their usage
at any time.
This enables the group to move cars from site to site as required and manage
its fleet of 12,000 cars and 1,000 vans more efficiently than competitors -
EuroDollar regularly achieves fleet utilisation rates of 70 per cent or
more.
The IT network also links together EuroDollar's 105 branches and has enabled
the group to pioneer the use of 'inplants' - EuroDollar employees who are
attached to large corporate customers and work on-site with them to manage
their rental requirements on-line.
The other key benefit of EuroDollar's IT system is that it enables the
group's fleet controllers to minimise vehicle holding costs which largely
depend on residual values and funding costs.
EuroDollar acquires more than 20,000 cars a year - each car remains in the
fleet for about 5 or 6 months. Because each rental effectively represents a
'test drive' by a potential car buyer, rental companies can negotiate
particularly good terms with manufacturers.
In most cases vehicles are acquired on finance leases or lease purchase
agreements funded either by a finance house or through the tied financing
division of a car manufacturer. EuroDollar has total credit lines of Pounds
111.5m - roughly Pounds 40m above its borrowings at the end of March - and
operates on the basis of no gearing before vehicle asset finance.
In order to further minimise risks, at least half of the group's fleet is
covered by guaranteed residual value programmes and it has managed to keep
overall disposal values at between 78 and 80 per cent of list prices.
The management's success in maximising fleet utilisation rates while
minimising holding costs is evident in the group's recent performance. Gross
profit margins have increased from 57 per cent in 1990 to 72 per cent in the
year to March 31 and over the same period operating profits have grown from
Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 17.8m
The management, led by Mr Ian Mosley, chief executive, has recently disposed
of lossmaking rental operations in France and Italy which are now part of
the group's franchised European network.
That move cleared the way for EuroDollar to become the first London quoted
car hire group since Avis Europe was acquired by a consortium in late 1989.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ANS launches Pounds 10m rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated Nursing Services, the USM-traded nursing home operator, is asking
shareholders for some Pounds 10m to fund the development of more homes.
The 1-for-3 rights issue at 255p was accompanied by estimated pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.3m for the year to March 31. This is about Pounds
500,000 less than expected due to ANS's introduction of the FRS 5 standard
on off-balance sheet financing.
The company, which changed its accounting policies in 1992 following a
judgment by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, has decided to bring the
assets and liabilities relating to two homes developed with BES money on to
its balance sheet. The Pounds 2.4m development profit will now be reflected
in the balance sheet as revaluation reserves.
Mr Nick Dhandsa, chief executive, said that because the company had a
commitment to buy the homes after five years the transaction would be
treated as a financing arrangement under FRS 5.
The change has the effect of increasing gearing from 84 per cent to 92 per
cent at the end of March and reducing pre-tax profits for the year from
Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 2.3m. The previous year's profit has been restated
from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 1.58m.
The change also reduces the effective tax rate so estimated earnings fall by
only 2p to 17.4p against a restated 14.3p. It plans to pay a final dividend
of 1.5p for a 2p total.
Mr Dhandsa said the rights issue, which will cut gearing to about 20 per
cent, would enable the company to fund the opening of 700 beds in 1995-96
and 750 beds the year after.
Its programme to add another 600 beds in the current year is already fully
funded.
Most of the new homes will be developed by joint ventures.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Henry Ansbacher. The shares
fell 9p to 275p yesterday.
ANS also said Mr Robert Upsdell was stepping down as non-executive chairman
at the end of October.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Faber Prest Pounds 8m cash call for
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Faber Prest yesterday announced an Pounds 8.3m rights issue to be used
partly to fund the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of Appleby Slag
Reduction - another step in the expansion of its industrial services
division.
The purchase price is Pounds 5.35m, plus a Pounds 1m loan to enable Appleby
to repay a loan from Clugston Group, the vendor.
Faber, which is also involved in distribution and car retailing, is issuing
2.1m ordinary shares at 425p on a 1-for-4 basis. Of the proceeds, Pounds
3.25m will satisfy the cash requirement of the acquisition and Pounds 1m
will repay the loan.
Faber reported a 71 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.65m to
Pounds 2.83m.
The interim dividend is increased to 5.5p (5p) on earnings per share more
than doubled to 21.76p (10.25p). The shares added 10p to 499p.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: VSEL rises to Pounds 61m but warns on
outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine builder, reported a 10 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 55.6m to Pounds 61m for the year to March 31.
The company is enjoying peak profitability from the Trident submarine
construction contract.
The increase, on sales of Pounds 466m (Pounds 442m), was achieved despite a
fall in interest income on the company's cash pile to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds
13.9m) due to lower rates. Operating profit increased by 22 per cent from
Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 50.9m.
However, VSEL's shares lost 50p to 928p after it warned that profits for the
current financial year were unlikely to increase significantly. Analysts had
been expecting about Pounds 70m this year with the construction of the
fourth and final Trident submarine contributing to profits for the first
time.
Construction of Trident submarines is starting to wind down and the Ministry
of Defence is unlikely to award a contract to build the second batch of five
Trafalgar class hunter-killer submarines until early 1996.
The company insists the remaining Pounds 24m of rationalisation provisions,
along with an additional Pounds 4.5m taken last year, will be enough to meet
redundancy costs. It is seeking work on surface ships to meet any lull.
VSEL is vying with GEC for the important prime contractor status on the
Trafalgar order. It is also considering bidding for the Devonport dockyard,
which is to be privatised by 1996. Devonport has already secured all the
refitting work on the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine fleet which was
manufactured by VSEL.
The final dividend is increased to 23.5p for a total of 34p (29p) payable on
earnings per share of 103.7p (93.4p).
COMMENT
The destination of VSEL's cash mountain is the central question preoccupying
investors. The company says it needs to retain the money in its balance
sheet if it is to win its spurs with the Ministry of Defence as a
risk-taking prime contractor. Winning prime status on the Trafalgar order
would certainly help profitability, but that will defer until 1996 a
decision on use of its cash. By then it will have accumulated about Pounds
330m, or 900p a share, which could be returned to shareholders. Equally, a
predator may be tempted by the cash before the company acts. Other uses for
the money, including merger with a cash-hungry company, or an acquisition
spree, look less likely. Still, against that lure, profitability has peaked
and the Trafalgar bid is not yet in the bag; other work on surface ships is
even less assured. Piling up cash as a virility symbol for the MoD also
carries heavy opportunity costs, particularly with interest rates low.
VSEL's low rating has always reflected its dependence on a single customer
and inflexibility of its product. The strong cash position underpins the
shares, but investors looking for the upside will have to hope that
management proves as adept at finding new business as it has been at
reshaping the company over the past three years.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Yorks Water plans cutbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Water is set to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in a bid to beat
the efficiency targets established in what is expected to be an increasingly
restrictive price regime.
The company said it would cut its 4,000 strong utility workforce by 400 this
year. About half of the reduction arises from transferring employees to
contractors now providing services which Yorkshire previously carried out
itself.
It has been estimated the reduction could result in cost savings of up to 15
per cent on an on-going basis.
Yorkshire also announced that a substantial reduction in capital expenditure
 -from Pounds 303m to Pounds 221m - meant it would meet the spending targets
set at privatisation. Previously analysts had feared Yorkshire would spend
much more than forecast, leaving it with a lower return than expected on
funds invested.
Yorkshire's comments came as it announced pre-tax profits up from Pounds
139m to Pounds 144m for the year ended March 31. Turnover was ahead 10 per
cent at Pounds 531m.
The increase was achieved after lower than expected charges of Pounds 10m
for rationalising the core utility division and against a Pounds 4.4m
exceptional gain in 1993.
The regulated businesses continued to suffer from a decline in demand from
industrial customers. The fall was offset by a main charge increase of 7 per
cent, leaving operating profits up 5 per cent at Pounds 153m.
The non-regulated businesses, principally environmental and property, more
than doubled profits at the operating level from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 7.2m,
on sales 89 per cent higher at Pounds 51.9m. The property division
contributed Pounds 3.8m.
A final dividend of 15.2p makes 22.8p (21.25p) for the year. Earnings were
up 4.6 per cent at 68p (65p), although the increase rises to 8.3 per cent
when a Pounds 4.4m exceptional gain in 1993 is excluded.
COMMENT
Yorkshire is proving its determination to get to grips with costs and
surprised many by its tough line on capital expenditure. With the benefits
yet to feed through on technology improvements it seems one of the better
bets to beat whatever efficiency targets are set by the regulator in the
current price review. Nevertheless, the sector is likely to be dogged by
uncertainty until the end of July when the pricing regime becomes public.
Forecasts are for about Pounds 155m, with the usual cautious approach to the
dividend leaving expectations of a 7.8 per cent rise to 24.6p.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hambros Insurance falls 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambros Insurance Services yesterday blamed a poor performance by its loss
adjusting business for a 15 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds
8.3m for the year to March 31.
The decline in profits was foreshadowed at the interim stage.
The results covered the group's first complete year of trading and compared
with Pounds 9.8m on a pro forma basis.
The group said that loss adjusting had 'suffered from the exceptionally low
level of claims experienced by the insurance industry'. Turnover for the
division declined to Pounds 38.6m (Pounds 41.6m), but profits fell by more
than 50 per cent to Pounds 2m (Pounds 5m).
Hambros said it was reviewing the structure and cost base of its loss
adjusting operation in order to identify areas where its services could be
improved and broadened.
By contrast, Hambros' other businesses all performed well. Hambro Legal
Protection - which sells legal expenses insurance and telephone helplines
services - increased profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 4.5m, with turnover
rising to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 9.9m).
Beale Dobie, which trades second hand endowment policies, increased profits
by 17 per cent to Pounds 1.4m with turnover ahead to Pounds 20.4m (Pounds
14.9m).
Earnings fell to 7.8p (11.2p). A proposed final dividend of 3.7p makes a
5.55p total.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise North Sea field reaches peak
output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil, the UK's largest independent explorer, yesterday announced
that its Nelson field in the North Sea had achieved peak production of
160,000 barrels a day only four months after the platform produced its first
oil.
Enterprise, which is locked in a hostile bid battle for Lasmo, the second
largest company in the exploration sector, has been labouring under
financial constraints. The Nelson field is its largest project to date. It
is also the first time that it has operated a North Sea platform.
Part of Enterprise's justification for the bid has been that it can use
Nelson's strong cash flow to bring forward Lasmo projects that might
otherwise be delayed by a lack of financing.
Mr Mark Hope, general manager, said the rapid move to peak production had
been achieved in large part by pre-drilling eight wells, which were ready to
flow once the platform was operational.
Additional wells were being drilled from the platform.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: MEPC advances to Pounds 47.6m - Further
moves made into retail and industrial property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, announced pre-tax profits of
Pounds 47.6m for the six months to end-March, compared with Pounds 43.8m in
the first half last year.
Lord Blakenham, chairman, described the half year as 'very active', as the
group pursued its strategy of moving further into retail and industrial
property and of building its overseas base.
MEPC has bought Pounds 363m of property since its last year end, including
shopping centres in Los Angeles and Atlanta in the US and in Derby, a
portfolio of office and industrial properties in the West Midlands and an
office building in Brisbane, Australia.
The shopping centre in Northridge, California, which was severely damaged by
earthquake, is likely to be open, following refurbishment, in March 1995.
The pre-tax profits, generated from net income ahead from Pounds 108.6m to
Pounds 112.6m, were boosted by Pounds 2.3m of property sales, against losses
and provisions of Pounds 8.7m.
MEPC said that the movement in relevant property indices suggested an
increase in value of about 12-14 per cent in the value of its UK portfolio
in the six-month period.
Although there has been no revaluation of the property portfolio, net asset
value per share has increased by 4 per cent from 416p to 431p. That reflects
an element of retained profit, currency movements plus the premium on the
share issue for the acquisition of American Property Trust which took place
in December 1993.
Mr James Tuckey, chief executive, said that signs of rental growth were
'patchy'. MEPC does not expect an early resumption of its development
programme, although a few small developments were underway within its
existing portfolio.
Net interest costs rose from Pounds 52.5m to Pounds 62.8m.
Earnings per share increased from 7.8p to 8.3p and the interim dividend is
held at 5.25p.
The comparisons with last year's reported figures are affected by the
adoption of FRS 3 and 4.
COMMENT
After slightly disappointing interim profits, MEPC looks set for a stronger
performance in the second half as additional income from new acquisitions
kicks in and rent-free periods fade out. Pre-tax profits for the full year
of about Pounds 105m seem possible, but the second half is likely to be
weaker than the first in terms of asset growth, since the market has lost
some of its momentum in the last few months. However, with gearing at just
50 per cent, net assets per share are unlikely to exceed 520p at the end of
September. That puts the shares, which rose by 5p to close at 455p
yesterday, on a discount of 12.5 per cent. Given a yield of 5.5 per cent,
assuming the dividend is not cut, the shares offer reasonable value.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lonrho spotlights its African interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho yesterday signalled the next stage in its plan to realise the value
of its African assets by saying it might float its general trading
activities on the Continent.
The move follows the successful market debut earlier this year of Ashanti
Goldfields, which valued Lonrho's 43 per cent stake at Dollars 720m - five
times its book value of Pounds 90m.
It announced yesterday that it was considering selling a minority stake in
its African businesses excluding mining or sugar. This though would leave a
question mark over the future of these extensive and more profitable
operations.
Mr Tiny Rowland and Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executives, said in a
statement yesterday that Lonrho was setting up a board committee to look at
ways of strengthening the group's African trading activities. The shares
closed up 3p at 138 1/2 p.
Lonrho has a diverse range of trading activities in Africa including motor
and equipment distribution, textile manufacturing, electrical goods supply
and aircraft services management. The combined businesses are estimated to
have a total turnover of up to Pounds 500m and were profitable last year.
If a flotation is decided upon, it is likely that the African company will
come to the London market, and possibly another, within a year. It is
estimated that Lonrho will be looking to sell a stake of about 30 per cent.
The company said a sale would help it to determine the value of a mixed
range of businesses. It would also strengthen the operations by bringing in
outside shareholders who might be prepared to invest further in the
businesses.
Analysts said the move might be seen as part of a strategy to strip out
lower growth businesses Mr Bock has been pursuing since he took charge of
the group earlier this year.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel in the grip of a financial vice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel's rights shares closed at 43p on their first day of trading
yesterday, as the company's shares continued to rise following the
resolution last week of its second debt crisis.
However, while the share price suggested renewed confidence on the long-term
future, the rights document emphasises the financial vice in which
Eurotunnel has found itself.
The document lists the conditions attached to the company's latest Pounds
693m tranche of senior debt and the high price it has had to pay for its
Pounds 50m top-up loan. The signing up of some Pounds 700m of debt was a
pre-requisite to the launch of last week's Pounds 858m rights issue, and
about two thirds of the original 220 banks failed to participate.
The loans are due to fund the company through to projected profitability in
1998, and repayment is due between 2000 and 2006. Eurotunnel has predicted a
first dividend in 2003, but according to the document, this will be
contingent upon it achieving its refinancing projections between 2001 and
2008.
The banks have attached tight conditions on the loans, which are based upon
their own conservative projections, or banking cases, rather than
Eurotunnel's. In addition, the company needs to demonstrate that net cash
flow up to February 2006, plus the balance of certain Eurotunnel accounts,
is one and a half times the amount of senior debt payable up to that date.
If the figure falls below 1.2 times for more than 90 days, the company will
be in default.
Eurotunnel is confident that it has a comfortable Pounds 470m financial
cushion, based on the agreed refinancing. This includes the Pounds 50m
top-up loan from Morgan Grenfell and Warburg, which will cost 4 per cent
over lenders' cost of funds, in addition to sizeable arrangement fees. Under
existing agreements, it can also borrow a further Pounds 325m (at current
exchange rates). If the company actually needs the money, however, it is
likely to be in breach of those agreements.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Sunleigh buys Maclaren for Pounds 19.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lazy babies, who enjoy a bit of sailing and golf, will be able to buy all
their vehicles from Sunleigh after its acquisition of Maclaren Group.
The maker of Powakaddy motorised golf trolleys and Laser sailing dingies
yesterday announced plans to pay up to Pounds 19.2m for Maclaren, the
manufacturer of baby buggies and pushchairs.
Founded 30 years ago by the late Mr Owen Finlay Maclaren, an aeronautical
engineer, the group also makes golf trolley wheels. But Mr Alan Hancock,
Sunleigh's chief executive, insisted there was rather more to the deal than
that.
'The enlarged group will cover three distinct consumer durable sectors but
the fundamental characteristics, cultures and skills of the business are
very similar.'
To fund the acquisition Sunleigh is increasing its share capital more than
fourfold with a conditional placing of 320.1m new shares at 6p.
Shareholders can apply for 96.5m of these on a 1-for-1 basis at the same
price.
Sunleigh is buying the business from the management team who acquired it in
1990 from BET, which in turn bought it as part of its Hestair acquisition.
Hestair bought it from the Maclaren family for Pounds 12.9m in 1988.
It made an operating profit of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of Pounds 26m in the
year to August.
Trading in Sunleigh's shares, suspended at 8p on the USM last week, should
resume on the Official List on June 30.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs behind 49% decline at
Union Intl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union International, the trading arm of the Vestey group, yesterday
announced a 49 per cent fall to Pounds 6.5m in pre-tax profits for 1993.
However, that reflected the group's substantial restructuring - its core
business showed growth.
Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive, has almost completed the group's
refocusing on food processing and distribution, while reducing its enormous
debt through the sale of non-core businesses.
'The company has moved from intensive care to recuperation', he said. Mr
Robinson's contract runs out at the end of the year, and is unlikely to be
renewed.
During 1993, total bank debt fell by Pounds 77.4m to Pounds 124.6m, helped
by the sale of Pounds 96m of assets - including UK properties, its
Australian fisheries business and Brazilian trading operations.
Turnover fell 25 per cent to Pounds 891.5m as a result of disposals, but
continuing operations showed an 8.3 per cent increase in sales and
contributed Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 21m) in profit
Interest charges fell from Pounds 32.6m to Pounds 21.6m due to the debt
reduction, but profits were held back by an Pounds 8m exceptional loss,
resulting from asset disposals.
In the UK, the food distribution businesses performed strongly. Weddel Swift
Depots, the largest national meat wholesaler, achieved a 70 per cent
increase in operating profit to Pounds 1.1m. However, Union's retail chains
of butchers in the UK - which include Dewhurst, Alex Munro and Baxters -
showed a decline in profits during the year.
The group's Australian businesses, including meat packing, retail and
wholesaling, and also a profitable property business, showed strong growth.
There is speculation that these will be floated off but Mr Robinson refused
to comment.

FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Control Techniques edges ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Control Techniques fell by more than 9 per cent yesterday after
the Powys-based electronic drives group reported a modest 3 per cent
increase in interim profits on lower sales and blamed 'a slow start in a
poor first quarter'.
The shares closed down 45p at 442p after the group reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 3.84m after US reorganisation costs of Pounds 600,000 in the six
months to March 31, against profits of Pounds 3.72m after reorganisation
costs of Pounds 200,000 in the comparable period.
Turnover fell from Pounds 54.2m to Pounds 52.1m, reflecting the effects of
the reorganisation in the US which resulted in the postponement of Pounds
1.4m of sales to the second half.
Despite the setback, Mr Trevor Wheatley, chairman, said the US operations,
which were acquired three years ago and have undergone substantial
rationalisation, were now in profit.
'The second quarter moved ahead very strongly and order books are some 17
per cent ahead of the same time last year and showing signs of improving
even further,' he said. 'Orders in April were an all-time record and over 40
per cent up on the same month last year.'
Earnings in the first half increased by 10 per cent to 6.5p (5.9p), and the
interim dividend is raised to 2.6p (2.35p) reflecting confidence about the
outcome for the year as a whole and the fact that the reorganisation process
is now substantially complete.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 524,000 (Pounds 807,000) although net
borrowings increased to Pounds 13.8m at the end of March, up from Pounds
8.63m at the end of September, partly reflecting growth in stocks.
The group opened four new CT Drive Centres in Denmark, the Czech Republic,
India and Norway during the first half bringing the total to 27 - more than
half way to its target of 50.
COMMENT
A nervous market punished Control Techniques for surprising it with
unexpected re-organisation costs and disappointing figures yesterday.
Nevertheless, the fundamentals remain strong, and provided orders are
converted into sales, the outlook for the second half is good. Eliminating
losses in the US and cutting costs in Germany will help margins. Pre-tax
profits should reach at least Pounds 12m this year, producing earnings of
20p. Even after yesterday's fall the shares are still trading on a
prospective multiple of 22.1, which reflects continued speculation about the
intentions of Emerson Electric, the US group which holds a 29.37 per cent
stake.

FT  03 JUN 94 / AIG fund to invest Dollars 1.1bn in Asian projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American International Group, the US insurer, will today announce it has
raised Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 730m) for investment in infrastructure in
developing Asian countries, about half of it destined for power,
telecommunications and transport projects in China.
The government of Singapore, through two of its investment funds, has
provided Dollars 250m of the money, signalling a policy to switch more of
its international investment to supporting Asian development. The fund is
backed by 24 institutional investors, most of them pension funds and others
based in the US.
The completion of the fund comes just 10 days after Tiger Management, one of
the biggest hedge fund groups, was forced to withdraw its own planned
Dollars 1bn infrastructure fund.
In an attempt to kick-start that fund, Tiger and GE Investments, which
manages pension fund money for General Electric, earlier this year agreed to
contribute Dollars 225m between them. However, the proposed fund is believed
to have suffered from the adverse publicity hedge funds attracted after some
made big losses in financial markets earlier this year.
The fate of the most ambitious infrastructure investment scheme announced to
date, between hedge fund manager Mr George Soros and GE Capital, General
Electric's financial services arm, remains unclear. In January, each side
agreed to contribute Dollars 200m to the venture, which was intended
eventually to attract as much as Dollars 2.5bn to invest in power projects
in developing countries.
Yesterday, GE Capital said that no efforts were under way to attract
additional investors. 'We are focusing our energies right now on finding
investment opportunities. Securing other investors was not the priority,' it
said.
The AIG fund will be managed by Emerging Markets Corporation, a
Washington-based company set up two years ago by two World Bank veterans, Mr
Moeen Qureshi and Mr Don Roth. AIG has put Dollars 100m into the fund. GE,
which has backed infrastructure funds to support the sale of its own power
generation equipment in developing countries, is also believed to be an
investor.
Around half of the Bermuda-registered fund is expected to be invested in
projects in China, with the rest in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Taiwan and Thailand.
The closed-end fund is believed to have set a target of achieving a 20-25
per cent compound annual return for investors over its projected 10-year
life.
Earlier this year, Mr Qureshi, a former caretaker prime minister of
Pakistan, said that the fund respresented 'a sea change in the willingness
of long-term investors to venture out into developing countries'.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Assurance on profit margins at Siebe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe, the international controls and engineering group, yesterday reported
a 20 per cent increase in profitability and sought to allay concern that it
was suffering margin pressure.
The UK-based group increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 182m to Pounds 217m
in the year to April 2, while sales grew by 15 per cent, from Pounds 1.62bn
to Pounds 1.86bn. Currency translation boosted the profits figure by Pounds
13m and sales by Pounds 133m.
Mr Allen Yurko, chief executive, said the group's return on sales had dipped
from 14.7 to 14.3 per cent, but this was attributable to acquisitions made
during the year.
Underlying margins were slightly ahead, although the group was concentrating
on increasing market share, rather than pushing up margins. Mr Yurko said
the group had also adjusted intra-group pricing to take less profits in the
US.
Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman, said the final quarter of the year confirmed
indications of a considerable improvement in certain markets, 'particularly
in North and South America, Asia and, to a limited extent, in the UK and
Australasia'.
He added that although there had been signs of improved demand, Siebe
continued to believe continental European and Japanese markets would remain
subdued until the end of this calendar year, particularly as many customers
relied heavily on domestic demand 'which is at present quiet in these
areas'.
Sales in the controls divisions, after excluding currency translation and
acquisitions, increased by 5.9 per cent and were particularly strong in the
second half. Mr Yurko said he was confident that these divisions would show
real growth of 10 per cent in the current year.
Operating cashflow rose to Pounds 126m from Pounds 95m, and gearing fell
from 66 to 25 per cent. Shareholders' funds rose by Pounds 208m to Pounds
950m, thanks mainly to last November's Pounds 184m rights issue.
The profits figure was struck after Pounds 17.3m of restructuring costs,
down from Pounds 11.4m the previous year.
Earnings per share rose by 19.4 per cent to 31.4p (26.3p). A final dividend
of 7.34p gives a total of 11p (9.86p), an increase of 11.6 per cent.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Bronfman plays for Time against a critical audience: Bernard
Simon explains why Seagram's new CEO is under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edgar Bronfman Jr made no secret this week of his irritation with the
speculation that has billowed around Seagram, the international drinks group
controlled by the Bronfman family. Making his debut as Seagram's chief
executive at the annual meeting in Montreal, Mr Bronfman hit out against
'inaccurate and baseless' reports about Seagram's intentions towards Time
Warner, the powerful entertainment conglomerate in which Seagram has a 14.99
per cent stake.
Mr Bronfman's concern is understandable. Seagram's new 39-year old CEO
carries an immense burden. He needs to show Seagram shareholders - not least
his father and uncle, who remain co-chairmen - that he can match the
accomplishments of his grandfather, Sam Bronfman, who transformed a small
Canadian liquor business into the world's biggest drinks company, and his
father, Edgar Sr, who in his 23 years at the helm has greatly enlarged what
'Mr Sam' started.
In particular, the younger Bronfman has to convince outsiders that Seagram's
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) investment in Time Warner is a wise one. The
entertainment group has been very much his project since Seagram secretly
started buying shares in February 1993.
Edgar Sr gave his son a ringing endorsement minutes before the annual
meeting: 'He's got great judgment. For a young man of 39, he's got great
wisdom.'
During his 14 years with Seagram, Edgar Jr is credited with moving its
liquor business away from mass-market, low-profit brands, and with
spearheading two bold acquisitions.
The 1987 purchase of Martell, the French cognac producer, has given Seagram
a strong foothold in Asia. Another initiative was the 1988 acquisition of
Tropicana Products, a leading US orange juice producer. Although Seagram had
hoped for stronger earnings growth from Tropicana, it believes the rising
popularity of fruit juices and Tropicana's high market share will pay off.
Mr Bronfman provided further evidence of a fresh approach by unveiling a
top-to-bottom 're-engineering' of Seagram's operations. Every part of the
company will come under scrutiny in an attempt to cut costs and improve
performance.
None the less, the dalliance with Time Warner has failed to excite
investors. The stake has barely been reflected in Seagram's share price,
which stood at Dollars 31.13 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Critics are concerned that Mr Bronfman may be biting off more than he can
chew, especially bearing in mind Time Warner's Dollars 15bn debt. They have
been quick to cast doubt on the Time Warner investment by pointing to Mr
Bronfman's fascination with show business, including his early career as a
film-maker. These reservations have been fanned by the entertainment group's
apparent reluctance to give its new shareholder a seat on the board.
Mr Bronfman insisted this week that the concerns were 'unwarranted'. He
maintained, as Seagram has all along, that the purchase of the Time Warner
stock is a passive investment that follows the pattern set by Seagram's 25
per cent stake in Du Pont, the US chemicals group.
Seagram has no plans at present to lift its Time Warner stake above 15 per
cent. Mr Bronfman insisted: 'There is nothing wrong with anyone being
interested in what is clearly the fastest-growing, most global industry in
North America.'
According to a recent article in the New Yorker magazine, the investment was
the culmination of a lengthy process which included consultations with
several outside advisers and a look at many other sectors, including luxury
goods and fragrances.
There is one important difference, however, between Seagram's investment in
Time Warner and its stake in Du Pont. The chemicals group has been a
motherlode to Seagram. Without Du Pont's dividends, which have totalled
Dollars 575m over the past two years, it is unlikely that Seagram would have
been able to afford Martell or Tropicana.
The returns from Time Warner are unlikely to be so generous in the short
term.
But Mr Bronfman asked Seagram's shareholders for patience. He predicted that
Time Warner's profits and share price would rise 'dramatically' over the
next five to ten years. The stature of the third generation of Bronfmans
will hinge on whether this prediction comes true.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Boots beats forecasts with 19% advance: Shares helped by 12%
dividend increase - Debts transformed into net cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots yesterday shrugged off problems at its pharmaceuticals and DIY
businesses to beat the best City forecasts with a 19 per cent increase in
underlying profits.
After exceptional charges of Pounds 68.5m, relating mainly to withdrawal of
the Manoplax heart drug and restructuring of the Do It All DIY joint
venture, pre-tax profits increased 2.6 per cent from Pounds 405.2m to Pounds
415.9m.
Before the charges, pre-tax profits were Pounds 484.4m - some Pounds 20m
higher than consensus forecasts - on turnover which increased 5.2 per cent
to Pounds 4.17bn.
Buoyed by a proposed final dividend of 10.1p, lifting the total pay-out 12
per cent to 15p, the shares gained 22p to 527p.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said Boots was reaping the benefits of
developing its own brand and vertical integration.
A higher proportion of own-label sales helped Boots the Chemists again to
lift its operating margin - from 10.7 per cent to 11.5 per cent - with
operating profits increasing from Pounds 285m to Pounds 322.9m. Boots
Contract Manufacturing, the cosmetics and healthcare business which sells
almost two-thirds of its output to Boots the Chemists, in turn raised
profits nearly a quarter to Pounds 16.2m.
Own-label sales were also growing at Halfords and Boots Opticians, which
both lifted profits, and at Children's World and Do It All which reduced
their losses. Boots and partners WH Smith are selling 100 Do It All stores,
reducing the chain to 140.
The prescription drugs business, Boots Pharmaceuticals, raised profits from
Pounds 91.4m to Pounds 94.2m in spite of the failure of Manoplax, but Sir
James said the strategic review of the business was continuing. He confirmed
that a merchant bank was assessing merger and sale opportunites.
'This is a complex process and we won't be rushed,' he said. 'All options
remain open. The only thing that has been ruled out is carrying on as we
are.'
Boots Healthcare International, the over-the-counter drugs division, more
than doubled operating profits to Pounds 6.6m.
Sir James is keen to expand Healthcare International through acquisitions
and has the cash to do so. Boots transformed Pounds 203.8m debts into net
cash of Pounds 69m - before Pounds 94m proceeds from the sale last week of
Farleys baby foods to HJ Heinz - in spite of record capital spending of
Pounds 224m. Much of that went on the retail businesses, with Boots the
Chemists adding 48 smaller stores.
Boots Properties raised profits by almost a quarter to Pounds 67.1m.
Earnings per share, after exceptional items, increased from 27p to 27.7p.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Treasury to raise Pounds 1bn-plus in sale of company debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Treasury plans to raise between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn this
summer through the sale of bonds issued by privatised companies, including
British Telecommunications, the power generators and regional electricity
distributors.
Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank acting for the Treasury, said
yesterday that the privatised companies were being offered the first chance
to buy back their debt. The companies have been asked to submit indicative
bids for the debt by June 17, after which the Treasury will draw up a list
of the bonds to be offered for sale.
Investment banks will also be offered the chance to indicate the price at
which they feel they can sell the debt to outside investors. The Treasury
hopes this element of competition will maximise the return to the UK
taxpayer.
The Treasury still holds about Pounds 2.75bn of debt from former
nationalised industries, about half of which was issued by BT.
This summer's sale of debt forms part of the Pounds 5.5bn privatisation
programme for 1994-95. The programme, announced in last November's Budget,
includes receipt of final payments for BT3 shares and the sale of remaining
stakes in the generators.
Salomon said recent turmoil in bond markets had not affected the ability of
companies to issue sterling denominated debt in the primary markets. City
economists said the sale was likely to succeed because of the quality of the
companies - BT and National Grid, for instance, have AAA ratings, the
highest possible.
But Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, cautioned: 'The price of
almost all debt and equity instruments has fallen and it might not go as
well as previous debt sales.'
Salomon said the privatised companies had expressed considerable interest in
buying back their debt. In April, Eastern Electricity bought back debt with
a face value of Pounds 118m for Pounds 145m. The companies will also have
the option of converting the bonds, issued at interest rates of around 12.5
per cent, into debt at current market rates. The high coupons on the
outstanding bonds mean that the Treasury expects to sell them at 10-20 per
cent above their face value.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Candidates for Delors job court French support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The competition to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission took an unexpected direction yesterday, with two leading
candidates courting France in an effort to halt a Paris-Bonn bandwagon in
favour of Mr Jean Luc-Dehaene, the Belgian premier.
Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister, and Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade
negotiator, paid separate visits to Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime
minister, in a rare turn of public lobbying for a job which, in the past,
has been settled through discreet diplomacy.
After the meetings, a spokesman for Mr Balladur said that 'France was open
to examining the merits of all candidates' for the Brussels job. 'The fact
that both Mr Lubbers and Sir Leon are of high quality is flattering for the
Commission.' France and Germany have made little effort to hide their
preference for Mr Dehaene as a successor to Mr Delors, but French officials
insisted that the two allies cannot pre-empt a decision that is scheduled to
be made unanimously at the EU summit in Corfu on June 24-25.
Mr Lubbers, the longest serving Dutch prime minister, stressed this week
that the choice of a successor to Mr Delors lay 'not only with Bonn and
Paris'. He appealed to other countries to make up their own minds.
Sir Leon's camp reacted with enthusiasm to Mr Lubbers' determination to
ignore the apparent Franco-German snub and stay in the race. Supporters
calculate that this increases the chance of a deadlock at Corfu, opening the
way for Sir Leon or the other long-shot candidate, Mr Peter Sutherland, the
outgoing head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Next week campaigning is expected to intensify, with Sir Leon planning to
visit Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister. Another crucial
meeting takes place on Monday between Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and
President Felipe Gonzalez of Spain.
Although Mr Gonzalez has pledged to support Mr Lubbers, a senior Spanish
official said yesterday that the promise was made when Sir Leon was the only
declared candidate.
Europeandisarray has spread to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), which now looks unlikely to reach agreement on a new
secretary general at its annual ministerial meeting in Paris next week.
With the UK, France and Germany all fielding rival candidates, European
members of the OECD want more time to select a single European candidate.

FT  03 JUN 94 / PM hardens attack on European integration: Poll suggests
Tories face disaster on June 9
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major hardened the tone of his attacks on European integration last
night as an opinion poll suggested the Conservatives face disaster in the
elections on Thursday.
A Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph puts the Conservatives in third
place behind the Liberal Democrats and more than 30 percentage points behind
Labour.
It estimates support for the Conservatives at just 21 per cent, down 3.5
percentage points since early May, compared with 21.5 per cent for the
Liberal Democrats (down 3.5 points), and 54 per cent for Labour (up 9.5
points).
The gap between the Conservatives and Labour is the biggest since the height
of the poll tax debacle in 1989, when it stood at about 30 percentage
points.
Labour officials said part of the increase in support was probably due to
public sympathy following the death of Mr John Smith, and increased media
coverage caused by the contest to succeed him.
However, the poll suggests that Labour is on course for a landslide victory
in the European elections, while the Conservatives could be reduced to a
handful of seats.
The only consolation for the Conservatives is that the poll was carried out
between May 25 and May 30 - before the prime minister launched an attack on
European Union integration at a rally in Ellesmere Port on Tuesday.
Conservative strategists believe his concept of a multi-speed Europe, in
which member states progress at different rates, offers the best hope of
persuading Tory supporters to vote.
Senior officials said last night's speech was intended to shore up the
Conservatives' image as the strongest defender of British rights in the EU.
In his most forthright comments of the campaign, Mr Major said he was
unrepentant about his criticisms of the EU, and insisted 'Europe has gone
wrong in recent years'.
He pledged to campaign for an open Europe in which the weight of bureaucracy
and regulation was dramatically reduced, and which was not 'the remote
preserve of an elite circle of politicians and bureaucrats'.
Mr Major's return to the Euro-sceptic theme will be welcomed by Conservative
right-wingers, who believe they have won the party's internal battle about
its approach to the Union.
Labour said the speech showed the government's willingness to draft policy
to cover Conservative splits rather than in the national interest.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's European elections campaign manager, said the prime
minister was 'once again selling Britain short in Europe'.

FT  03 JUN 94 / OECD will seek backing for plan to cut jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finance and labour ministers from the world's leading industrialised nations
will be asked next week to endorse 57 detailed proposals to cut the 35m army
of unemployed in their countries.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will seek the
backing of its 25 member governments for the recommendations as a step
towards drawing up tailor-made unemployment reduction programmes for each
member state.
The plan is that the programmes should be ready in autumn to catch a
hoped-for quickening of growth in the industrialised world that would lessen
the pain of some of the planned measures. Against a background of strong US
growth and rising hopes of recovery in Japan and continental Europe, the
OECD secretariat is expected to tell ministers next week that growth in the
OECD area will be faster than last December's forecasts of 2.1 per cent for
this year and 2.7 per cent for 1995.
The jobs paper, which will be put forward by Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the
secretary general, is likely to be an uncomfortable read for many
governments in Europe, where the organisation envisages an increase in
unemployment to 22m next year.
It is expected to urge governments to look at such institutions as minimum
wages, arguing that these increase youth unemployment. It will advocate
changes to tax and benefit systems in many countries, so that the benefit
safety net targets people in real need. It will propose cuts in Europe's
high non-wage labour costs such as payroll taxes, suggesting that
governments levy taxes on consumption if they need to make up revenue
shortfalls. It is also expected to advocate lower direct taxes where this
would make it more attractive for employers to hire people with low skills
for low wage jobs.
However, the OECD will underline the importance of social policies to ensure
that people on low wages have acceptable incomes.
The study strongly supports many of the changes made by the UK government to
make Britain's labour market more flexible.
The OECD's aim is not to put forward a magic solution for cutting
unemployment, recognising that its recommendations will apply with different
force in the various member states, depending on local conditions.
The paper will be discussed by ministers in Paris on Tuesday. Once endorsed,
the document will form the basis of further discussions on combatting
unemployment among the Group of Seven leading industrial countries at their
annual economic summit in Naples next month.

FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Privatised debt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having sold its equity stakes in UK utilities, it makes sense for the
Treasury to clean out the cupboard and sell its stake in their debt as well.
Still, given the fragile state of the bond markets it must hope that the
bulk of the proceeds come from purchases by the companies themselves. That
way the government would be tapping a genuine new source of funds.
The incentives for the companies to buy back the debt are considerable. Not
only does it free them of any associated covenants; it may be preferable to
seeing the debt repackaged and sold on by merchant banks with whom the
company has no direct relationship. But the debt is trading at a premium
while the companies are carrying it at face value in their balance sheets.
Those that buy it back must take a hit in their profit and loss account.
The first sales programme sought to get round this problem by adjusting the
price at which companies bid for their own debt. Effectively it was reduced
to take account of the future tax they would pay as a result of their lower
interest charge. Doubtless that will again provide an incentive. Perhaps
more important is the state of the markets. With long term rates so high,
now may be a good time for the companies to move. The purchase premium is
unlikely to fall much further. With luck the debt may be refinanced at lower
rates later.

FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Siebe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The reluctance of Siebe's share price to rise with the market after
yesterday's full-year results suggests investors are not yet quite convinced
that it can deliver strong organic growth in the recovery. That may be a bit
grudging after the relatively strong second-half progress in controls which
account for three quarters of all sales. Presumably the recession in the
European automotive sector which held back the specialist engineering
division will not last for ever, while there must be room for fairly rapid
margin improvement at the new European acquisitions.
Changes in intra-company pricing may have reduced the tax charge, but they
make it even harder for outsiders to analyse what is happening to margins.
For example, transfer pricing changes may be one reason why margins in North
America do not seem fully to reflect recovery there. The best test of
Siebe's performance in the current year will thus also be one of the most
basic - the extent to which overall sales are driven by organic growth.
Despite the second-half improvement, last year's group turnover rose by only
2 per cent before currency changes and acquisitions.
Siebe's says it is now more interested in higher market share than margin
enhancement. That may say something about the nature of an economic recovery
in which prices remain under pressure. Yet Siebe's operating margin which
remained high during the recession is already 14.3 per cent. If that cannot
be improved much in the recovery, one wonders whether it will again defy
gravity when the next downturn hits.

FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal's enthusiasm to buy shares in Euro Disney is
matched by Walt Disney's willingness to cut its stake. Given that the US
media group knows the project better than the Saudi prince, that looks like
yet another argument for selling the shares. Even so, the prince's
involvement could help Euro Disney's forthcoming rights issue in a number of
technical ways. For a start, it means there is less chance that the
underwriters may have to unload hundreds of millions of unwanted shares on
the market after the issue. It also makes it more likely that the issue
price will be nearer the top of the FFr5-FFr10 range. So shareholders who do
not take up their rights may not be quite as heavily diluted as feared.
In the longer run, the prince's promise to build a Dollars 100m convention
centre should help fill Euro Disney's empty hotels. The hope must be that
his involvement will also make it more likely that a second 'gate' at the
theme park is built. Given that the banks have a grip on future spending by
Euro Disney, the company could probably not act on its own.
Of course, if the prince is as shrewd a financier as his investment in
Citicorp would suggest, he will not be willing to give small shareholders a
free ride on his convention centre. He will presumably negotiate a deal that
ensures that the lion's share of the extra hotel revenues from the project
flow to him rather than Euro Disney. Then again, if the prince is smart, he
may indeed be buying into Euro Disney at the bottom of the roller-coaster.

FT  03 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Tonic from Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots has again confounded its critics by widening margins in its chemists
chain on rising sales. Since most of the headaches acquired with Ward White
are also showing improvement - Halfords in particular is starting to perform
 -yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares looks justified. Still, Boots is
earning only Pounds 7m operating profit on retail turnover of Pounds 900m
outside the chemists business. It cannot afford to rest on its laurels. Do
It All and A G Stanley continue to defy their parent's much vaunted retail
skills.
With Pounds 150m cash in hand - including the proceeds from the sale of
Farley's - Boots can also afford to look for growth elsewhere. The cash
position would strengthen further if it decides to get out of prescription
pharmaceuticals, although piecemeal disposals look more likely than an
outright sale or - given its experience with Do It All - joint ventures. The
snag is that credible investment opportunities are thin on the ground. The
retail side of the business is generating cash faster than Boots can spend
it. Diversification has rightly been ruled out.
The best hope for expansion lies in over-the-counter medicines. But such
acquisitions do not come cheap. Boots would be bidding against the giants of
the pharmaceuticals industry should larger brands become available. It is
also doubtful whether Boots has the experience to compete as a serious force
in the US. Smaller OTC acquisitions in Europe may thus be the best way
forward, even if that means returning some cash to shareholders. Since Boots
has still not shaken off the legacy of its last big move, investors might
welcome such a cautious approach.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Personal View: Russia - not the country you expect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAYARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western perceptions of Russia are still desperately awry. Intelligent
friends still ask whether there is enough to eat. Such excessive pessimism
has scared off western business, so that great opportunities are being
missed. Western business needs a balanced view of the pluses and minuses.
Let me begin with the pluses.
Russia has privatised at a rate unknown in history. By now two-thirds of
Russian industry, big and small, is in private hands. Most shares are fully
tradeable, to foreign buyers as well as Russians.
Shares are cheap. If you spend Dollars 1,000 to buy 'vouchers' and exchange
these for a representative portfolio of shares, you will end up owning
capital that produces Dollars 20,000 of output each year (at present
exchange rates). The comparable output figure for shares bought on the
London stock market would be about Dollars 500.
From July 1, a new wave of privatisation will begin, covering the rest of
industry and huge chunks of oil, gas and telecommunications. These shares
will be sold directly for cash, by investment tender, and (given the low
purchasing power in Russia) many will represent bargains.
As well as a big domestic market, Russia has other advantages. In natural
resources, it has amazing reserves of oil, gas, diamonds, nickel, aluminium,
uranium, iron ore and land.
It is also rich in human resources: an extraordinary supply of well-trained
engineers, and a good general level of education in science and mathematics.
Business education is minimal but the commercial spirit is widespread.
Industrial relations are good. There has been almost no social unrest.
Some western companies have noticed all this. They are investing in all
kinds of industries, generally with the Russian home market as the chief
initial target. Thus we see foreigners in food, drink and tobacco (Mars,
Pepsi, Philip Morris), retail and fast food (Littlewoods, McDonald's),
engineering (ABB, Otis), telecoms and gas, financial services, hotels, real
estate.
There are, of course, some major problems:
Production: output of manufacturing and mining has fallen by 25 per cent in
the last year. But much of this fall is in military hardware, obsolete
capital equipment, and ill-designed consumer products. By contrast total
household consumption actually rose - by 4 per cent, according to official
figures (of income, minus saving), or more than 15 per cent, according to
household surveys. Average food consumption is back to 1991 levels.
Inflation: this is still high, but it has been reduced from 25 per cent a
month in early 1993 to less than 10 per cent. This is due to a massive
credit squeeze, with real interest rates now above 5 per cent per month.
With continuing high interest rates, inflation can be made to keep falling.
But this requires political will.
Politics: Russian politics is always difficult but is probably more stable
now than at any time since the reform began. The government is a broad
national coalition in which most of the key ministries are headed by
reformers. Few westerners seem to realise this.
It is true that the Duma has a conservative majority, but its conduct has so
far been moderate (except for the release of former vice-president Alexander
Rutskoi), and its economic committees are chaired by non-conservative
deputies. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic party, will
run for president in December 1995, but his chances are poor.
Mafia: openness in turn encourages crime. The mafia, already strong under
communism, is now all-pervasive. Even so, the streets of Moscow are safer
than in New York.
Legal system: in fact, the biggest problem for foreign business is still on
the legal front. On the one side property rights and commercial law are
unclear and there is inadequate legal redress and law enforcement. On the
other side there is still too much regulation, too much corruption and too
many unpredictable taxes.
But Russia's leaders know all this. Only last month, President Boris Yeltsin
abolished virtually all export quotas and ordered further simplifications of
laws and taxes.
Thus, beneath the ripples of conflict and contradictory action, there is a
steady tide running towards a regular market economy. Most westerners who
visit Moscow for the first time say: 'Is this the country I have been
hearing about in the media?' The best answer is: 'Go and see.'

So, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown buys his clothes from Marks and

1986 admitted purchasing M and S underwear.
But does he persuade the store to open its doors early for him to make his
purchases, as happened for health minister Virginia Bottomley, and Norma
Major, the prime minister's wife? Given that the Lib-Dems have complained to
the BBC about the lack of coverage of their Euro-election campaign, what
better way of gaining attention than by asking M and S to open up a little

General Sir Michael Rose, recently visited Bosnia to get a clearer picture
of the people he might be bombing. He got more than he bargained for.
Rose took him to the Serbs' north-eastern corridor near Brcko, reputedly now
one of the hottest spots in the war. They found a sole elderly and somnolent
shepherd who, spotting the admiral's medals, struggled to his feet and
saluted.
'You're obviously a military man,' ventured Smith. 'May I ask who you fought

'For Germany,' replied the shepherd proudly. 'Heil Hitler]'

Why is it taking Britain's Ministry of Defence such a long time to find a
new chief arms dealer? Sir Alan Thomas, current head of the Defence Export
Sales Organisation, steps down at the end of June. But a replacement has yet
to be announced - even though the MoD advertised the job last September.
On offer is plenty of overseas travel, hobnobbing with heads of state, and
(normally) a knighthood - it helps impress overseas clients.
Admittedly, it also sometimes involves rubbing shoulders with types who
might not get into your club. But these days it's a chance to run one of
Britain's great success stories; the UK is now the world's number three arms
seller.
It seems the MoD had little luck with headhunters, and has now fallen back
on the old boy network. The word is that a distinguished naval officer
declined the honour, and the idea of the MoD promoting one of its most
senior civilians appears to have been dismissed.
Still, Observer understands that the search is now drawing to a close.
Subject to cabinet approval, Britain's new top salesman will be a marketing
chap with a background in blue-chip companies closely associated with the
government.

John Gummer clearly has a lot on his plate at the moment. The UK environment
secretary's name appears on many people's lists for demotion in the expected
summer cabinet reshuffle; for such a long-serving stalwart of successive
Tory administrations, that prospect must concentrate the mind.
Enough, perhaps, to justify his 45-minute-late arrival on Wednesday evening
at a bash organised by London First, the business-led organisation to
promote Britain's capital.
Sir Terence Conran, Stuart Hampson of the John Lewis Partnership and Sir
Brian Jenkins of Coopers &amp; Lybrand were among 100 guests of Christopher
Moran - the former insurance broker expelled from Lloyd's 12 years ago - at
a dinner to raise awareness of London's 'intrinsic and enduring qualities'.
Gummer chose to pick a fight with Sir Richard Rogers who, in his speech,
delivered some home truths on the government's shortcomings over London.
The environment secretary took exception to Britain's leading architect
pointing out that London's docklands was only 60 per cent completed after 15
years of regeneration. Nor did he much care for Rogers reminding the
assembly that no other European capital has a large urban development that
is inaccessible by public transport at the weekends.
Time for a new portfolio. Minister for cleansing the streets of beggars
looks a possibility . . .

FT  03 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Networking Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe cannot afford to be left behind in the construction of fibre-optic
grids, or in the development of inter-active services to run over them. The
report of the EU's industry group on the Information Society, chaired by Mr
Martin Bangemann, must offer a clear framework of policy and regulation to
promote both goals.
From the summary of its recommendations published this week, the group
appears to be leading in the right direction. But it has left crucial
questions unanswered - notably the regulatory framework for competition in
service provision, and the protection of intellectual property.
Most of the principles for action laid down by the group are laudable. It
places the onus for the construction of 'superhighways' on the private
sector, and urges that state telecommunications operators be freed from
'non-commercial political burdens' - notably the duty to act as tax
collectors for their national governments. The group coyly urges 'practical
measures' with 'clear timetables' to achieve this. The best measures are, in
fact, privatisation and the separation of the regulatory function from
national operators and their sponsoring government departments. These are
proceeding painfully slowly across most of the EU.
The report is also right to call for greater harmonisation of equipment
standards and acceleration of the pace of telecoms liberalisation. On formal
occasions the Commission continues to pay lip service to the 1998 deadline
for 'voice' telecoms liberalisation agreed by EU ministers last June.
Effective policing
In practice, that timescale is being progressively eroded: multinationals
are being encouraged to contract with single operators to provide
pan-European 'private' networks; the Commission is toying with further
deregulation of the cable industry; and operators in the corporate sector
are discovering numerous ways to evade existing restrictions.
If competition is to flourish, the former monopolists will require effective
policing. Even in the UK, whose government has made competition the
cornerstone of its telecoms policy, British Telecommunications commands
nearly 90 per cent of the market 10 years after the abolition of its
monopoly. Without a regulator to attend to the critical nuts and bolts of
competition, notably the terms under which rivals inter-connect to BT's
national network, BT would be more dominant still.
In EU states with governments less ardently committed to competition, fair
access to national telecoms networks is unlikely to be secured without
external leverage. The Bangemann group ducked the issue: 'an authority
should be established at European level whose terms of reference will
require prompt attention', it noted.
Independent agency
What 'authority'? A highly legalistic and bureaucratic Federal
Communications Commission on the US model is not an attractive proposition.
Yet, with all due respect to subsidiarity, a college of national regulators
 -the other extreme - is unlikely to be adequate to the task. An independent
EU agency is essential. Whether it takes the form of a free-standing agency,
or is integrated within the Commission's existing competition directorate,
is an issue which needs to be resolved soon.
Whatever its form, the agency's terms of reference should include a duty to
promote access to national networks, on terms consistent with efficient
competition. It might also be desirable to give it power to increase the
downward pressure on Europe's damagingly high cross-border telecoms tariffs,
the aim being equality with tariffs for similar internal traffic.
On intellectual property, the paper says EU-wide protection must have a
'high priority' and 'rise to the challenge of globalisation'. Its diffidence
in this field is more understandable, given the complexity of the issues at
stake.
It is important, however, that resolving them does not delay progress
towards telecoms liberalisation and the extension of fibre-optics into local
networks. For the benefits of competition and fibre networks apply as much
to existing telecoms services as to the new information and inter-active
products, where protecting intellectual property is essential. In setting
its eyes on the multi-media horizon, Europe must not stumble over the
immediate steps ahead.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Tiger cub starts to find its feet: Hefty obstacles remain,
but the Philippine economy could be on the road to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago the Philippine capital Manila was a miserable place even for the
rich. Executives sat sweating and cursing in their offices through frequent
12-hour power cuts without air-conditioners or fans to combat the summer
heat. Factories were often idle, and the economy, long since left behind by
fast-growing Thailand and Malaysia, was stagnant.
The previous government of Mrs Corazon Aquino had failed to invest in new
power stations. Hardly anyone dared hope that her chosen successor,
President Fidel Ramos, would succeed in turning on the power and launch an
economic recovery by mid-1994.
But he did both. 'Fast-track' power station projects have restored
electricity to the industrial centres of the Philippine archipelago, and
economic growth is accelerating after a series of reforms to liberalise
finance and industry.
'That is what I predicted from day one of my administration,' said the
cigar-chomping Mr Ramos in an interview with the Financial Times at the
Malacanang palace in Manila. 'We have started to reverse the downtrend of
the past.'
For years the Philippines has been a notorious laggard among south-east
Asia's tigerish economies. Since 1980, according to the International
Monetary Fund, real gross national product has increased by only 1.5 per
cent a year (below the population growth rate of 2.5 per cent) compared with
an average 7 per cent for the other five members of the Association of South
East Asian Nations.
This year, GNP growth in the Philippines could reach about 4 per cent, and
economists say the government should soon be able to achieve its target of
sustained 6 per cent annual growth.
Mr Ramos and his cabinet maintain that the Philippines has finally turned
the corner. 'Think of the Philippines as a tiger cub,' Mr Roberto de Ocampo,
the finance secretary, told a business conference recently in Singapore.
'The Philippines is back in business.'
Financial institutions have endorsed Mr Ramos's optimism. 'On the road to
recovery,' declared a report from CS First Boston, the investment bank. 'Go
towards the light]' said UK investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'It
really is about to happen.' Investors in the local stock market, Asia's top
performer last year with a rise of 132 per cent in US dollar terms, clearly
think so, too.
Scepticism, however, lurks beneath the surface. Some Filipino and foreign
investors in Manila say their hopes have been raised and then dashed so
often in the past that they refuse to be euphoric now.
Corruption and bureaucracy are still rampant. And economic growth, the
sceptics say, could easily be stalled by militant workers demanding higher
wages - already high by south-east Asian standards - as soon as recovery
appears. Earlier this year, in the face of demonstrations, the government
withdrew a levy of one peso (about 2 1/2 p) per litre on petroleum products
to help plug the budget deficit.
It may be true, the critics add, that the IMF is poised to approve Manila's
economic policies with a three-year, Dollars 650m loan this month, but the
country has implemented no fewer than 22 IMF programmes in 30 years, with
little sign of improvement. 'We would like them to be Switzerland by now,
after all those programmes,' said one foreign banker.
Mr Ramos and his government colleagues say the pessimists have forgotten to
take into account the country's peculiar history. Much of the blame for its
poor performance can be laid at the door of the late dictator, Ferdinand
Marcos, who came to power in 1965. He mired his country in debt and fostered
a culture of protectionism, import substitution and monopolies for his
friends - a 'crony capitalism' that contrasted sharply with the export-led
growth of other economies in the region.
Mrs Aquino toppled Marcos in the popular uprising of 1986, but restoring a
measure of political stability has taken nearly a decade; while still armed
forces chief, Mr Ramos had to protect Mrs Aquino from seven attempted
right-wing coups d'etat.
'Her job really was to ensure the political empowerment of our people, and I
was part of that,' said Mr Ramos. 'But the economic side was not really
attended to. Evidence: electric power.'
Mr Ramos, a methodical man known as 'Steady Eddie', was himself elected
president two years ago for a six-year term. Even those who doubt that the
Philippines can catch up again with its Asian neighbours - the economy was
one of the strongest in the region in the 1950s - give credit to Mr Ramos
for his achievements so far.
Apart from restoring electricity to Manila by farming out power station
contracts to private investors, such as Hopewell of Hong Kong, his
administration has ended foreign exchange controls on current transactions,
relieved the central bank of debt accumulated during the Marcos era, and
continued the privatisation programme begun under Mrs Aquino. Among the
assets sold to raise much-needed revenue for the state are stakes in
Philippine Airlines and in Petron, the oil refiner and fuel distributor.
The telecommunications sector, once the protected fiefdom of Philippine Long
Distance Telephone, has been opened up to foreign and local competitors, a
move expected to improve the country's inefficient telephone network
rapidly.
In the past few weeks, the government has liberalised the banking sector, by
ending a 45-year ban on the entry of foreign banks. It has also pushed
through the two houses of Congress a measure to increase the scope of
value-added tax and other revenue-raising measures which claw back money
lost by the failure to maintain higher fuel prices.
'These are laws that should have been put in place 40 years ago, but we are
doing it now,' Mr Ramos said of his economic legislation. Unlike Mrs Aquino,
Mr Ramos has so far been able to cope with the political system inherited
from the US, which succeeded Spain as the country's colonial power in 1898,
and to work through the Congress to enact legislation. 'I'm not experiencing
the gridlock that you (foreign commentators) always accuse the Philippine
leadership of having,' he said.
The economic reforms that have been enacted have been achieved in an
atmosphere of political stability not witnessed for 15 years. Negotiations
have dragged on with rebel right-wing military officers, communists and
Moslem separatists in the south, but none of these groups seems as
formidable today as when the economy was in decline.
'Sometimes you go for stability but you lose out on growth,' says Mr Erico
Claudio of stockbrokers James Capel in Manila. 'Now we're getting both.'
Some hefty obstacles still need to be overcome if economic reforms are to
succeed. Each year the population of this predominantly Roman Catholic
country increases by 2.5 per cent, which means that the economy has to grow
at the same rate just for per capita income to hold steady. Natural
resources - trees, fish, soil, fresh water - are being consumed or damaged
at an alarming pace by the country's 66m inhabitants.
Compared with its neighbours, the Philippines has low rates of saving and
investment. And although the budget deficit has been held at less than 3 per
cent of gross domestic product for the past three years, so much of the
revenue is spent paying salaries for the bloated civil service and on
servicing foreign and domestic debt that little is left for capital spending
on roads and other infrastructure required to support economic progress.
Mr Ramos nevertheless believes he can put the Philippines firmly on the road
to recovery by the end of his term in 1998. He says, further, that he can do
this within an argumentative democratic system regarded as too weak and
divisive by successful Asian authoritarians such as Mr Lee Kuan Yew of
Singapore. 'Stick with us. We'll show you in two or three years,' said Mr
Ramos. 'The Philippines is still the model of respect for human rights and
democracy in south-east Asia.'
Fostering rapid economic growth and ensuring a constant supply of
electricity are considered routine government tasks in south-east Asia these
days. But to do so in a liberal democracy, complete with a free press and
the sort of unlimited public debate found in the Philippines, would be a
memorable achievement.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Leading Article: More unequal than others
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The very sharp increase in the number of people in the UK with incomes below
half the national average, reported yesterday by the Institute for Fiscal
Studies, may come as a shock. It is, of course, possible to imagine a
society in which growing income inequality coexists with rising living
standards for all. Yet the evidence that the poorest in society are not
benefiting from the economic growth enjoyed by the majority is now mounting.
The government's own figures for households below average incomes show
little change in real income for the poorest tenth of the population since
1979. When housing costs are taken into account, their real income has
actually fallen during the 1980s. The IFS study confirms the government's
figures and contrasts them with the 60 per cent increase in incomes after
housing costs for the richest tenth of the population since 1979. There is
no sign of the trickle-down effect for those at the very bottom of the
income ladder.
What has happened in the 1980s contrasts with the experience of much of the
rest of the postwar period, when all income groups benefited to some degree
from economic growth. There is concern over the emergence of an excluded
minority which has little or no stake in society. Those at the bottom of the
income ladder find themselves cut off from employment, dependent on benefits
and trapped on problem public housing estates. A spiral of deprivation is
created, with high rates of family break-up and growing numbers of single
parents bringing up children in poverty.
Growing bills
This is not a recipe for a society at ease with itself. The more affluent
majority with access to jobs, owner-occupation, cars and the rest cannot cut
themselves off from it. They see its consequences in the increasing numbers
of beggars on the streets. They must protect their homes and families from
the lawlessness it engenders. They pay the taxes to meet the growing social
security bills. Fortunately, there are many data in the IFS study that offer
help in devising policies to break out of the spiral of decline.
A central finding is the growing importance of unemployment as a cause of
low incomes. In 1961, less than 4 per cent of those on below half average
income were unemployed: by 1991, it was over a fifth. Unemployment is the
dominant factor behind the increase in families with children in the poorest
tenth: they now make up more than half this group, compared with only a
third in 1961.
Smoother transition
Finding work opportunities for those who are unemployed is essential in
providing pathways out of poverty for these individuals. Simply increasing
benefits for the unemployed is unlikely to assist in this, because it may
discourage them from taking low-paid jobs. Instead, the benefits system
should be adjusted to smooth the transition to employment so that unemployed
people can accept part-time or low-paid work without losing all their
benefits.
Another clear finding of the IFS study is the relative improvement of the
position of pensioners. They formed almost half the poorest tenth in 1961,
and now make up less than a quarter, despite their growth in numbers. Some
of the improvement is marginal - the proportion of pensioners in the bottom
fifth of the income distribution has declined much less. But the link
between retirement and poverty is no longer as strong as in the past.
Yet an increasing number of pensioners find themselves with less than half
average income, enjoying little or none of the fruits of economic growth.
They depend on the basic state pension which has been increased in line with
prices since the ending of the link with average earnings in 1980. To tackle
their poverty by restoring the link with earnings would be foolish, however.
With the growth of occupational pensions and other forms of investment
income, a growing minority of pensioners is in the top half of the income
distribution. Far better to target additional resources on those who depend
only on the state pension.
There is nothing inevitable about the falling living standards of the
poorest in a society that is steadily getting richer. But tackling the
problem needs subtle if modest steps, rather than simple big ideas that grab
the headlines.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Poverty of vision: Europe's reluctance to give direct aid to
the poor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Social policy is the Achilles' heel of Europe,' Mr Raphael Chanterie, a
Belgian member of the European Parliament told a conference on the subject
last week.
His audience of government officials, academics and industry representatives
murmured assent, but could have spent hours disagreeing with each other over
what the statement meant. It might have been possible to thrash out an
agreed definition of 'Achilles' heel'; 'social policy' would have presented
greater difficulties.
Their confusion is partly understandable. European Union social policy has
traditionally been dominated by employment-related issues. Alongside these,
however, a clutch of policies concerned with the poor - or, in the EU's
preferred term, the 'socially excluded' - has grown in significance.
Anti-poverty organisations are increasingly looking to Europe for
initiatives to attack deprivation. But they fear that EU involvement in this
area of social policy is about to collapse.
Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner, is currently sifting
through hundreds of responses to a green paper on options for the future of
social policy, before presenting final proposals to the Commission in a
white paper next month. The green paper sounded powerful warnings about the
dangers of excluding large sections of Europe's population from a reasonable
share of wealth and opportunities. Violence, drug abuse, racism, political
extremism and social unrest were, it said, all likely to result.
Mr Flynn made it clear last week, however, that against a background of high
unemployment, job creation would 'dominate the whole agenda' arising from
his white paper. He emphasised his opposition to the emergence of a 'dual
society' of advantaged and disadvantaged in Europe, but argued the best way
of supporting the most needy groups was through measures to attack long-term
unemployment.
With the number of the EU's poor variously estimated at between 50m and 70m,
anti-poverty organisations regard the idea of relying on labour market
policies alone to tackle 'social exclusion' as wishful thinking. The green
paper itself concedes that a return to full employment is 'unlikely in the
foreseeable future' without significant policy changes. Europe created 9m
jobs between 1985 and 1991 but unemployment fell by only 3m.
The European Anti Poverty Network, which represents voluntary organisations
in the 12 member states, wants the introduction of rules requiring poverty
and its social consequences to be taken into account in all EU policies, in
the way that environmental factors are considered. But campaigners' fears
that their efforts will fall on deaf ears have been compounded by signs that
the financial help the EU gives to the poor may be under threat.
Although relief of poverty is a responsibility of individual states, the EU
supports experimental projects aimed at changing the lives of the poor.
Poverty 3, its current five-year programme, ends this month, and last year
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, expressed hopes that it would be
followed by a more ambitious Poverty 4 with its budget doubled to Ecu110m
(Pounds 85m).
But Germany, in what started as a dispute between the federal government and
Lander over responsibility for running anti-poverty programmes, has blocked
the introduction of the initiative. Behind the dispute are wider
reservations, shared by some UK and Dutch ministers, about the
appropriateness of EU involvement in this area of social policy.
Mr Delors is believed to have tried to rescue Poverty 4 in talks with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl - without success. Unless there is an unexpected
breakthrough at a meeting of social affairs ministers on June 22, there is
little chance of the programme being launched during the six-month German EU
presidency, which begins next month. With the specialist teams that worked
on Poverty 3 already breaking up because of the uncertainty, this could mark
the end of the programme. The resistance to Poverty 4 is also giving rise to
doubts about the future of other EU social initiatives such as its work with
the elderly.
Most of Europe's poor would not immediately notice the loss of the
programmes - budgets have never been big enough to relieve much poverty. But
Poverty 3 has helped fund schemes for former prisoners in Italy, itinerant
families in Ireland, narcotics addicts in Greece, single parents in Bristol.
A House of Lords sub-committee concluded last month that it had led to work
which would not otherwise have been done, relieving poverty and starting to
'rebuild the economic and social lives of some severely deprived
communities'. Although the invigoration of local economies was beyond the
capacity of small projects, the committee said it was 'impressed by the
determination and ingenuity' shown by Poverty 3 initiatives in creating
limited numbers of new jobs.
The local government centre at Warwick University, which has co-ordinated
and monitored the UK projects included under the Poverty 3 umbrella, lists a
series of small but significant practical achievements. They include a
scheme to train black people for voluntary work in Bristol, development of a
new childcare centre at Pilton, Edinburgh, and changes in Liverpool city
council's policies to encourage the employment of local labour.
But supporters say the programme's most significant contribution has been
its direct involvement of needy and deprived people in efforts to rebuild
their communities. The encouragement and prestige of having the EU flag
flying over little local initiatives in Scottish housing estates and
Portuguese mountain villages has, they say, been worth as much as the money.
Mr Dennis Preston, who chairs the Brownlow Community Trust, says Poverty 3
has provided a local test bed for national urban aid policies. Warwick
University researchers say it has enabled people to 'participate in the
process of change, rather than becoming resentful objects of it'.
Europe's anti-poverty groups fear that, if the EU abandons such initiatives,
the dangers of that resentment being expressed in the dark forms described
in its green paper will come at least a little closer.

Sir, Although I will always believe that the government was wrong in ever
setting up the National Lottery in the way it did, I do not believe I
behaved badly on receiving the news.
The news was received privately by a number of us. It was received with
great disappointment by all of us. (We had just failed to create the largest
charitable foundation in Europe - much needed by small charities all over
the UK.)
However, there were no angry outbursts. No ripping up of faxes. There were
also no photographers.
An hour later the popular press asked for a couple of staged shots. Having
read Lucy Kellaway's diary piece (Management, May 30), I was obviously
mistaken in agreeing to their suggestion. I should have known better.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: NVQs one of best hopes for training
in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEVE PALMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Bogus NVQ claims raise alarm' (June 1), is illuminating
in that it highlights some of the stresses and strains in a national
vocational qualifications system that has grown fivefold in volume terms in
the last four years.
With our many partners, we will weed out any alleged wrongdoings against us.
We will also continue to improve the already elaborate systems that are in
place for paying for NVQ achievement.
We must not throw that baby out with the bath water, though. Paying for NVQs
is a sensible approach. The idea that no results equals no money must be
right. NVQs signify competence-based learning and are a vast improvement on
the more subjective arrangements that preceded them. As such, NVQs represent
one of the UK's best hopes for improving skills levels to allow us to catch
up with our industrial competitors.
Alleviating unemployment can only be achieved by raising Britain's
competitiveness, and NVQs are an essential calibration of that process. They
thus unify the economic and social challenges that all Training and
Enterprise Councils are tackling with gathering success.
Your report failed to mention the pivotal role of the awarding bodies. They
give out the NVQ certificates and they need to take steps with the Tecs and
others to ensure the legitimacy and bona fides of the NVQs. We must not
allow the hard work of more than 500,000 trainees nationally who are aiming
for NVQs to be corroded by the alleged activities of less than a handful of
people.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Indian government ahead of the game
with rupee 'dilemma'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL ASHFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('India's rupee dilemma', May 27) doubted the seriousness
of India's present government. But as early as last August, the Indian press
reported a visit to the ministry of finance by John Williamson of
Washington, who is one of the world experts on the capital flows which you
discuss. To my mind, somebody in the Indian government was well ahead of the
game.
I suggest, moreover, that they have stayed ahead. You might have mentioned
debt repayment as another way of reducing the problem. In fact, the
government has recently done some of that.
The leader also said that the country needs to find ways of using foreign
capital. Such as investment in electricity, telecoms, oil and gas, aviation?
All of these have already been opened up by the Rao government.
And as an example of another encouraging fact, may I add that while the rest
of the world's exports to India stagnated last year, exporters in the UK
earned nearly 20 per cent more from India than in 1992 (the total was Pounds
1.1bn). In the first quarter of 1994, the British continued to help the
Indians with their rupee problem: Britain's exports to them were up by 29
per cent.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Personal View: A framework for financial stability - Gerald
Corrigan outlines the risks inherent in derivatives and suggests how they
can be contained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the wake of a period of extreme volatility in financial markets in recent
weeks, the flow of commentary has taken on extraordinary proportions. In
these circumstances, I am reminded of a comment I made in January 1992
during a discussion of financial derivatives. In my address I said: 'I hope
this sounds like a warning, because it is.'
Significant progress has been made in learning more about derivatives in
both private and official circles in the intervening two and a half years.
For example, in the private sector truly great progress has been, and is
being, made in developing the risk management, information and control
systems that are crucial for individual firms and the marketplace more
generally. At the same time, supervisory authorities are making important
gains in adapting prudential standards to the widespread use of derivatives.
Yet there are several reasons why the central thrust of my January 1992
warning should not be forgotten. Among them are that, while constructive
steps have been taken, they are hardly complete; markets have continued to
grow and are evolving very rapidly; and derivatives seem to entail an acute,
if not ironic, dilemma. This is that, although they unmistakably work to
reduce risk, including the risk of a systemic financial breakdown, the
implications of such a breakdown (admittedly a very unlikely event) are even
more difficult to contain and control.
Thus we face the vexing question of how to deal with such a contingency in a
manner which remains sensible and constructive in a broader and longer-term
perspective.
There are a number of steps which should be taken to contain risks
associated with financial derivatives in a manner that will not materially
impair the ability of these instruments and markets to perform their
necessary role.
First, all of the larger market participants, including non-financial firms
that are significant end-users of derivatives, need to redouble their
efforts to ensure that risk management, information and control systems are
up to state-of-the-art standards. Boards of directors and top managers
should insist that all such firms undertake a rigorous self-analysis
relative to the original recommendations made by the Washington-based Group
of 30 think-tank in July 1993 and relative to the findings of the recently
published G30 survey of industry practices.
Among other objectives should be implementation of accurate and timely
consolidated credit and market risk monitoring by all significant
institutions in these markets. In the longer term, these monitoring efforts
should be pushed to the limits of technology and practicalities in order to
achieve intra-day monitoring capabilities on a broad scale.
Second, individual firms, exchanges, clearing houses and central banks
should be even more aggressively pursuing ways to strengthen clearance,
settlement and payment systems.
These should focus on: shortening and standardising the gap between trade
date (and time) and final payment; the more widespread use of same-day
delivery against payment systems for securities transactions; moving towards
same-day final payment in clearing houses and exchanges; and further
strengthening the operational reliability of key processing systems.
While it may not be obvious to all, such improvements in the 'plumbing' of
the financial system can work towards enhancing market liquidity across a
wide spectrum of financial instruments. In turn, this would help strengthen
the capacity of markets to absorb more smoothly sudden shifts in market
psychology.
Third, we must move more aggressively to establish a standard set of
definitions applicable to financial disclosure and reporting requirements
for widely traded derivative instruments. This issue is at the heart of the
ability of firms and regulators to make consistent judgments on risks. At
present, the gaps in uniform definitions and disclosure standards are a
significant factor in explaining the considerable variation in firms'
responses to the 30 survey questions. It would be unfair not to acknowledge
that progress has been made in this area, but much remains to be done.
Fourth, larger market participants need to work with regulators and
supervisors to assure the legal enforceability of derivatives transactions,
both within and across jurisdictions. Particular attention should be paid to
enforceability of netting arrangements, both nationally and internationally.
Dealers and end users also should work together to establish greater
standardisation in documentation further to promote liquidity and stability
in these markets.
All of these steps, which are included in the G30's list of recommendations,
are critical to reducing risk and promoting certainty in the international
derivatives markets.
Fifth, consideration should be given to the establishment of voluntary
minimum standards for disclosure, credit and market risk controls, and
customer suitability that could apply broadly to all key market participants
in derivatives. This will be very difficult, but progress might be made by
such minimum standards being developed by a private sector group, such as
the G30. While such standards would have no binding authority, if applied by
prominent individual firms voluntarily and publicly, others would be under
great pressure to do so also.
Indeed, if some firms - acting on their own and in their own best interest -
refused to do business with firms that did not voluntarily comply with such
standards, the pressures would be very great. The obstacles to achieving
such a workable framework of voluntary minimum standards are formidable, but
the concept should not be rejected out of hand.
The above steps constitute a building block towards greater safety and
greater efficiency. Yet the international community of banking and
securities regulators - together with the appropriate European Union
officials - is still faced with the enormous challenge of achieving greater
cohesion and consistency as it applies to minimum capital standards.
Under any circumstances, this will take time. And, based on my experience as
chairman of the Basle Committee, I know it will not be easy. I believe,
though, that in the fullness of time the legitimate interests of individual
firms or groups of firms or individual regulators or groups of regulators
can be accommodated while allowing significant movement towards greater
consistency in prudential standards and greater harmony in market practices.
The above agenda is formidable but not insurmountable. It can be achieved
without new legislation, new regulatory structures and without the threat of
regulatory overkill.
That said, it should also be stressed that no such framework is fail-safe
and there can be no substitute for the time-honoured dictates of discipline,
conservatism and knowing your counterparty. In the current environment,
those dictates should take on a special premium of attention, because
neither the markets nor the regulatory and political communities will react
kindly to any large-scale surprises.
To coin a phrase: I hope this sounds like a warning, because it is. Much has
been accomplished, but more needs to be done.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Monetary danger overstated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL CLAUSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Thomas Mayer (Personal View, June 1) is right to warn of the dangers of
excessive growth in German M3 and public borrowing, but he overstates the
case.
Mr Mayer compares M3 growth of 46 per cent between 1989 and 1993 with real
gross domestic product growth of 19 per cent (giving an implied money
overhang of 27 per cent). However, the appropriate comparison is with
nominal GDP, which grew by more than 39 per cent. In other words, past
inflation has already absorbed much of the excessive M3 growth, leaving an
overhang of only about 7 per cent.
He notes that at the end of this year, public debt will be 115 per cent
higher than at the end of 1989. This overstates the upward trend in public
borrowing, because it includes existing GDR net debt, which we estimate at
DM450bn, or 48.5 per cent of the level of public debt in 1989.
Mr Mayer rightly warns that credit is expanding faster than investment, but
he overstates the problem by citing the 4 per cent fall in equipment
investment between 1989 and 1993. Most investment has recently been
concentrated in construction, especially desperately needed housing.
Including this, nominal investment rose 26 per cent in the west during that
period. The figure would be higher still if we add in investment in the
east.
There should be no question of the Bundesbank's abandoning the M3 target -
its current rapid growth and the surge in credit provide a signal of
potential risks ahead. But those risks should not be exaggerated.

Sir, Companies such as Tesco, Royal Mail, National Power, Unilever and The
Body Shop would all confirm the value of volunteering by managers: it
enriches their skills and extends their talents. It need not, however, be
constrained through 'lack of time' ('Managers volunteer surplus expertise',
May 30). NatWest managers give a lunch hour a week to tutor pupils in
Islington schools, Coopers and Lybrand and the London Stock Exchange build
stronger teams by tackling tree planting on an inner-city farm or building
flower beds in Tower Hamlets on one Saturday a year.

morning at 10.55 on BBC1. Afternoon play begins on BBC2 at 1.45, and the
same channel shows highlights at 11.20 pm. There is also ball by ball
commentary on Test Match Special on Radio 4 long wave, which is not the same
without the late Brian Johnston, bless his chocolate cakes. Yet it is still
a unique programme, and aficionados will, as ever, watch television with the
sound turned down and listen to the radio commentary, which begins at 11.00
am. At 8.00 pm BBC1 is repeating an episode from the 1977 series Secret Army
in which Bernard Hepton played the owner of a Belgian restaurant which
served as HQ for the resistance. It was this series more than real events
which gave rise to the comedy 'Allo Allo'. A new gardening series on Channel
4, Over The Garden Wall, looks at the natural conditions in various parts of
Britain and at how wild plants have adapted to them (9.00). The day's best
movie is The Scarlet Empress with Dietrich as Catherine The Great (12.30
BBC2).

FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: Pimlott's Murder in the Pit a mere facade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a truth too seldom acknowledged that TS Eliot, among the most haunting
of 20th-century poets, was a lousy playwright.
But Eliot's finest poems are so much nearer drama than his plays.
In his finest poetry you can feel the conflict of separate voices and the
tension of different ideas.
In his plays, however, he can rarely characterise successfully; and he
develops his few dramatic ideas at a woefully cumbersome rate. Eliot can
always lull an audience with his sheer quality of sound, but this counts for
too much. Beneath this siren surface the quality of meaning is all too slow,
and sometimes nebulous.
Eliot's plays usually bring out the worst in English actors: you can see
them calculating their most showy and superficial effects. And Steven
Pimlott's RSC production of Murder in the Cathedral is utterly sunk by the
central performance of Michael Feast as Thomas Becket.
It is easy to see that Feast is in some ways wrong for Becket. (In his
skull-like visage and glassy facial expressions it is impossible to find any
trace of the former bon viveur.) Also his reading is in other ways
controversial.
He seems to be trying to reveal some of the stranger facets of the
psychopathology of religion - the suppressed hysteria of the would-be
martyr, the manic fervour of the bigot, even a not-quite-sublimated
homosexuality.
But these aspects would not matter if Feast led us into the contemplative
stillness of Becket's thought.
Instead, however, he applies his considerable intelligence and technique
into an ever-changing array of artificial gestures, over-bright facial
expressions and contrasts of vocal dynamics.
The overall impact is busy and contrived. He is worse when pretending, with
constant artfulness, to be most spontaneous - in his prose Christmas sermon.
As it is, the play snaps into some kind of dramatic vigour only once: in the
clever, specious, modern apologias spoken by the four knights after the
murder. Jonathan Philips (third knight) has done nothing with the RSC better
than this witty piece of bluffing.
The play's truest poetry is for its female chorus. Just sometimes Eliot
comes close to catching the mysterious incantations of the choruses of Greek
drama. Pimlott paces and divides these well.
Sarah Woodward and Kate Duchene make only mild effect. Look at them after
watching the older Cherry Morris and Sheila Ballantyne, so excellent in
speech and stance. Morris, in particular, is so calm and focused - very
reminiscent of Peggy Ashcroft in intonation - that she raises the play to a
higher level with her every contribution. She even persuades us that such
lines as 'I have smelt . . . incense in the latrines' mean more than they
do.
Pimlott, his designer Ashley Martin-Davies, his lighting designer Brian
Harris, and Feast himself have reaccentuated many features of the production
in transferring it from Stratford's Swan to the Barbican's Pit.
This, alas, is merely to adjust the facade of what is only a facade anyway.
The more you shift the visual aspects of Eliot's play, the more you expose
how static is its dramatic core.
In repertory in the Pit.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: Cool relations warm to new challenges - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relations in the past between the Arts Council, the bastion of the
subsidised arts, and the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts,
created to encourage corporate investment, have not always been easy.
They became particularly cool when the council set up an external relations
department to offer its clients advice on sponsorship, and also to seek,
with patchy success, business funding for its own conferences and
publications.
This mutual suspicion should change now that the new secretary-general of
the council, Mary Allen, is an ABSA old girl, and the chairman, Lord Gowrie,
was a committed believer in sponsorship when arts minister, and boasts the
Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme as one of his greatest achievements.
ABSA will undertake assignments for the council, especially in advising arts
companies how they can attract more sponsorship. This is already happening
in a piecemeal way. ABSA works for the Scottish Arts Council on raising
corporate funding and in April Elizabeth Ganney was drafted from ABSA to
bolster South East Arts, with most of her salary coming from the regions.
Her task is to instruct the many small arts organisations in the area, (not
necessarily South East Arts clients) on how to fundraise more effectively.
The region receives less subsidy per head than any other (because the
council expects local arts lovers to go to London) and many organisations
there struggle to survive.
Fortunately, the south-east is attractive to business, and some new
companies are embracing sponsorship. Nynex Cablecommunications, for example,
has become a sponsor: it needs to improve its corporate image while digging
holes throughout the area. It has backed the Brighton Festival and such
small causes as the Reigate-based English Arts Chorale. The potential in the
south-east is considerable: last year the region boosted its revenue from
the BSIS (which encourages first-time sponsors) by 24 per cent, to Pounds
326,000.
As ABSA extends its network of regional offices (Birmingham opened this
week), it will work closer with the newly beefed-up arts boards.
                           *      *      *
Scotland swept the board at ABSA's Goodman and Garrett Awards ceremony at
the Tate Gallery, which is unique in honouring individuals who have served
the cause of arts sponsorship. Alex Clark won the Pounds 10,000 Goodman
Award, for achievement by a volunteer, and Nina Havergal the Pounds 10,000
Garrett as a professional in the field.
These imaginative awards have been sponsored for three years by Reed
Elsevier.
                           *      *      *
BP was one of the large sponsors that froze its budget during the recession.
By not renewing most of its 40-odd, Pounds 25,000 or so, touring and
community-based commitments its expenditure almost halved, to around Pounds
750,000 a year. Now it is re-examining its position.
The budget is unlikely to rise in the short term but BP has a strategy
again. Community work will be left to local subsidiaries, which may, or may
not, include the arts. HQ will concentrate on four or five prestige
sponsorships.
The annual re-hang of art at the Tate Gallery will be financed for two more
years, and there is to be another year at least for the annual Portrait
Award at the National Portrait Gallery. The Cardiff Singer of the Year, with
the BBC, will continue in 1995, and then stay on hold until the murky
relationship between the BBC and sponsorship is thrashed out.
In July, BP sponsors its first production at the National Theatre, Chekhov's
The Seagull. In the past BP backed the NT's educational programme, but it is
switching about Pounds 60,000 to a more high-profile event.
                           *      *      *
Last month the most important exhibition of paintings in a generation by the
American artist, Willem de Kooning, opened at the National Gallery in
Washington. It will later go to the Met in New York before coming to the
Tate in London early next year. The British end of the trip was entirely
dependent on the American bank JP Morgan having invested more than Pounds 1m
into the event. This will cover transportation and insurance costs.
JP Morgan is slowly appreciating the benefits of sponsorship and its budget
rises steadily. It exploits the opportunities for corporate hospitality -
but is as much swayed by a feeling of responsibility towards the quality of
life, and the fact that de Kooning, American and avant-garde, chimes in
nicely with a bank that is trying to shed its traditional image of
exclusivity.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: The Dream's spell in the Park - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In hell they give performances of A Midsummer Night's Dream without a single
laugh. In this life, however, it is the most watertight of Shakespeare's
comedies. The lovers' confusions will rouse the sleepiest of audiences, and
the Pyramus and Thisbe scene seems never to fail. The production that opens
this year's Open Air season in Regent's Park, directed by Deborah Paige, is
not very far above these minimal standards - but does that matter? Regent's
Park itself lends poetry where the actors lack it.
Part of the spell is that the birdsong, which at first virtually drowns the
actors, gradually ebbs away during the evening; and the last glow of full
daylight deepens into nightfall behind the stage and is replaced, bit by
bit, by stage lighting.
The quality that is rarest in performances of The Dream is sheer human
complexity, that most vital Shakespearean ingredient.
It is most touchingly present on this occasion with Bottom, given an
unusually po-faced, even dignified, performance by Robert Lang. His speech
on awakening, baffled by last night's memories, is spoken with ideal, hushed
awe; and, as he remembers, his hands trace above his head the arcs of his
vanished ass's head.
No jolly stupidity here, but the stunned wonder of one whose life was
briefly transfigured. Then, on his next appearance, comes the robust
life-giving camaraderie of 'Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?':
sweet bully Bottom, fully restored to the human race.
Excellent also is Estelle Kohler's Titania - an arresting mixture of
dangerous power and wanton sensuality. She speaks the verse with an
authority that sends the play's pulse soaring on her every entrance. Cameron
Blakely, with horns and thick black hair like the god Pan, is a virile,
bright-eyed Puck with bags of attack. Paul Freeman's Oberon, eyelids
glittering, is more hammy, savouring the role's rhetorical flourishes and
rolled Rs.
Most of the rustics do well, though why Flute (Simon Harrison, looking like
Tim Brooke-Taylor) should say he has 'a beard coming' when he is already
half-bald beats me; his piping voice is a cheap joke; and Peter Quince
(weakly performed by Tim Stern) does not speak the prologue as Theseus and
Lysander then describe. The four mortal lovers are given light, superficial
performances by actors who have plenty to learn about producing their
voices. (And if the Open Air Theatre doesn't teach them . . .)
Geraldine Pilgrim has put them in 19th-century attire (Empire line for the
girls), and has provided an elegant set - an extended creamy neoclassical
arcade through which we see the park's trees. The fairies, as usual, are a
problem: five of them here, played by adults.
Most of Jonathan Goldstein's music for them sounds like (remember Round the
Horne?) the Fraser Hayes Four; and Pilgrim and Paige have dressed them with
mirror-specs, black helmets, glittery leggings, and fanned silver-paper
wings to look like bluebottles. Were I Bottom, I would not ask one of them
to scratch me. And, call me old-fashioned, I cannot believe in fairies with
large buttocks.
In repertory at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Arts: Perfect marriage of aesthetics - Glyndebourne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was never much doubt about it, but now we know: Glyndebourne's new,
round opera house is a magnificent success. From the start Michael and Patty
Hopkins designs looked full of promise, and they have been beautifully
realised.
Externally, the building fits into its context without a cross glance or a
jar - within a few years many visitors will be surprised to hear that things
used to be different.
Cunningly, it has been built down into the hill, so as not to protrude too
much above the old surroundings. There is still height enough to accommodate
external balconies, from which to admire the Sussex view.
I had wondered whether the increased numbers might make the statutory
picnicking a bit of a scrum, but no: new garden-room has been provided, and
the grounds felt no more crowded than before.
And the interior, a dream of blond wood, exceeds all expectations. Not only
is it comfortable (that, at least, we were counting on), but with its rising
concentric tiers it looks intimately crowded, just as a proper theatre
should.
Nobody seems distanced from the stage, even on the uppermost tier.
Excellently chosen lighting achieves a jewel-box effect - charming, not
twee, since there is no decorator's folderol in the house. Friendly
simplicity is the keynote; even the 'boxes' on either side of each tier are
open and informal.
Best of all, the acoustic offers everything one had hoped for. Gone is the
dry, boxy sound of the old auditorium; now the orchestra rings clear and
uncramped, in far better balanced perspective, and singers' voices bloom in
the new space.
Almost inevitably, Glyndebourne chose Le nozze di Figaro to inaugurate the
house.
The old Peter Hall production was to have been revived, but the sets were
lost in a fire two years ago. John Gunter has re-done them, thriftily: the
garden act is planted now with nothing but giant stalks of rhubarb, among
which the clandestine comings and goings become a public charade. Hall's
original staging was unique in making the dodgy action both clear and (more
or less) believable.
Clarity, at least, remains a great virtue of the 'newly mounted production'
by Stephen Medcalf.
Everything that matters is there, and it doesn't subject its cast to any
awkward tricks or gimmicks. Since Bernard Haitink is the conductor, with the
London Philharmonic, Mozart's score is rendered with lively faithfulness.
I thought Haitink had taken particular care to brighten the accompaniments
for the extraneous arias - Marcellina's and Don Basilio's - in the garden
act, though they will never really justify themselves. (Nice for the
Marcellina and the Basilio, who otherwise get no solos; but they do nothing
to advance the action in the run-up to the finale of a longish opera.)
It is Figaro and his Susanna who dominate the proceedings here: personable
Gerald Finley and Alison Hagley, who have the further advantage of distinct
individual timbres and styles. The naughty Count is Andreas Schmidt, elegant
but slightly dry-voiced; his Countess, Renee Fleming, wielded her big
soprano with increasing grace as the opera developed.
Old Bartolo is Manfred Rohrl, who gives him an old-fashioned gentility and
reserve: a collector of first editions, probably.
Wendy Hillhouse cuts a nicely ample figure as Marcellina. Robert Tear's
Basilio - a piece of power-casting, that] - brims with character, though in
ensembles his penchant for reaching up slowly to high notes sometimes takes
the edge off the rhythm. As Cherubino, Marie-Ange Todorovitch is deliciously
candid and plausible.
There is a sexy young Barbarina from Susan Gritton, and Donald Adams makes
her uncle Antonio definitively crumbly and grumbly. For the lawyer Don
Curzio, John Graham-Hall imitates the original Michael Storace
stuttering-trick (Mozart was initially doubtful about it, but Storace
persuaded him).
All in all, it is an unspectacularly happy, rewarding evening: just what we
love Glyndebourne for, and even more now in its splendid new house.
Sponsored by NM Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd, Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque. In repertory
until July 15.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology: Knowledge is power - Knova is an analytical tool
that aspires to making the intangibles tangible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE PALFRAMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most companies, improving business performance means reorganising to cut
costs and jobs, followed by further investment in computers and
communications technology. Few have considered the impact of intangibles
such as knowledge on performance.
Knowledge is a resource that is difficult to assess and manage. But now
researchers at Cambridge University, working with British Petroleum, have
developed a method for analysing the factors influencing knowledge. It
allows an appropriate investment plan to be developed and, ultimately, the
investment to be related to performance.
BP initiated the work after making substantial organisational changes in the
late 1980s. It wanted to improve the way people worked in a flatter, more
team-oriented structure; but it also recognised that the usual
information-based approach was too narrow and that 'soft' factors  - such as
knowledge - must be taken into account.
'Common sense tells you that knowledge will influence the way people work,
but we wanted to know how it affected them,' explains Paul Wilhelmij, BP
International's team leader in decision support, who with his colleague,
Jack Betteridge, provided a business focus for the work with Cambridge
University.
The partnership produced an analysis technique called Knova (Knowledge
value-added). This provides 'a holistic business view to identify the less
obvious cost drivers,' says Tony Holden, head of the university's decision
support group, which collaborated in developing the method.
Knova resulted in a computer model that takes into account the relationships
 -in a team or organisation - between knowledge, people, performance,
investment, culture and benefits.
People factors include staff turnover and motivation, while culture factors
include leadership, openness, informal and formal communications, the
working environment, geographic distribution and personal reward.
According to Holden, traditional management models have difficulty linking
these 'soft' issues with 'hard' quantitative factors, such as costs and
investment. Nor can they easily analyse the benefits of investing in the
knowledge resource.
In addition, Knova can provide both a static and a dynamic view of the
factors that influence knowledge. By assigning order-of-magnitude values to
the influencing factors and using system dynamic modelling software, a
computer model can be produced. This model can then be used to track the
factors over a period of time and perform 'what-if' analyses to compare
different investment options. Knowledge investments cover, for example, new
procedures, computer systems, communications, external consultancy and
training.
Holden points out that the computer model is only quasi-quantitative because
of the subjective nature of such factors as culture, but insists: 'Knova
facilitates a much richer representation, that can be linked to pictures,
text and numbers, than the traditional paper-based representation of
influencing factors.'
Companies do realise that knowledge is important, says Holden. It is
expertise, know-how, information and data that employees use to make
decisions.
In the recent restructuring, some companies have tried to use knowledge more
effectively by introducing team-working and giving people more
responsibility. But freedom to apply and share knowledge will not
necessarily improve performance. Nor will an increase in the training
budget. Knowledge must be developed and managed to produce beneficial
results, argues Holden.
The development of Knova began at the end of the 1980s and its practical
relevance was tested in the early 1990s on projects within the exploration
arm of BP.
One application, that looked at human factors in team-working, involved an
awareness campaign to overcome a common problem in oil exploration - when a
drilling pipe gets stuck. At BP Exploration, the cost of this problem had
risen sharply in the late 1980s, from around Dollars 32m (Pounds 21.5m) a
year to nearly Dollars 40m in 1988.
BP Exploration knew that poor communications was a leading factor in the
problem. It developed a training programme to encourage open communication,
knowledge-sharing and problem-solving among its drilling teams. It trained
800 people, 70 per cent of whom were from outside contractors.
In two years, BP Exploration cut its drilling costs to Dollars 13m, but in
1991 costs began to rise again at two sites. This was put down to changes in
personnel and a push for higher performance. Applying Knova to the problem
(albeit after the fact) showed that Knova would have predicted the cost
trends and would have highlighted staff turnover as a potential factor.
Having validated the technique, both BP and the Cambridge group are applying
it to other problems. BP is using it to look at operational decision-making
on its process plants. 'We are trying to create the right kind of
environment for people who are working together in teams on our plants,'
says Wilhelmij. This would improve decision-making and could affect plant
safety.
At Cambridge University, the decision support group is currently using Knova
to identify the influences on performance in service departments of large
organisations, such as the UK's National Health Service hospitals. But the
group's main target industries are manufacturing, in particular oil and
petrochemicals, and financial services.
These sectors have gone through big changes, and want to maximise
performance and minimise risks. One way to do this, argues Holden, is by
ensuring that people make quality decisions - decision-making being a
knowledge-based activity.
'To get quality decisions, you may not need more sophisticated computer
systems but a better organisational environment in which managers can make
them,' says Holden.
'Investing in computer technology has become a knee-jerk reaction and
although computers have a place companies must broaden their perspective.
Companies must also consider the intangibles and our work is to make the
intangibles tangible.'

<TEXT>
To monitor products sensitive to time and temperature, Bowater of the UK has
developed labels, called Reactt, which change colour according to varying
conditions.
They can be used on foods that must be kept chilled and eaten within a
certain number of days or to label pharmaceuticals, especially vaccines.
Reactt labels, containing dye and binder chemicals, are in two parts: the
first, the indicator, contains a blue dye which indicates temperature change
by turning red; the second, the activator, is a catalyst. Both are inert
until they are joined when the chemicals merge into each other, the speed
determined by temperature and time.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new method of detecting leaks in gas-assisted (to keep out moisture)
electric power and telecommunications cables without using pollutants has
been developed by Varian of Italy.
The system, marketed by Ai Cambridge, uses helium; an instrument sensitive
to the gas provides highly accurate readings, eliminating errors from other
soil-borne gases. Previously, some 60 per cent of tests were abandoned
because of false readings.
The system dispenses with arcton, a CFC compound gas known to cause damage
to the ozone layer. Norweb, a UK electricity company using the
helium-sensing technique, has withdrawn approval for the arcton method. 'We
are now obtaining 100 per cent success in locating leaks in our gas-filled
cables,' says Alan Jones, Norweb's Manchester area maintenance manager.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Stroke sufferers learn to talk
again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computers are teaching people to talk again after suffering strokes. A team
at Bristol's Frenchay Hospital in the UK uses personal computers to help
patients supplement therapy.
They allow patients to practise repeatedly routines that will help them find
words they have in their heads but cannot express or write. The Frenchay's
aphasia (stroke-induced speech and language difficulty) computer team has
worked in this area for seven years. The patients it deals with range from
33 to 82 years old and have suffered strokes of varying severity.
The stroke patients call up words on screen which they have difficulty
locating mentally, explains Jane Mortley, of the aphasia team. 'Where the
word is stored in the brain, that's where the damage is as a result of the
stroke.' Courses are held at the hospital to train speech and language
therapists in the method.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Non-stick finish for textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL SHUTTLEWORTH and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Textile chemists have searched hard for a treatment that prolongs the life
of clothing and home furnishings, writes Neil Shuttleworth.
Ciba of Switzerland and Du Pont of the US (owner of the Teflon trademark)
have come up with the Teflon fabric protector, which provides lasting stain
protection for rain and leisure wear. It also keeps water and stains off
awnings and garden upholstery.
The finish is derived from the chemical material used on non-stick pans. The
fluorocarbons are linked to the textile fibre to form an invisible,
odourless, colourless, durable film.
'We see the products as being alternatives to silicon- and paraffin-based
products because of their superior oil and water repellent effects,' says
Alan McDonald, head of marketing for textile finishing agents. Unusual
applications include hot air balloons and parachutes.
Ciba: UK, 0625 618585.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology: Robot lifts the load
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY MAX GLASKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A robot fork lift truck that carries loads between lorry trailer and factory
floor could extend automation to the loading bay. A prototype now being
tested maps its surroundings continuously and plots its routes.
'There is no system in the world that loads and unloads conventional
trailers fully autonomously,' says Malcolm Roberts, director of Guidance
Control Systems of the UK. 'We built a system four years ago that relied on
mirrors in the trailers to reflect positioning lasers but now we don't need
them.'
Drivers of trailers up to 16m long cannot park them accurately enough for a
fixed robot loader to work. The GCS robot copes with such variables and also
detects changes in its surroundings - for instance, when a pallet is in its
path. A central computer communicates the tasks by radio to the robot, which
is otherwise autonomous.
The robot uses a variety of sensors to detect its own location and the
trailer. A laser system scans ahead up to 25m; for local positioning,
ultrasound is accurate for between 20cm and 2m. The ultrasound data is
interpreted quickly by an off-the-shelf transputer but an infra-red sensor
cuts in when data of a higher resolution is needed - to cope with an
odd-shaped load, for example.
The robot analyses when it has nudged up close to a load using a force
sensor and torque measurement on each wheel. More sensors control the
sideways movement of the forks so that loads are deposited hard up against
the trailer wall.
'A fork-lift truck driver can unload a trailer in half an hour with relative
ease and our prototype hasn't yet shown it can work so quickly. We expect to
be there later this year,' says Roberts.
However, time is not the only cost factor as robots are not so prone to
accidental damage to loads.

FT  03 JUN 94 / People: Abbey National promotes Pople to run its Scottish
life subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Pople, 36, an ex-Bank of England man who joined Abbey National five
years ago, has taken over as chief executive of Scottish Mutual Assurance,
its recently-acquired life insurance business.
Abbey National bought Scottish Mutual in January 1992 for Pounds 287m with
the objective of using its skills to launch Abbey National Life in February
1993. Scottish Mutual chief executive Douglas Patrick, 51, was put on the
Abbey National board and given the task of heading the group's life
assurance division which contributed Pounds 61m of Abbey National's Pounds
704m pre-tax profits last year.
However, Abbey's rapid expansion into the life assurance industry has been
threatened by the sudden resignation of Patrick, for family reasons. Pople's
knowledge of the life assurance industry is limited to what he picked up
when he was helping plan the establishment of Abbey National's life
assurance strategy, but his appointment marks him out as one of Abbey
National's young high-fliers.
He worked in the Bank of England's banking supervision section for three
years before getting his MBA from the City University Business School. In
1988 he joined Abbey as strategic planning manager, Life Assurance and in
1992 switched into a line position managing 800 staff and 62 branches in
Abbey's central division.
Meanwhile, Abbey has sought to plug the rest of the gap left by Patrick's
resignation by giving John Fry, 58, Abbey's group services director, main
board responsibility for the group's life and general insurance business.

FT  03 JUN 94 / People: Maurice Paterson leaves ScotAm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The departure of Maurice Paterson from Scottish Amicable a week today, after
35 years with the life insurer, will leave the post of deputy managing
director vacant for a while.
Responsibility for sales, which had been Paterson's remit, has been given to
a team headed by Jim Cowan.
Roy Nicolson, managing director, said yesterday that while there was a need
for a deputy managing director at some stage, that was not his priority at
present. 'Titles are not that important,' he said.
The rationale for the change, he said, was the need for a fresh approach,
which had struck him as he looked at the organisation in the light of
changes happening to the life industry, such as commission disclosure, and
the launch of ScotAm's own European venture in Dublin.
He had discussed the question with Paterson who had concluded that there was
not another job at his level within ScotAm that he would be interested in
doing. The decision was taken on a friendly basis between the two, who had
worked together for more than 30 years: 'We're still talking,' Nicolson
said.

FT  03 JUN 94 / People: Engineering a career at WS Atkins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The engineering design and consultancy firm of WS Atkins has appointed Helen
Stone, who first joined the company in 1972 as a graduate engineer, as
managing director of WS Atkins Structural Engineering (one of some 25
divisions within the company). She will be responsible for its engineers in
the UK and overseas.
WS Atkins has a history stretching back to 1938, when William Atkins - who
died in 1989 - first registered the firm as WS Atkins Partners. Mostly
engaged in defence contracts during the war years, the firm's first real
coup was to be awarded the contract to design and supervise the building of
Britain's first large post-war steelworks at Port Talbot.
Today, the company is one of Europe's largest design consultancies, with
some 4,000 staff employed on contracts in more than 40 countries. It has
taken a significant part in the construction of the Channel Tunnel, advising
the banks on progress of the project and also conducting safety audits.
Stone was elected a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1991,
the third woman to receive that recognition.
She says she is 'not in favour of positive discrimination but I am conscious
that I have a responsibility to break down inappropriate barriers which
prevent women engineers from making progress. The difference between men and
women does not extend to their ability to make engineering calculations, or
take engineering decisions.'
Stone's dislike of positive discrimination in engineering circles stems from
a rational basis: 'It's still a profession where men predominate, and if you
come across a female engineer the general assumption is 'she must be pretty
good to have got so far'. I'm worried that if we start introducing positive
discrimination that those very high standards will start to get lower.'
She replaces Chris Symonds, who moves to be managing director of WS Atkins
Building Management Northwest.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Property: Tenant in the driver's seat - Developers are
losing out in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's dithering over setting a date for the final
transfer of the government from Bonn to Berlin is dismaying property
developers. The industry believes the move could usher in a period of
renewed property activity, boosting prices and demand.
Initially, Mr Kohl said the transfer - decided by a narrow vote in the
Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, in June 1991 following unification
 -would take place by 1996, but the move has now been postponed to the end
of the decade.
On Wednesday, the cabinet agreed on where ministries would be located in
Berlin. However, because of soaring costs, not all ministries will be housed
in new buildings, as originally envisaged. Many ministries will be put into
old buildings which housed the former imperial, Nazi and communist
administrations.
The finance and economics ministers will move to the building which now
houses the Treuhand privatisation agency (originally the headquarters of the
Luftwaffe). The chancellery will be one of the few institutions to be given
a new site, close to the former Reichstag parliament building.
The sharply scaled-back plan will save about DM1bn (Pounds 400m), reducing
the overall cost to DM20bn.
This week's decision comes as an anti-climax for Berlin's property
developers, which had been expecting a bonanza in either renovation work or
new constructions, but at a much earlier stage.
'We cannot wait around for Bonn to make up its mind. We just have to get on
with it,' said Mr Michael Spies, manager of Tishman Speyer, a US company
which is building an office and retailing complex along Friedrichstrasse, in
the Mitte, the old heart of Berlin.
The government's decision to make Berlin the new capital of united Germany
has had a big impact on property prices in the city. When the Berlin Wall
was breached in November 1989, developers rushed to the eastern part of the
city. Over the next two years, prices soared. However, the government's
delay in moving to Berlin has frustrated the market, leading to a price
correction: office rents in prime locations, which reached a peak in 1991 of
about DM120 a square metre, have fallen to between DM60 sq m and DM70 sq m,
and in some areas such as Leipziger Strasse, to as low as DM45 sq m. The
question today is what impact these shifts in prices will have on investors.
There are two broad methods of property financing in Germany. In the west,
many properties are financed by open-ended funds - dedicated investment
vehicles similar to unit trusts. The properties these funds purchase usually
have a relatively secure rental flow; however, the funds have few tax
advantages. Closed-end funds in the east were set up by the federal
government in 1991 in a bid to attract investment in property in the region.
In contrast to open-ended funds, investors in closed-end funds can set off
50 per cent of their investment against tax.
'The closed-end funds were attractive to people who wanted to benefit from
the tax-breaks. But investing in property in order to save tax is often a
bad move, particularly if the investor does not know how the property market
works (such as in the east),' said Mr Guy Barker from property agents Knight
Frank and Rutley Immobilien Consulting.
There are about 200 companies operating closed-end funds in the east. Of
these, 30 or so are big players commanding total funds exceeding DM20bn.
Property analysts argue that the real weakness of closed-end funds is that
fund managers cannot always promise a guaranteed return on the investment.
'Sometimes these funds are set up without any guarantee of tenants. There
are not many investors who are ready to buy buildings which are not
pre-leased,' said Mr Barker.
Yet with the fall of property prices by at least 25 per cent over the past
two years in Berlin, property analysts believe closed-end funds' investors -
including many small investors with average holdings of DM50,000 - could
lose money.
'The problem for these investors will emerge over the next two years,' said
Mr Frank Schaick from Immobilien Consulting in Dusseldorf. 'Many projects
are still being constructed and not yet let. The key for any small investor
is to opt for a fund which offers a long-term lease.'
Two other factors are increasing the pressure on the closed-end funds:
first, strict planning controls in east Germany; second, a surplus of land
available for development in the west, which could force prices down and
prompt western-based business to reasses the need to shift east.
Over the past year, cities in the east have started to set up zoning
districts - demarcated areas for development - and have introduced planning
controls. Berlin, for instance, is limiting the issue of permits for
developments on the outskirts of the city.
'The introduction of zoning means that the investor will get an idea of
where to plan, and will eventually be able to get an idea of where the key
catchment areas are,' said Mr Guy Duckworth, from Healey and Baker, property
consultants. Those who moved in early to some parts of east Germany might
now be saddled with properties which offer little return on investment
because of zoning restrictions.
For example, the Fundis fund, one of the biggest closed-end funds in Berlin,
acquired a building without tenants or rental guarantees, along the river
Spreebogen which loops around the Reichstag. Today the building is still
unlet, partly because rental expectations were set too high. But an
additional factor deterring prospective tenants was the tough requirements
of the zoning policy. Under this policy, tenants are required to undertake
activities designed to build up the zone's infrastructure: tenants at the
Fundis-backed building, for instance, are obliged to complement the
Fraunhofer, the state-backed research and development centre which is
located nearby.
The second factor putting closed-end funds under greater pressure is that
for the first time since the second world war, there is generally a greater
availability of developable land throughout the country, especially in the
west.
'With the effects of land reclamation, mine closures and privatisation the
market is shifting,' said Mr Berthold Wetteskind, chief executive officer of
Deutsche Immobilien, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. The privatised railways,
for example, now have large plots of land available for development. 'The
scarcity of land has disappeared,' he added.
Analysts believe that the cost of land could still fall, perhaps by as much
as 20 per cent. With more land available in the west and with the opening up
of the east, 'the tenant is now in the driver's seat', said Mr Wetteskind.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Management: George Orwell's 1994 - Simon Gibson explains why
the language that a company uses can have a direct effect on its financial
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GIBSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company's fortunes are expressed by its figures, but its future is caught
in its language. While numbers are merely red or black, the words that a
company uses in its corporate speeches, articles and annual reports open up
a window on the way that management is thinking. Indeed, they show whether
it is thinking at all.
Companies today are required to communicate more regularly than ever before,
both to internal and external audiences. Many cope admirably, many others
fail. All too often executives resort to management-speak rather than using
clear and original expression.
The struggle against the corruption of the language goes beyond the concern
of the corporate communications director - it is a business issue. Indeed,
one can argue that the language that a company uses can have a direct effect
on its financial performance.
The enemies of clear expression are not unique to the world of business.
They are language's common foe, given new clothing. In one of the great
essays on this subject, Politics and the English Language, George Orwell
listed a number of 'bad habits which spread by imitation', which he believed
were signs of the corruption of political thought at that time.
These bad habits included: pretentious diction, meaningless words, dead
metaphors, hackneyed phrases, cliche and jargon. It is a list that one could
level at today's business communications with equal legitimacy.
Perhaps the most obvious villain is jargon. The language of business is full
of it: empowerment, downsizing, proactive, business re-engineering,
networking. These are just a few of the jargon words that are trotted out at
innumerable business meetings.
The argument is not specifically against industry coining technical words to
describe its processes, but rather against the misuse of such technical
terms. Indeed, certain industries have built up their own vocabulary of
technical words that when used are quite precise.
Frequently, the problem occurs when words are borrowed from other activities
in an effort to mystify the business of business. For example, 'downsizing
the headcount' sounds more cerebral, worthy and expensive than 'giving
people the sack'. Equally, it seems that everyone who has been given the
sack recently has not been made redundant, but has become a consultant.
Consultants are often the worst offenders when it comes to the use of
jargon, presumably in the vain attempt to remain part of the corporate club.
Some will see these accusations of the corruption of language as a crusade
against Americanisation. It is not. Silicon Valley may be responsible for
some of the worst excesses of techno-babble, but these are only injurious
when misused. Again 'downsizing' is a good example. When applied to
computers it is a forgiveably neat way to describe the migration from
mainframe to client-server technology; applied to people it is simply
dehumanising.
Nor is the argument an elitist one, part of an effort to protect the purity
of our culture in the way that the French establishment is currently
attempting.
The argument is simply against the use of language without meaning or with
false meaning. Too often meaningless words or phrases are used simply to
indicate that the speaker belongs to the middle management club. 'Vision',
'challenge', 'short-termism', 'whither', 'I hear where you're coming from',
'we need to manage change', 'think global, act local' are all typical
examples. Describing business partnerships as 'getting into bed with'
someone was another common example of this trait; often heard in the 1980s
it has fortunately gone out of fashion.
Another feature of this language of acceptance is what one might term the
proposition of the indisputable. For instance, phrases such as 'people are
our most important asset', 'I'm with Cadbury on that one' or 'we are
committed to giving our shareholders a sound return on their investment',
are all so palpably blessed with holy oil that no one would dare argue
against them. Anyone caught using them is probably begging as many questions
as they are attempting to answer.
When was the last time you can remember someone daring to question a speaker
who extolled the values of 'total quality management' or of being
'market-driven'? Yet phrases such as these are frequently misused and most
often employed by people who have not thought sufficiently about quality or
the marketplace. They are merely camouflage.
Without them, without cliche, jargon and other dead language, most
businesses would work better. So what should govern the way that companies
and those in business express themselves?
Prescriptive lists are always dangerous. Language is far too individual to
be shackled by too many rules. However, there are good guidelines. Orwell
suggested the following:
Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to
seeing in print.
Never use a long word when a short one will do.
If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
Never use the passive where you can use the active.
Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can
think of an everyday English equivalent.
Break any of these rules rather than say anything that is outright
barbarous.
These guidelines are still sound. If a company were to banish the bad habits
and take up Orwell's principles, managers would have less camouflage to hide
behind. Employees would be more likely to think for themselves.
In the process some startling things might be discovered: for example, that
people may not be the most important asset of the company or that
shareholder value may not be the only golden rule for senior management.
Above all, clear language both encourages and reflects clarity of thought
and, in business, isn't that the only real asset a company can depend upon?

FT  03 JUN 94 / Management: Top dogs bark up the wrong tree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is time top managers admitted the truth. Most of them are indulging in a
convenient but simplistic fiction when they repeat the standard mantra that
the biggest barrier to radical change in their organisations is front-line
employees or, more often, middle management. The reality is frequently much
more painful: that the most intransigent group is top management itself.
In a few high-profile cases over the past couple of years, this has become
so obvious that outside directors or institutional shareholders have been
forced to have the top man removed. Notable examples include Digital,
General Motors, IBM and Kodak in the US, and Midland Bank in the UK.
But in almost all these instances action was taken long after the top man
had caused serious damage in one of several ways: by allowing the first
sparks of the company's strategic crisis to develop into what experts in
change call a fully-fledged 'burning platform'; by failing to douse flames
which were already burning when he took over; or by failing to change the
team - whether literally or figuratively.
It is far from unknown for recalcitrant members of a top team to be elbowed
or frozen out by its leader, or by their peers. But, all too often,
top-level resistance to radical change in strategy, organisation or culture
is tolerated by executive colleagues reluctant to invite criticism of
themselves, or by outside directors loath to rock the boat. Sometimes, as
the top team directs all its attention to the minions below, it does not
even recognise that it has a problem itself.
In the past three weeks I have attended two discussion dinners of top
managers trying to grapple with change. The first was billed by the
organisers as focusing purely on the top team. The second was more
wide-ranging, but promised to include some debate about the top.
On each occasion, discussion slipped quickly away from 'us' on to much more
comfortable ground: what 'we' can do to get 'them' to become more flexible,
customer-responsive, open-minded, speedy, and so on.
The same phenomenon was in evidence last week at a conference on radical
change, when a string of top managers blamed their organisations'
inflexibility and other inadequacies on what several called the 'mushy
middle'.
All of which makes very timely a research project which Don Laurie, a
consultant, has undertaken into what he calls the changing 'work of a
leader' in improving the customer-responsiveness of organisations.
Unlike the usual sort of wide-eyed study of leaders' characteristics, Laurie
concentrates on the actions they actually take. He focuses mainly on the
top, although he also deals with the need for 'distributed leadership' at
all levels of an organisation.
His research, which he is turning into a book, has one obvious limitation.
It relies heavily on one-to-one interviews with a blue-chip (all-male) list
of two dozen high-profile US and European chairmen, chief executives,
presidents and managing directors. They include Sir Colin Marshall of
British Airways, Jan Timmer of Philips, the electronics group, Elserino Piol
of Olivetti, John Duerden of Reebok International, and the heads of Goldman
Sachs and Chemical Bank in Europe.
So the study's findings are coloured heavily by the leaders'
self-perception, although this is tempered by Laurie's own experienced
judgment. But his focus on the top man and his team provides insights
aplenty, especially into the prevalence at that level of deep-seated
resistance to change.
Effective modern leadership is very different from the traditional exercise
of authority and power, and the handing-down of detailed, 'technical'
solutions, Laurie concludes. 'An awful lot of leaders are authority figures,
they're not performing the act of leadership,' he complains.
That consists of mobilising the people in an organisation to confront
difficult problems themselves, and helping them adapt to the challenges and
uncertainty which arise as a result.
Paradoxically, in addition to listening, 'coaching' and other supportive
behaviour, this often involves maintaining a fair degree of instability in
the organisation.
One obvious source of resistance to change which Laurie identifies is the
preponderance of control-types on most top teams, and the lack of creative
minds. Another is the tendency of many top managers to behave, not as a
cohesive team, but as warring barons, each defending their own departmental,
divisional or personal constituency; Laurie quotes a colleague's view that
'a top team working together is an oxymoron'.
A more surprising cause of resistance is the failure of many chairmen and
chief executives to listen to their top colleagues, to understand them as
individuals, to perceive clearly their strengths and weaknesses. Bernard
Fournier, head of Rank Xerox, places particular emphasis on overcoming what
he calls people's 'unconscious incompetence'. This can only be done by
communal learning from mistakes, he says.
That, in turn, requires real openness and considerable argument - the lack
of which, says Laurie, is a further cause of resistance at the top. Without
openness, recalcitrant team members will avoid commitment at meetings, and
then reinterpret supposed agreements. Or they will sabotage a decision -
usually by blackening a colleague's reputation.
As Laurie argues, the instinct of many top managers is to continue
furthering their own interests. They are loath to become team players - and
then to challenge much of what they have stood for. But unless they do,
neither will the people beneath them.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Big rise in people on low incomes: Richest sector receives
increasing share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proportion of the UK population with income below half the national
average has more than doubled in the past 30 years, says a report published
by the Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday.
In 1961 about 5m people - 10 per cent of the population - had incomes below
half the national average. This fell to just over 3m in 1977 but rose by
1991 to 11m - 20 per cent of the population.
The report says that the share of income going to the poorest tenth in
society fell from 4.2 per cent to 3 per cent in 1991, with most of the fall
occurring in the 1980s. The share of the richest tenth rose from 22 per cent
to 25 per cent during the three decades.
The report is based on a study of living standards in the UK during the past
three decades funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research
organisation.
It shows that the income of the poorest tenth increased 57 per cent between
1961 and 1991. The income of the richest tenth rose by 113 per cent and
average incomes grew by about 84 per cent.
Rising housing costs mean that the income of the bottom tenth, net of
housing costs, barely rose over the three decades. For this group income
after housing costs was no higher in real terms in 1991 than in 1967. The
income of the richest tenth after housing costs almost doubled in this
period.
The report shows that the long-term rise in unemployment has become a
significant factor in the changing pattern of low incomes. Families with
children now account for almost 50 per cent of those on less than half
average income, compared with just more than a third in 1961.
There has been an increase in the number of self-employed at the bottom of
the income scale, reporting very low or zero profits. The report says their
growth in the 1980s suggests that some were forced into insecure and
low-income forms of self-employment through the absence of jobs.
The number of pensioners below half average income, which fell from 2.3m to
just under 1m between 1961 and the early 1980s, has risen sharply to 3.4m in
1991. The study says the ending of the link between the state pension and
average earnings is largely responsible for the surge.
Part of the growth in inequality is caused by growing inequalities in
earnings, the report says. But the inequality of income from self-employment
and investments is growing faster and becoming increasingly important.
The report says the rise in inequality during the 1980s dwarfs the
fluctuations in inequality in the 1960s and 1970s.
Average incomes have grown more quickly since 1960 in the south of England
than in the rest of the country, the Institute for Fiscal Studies report
says.
At 1994 prices, average incomes in the south and Midlands were similar at
the start of the 1960s, on Pounds 150 and Pounds 144 a week respectively.
Average income in the north was already somewhat lower at Pounds 136 a week.
By the 1970s the south had pulled away from the rest of England with average
incomes about 10 per cent higher. This widened further during the recession
in the early 1980s, when the Midlands, in particular, suffered.
By the start of the 1990s the south had moved 30 per cent ahead of the rest
of England with average income of Pounds 292 a week, compared with Pounds
237 in the Midlands and Pounds 224 in the north.
Scotland and Wales started the 1960s with similar incomes, although below
the average for England. For Scotland, the average was Pounds 129 a week,
compared with Pounds 128 for Wales.
During the 1970s, however, Scotland started to pull away from Wales and has
stayed ahead. By 1990 incomes in Scotland had risen to Pounds 237, the same
as for the English Midlands and 10 per cent above the Pounds 215 a week for
Wales.

FT  03 JUN 94 / DTI pledges to seek plug opt-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine yesterday committed the government to seeking an
exemption from any attempt by the European Union to standardise electric
plugs and sockets.
But as the trade and industry secretary played down any suggestion that such
a move was imminent, he appeared to acknowledge that it would be impossible
to block it by using the national veto.
Pressed on whether standardisation could be pushed through under the
majority voting system applicable to the single European market, Mr
Heseltine insisted that present discussions within Cenelec, the European
standards body, did not amount to firm proposals.
Speaking during the European election campaign, he said that the government
had commissioned a study of the costs of such a switch to 'arm itself'
against the possibility of a proposal from Brussels.
The Department of Trade and Industry study says UK consumers would face a
bill of Pounds 78m a year for 40 years if the country moved to European
standards.
For the moment it was a 'non-issue'. But Mr Heseltine said: 'We now have the
facts. If proposals do emerge, we want very much to be in the position where
we can secure a derogation for Britain.'

FT  03 JUN 94 / Risk-capital list launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A national database designed to bring together private investors or business
angels - and unlisted companies requiring risk capital was launched in
London yesterday.
Enterprise Adventure, the private company which is launching Venturelist,
will join a number of other UK introduction services trying to marry
investors and companies.
Similar agencies have attempted to launch national databases before, but
Venturelist is the first attempt to provide the service electronically,
allowing angels to access the system through a personal computer.
Inclusion on Venturelist will be free until 500 angels and 250 businesses
have been included on the system.
Mr Paul Coleman, Enterprise Adventure's managing director, hopes to have
2,000 angels - from a potential population of 50,000 informal investors it
says exist in the UK - and 1,000 companies on the system within a year.
The success of the venture will depend on whether it can attract enough
private investors to use the database as a marketplace for information,
observers say. Almost none of the other UK introduction services have
survived without some form of subsidy.
Enterprise Adventure hopes to get intermediaries such as accounting firms,
Business Link organisations, and local training and development bodies to
provide lists of companies seeking funds and angels prepared to invest.
These so-called champions will be charged Pounds 1,000 and the investors
will also pay a fee for logging on. Individual investors who want access to
the database will be charged Pounds 500 a year. Entrepreneurs seeking equity
will pay a Pounds 250 fee for an assessment by consultants who will
'rigorously vet' the quality of the information companies supply. Companies
will also pay Pounds 50 to be included on the database.

FT  03 JUN 94 / 'A respectable and respected public corporation': Statement
by Tim Smith, economy minister for Northern Ireland, about the controversial
Pounds 160m Hualon project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hualon project to be located outside Belfast in Northern Ireland is a
fully integrated textile plant involving dyeing, finishing, weaving and
spinning of polycotton, cotton and nylon polyester fabrics. The plant will
be established in four distinct phases over a period of eight years, and
will involve total investment of almost Pounds 160m.
Because of its size, and the need to obtain European Commission approval for
state aid, it has created particular interest. I welcome the opportunity to
clarify some issues.
Independent scrutiny: Before submitting the proposal for consideration by
the EC, the Industrial Development Board (IDB) subjected the Hualon business
plan to a rigorous appraisal process. This involved a detailed review of the
four main components of the business: marketing, production, technical,
management and finance. The IDB also examined the project under the headings
of viability, additionality and efficiency.
In considering the nature, scope and size of the plan, it was considered
that there were fundamental issues on which expert consultancy advice was
needed. Specialist marketing and production/technical advice was provided by
Kurt Salmon Associates, a leading independent internationally recognised
textile consultancy firm. KSA addressed the following issues: the specific
production and sales targets, the impact on European industry and the
marketplace, the size and cost of the capital expenditure programme, the
level of employment, and the costing structure. KSA's evaluation drew on key
sources among potential customers, manufacturers and other industry
interests throughout Europe.
Its market assessment report included the following comments: 'Based on its
wide knowledge and experience of the European textile and clothing
industries, and supported by specific interviews to investigate market
aspects related to the Hualon project, KSA believes that there is a
realistic market opportunity for a Northern Ireland production facility and
in the context of the changes occurring in the EC, Hualon's strategy is
valid.
'The market for clothing will continue to grow. Despite predicted import
penetration of 70 per cent by 2001, the manufacturing base in EC  - and more
particularly in Eastern Europe and North Africa - will still be substantial
and will benefit from a reliable, low-cost source of fabric such as that
proposed by Hualon.'
The consultants also confirmed that Hualon is a major successful world-class
textile company with an impressive track record, and that its product range
will compete predominately in the sector currently served by imports.
Perhaps I could emphasise the point that the market for these products is
not shrinking.
Hualon will be competing from a European base in what is by any standards a
substantial and growing market.
In assessing this project we were aware of the previous interest of the
Irish government in securing a project from the Hualon organisation and my
officials have been in touch with their counterparts in Dublin. However, it
should be made clear that the project originally announced for the Limerick
area during October 1990 by the then minister Mr Des O'Malley was much
smaller than the four-phase project destined for Northern Ireland. A
statement dated March 25 1991 by Mr O'Malley, on his return from Taiwan,
stated that this project had been 'put on hold'. Technology: The project is
very much high-tech. Hualon propose to invest in the latest 'state of the
art' weaving machinery. Waterjet and airjet looms from Tsudakoma will
provide Hualon with the ability to produce high-quality, high-volume fabrics
at the lower end of the market. Traditional European producers are generally
moving towards weaving more complicated fabrics at the higher value end of
the market which involves shorter runs and requires greater flexibility as
provided by slower rapier-type looms.
Hualon's success in Asia is built on its ability to operate at the leading
edge of weaving technology by running its airjet and waterjet looms at
greater efficiencies and speeds than its competitors can achieve. Indeed an
article in the Technology section of the Financial Times of August 6 1993
referred to the 'greater speed and efficiency' of the waterjet looms.
European Commission: In presenting our case to the European Community we
emphasised the economic arguments in favour of the project. We also pointed
out that the project would have a significant impact on a region which
suffers from the highest unemployment figures in the United Kingdom and is
recognised as an Objective 1 region in the European Union.
Our representations to Europe were actively supported by the Unionist, DUP,
and SDLP Northern Ireland members of the European Parliament, and the
decision by the European Commission was welcomed by all shades of political
opinion in Northern Ireland. The proposed location for the project, which
has been known for some time, is a greenfield site accessible to all areas
but particularly to North and West Belfast.
The Oung family: As minister for the economy in Northern Ireland I have
direct responsibility for the IDB, which is part of my Department of
Economic Development. Both Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary,
and I have been closely involved with the Hualon case.
We were fully aware of the allegations, which have been in the public domain
for some time. I wish to emphasise that the IDB has been negotiating with a
respectable and respected public corporation. As a matter of interest, we
have not had any dealings with the persons charged.
Safeguards: Northern Ireland does have the highest unemployment rate in the
UK. However, this does not remove from government the obligation to consider
most carefully each case which requires public funding. Invariably we build
in appropriate safeguards. In the case of Hualon these safeguards will
include continuing in-depth monitoring and the successful achievement of
objectives in each of the four phases will be necessary before approval is
given to grant-aid the next phase. There is absolutely no question of grant
aid of up to Pounds 60m being made available on an 'up front' basis.
It is a real challenge for ministers and for the IDB to attract industry to
Northern Ireland but success on this front is being achieved. In the
financial year 1992-93, for example, the IDB obtained ten internationally
mobile projects against very severe international competition. These
projects represent an investment into Northern Ireland of about Pounds 167m.
This achievement was followed by a further very successful year in 1993-94,
when 13 projects involving Pounds 259m investment were secured.
These successes have been achieved in the face of considerable difficulties.
Not least of our burdens have been continuing references to De Lorean which
occurred 13 years ago. Since then no less than 112 inward investment
projects have come to Northern Ireland and have established successful
businesses here.
The Northern Ireland project is a commercial venture and is not therefore
risk free. However, the willingness of the Hualon corporation to invest
about Pounds 160m in Northern Ireland is a welcome indication that
successful Asian companies regard us, and Europe, as a good location for
extending their businesses. In doing so they join Japanese, Korean,
Indonesian and Hong Kong companies already in Northern Ireland.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Leading indicators decline in April
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Both the longer and shorter leading indicators of the UK economy fell in
April, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday.
The shorter leading indicator, which looks five months ahead, fell sharply
because of declining share prices, consumer confidence and new car
registrations. Subsequent data may reverse the decline.
The longer leading indicator, which looks 13 months ahead, has been flat or
falling since the second half of last year.
The coincident indicator continues to rise, as it has done since the second
quarter of 1992. This indicator is based on factors such as industrial
output, retail sales and M0. The UK's official reserves rose Dollars 9m in
May, bringing the total at the end of the month to Dollars 43.46bn, Treasury
figures showed yesterday. The underlying rise in the reserves was Dollars
25m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tradepoint Financial Networks, set up to develop an electronic share-dealing
system, has applied to City regulators to become a recognised investment
exchange.
Being recognised would put it on the same regulatory basis as other
exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange and the London Metal Exchange.
Mr Peter Bennett, chief executive, said the move would make it more easily
recognisable to participants and enable it to deal on a 'peer to peer' basis
with other exchanges.
The new system is aimed at institutional investors and will be
'order-driven'. It will match volumes and prices of share orders from buyers
and sellers, in contrast to the quote-driven system that dominates the stock
exchange.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Names told to pay extra Pounds 70.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 4,000 Names on the loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates at Lloyd's
must pay a further Pounds 70.3m before the end of next month, GW Run-Off,
the agency now managing the syndicates' affairs, announced yesterday,
Richard Lapper writes.
The Names, whose assets support the market, have already faced demands for
Pounds 700m and will eventually lose more than Pounds 1bn.
A court action by 3,095 Gooda Names against their agents began in April. The
case, in which the Names are seeking compensation of more than Pounds 600m,
will resume on Tuesday.
Names on two of the syndicates - numbers 290 and 298 - face a further cash
call of Pounds 30.5m in January next year. However, Mr Ken Randall of GW
Run-Off said he was hopeful that this second call could be deferred if a new
facility, designed to provide syndicates with short-term credit, was
launched as expected.
Negotiations about the facility - which could provide between Dollars 500m
and Dollars 1bn in credits - are continuing.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Labour unveils industry policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour said yesterday that industry had reached a 'historic crossroads' as
the party unveiled plans which it said would boost research and investment
and encourage a long-term commitment to strategic businesses.
The party said in a 17,000-word document, which attacked the 'short-termism'
of the City and pledged the creation of a Business Development Bank to
foster the growth of small companies, that it was determined to promote
Britain as a 'high-skill, high-tech' economy.
The opposition faced immediate charges from Mr Michael Heseltine, who last
month launched the government's plans to boost industrial competitiveness,
of old-fashioned interventionism which would destroy jobs and innovation.
The document, launched by Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry
secretary, sets out a list of policy commitments ranging from curbs on
hostile takeovers to the abolition of the restrictions which prevent British
Telecommunications from using its network to provide entertainment.
Mr Cook said the document, Winning for Britain, was based on a year of
intensive consultation with key figures in industry. In a sideswipe at UK
financial institutions, he added: 'This document provides the policies that
protect long-term investment from being put at risk by the short-term
priorities of the City.'
The proposals, which will be presented to this year's annual party
conference, include a range of measures directed against current practices
in the City. They include:
Shifting the onus of proof in hostile takeovers to require predators to show
a public interest.
A review of regulatory rules in financial markets to support moves to more
'committed ownership', and talks with pension fund trustees on ways to
ensure more investment in productive capacity.
Possible changes to the tax treatment of share ownership to produce a bias
in favour of long-term holdings.
A review of the structure of corporate governance to strengthen the
'collective character' of industrial enterprise.
More broadly, the document says Labour would institute a corporate tax
review which would investigate the case for a tax credit to encourage
research investment.
A package of proposed measures for small businesses include:
The introduction of a statutory right to interest on late payment by
companies above a minimum threshold.
A legal right giving a company in financial difficulty the option of a
moratorium on debts for a limited period in order to develop a rescue
package.
The creation of the Business Development Bank and establishment of a network
of regional development agencies.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Heseltine rules out easing of BT ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday flatly
rejected any easing of restrictions which prevent British Telecommunications
from using its network to provide entertainment services.
As the Labour party used the launch of an industrial competitiveness
document to pledge it would scrap the ban, Mr Heseltine insisted that any
such move would represent a 'grave breach of trust' by the government.
Accusing Labour of irresponsible opposition politics, he said the
restrictions had been introduced to allow other companies to catch up with
BT's monopoly when it was privatised. Competitors had invested billions of
pounds because they could rely on the 'word' of the government. He added:
'Frankly, it would be the gravest possible breach of integrity if we were to
go back on that.'
The ban, which applies at least until 1998, was imposed to encourage cable
companies to invest in telecommunications networks in competition with BT.
The cable companies say the ban is essential to ensure the viability of
their planned Pounds 6bn investment during the next five years.
BT has argued that the decision, taken in 1991, has been overtaken by events
and threatens the viability of a nationwide telecommunications
'superhighway' based on fibre-optic networks. It appears willing to invest
Pounds 15bn in such a programme but needs the assurance of profits from the
entertainment sector, at present dominated by US cable companies. Labour
would scrap the ban in return for a BT undertaking to participate in a new
'nationwide communications link-up'.

There is no sign of upward pressure on pay settlements in the engineering
industry, in spite of the upward drift in national average earnings over the
past few months, the Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday.
In the three months from February to April the average settlement level was
2.27 per cent, only slightly up on the 2.14 per cent recorded from December
to February.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Ofgas accepts proposals for grid pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, yesterday broadly accepted a pricing
system proposed by British Gas for the use of its transportation and storage
facilities by commercial rivals and its own trading arms.
It will for the first time separate out the costs of sending gas through the
different tiers of the national gas grid.
The pricing system clears the way for British Gas to split, as required by
the government, its two trading arms - Contract Trading and Public Gas
Supply - from TransCo, the new name for the company's pipeline and storage
division.
As a monopoly British Gas has not needed to separate the cost of
transportation but the introduction of competition and the requirement to
separate the trading and transportation functions has required it to devise
pricing guidelines for all potential users of the system.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said the 'proposals . . . are
a reasonable first step forward towards creating a more transparent and
cost-reflective pricing regime'.
There were fears last year that the introduction of the new method would
lead to transportation price increases of 20 per cent over three years.
Ofgas said yesterday that the new method would lead to a price cut of 2.7
per cent to users of the grid in October.
The watchdog accepts the 'long-range marginal cost' pricing method put
forward by British Gas but has 'reservations' that it could lead to 'large
price variations between regions', one of the most politically sensitive
issues associated with gas liberalisation.
It says it will limit such price volatility by imposing a curb on
fluctuations of more than 10 per cent.
It has also agreed to TransCo charging uniform prices on the regional
pipeline system, even though that involves a 'degree of cross-subsidy
between customers'.
British Gas and independent gas marketers say they will need to see an Ofgas
decision on how much TransCo will be allowed to charge for the pipeline
before they can fully assess the impact of the proposals.
That decision is expected by mid-month.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Costs of accountancy watchdog soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs of the accountancy profession's most senior regulatory body have
increased by nearly half, the 1993 accounts showed yesterday, Andrew Jack
writes.
Spending on the Joint Disciplinary Scheme was Pounds 1.44m in the year to
December 31, from Pounds 1.03m in the previous year.
The scheme estimates that an additional Pounds 1.63m not yet allowed for in
the accounts will be needed to complete work on its five current
investigations, even before any costs if the verdicts are appealed against.
This compares with an estimate of Pounds 670,000 for completing its two
outstanding inquiries last year.
No cases were completed in 1993, but an additional three cases were taken
on. The original two are Barlow Clowes, the fund management company, and the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Last year it started probes of Robert Maxwell companies, those associated
with International Signal and Control Group, which was bought by Ferranti,
and War on Want, the charity.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Walker 'driving force' in fraud: Court hears of alleged
thefts totalling Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the
property and leisure group, fraudulently inflated the company's profits in
the mid-1980s to mislead investors and creditors about the success and
financial health of his business empire, it was alleged at the Old Bailey
yesterday.
Mr Peter Rook QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, told the jury
yesterday that Mr Walker was the 'driving force' behind a fraud which also
involved the theft of Pounds 17m from the company and complex
misrepresentations of the company's accounts to conceal the dishonesty from
the outside world,
Mr Rook was opening the prosecution case on the first day of the trial of Mr
Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker group finance
director.
Mr Walker faces four charges of theft involving a total of Pounds 17m, two
charges of false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the Brent
Walker accounts to overstate the company's profits and assets. Mr Aquilina
faces one charge of the theft of Pounds 4.5m, three charges of false
accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the company's accounts. Both men
deny all the charges.
Mr Rook said the fraud centred on the activities of Brent Walker's film,
television and video subsidiary. Between 1984 and 1987 the profits of this
division were artificially boosted by Pounds 19.3m - profits which also
appeared in the accounts of the overall group which reported healthy results
to shareholders throughout the period.
He said: 'In reality, this income was not true income. The profits were
bogus. They did not reflect proper commercial transactions. Brent Walker was
funding its own profits' He said the profit-boosting, financed from Brent
Walker funds, proved expensive and cost the company Pounds 30m.
The fraud made a substantial difference to the apparent health of Brent
Walker, he said. In 1987 the media division made a Pounds 1.7m loss when in
reality it was claimed the subsidiary was responsible for almost half of
group profits. Had this been known by the markets the subsequent history of
Brent Walker might have been very different.
To keep the illegal profit-boosting concealed, the company accounts had to
be massaged, he said. Mr Walker and Mr Aquilina were aided in this by two
former directors of the media division, Mr Donald Anderson and Mr John
Quested.
Mr Rook said this was done by falsely stating that film rights had been sold
to three purchasers. In all cases, however, the purchasers were refunded
their money by Brent Walker through a series of complex circular
transactions.
To keep the fraud concealed, it became necessary for Mr Walker and Mr
Aquilina to extract even more money from the company and to continue
manipulating the company accounts.
He said: 'Each time the defendants tried to paper over the cracks, cracks
appeared elsewhere so other measures would have to be taken to cover up the
situation.'
The Brent Walker auditors, Leigh Carr, must have been 'less than vigilant',
Mr Rook said. However, when some of the bogus transactions were first
questioned in the press, Mr Walker misled KPMG Peat Marwick, joint auditors
from 1988, and lied to the Stock Exchange.
The trial, expected to last up to five months, continues today.

FT  03 JUN 94 / British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting: Ashdown urges
training takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chambers of commerce should take over the Training and Enterprise Councils
which administer government training schemes in England and Wales, Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said yesterday.
He urged a greater role for local business in determining not only the
pattern of education and training but also of local infrastructure
investment.
He also argued for chambers of commerce to be given a statutory role, as
they have in Germany - a suggestion advocated by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, when he was out of office.
Mr Ashdown said companies would have to belong to the local chamber and in
return they would have the benefit of a single voice when speaking to
government and a single framework for training. The chambers, he said,
'should take on responsibilities for the Tecs themselves'.
There are 82 employer-led Tecs in England and Wales, which have increasingly
taken a role in local economic development as well as training since their
creation just more than three years ago.
Mr Ashdown also said the Liberal Democrats would legislate to make interest
payable on overdue debt, a step which the government rejected in its white
paper on competitiveness.
But he made his strongest comments as part of an advocation for a stronger
voice for the UK in the European Union. This is a subject about which
smaller companies have a distinctly cool view, a sur-vey by the British
Chambers of Commerce found yester-day.
The survey of 364 small companies found 72 per cent opposed to the EU
becoming responsible for wider areas of policy.
But 60 per cent of the companies said they had not been affected by the
single European market and slightly more did not know the name of their
member of the European parliament.
More than half of them claimed to have had no benefits from the single
market.

FT  03 JUN 94 / The Bar relents on student places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 250 students who had been denied places at the barristers'
training school by a controversial new selection procedure have been
accepted after a climbdown by the Bar.
The selection system, which ignored degree results, was based on a mixture
of academic qualifications at A-level and psychometric tests. It was
designed to pick the best 800 from a record 2,400 applicants for the
one-year vocational course - the only route to practise at the Bar.
But the scheme provoked outrage among students and university law teachers
after hundreds of students with first-class and 2.1 degrees, including more
than 60 who had been awarded scholarships by the four Inns of Court, were
rejected because of their A-level results.
Last month Ms Jane Nightingale, 25, a student with a 2.1 degree who was
rejected by the Bar on the basis of her A-levels, was granted leave by the
High Court to bring judicial review proceedings against the Council of Legal
Education, the body which runs the Bar School.
Ms Nightingale has now been offered a place and her judicial review
application has been withdrawn.
The Public Law Project, a charity which supported her application, said that
it was delighted for the students that the Bar had been forced into a
climbdown by the action.
But it said there were still more than 100 students who felt they had been
wrongfully rejected. Yesterday the charity was given leave by Mr Justice
Morrison to bring a further judicial review of the selection system on
behalf of Ms Penny Davies, 21, a third-year student at the University of
Westminster.
She is expected to gain a 2.1 but has been told only a first-class degree
will secure her a place as she failed the supplementary application form
test. Her case is expected to be heard at the end of June.
In a joint statement issued yesterday Mr Robert Seabrook QC, chairman of the
Bar, and Mr Justice Phillips, chairman of the CLE, admitted the Bar had been
wrong to ignore good degrees.
Following detailed assessment of the selection system they said the Bar had
decided to offer additional places to students with first-class degrees who
had failed in any one of the four elements of the selection system and to
students with 2.1 degrees who failed either the A-level or application form
elements.
As a result all but 17 of the 250 students awarded scholarships by the Inns
and 98 of the 106 applicants with first-class degrees had now been offered
places on the 1994-95 course.
The selection system had also been criticised for discriminating against
ethnic minorities and women.

FT  03 JUN 94 / British Chambers of Commerce Annual Meeting: Heavy cost cuts
ahead at Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further attacks on costs at the combined BMW-Rover motor group have been
foreshadowed by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, the BMW chairman.
He told chambers of commerce members at their annual meeting in Birmingham
that, in the European motor industry, 'the objective is to reduce the
general level of costs by 20-30 per cent within two years'.
Both BMW and Rover had been 'far-sighted enough to start this process of
restructuring in good time, in this way coming out of the recession without
any major problems,' Mr Pischetsrieder said.
He did not specify how much further the restructuring in both companies had
to go. 'We have to increase productivity by 4 to 5 per cent a year on an
on-going basis.'
But he indicated that Rover would be allowed to continue its restructuring
independently. 'It is not our objective to integrate and bring together as
many corporate functions as possible, in this way superficially reducing our
costs. Instead, we wish to pool the specific skills and abilities of the two
companies, working together to capitalise on our larger market,' he said.
Mr Pischetsrieder sought to allay continuing fears that Rover's interests
would be progressively subordinated to those of BMW: 'There will be no
overriding holding company, the two companies being guided instead by joint
committees,' he said.
He added that Rover would maintain its research and development capacity.
'To have an individual car company as a partner in the UK, we have to
maintain the capacity for R&amp;D in the UK and even to increase it.'
The Rover 800 model would be replaced, even though in some respects it
competed with BMW models. Mr Pischetsrieder said: 'We do want an exclusive
image for Rover, and exclusivity starts at the top. We need a car succeeding
the Rover 800, which is typical British luxury sedan.'
Mr Pischetsrieder said Rover sales in Germany had increased by 100 per cent
in the past two months and production volumes were 25 per cent more than a
year ago.
He also painted a bright future for UK component suppliers if they
maintained present trends. BMW has increased by 400 per cent its purchases
of UK components during the past three years.

FT  03 JUN 94 / British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting: Cadbury urges
new roles for companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boards of UK companies will have to give greater recognition to their
responsibilities towards employees and society, Sir Adrian Cadbury, the
chairman of the committee on corporate governance, warned yesterday.
He presented this as part of a process which would bring about some
convergence between British and continental European practice.
Underlying his remarks was the thought that the form of company boards will
change, given UK membership of the European Union. Sir Adrian said the UK
viewed a company as a capitalist enterprise, while the Continent saw it as a
coalition of interests and a partnership between capital and labour.
Sir Adrian said that if there was to be a convergence between these two
notions British boards would have to recognise a wider responsibility while
Continental companies would have to pay 'more regard to shareholders' rights
and Anglo-American standards of disclosure, especially if they want to tap
international sources of equity finance'.

FT  03 JUN 94 / British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting: Business truths
that need modern techniques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Chambers of Commerce has been trying, its outgoing president Mr
Christopher Stewart-Smith said: 'To set out the business agenda.'
This agenda, as it has been exposed before about 500 executives in
Birmingham, has been a question of updating techniques to deal with
long-established business truths.
Thus Ms Jean Muir, the fashion designer, stressed one of the factors -
design - which has been a continual problem for generations of business.
'Those companies who consistently produce good ideas and practical
commitment to quality and craft not only last the longest, but in
economically challenging times are those that suffer least.'
But corporate survival and success depend above all on the skill and
motivation of a well-trained workforce responding to the needs of customers.
'People are the most important asset of a company,' said Mr Nick Temple,
chief executive of IBM (UK). 'The future for us is customer loyalty,' said
Mr Stephen Cronin, group resources director at Rank Xerox (UK).
Communication both within and without a company is seen as easier in small
units. Hence, as Mr Temple acknowledged, the reorganisation of IBM into
smaller units or, as Mr Robert Horton, chairman of Railtrack described, the
devolution of power on the rail network into 10 zones watched over by a
small headquarters.
But Mr Horton acknowledged that within Railtrack the ability to communicate
had some way to go. He admitted there had been a failure of communication
with signalmen who are threatening a strike.
Mr Allan Amey, managing director of LDV, formerly Leyland Daf Vans, warned
that 'the larger the organisation the more in-built corporate inertia
exists'.
But just as companies, according to the agenda which the chambers are laying
down, are seeking greater communication internally, there is also a process
of forging partnerships outside.
'What we are looking for is a quality company which has quality products and
delighted customers,' said Mr Cronin. But the needs of customers change and
for Mr Horton 'excellence is meeting constant change'.
The notion of partnership is being fostered by the government, especially in
its approach to inner-city revival. These are partnerships involving both
the public and private sector. Sir Reginald Eyre, chairman of Birmingham
Heartlands Development Corporation, said: 'If in three or more years ahead,
the successful regeneration of Birmingham Heartlands is to be attributed to
only one thing, then that attribute will be partnership.'
This is taking place at a time of rapid technological change and, said Dr
Peter Horne, managing director of Apricot Computers, the information
revolution will change the habit of companies doing most of their business
in local markets.
'With a worldwide communications and information network, which is cheap and
open to all, the definition of what is local will radically change.'

FT  03 JUN 94 / Tradepoint requests exchange status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tradepoint Financial Networks, set up to develop an electronic share-dealing
system, has applied to City regulators to become a recognised investment
exchange.
Tradepoint is authorised as a service company regime, but becoming a
recognised exchange would put it on the same regulatory basis as other
exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange and the London Metal Exchange,
the company said yesterday. The change carries greater regulatory
obligations, and higher regulatory fees.
Mr Peter Bennett, chief executive, said the move would make it more easily
recognisable to participants and enable it to deal on a 'peer to peer' basis
with other exchanges.
The new system is aimed at institutional investors and will be
'order-driven'.
It will automatically match volumes and prices of share orders from buyers
and sellers, in contrast to the quote-driven system that dominates the Stock
Exchange, based on intermediaries' quotes.

FT  03 JUN 94 / When choice does not mean change in Ulster: The issues
dominating the campaign in the province
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are 17 candidates for the three Northern Ireland seats at Strasbourg,
seven more than in 1989.
Greater choice though, including a Conservative this time and a 'Yogic
flyer' of the Natural Law party, is unlikely to produce significant changes
to traditional voting patterns in Ulster's hothouse of sectarian politics.
The Rev Ian Paisley, of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party, topped the
poll for the three-seat constituency in the 1989 election, followed by Mr
John Hume of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and Mr Jim
Nicholson of the Ulster Unionist party. Even the other candidates have
little doubt that the same three will be elected again.
The main interest therefore is in how the relative share of votes may shift.
The key division between the three sitting MEPs is over the Downing Street
declaration.
Mr Paisley has declared the June 9 Euro-election to be a referendum on the
Anglo-Irish peace efforts and what he says is a 'sell-out' to Dublin.
Mr Hume and Mr Nicholson, moderates of the nationalist and unionist camps
respectively, have chosen to fight the election on their Euro-credentials.
Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the UUP, said: 'There is probably more
in common between us and the SDLP in this campaign than there is with the
DUP.'
Europhile Mr Hume points to his successful lobbying to attract European
Union structural funds to the province.
He said: 'You've got the bizarre situation in this election that parties who
have been against Europe are running around trying to claim credit for the
European developments that have taken place in Northern Ireland.'
The anti-federalist Mr Nicholson says that Ulster's MEPs have to do better.
'The republic (of Ireland) is getting funding at a level 2 1/2 times per
head of population than we are in Northern Ireland. We've got to get in
there to fight for the best possible deal and maximum support for Northern
Ireland. If we don't achieve that the republic will continue to advance into
the future and we will be left standing behind.'
Sinn Fein is putting up three candidates and doing all it can to get its
supporters out. It obtained 9 per cent of the poll in 1989, and any
improvement on that will be used by the party's leaders to vindicate their
begrudging approach to the peace process.
Similarly the DUP will see any improvement in Mr Paisley's vote as a
vindication for his rejection of the Downing Street declaration.
The DUP is also likely to further strengthen its vote among Protestant
working-class voters disgruntled with government economic and social
policies that the UUP has backed at Westminster. Significantly, the only
candidate to have visited a picket line at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in
Belfast last week was Mr Paisley. The 125-strong workforce of the shipyard's
ship-repair division has been on strike over management plans to implement
an annualised hours agreement. This will effectively abolish overtime rates,
yet will oblige the workforce to work up to 80 hours a week at peak periods.
The dispute has highlighted Britain's opt-out on the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty. Mr Sammy Wilson, DUP spokesman, said: 'We are against
federalism that would dilute sovereignty and the union, but we support the
social chapter.'
The UUP could be vulnerable on the economic issue. Last weekend Mr Nicholson
was out with party leader Mr James Molyneaux in the Protestant working-class
area of Sandy Row in south Belfast, enthusiastically stuffing campaign
literature through letterboxes.
In a part of the Sandy Row enclave where wall paintings testify to support
for loyalist paramilitaries, a local man approached Mr Nicholson and said:
'What are you going to do about housing - that's what I want to know?'
A somewhat surprised Mr Nicholson paused a moment and said: 'Well housing
isn't a European issue actually.'

FT  03 JUN 94 / Talk Radio plans February launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talk Radio UK, the highest bidder for the third national commercial radio
station, was yesterday awarded a licence by the Radio Authority and plans to
launch in February.
Sir David Nicholas, the former chief executive of Independent Television
News who is chairman of Talk Radio UK, promised it would be 'a national
sounding-board to ventilate issues where people could get things off their
mind in a way that has not been done in this country'.
The company bid Pounds 3.82m a year - the highest of six bids for the
eight-year licence and more than Pounds 1m ahead of its nearest rival
Newstalk UK.
The new national station has raised Pounds 9m for the venture - Pounds 6.5m
in equity and Pounds 2.5m in leasing finance.
Media Ventures International, a UK-controlled fund largely backed by US
money, will have 31 per cent of the venture. Two American broadcasters -
CanWest Global Communications and Emmis Broadcasting - will each have 24.5
per cent while Hambros Bank has 15 per cent and Radio Investings 5 per cent.
Mr John Aumonier, managing director of the new station, said 97 per cent of
output would be speech-based but it would not consist of 'Fred from
Battersea' phone-ins. He promised drama, news, comedy, quizzes and
discussions.
Research showed the likely audience would be middle market, aged between 25
and 55.
As much as 500 hours a year of programmes would be bought in from
independent producers by the second year.
The Radio Authority yesterday rejected a call from investors in LBC to
re-advertise two London licences after Reuters Holdings took control of LNR,
the company that was awarded LBC's licences.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Campaign Diary: Kick-in-teeth politics packs a punch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Alan Sked's UK Indepen-dence party claims to be signing up hundreds of
members a day following its first party political broadcast this week. But
the party's uncompromising promise to withdraw from the European Union is
also making inroads into the conservative academic establishment. Few
candidates can have better academic support than David Wilkinson, the
party's man in Oxford and Hampshire North, who was nominated by Lord Dacre,
the historian of Nazi Germany, and seconded by Norman Stone, professor of
modern history at Worcester College, Oxford. Lord Dacre, who sits on the
Conservative benches in the Lords, was not available to discuss the party
yesterday owing to a lunch engagement at Oriel. But Prof Stone, who
describes himself as an independent Tory, says this is the time for a
'protest kick in the teeth' for the party over Maastricht. He thinks
Wilkinson might even win because of growing disenchantment with the EU:
'It's a case of galloping detumescence.'
Where are the 'bastards' hiding? Of the four rightwing cabinet ministers
whose parentage was questioned by John Major in an unguarded moment, only
Michael Howard has taken an active part in the campaign. John Redwood made
his first appearance yesterday, but Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo have
been noticeable by their absence. Asked where Portillo was, a senior Tory
official said he would take at least one press conference after June 9. Slip
of the tongue, of course. No-one at Central Office is trying to keep the
right quiet until after the election. Perish the thought.
                         *        *       *
Esperantists are threatening to spoil the Euro ballot. Brian Barker,
campaign officer for the Esperanto Association of Britain, is urging voters
to protest against the cost of translating the EU's nine working languages.
He claims there are 4m European speakers of esperanto, an artificial
language which mixes a largely Romance vocabulary with Swahili vowels. The
association - campaign slogan sparu monon per esperanto (save money by means
of esperanto) - wants esperanto to be a common European language, scorning
claims for Latin, once spoken from the North Atlantic to the Black Sea.
Apparently computers prefer esperanto.
The Communist party of Great Britain, self-declared inheritor of the CP's
Leninist mantle, is putting up hopefuls in Scotland North West and two
London seats. But the revolution may be delayed: the party won 425 votes in
the local elections - split between seven candidates.
                         *        *       *
Labour's glossy election document on animal rights promises protection for
creatures as varied as badgers and whales, and bans on everything from
hunting to battery farming. Unaccountably, its moral outrage fails to extend
to the most common form of human cruelty to animals - the predominantly
working-class sport of angling. Nothing to do with tawdry vote-catching, of
course.
                         *        *       *
Labour's leadership election presents a ticklish timing problem for John
Major. The new leader - almost certainly Tony Blair - will be named on July
21, probably the last day of the parliamentary session before the summer
recess. Major wants to reshuffle the cabinet as close to the end of the
session as possible, to minimise the opportunities for sacked ministers to
make embarrassing resignation statements to the Commons. He could try to
spoil Labour's inauguration ceremonies by going for July 21, but that would
also blunt the impact of the reshuffle. An earlier announcement might give
someone time to do a Norman Lamont, but a short delay would look like a
defensive reaction to Blair. He could postpone the shake-up until the
summer, but ministers' holiday commitments would probably mean that it would
be delayed until September. Bit too close for comfort to the party
conference which is to be held in October.
Lindi St Clair, sometimes known as 'Miss Whiplash', seems a bit confused
following the demise of her Corrective party, which fought so hard for
courtesans' rights. Almost every window of her house in Charlton, south-east
London - the one with video cameras on the front and a pink Corrective party
hoarding stashed in the back garden - is plastered with Liberal Democrat
posters. But Ms St Clair has also applied for membership of the UK
Independence party. No doubt the party will want to sleep on it.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Rail signalmen's seven-year itch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threatened paralysis of Britain's rail network by striking signalmen
later this month has been provoked by an issue that has gone unresolved for
seven years.
It suggests that British Rail's new structure has a long way to go to clear
the industrial relations legacy of 45 years of public ownership.
The decisive four-to-one vote by signalmen for industrial action suggests
that their discontent is much deeper than management had thought.
In an 80 per cent turnout 2,351 backed disruption and only 566 opposed. But
nearly 1,000 signalmen were not ballotted because they have left the RMT
rail union.
Yesterday Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, the state-owned company set
up in April to run British Rail's track and signalling after privatisation,
said he hoped for 'a meeting of minds' before June 15, the date set for the
first one-day strike. A second 24-hour stoppage is planned for June 22 and
more could follow.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, has called for an urgent
meeting with Railtrack to deal with the signalmen's grievances. It is
expected within days.
The signalmen are demanding an 11 per cent interim pay rise even before
agreeing to enter negotiations over the restructuring of their pay system,
first suggested in 1987.
The union's demand for such a high wage increase may seem absurd in the
present climate, with annual earnings settlements inching up to only about
2.5 per cent. The RMT says, however, that the signalmen have a special case.
The union sent the signalmen's pay claim to the British Railways Board -
responsibility for signalling moved to Railtrack on April 1 - in early
February. It argued that the workers had agreed to the introduction of new
equipment, had accepted extra responsibilities and cuts in the numbers
employed on signalling work, but had not secured any improvement in their
pay.
Their claim accused management of wanting 'improved productivity on the
cheap', adding that the signalmen had had 'to endure a steady erosion of
their status and differentials in comparison to other grades'.
The union argues that signalmen have to work an average 52-hour week to
approach a reasonable level of earnings. It points to the erosion of pay
differentials relative to other rail workers, including drivers and station
staff, while a big earnings gap - of between Pounds 29 and Pounds 51 a week
 -has opened up with London Underground signalmen.
The RMT said: 'If the board concedes the interim payment, foundations can be
laid for constructive discussions on restructuring, whilst at the same time
a message will be sent to signalling staff that the board is serious about
addressing our longstanding grievance.'
It added: 'If this course of action is not taken, then the union is of the
strong view that obtaining the agreement on restructuring that both the
board and Railtrack want will be a difficult, if not impossible, task.'
Railtrack has made some moves to improve the signalmen's position. On April
8 the newly-created company agreed to simplify signalmen grades, enabling
some to receive rises of between Pounds 10.75 and Pounds 11.45 a week. All
other staff on signalling grades were offered immediate payments of Pounds
100.
Railtrack said: 'All we asked the union to do was to start talks on
restructuring and for the minority of signalling staff still paid in cash to
move to bank credit transfer.'
The company says that no one wants industrial action and there must be
negotiation. It wants to see the planned pay restructuring exercise
completed by September 30.
A new joint industry pension scheme is due to start in October and Railtrack
has told its employees that 'to get the full benefits of that scheme we must
agree basic pay rates before October. That needs co-operation on all sides'.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Lib Dems accuse BBC of imbalance: European Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday accused the BBC of abandoning its legal
obligation to give balanced coverage to political parties during the
European election campaign. Mr Matthew Taylor, the party's campaign
chairman, said in a letter to Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, that the
corporation was 'slavishly following' an agenda set by Labour.
Mr Taylor said 52 per cent of BBC television political coverage had been
devoted to Labour since the party manifestos were launched on May 23,
compared with 34 per cent for the Tories and 14 per cent for the Liberal
Democrats.
He also accused Mr Birt of failing to respond to a Liberal Democrat call for
equal treatment which was made two days after the campaign started.
Liberal Democrat strategists believe there are two main reasons for the
imbalance:
Coverage of the Labour leadership election has not been kept separate from
coverage of the campaign.
Much of the coverage of the Conservative campaign, especially in the early
stages, included speculation about the impact on Mr John Major's hold on
Downing Street.
The Liberal Democrats say that the main television news broadcasts have also
given an unfair advantage to Labour on policy issues. In particular, a long
report on Labour's Social Justice Commission is said to have mentioned the
Labour party several times without the usual balancing responses from other
parties.
Liberal Democrat officials acknowledge that the party frequently complains
about television coverage during elections. However, they say the distortion
is worse than in any previous campaign.
They are also incensed by the BBC's failure to respond to the party's
initial complaint, adding that a similar complaint to Independent Television
News was followed quickly by 'satisfactory' talks.
Broadcasting organisations are required by law to ensure 'balanced' coverage
during election campaigns.
The BBC said that Mr Birt had been unable to respond to the Liberal
Democrats' first letter because he was away from the office when it arrived.
The corporation said the director-general had seen both letters and would
respond in due course.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Blair scorns talk of uncontested anointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, KEVIN BROWN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday moved to defuse shadow cabinet tension over the
Labour leadership by rejecting any suggestion that other candidates should
drop out of the race to succeed John Smith.
Those potential contenders reserved their position until after the June 9
European elections. However, last night Mr John Prescott, shadow employment
secretary, said he thought there should be a contest. Speaking on BBC
television he said an election was 'an essential part of the democratic
process'.
It is understood that Mr Blair, who last night combined a blistering attack
on the record of the Conservative government with a strong re-affirmation of
his own political philosophy, would welcome such a move. Mr Blair's
supporters believe he is now assured of the leadership  - but the shadow
home secretary thinks a contest would bring benefit for the party and his
own position.
Friends insisted the decision by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, to
stand aside from the race had not been calculated by the two political
allies to lead to Mr Blair's 'anointment' as leader. Instead Mr Blair was
keen that one or more of the other contenders should stand to ensure the
widest possible debate about the direction of the party.
A contest would allow Mr Blair to spell out in detail the central policy
platforms on which he would like Labour to fight the next general election
and would allow him to establish a clearer identity with the electorate.
Mr Blair's assurance came as leading figures on the left of the party
reacted angrily to suggestions from some union leaders that there was no
point in a formal contest. They insisted that, if the main contenders
dropped out, a backbencher - probably Mr Ken Livingstone, MP for Brent East
 -would win enough support to force at least a token contest.
Friends of Mr Prescott and Mr Cook said the two men were annoyed by the
timing of Mr Brown's announcement. There was also irritation at suggestions
that the shadow chancellor had been offered overall control of Labour's
economic and social policy. Mr Blair, however, made clear that other shadow
cabinet members would not be frozen out of policy debate in those areas.
Mr Blair used a speech on the campaign trail in Eastleigh, Hampshire, to
attack the Conservatives for 15 years of failure. He said the Britain
created by the Tories was one 'weakened by recession, corroded by crime,
scarred by urban squalor'. He added: 'The evidence of social disintegration
lies all around us.' He said Labour had become the party of government in
many southern councils and made clear that he aimed to widen the party's
appeal beyond the north and its inner-city strongholds.
While appealing to the political centre with his claim that Labour was the
party of 'one nation', he also underlined Labour's commitment to its
principles and the values of the public sector. He said privatisation of the
railways would enable only a few to make a profit at the expense of many.
Mr Blair significantly declined to mention the Liberal Democrats, who are
widely expected to win the Eastleigh by-election next week.

FT  03 JUN 94 / McAlpine attacks Major's campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's handling of the European election campaign was bitterly
attacked yesterday by Lord McAlpine, who was Conservative party treasurer
during Baroness Thatcher's premiership.
However, Mr Major's concept of a multi-speed Europe was given full backing
by Mr Michael Heseltine, a leading cabinet member of the Tory pro-European
wing.
Lord McAlpine, writing in The European newspaper, said Mr Major's criticism
of beggars would go down as a 'minor classic in the annals of political
nastiness'. The comments had been made to win votes, not because they were
sincerely believed.
'This is a form of politics that I detest,' he said. 'I consider myself to
be on the rightwing of British politics. These words uttered by a
Conservative leader fill me with shame at being a Conservative.'
Mr Heseltine said his view of the future of the European Union was 'exactly
the same' as that spelt out by Mr Major: 'You can be at the heart of Europe
 -and we should be at the heart of Europe - but the outcome of negotiations
can be multi-tiered and multi-speed.'
Mr Heseltine said the opposition parties were prepared to 'sign up to almost
any idea called Europe without checking the details'. He added: 'We believe
it is worth having a hassle over the details before you sign up to the
principle.'
His comments suggest that the party's pro-Europeans are likely to cloak
their distaste for the prime minister's Euro-sceptic rhetoric - intended to
encourage core Conservative supporters to vote - until after polling day on
Thursday.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told businessmen in Birmingham that the
government was seeking a 'decentralised, de-regulating and competitive
Europe'.

FT  03 JUN 94 / New Independent editor sought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A replacement is being sought for Mr Andreas Whittam Smith as editor of The
Independent, the loss-making national daily newspaper.
The search has begun, partly at least, because senior journalists at the
paper have been individually approaching the main shareholders warning that
editorial renewal will not be possible without changes at the top.
In an unprecedented move the journalists on the papers yesterday passed
overwhelmingly a motion of no confidence in the two main founders Mr Whittam
Smith and Mr Matthew Symonds.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Candidate for Smith seat picked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Helen Liddell, former secretary of the Scottish Labour party, was last
night chosen as candidate for the Monklands East by-election - the contest
caused by the death of party leader John Smith.
Mrs Liddell, 43, won on the first count at the constituency Labour party
meeting in Airdrie.
The final choice was made from a shortlist of three at a meeting where the
selection was made by one-person-one-vote - the first time this procedure
had been used in Scotland.

FT  03 JUN 94 / ERM exit blamed for Tory poll woes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic recovery has failed to revive the fortunes of the Conservative
party because of a collapse in the government's credibility after Black
Wednesday, according to research from Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank,
and the University of Strathclyde.
The research shows that on the basis of economic factors, were it not for
the political fall-out from sterling's departure from the European exchange
rate mechanism in September 1992, the government's opinion-poll rating would
be as high as 42 per cent. In fact, its standing is about 26 per cent.
In normal circumstances, economic conditions such as low inflation, falling
unemployment and low interest rates help the government's popularity.
However, Mr Peter Spencer and Mr John Curtice, the authors of the report,
say that 'contrary to the consensus view the beneficial effects of economic
recovery have already been reflected in the opinion polls'.
The report adds: 'All the indicators suggest that while the Conservatives'
reputation for economic management survived the recent recession well, it
has been destroyed by the debacle of sterling's leaving the ERM. In this,
there are uncanny parallels between Black Wednesday and the damage done to
Labour's reputation by the sterling crises of 1967 and 1976. On all three
occasions there was an immediate collapse in government popularity, which in
1967 and 1976 were eventually followed by electoral defeat.'
Kleinwort suggests that if the Tories were able to cut the basic rate of
income tax from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, this would improve their poll
rating by 7.5 percentage points.
The report concludes: 'What the government now needs is not an economic, but
a political recovery.'

FT  03 JUN 94 / Customs poses hospitality threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over-enthusiastic claims by companies for rebates of value added tax on
business entertainment expenses yesterday prompted Customs &amp; Excise to
threaten a clampdown on corporate hospitality.
Customs believes that goods or services bought for the purpose of business
entertainment should not be eligible for VAT refunds.
European and English law has long prevented VAT relief on pure business
hospitality, but it has left a grey area when it comes to other business
activities which include an element of entertainment.
In the light of a series of contradictory VAT tribunal and court judgments,
Customs said yesterday it would put all appeals on such cases on hold while
seeking guidance from the courts.
The problem started with Plant and Repair (South Wales), a small
Cardiff-based company, which tried to claim back as office expenses some of
the VAT on its costs for maintaining a box at Cardiff Arms Park, the rugby
stadium.
The company insisted it used the box primarily as an office and only
incidentally for entertaining clients at the weekend. The VAT tribunal was
unconvinced and forbade any rebate.
It took the same sceptical view of a rebate claim from Thorn-EMI, which
asked for its VAT back on some of the costs of running its chalet at the
Farnborough Airshow.
But the High Court upheld the company's claim in March, arguing that its
chalets were temporary offices and that it was possible to apportion its
expenses between business and entertainment costs.
Customs said yesterday it would appeal, while conceding in the meantime that
companies may claim back VAT on their non-entertainment costs.

FT  03 JUN 94 / US workers 'must share in decision-making'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sustained employee participation in decision-making is a critical factor in
increasing economic performance, a panel appointed by the Clinton
administration reported yesterday.
The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, chaired by
former labour secretary John Dunlop, spent a year on a comprehensive
examination of US labour-management relations.
In its 150-page report it found viable employee participation arrangements
were rare because the structure of US labour law, little changed since the
1930s, makes managers wary of changing traditional decision-making
hierarchies.
The commission found that 40m to 50m US workers would like to participate in
critical decisions on their job but have no opportunity to do so.
'Employee participation has grown and is designed to increase efficiency,
performance and quality,' Mr Dunlop said. '(But) the high performance
workplace may well be limited in the eyes of employers by our existing
statutory arrangements.'
The Commission also found that most sectors of American society support
workers' right to unionise and participate in collective bargaining.
The labour secretary, Mr Robert Reich, said business and government should
be alarmed by Commission findings on the growing income gap in the US,
currently the largest of any industrialised nation. Over time, this
increasing difference between rich and poor, and educated and uneducated,
would lead to a sharp erosion in both productivity and competitiveness.

FT  03 JUN 94 / North awaits decision on Senate race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Some 14,000 registered Republicans from the state of Virginia will decide
tomorrow afternoon if Mr Oliver North, of Iran-Contra notoriety, has any
kind of political future.
The probability, but not certainty, is that the party convention in Richmond
will nominate him to contest the seat to be defended by Senator Charles
Robb. This assumes the incumbent survives the Democratic primary on June 14
 -his two opponents have made much of his confessions of marital infidelity.
If Mr North and Mr Robb emerge as the candidates of the two established
parties, independent bids are likely to follow and make Virginia the most
fascinating, if least edifying, of all the national mid-term elections in
November.
Mr Doug Wilder, former Democratic governor, is poised to enter as an
independent, as, under prodding from Virginia's other senator, the
Republican Mr John Warner, may Mr Marshall Coleman. He is the former
Republican state attorney general beaten by Mr Robb for the governorship in
1981 and by Mr Wilder in 1989.
But all eyes this week are on Richmond and the convention's secret ballot
between Mr North and Mr James Miller, former budget director in the Reagan
administration. With fundamentalist Christian and right-wing support well
organised for Mr North, the staid and conservative Mr Miller, previously
little-known in the state, apparently faces an uphill battle.
However, national Republican strategists are nervous that the convention,
with predictable tub-thumping appeals to very conservative values, will be
seen as a state version of the party's convention in Houston in 1992. That
occasion did nothing for President George Bush's re-election prospects. But,
as one local political analyst put it: 'Oliver North is a bomb thrower and
the fundamentalists want a bomb thrower.'
Mr Miller is not without support from some famous conservative names,
including Mr Ronald Reagan, who has condemned Mr North for lying about what
the then-president knew during Iran-Contra. This was a scheme in the
mid-1980s to sell arms to Iran aimed at securing the release of US hostages
in Lebanon. Simultaneously funds were diverted to Contra rebels in Nicaragua
in defiance of Congress.
But nothing compares with the fury exhibited by Mr Warner at the prospect of
being joined in Washington by a man he considers unfit to hold public office
and to represent the Republican party.
Mr Warner is not only threatening to bolt from the party and campaign as an
independent when he runs for re-election in 1996, but is also urging Mr
Coleman to get into the senate race, if Mr North is the nominee.
Paradoxically, an evenly divided four-way contest might increase, rather
than diminish, Mr North's chances if he is on the November ballot. His
hardcore support seems very loyal, which is more than can be said for any of
the other prospects.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Leading indicators index stalls after rise in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US official index of leading indicators was flat in April, after a
strong 0.7 per cent gain in March, the Commerce Department reported
yesterday.
Separate figures showed new orders for manufactured goods fell 0.1 per cent
between March and April. On an annual comparison, however, orders were up a
robust 9.1 per cent.
The figures followed reports earlier this week of a modest decline in
consumer spending and home sales between March and April and a drop in the
Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence last month.
The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to conditions in manufacturing
industry - was flat in May.
Some analysts see the weaker tone of recent data as evidence that higher
short- and long-term interest rates are beginning to exert a downward pull
on growth.
The majority view, however, is that recent data reflect the natural
volatility of economic statistics rather than a weakening of economic
fundamentals. Economic series do not rise continuously even in strong
expansions.
Most forecasters believe the economy is still growing faster than the 2.5-3
per cent annual rate regarded as sustainable in the long term. Gross
domestic product is expected to grow faster this quarter than the 3 per cent
annual rate registered in the first three months.
Falling share prices and an increase in weekly claims for unemployment
insurance made the largest negative contributions to the leading index in
April.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Cuban economy 'set to recover next year': A senior economic
policymaker tells Stephen Fidler of plans to tackle island's money glut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba's economy will not return to growth until at least next year, and any
recovery will be modest, a leading Cuban economic policymaker says.
'It seems to me that this year the economy is still facing a very, very
difficult situation,' says Mr Osvaldo Martnez, president of the Economic
Commission of Cuba's National Assembly, 'but I expect that next year it will
be in a position to resume growth, though not in a spectacular manner.'
Mr Martnez, in London last week with a delegation from Cuba's National
Assembly, estimates that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Cuban
economy has shrunk by 30-35 per cent - lower than many external estimates.
The collapse - Cuba conducted 85 per cent of its commerce with the USSR and
its former east European satellites - was followed by a big drop in Cuban
trade. Exports from Cuba dropped from Dollars 8.1bn in 1989 to Dollars 1.7bn
in 1993, he says.
Mr Martnez says the main problem facing the government is the big overhang
of currency in the Cuban economy. A meeting of the National Assembly at the
start of this month, following consultations with 3.5m workers, has provided
the outline for tackling this issue, he says.
The government does not intend to apply shock therapy - 'the type of
neo-liberal policies as you see in Latin America. The task is to correct the
internal financial imbalance and not to kill the social cohesion'.
However, the government recognises that excess liquidity has had negative
effects on the economy. 'It hurts the discipline of work and the interest in
work. It hurts productivity and efficiency and contributes to the
development of the black market,' says Mr Martnez.
Excess liquidity was estimated at the start of last month at about 11bn
pesos - representing about 15 months of the population's earnings. (The peso
is not convertible, but it is officially set at about parity to the dollar.
The black market rate is around 100 to the dollar.) Some 60 per cent of this
monetary overhang was in the form of deposits in savings banks, and the rest
in cash.
This is being made worse by a continuing budget deficit. It was 5.2bn pesos
last year, and this year the government is aiming to reduce it by 24 per
cent, mainly by reducing inefficiency in and cutting subsidies to state
enterprises, he says.
The monetary overhang will be addressed in three ways. Policies would be
aimed at encouraging savings; raising prices and eliminating subsidies and
certain government gratuities, such as free water; and through the
introduction of wider taxation. At the moment, only a few thousand Cubans
pay income tax.
Price rises were announced last week, significant ones on products Mr
Martnez describes as non-essential goods, such as cigarettes, tobacco,
alcoholic beverages, and on petrol. Electricity prices will also go up, but
by how much will depend on what is consumed.
'We think that we need not less than 18 months to see the problem under
control,' though the first effects of the policy will be seen before that.
The aim, he says, is to 'restore the purchasing power of our national
currency'. After the problem of excess liquidity is resolved, the
possibility of making the peso convertible will be considered.
Asked about the crackdown on the rampant black market that also emerged from
the National Assembly meeting, Mr Martnez says: 'We are not thinking in
terms of an economic solution. The repression of the black market is not a
matter of an economic solution, it's a matter of elementary social justice.
'If we are asking Cuban workers to accept some sacrifices in order to
balance the excess of liquidity . . . it is necessary to act against the
black marketeers who make profits from the exploitation of the people.'
The economic solution to the black market 'is to increase the production and
efficiency of the economy,' he says.
Asked whether a further freeing of the agricultural sector - producers must
by law sell their produce to the government - is in prospect to increase
farm production, he says: 'We are not in a dogmatic position in this field
or any other field.' However, the 1980s experiment of peasant markets is
'not a real solution' but a source of 'speculation, high prices and
intermediaries'.
His prediction that the economy will improve is based on some improving
indicators. 'Foreign investment is going well in the conditions of the US
blockade' - a reference to the US embargo, which he estimates has cost the
Cuban economy Dollars 40bn since it was introduced in 1960. He says there
are no official figures for the size of foreign investment but cites
'academic estimates' of Dollars 500m. 'It's not a big figure but in the
conditions of the Cuban economy an important one.'
He says tourism is going well. Last year gross revenues were about Dollars
700m - with visitor numbers of around 700,000 - providing a net contribution
of Dollars 220m to the economy.
Oil exploration is on a rising trend, and national oil output rose last year
to 1.1m tonnes, from about 800,000 in 1992.
He does not expect electricity shortages, already leading to significant
power cuts, to get worse.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Toyota to send UK engines to Turkey
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota, the Japanese car maker, is to export engines from its UK plant at
Deeside, Clwyd, to a new car assembly plant in Turkey, which will begin
production in the autumn.
The supply of engines to the car plant at Adapazari, 100 miles east of
Istanbul, will mark the first time that Toyota has exported engines from the
Pounds 140m UK plant.
The Deeside engine facility began production in late 1992 and chiefly
supplies engines to Toyota's Pounds 700m UK car assembly plant at Burnaston,
near Derby.
Production of the Corolla small family car at Toyotasa, Toyota's joint
venture plant in Turkey, is due to start in September.
The Turkish company is owned 40 per cent by Toyota, 10 per cent by Mitsui,
the Japanese trading house, and 50 per cent by Sabanci, Turkey's second
largest industrial group.
Production is expected to total 2,000 in the final months this year rising
to around 20,000 next year. Toyota said the plant's short-term prospects
were uncertain, however, given the present sharp downturn in the Turkish new
car market.
Toyota's Turkish plant will have an eventual capacity to produce 100,000
cars a year with a significant share of the engines to be supplied from the
Toyota plant in north Wales.
The Deeside facility currently builds 1.6 litre petrol engines for Toyota's
Burnaston car plant, and supplies components - blocks and crankshafts - to
Toyota in Japan for 1.8 litre engines.
The Deeside plant produced 29,000 engines in 1993, but this is expected to
rise to around 70,000 this year.
In the six months to the end of March it exported 45,000 cylinder blocks and
crankshafts to Japan worth Pounds 2.5m.
Toyota said the Burnaston car plant had reached a production level of 400
cars a day or 100,000 cars a year, the planned full capacity in the first
stage of the project.
Output of the Carina large family car in the whole of 1994 would total
around 90,000 compared with production last year of 37,314. Around 75 per
cent of production would be exported to other markets in Europe.
Citroen, the French car maker, is investigating the possibility of
participating in a joint venture in Malaysia. One report quoted a company
official as saying that Citroen had put forward proposals to build diesel
engines for Malaysian-made Proton cars, Kieran Cooke adds from Kuala Lumpur.
Last month Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, visited
Citroen's factories in France.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Japan to step up Asian production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese companies plan to boost low-cost production in other Asian
countries next year, when their overall capital spending is expected to rise
for the first time in three years, according to a government survey released
yesterday.
Corporate Japan plans to increase total investment in plant and equipment by
1.1 per cent in the year to next March, according to a study of 1,615
companies by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
This is a sharp change from the 0.1 per cent investment decline forecast in
Miti's most recent survey of this type, published last October, and the
latest in a recent series of moderately bright economic indicators. Capital
investment fell by 8.7 per cent last year.
Direct investment in other Asian countries in the coming year will leap to
37.5 per cent of total foreign investment, up from 16.4 per cent in the
previous year, emphasising the Japanese focus on expansion in China and
south-east Asia.
Investment in new plant in other Asian countries is forecast to rise 26 per
cent, a spectacular turnround from last year's 2.6 per cent fall, according
to the Miti survey. Within this, manufacturing industry is forecast to
increase Asian investment outside Japan by 56.1 per cent.
The long-term shift of production out of Japan paused slightly during the
recession. But the Miti survey suggests it is now on the verge of a second
advance. This is a response to the yen's renewed strength in the past year
and reflects manufacturers' strategy of adding component plants to the
assembly lines they established in east Asia during the late 1980s.
This trend has prompted concern within Japan that its manufacturing industry
will be 'hollowed-out' by the shift of production abroad.
Japanese investment in China is now aimed at capitalising on the strong
growth of domestic demand, along with taking advantage of the country as a
low-cost production site for exports.
In areas outside Asia, improvement in corporate investment appears to be
patchy. Manufacturers expect to cut spending by 3.5 per cent across the
board this year, a less severe reduction than the 19.6 per cent cut last
year.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Dollars 100m joint venture to extend UK
network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nortel Matra Cellular, the mobile communications equipment joint venture
between Northern Telecom of Canada and Matra of France, has won a Dollars
100m (Pounds 66.6m) contract to extend One-2-One, the UK digital cellular
network launched last September.
The contract marks a significant advance for Nortel Matra, which makes its
cellular infrastructure in Paignton, England, and in France, as it seeks to
establish itself as a supplier to Europe's new digital cellular network
operators. Ericsson, the Swedish supplier, installed the first section of
One-2-One's network.
Nortel Matra said it won the contract because of its advanced 'smart
antenna' technology, giving its cellular base stations for One-2-One's
digital Personal Communications Network (PCN) system greater range than
those of other suppliers.
In 1990 Northern Telecom bought STC, one of the UK's largest telecoms
suppliers, and has used the UK as a base to expand into mainland Europe.
One-2-One, which now covers only the London region, aims to extend to the
UK's top 30 conurbations by 1996. With the launch in April of Hutchison
Microtel's Orange network, the UK has four cellular mobile operators.
Cellular operators in France and Germany will start building PCN networks
this year.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Waging a war for US business - Guy de
Jonquieres interviews Clinton's export policy 'general'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As befits the son of a career soldier who grew up with General Douglas
MacArthur's farewell address on the wall of his family home, Mr Jeffrey
Garten has a penchant for military metaphors. When he talks about his job,
his conversation is dotted with phrases like 'no first-strike policy',
'strategy' and 'war room'.
Mr Garten is not a Pentagon brass-hat, but the Clinton administration's
under secretary of commerce for international trade. However, the martial
imagery clearly fits with his convictions about the need for radical change
in US national priorities since the cold war ended.
In his writings and speeches - which he turns out prolifically and at great
length - he has pounded away at the theme that the overriding concern of
policy today is no longer defending national security but a remorseless
global battle for economic advantage.
As commander of the federal government's newly-refurbished export promotion
drive, he is in the frontline of that offensive. And he has powerful backing
from President Bill Clinton. Not only has Mr Clinton thrown much bigger
resources at export promotion, but he has proudly claimed credit for
pitching in to win a Dollars 6bn civil aircraft order from Saudi Arabia in
February.
'I would be very surprised if we did not have many more successes,' says Mr
Garten, a 47-year-old former investment banker who is widely acknowledged to
be one of the intellectual leading lights of the Clinton administration.
'In the past, export policy has been seen as a stepchild of the commerce
department. Nobody's thinking that any more. It's now embedded in our
perception that exports are what is going to make the US economy spin.'
But while the administration basks in the early results of its foreign sales
drive, they are provoking outrage abroad. The French government - itself no
mean export promoter - is still fuming at the Saudi deal. Disappointed
foreign bidders for a Dollars 4bn Saudi telecommunications contract, won by
American Telephone and Telegraph last month, allege it was rigged
politically in favour of the US company.
Mr Garten is unrepentant. He insists Washington is simply a late entrant in
a game long played by other governments, notably in Europe and Japan. If
they resent the US muscling in, they should not have started the ball
rolling. What is more, he says, the US aims to play very hard indeed.
With the blessing of the White House, export promotion has blossomed into an
administration-wide effort, co-ordinated at regular cabinet-level meetings
involving officials from the state department and other federal agencies.
It all comes down to growth and jobs. Pulling out a set of flip charts, Mr
Garten reels off figures showing how much exports have contributed to recent
increases in US gross national product and well-paid employment. 'We do not
have the great luxury of saying this job is good and that job is bad. The
first thing we want is high levels of employment.'
But how does the policy fit with the globalisation of business, as companies
increasingly source components and manufacture products worldwide? How can
Washington be sure that support for American companies will end up
benefiting workers in the US rather, than say, in Singapore?
Mr Garten insists his department vets every application for export
assistance to determine its contribution to the domestic economy. But he
admits that choosing between the relative merits of US-owned companies and
local subsidiaries of foreign groups can be tricky.
So far, he says, the problem has arisen less in export promotion than in
deciding whether foreign-owned subsidiaries should be eligible to
participate in the administration's sharply increased funding for research
and development in high-technology industries.
'This thing comes up all the time. We don't have the most consistent policy
right now. They're very difficult issues . . . and we know they're
important,' he says. Finding a solution is a high priority, he says, likely
to require international negotiations.
Washington's assertive championing of national business interests also sits
rather oddly with other aspects of its trade policy. Does it not, for
instance, risk devaluing indignant US assertions that Japan's domestic
market is rigged by politicians and bureaucrats in favour of national
producers?
'We certainly can't mortgage our entire international economic strategy to
perceptions of what we would like the Japanese to do,' he says.
And asked how he would field objections from, say, Sweden, that the US may
distort competition and discriminate against companies from smaller
countries whose governments pack less international punch, he replies: 'I
would say that you engage in subsidised financing . . . the Swedes are doing
it. I haven't measured it, but if any government came in and said it was
totally pure - first of all, if it's from Europe or Canada  - I would be
sceptical. You certainly couldn't expect US policy to be geared to the one
or two countries that possibly could be pure.'
If other governments really feel strongly about US tactics, he says, they
should agree to sit down and negotiate more effective ways of eliminating
export subsidies. Until that happens, the administration remains determined
to lobby hard for US companies and match the competition, subsidy for
subsidy, in bidding for contracts it really wants.
Mr Garten concedes that, in practice, budgetary constraints will compel the
administration to be selective about the projects it backs. Already, he
says, it is under pressure to improve the efficiency of its export promotion
effort before requesting more funds from Congress.
Furthermore, for all his enthusiasm about the mechanics of the effort and
the new resources at his disposal, he admits to more than a shade of doubt
about the value of the purpose they serve.
'Without question, no good is going to come out of this. It would be vastly
preferable to have a system where companies are competing on their quality
and reputation, not on the subsidised financing they get. We would prefer
not to play this game at all.'

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Cosmo to receive rights to Abu Dhabi oil
field

<TEXT>
Cosmo Oil, a Japanese oil wholesaler and distributor, is on the verge of
receiving exploration and development rights to a new oil field in Abu
Dhabi.
The Abu Dhabi authorities made the offer to Mr Yoshiro Nakayama, honorary
chairman of Cosmo Oil, when he visited the United Arab Emirates in April,
Cosmo said.
Japan accounts for about half of Abu Dhabi's total crude oil exports.
Negotiations are still underway, but if a deal is finalised it would help
Cosmo to take its long-term goal of expanding its Middle Eastern production
a step further.
It has been producing oil at the Mubarraz concession in Abu Dhabi since 1973
through a joint venture company with Japan Energy. However, output at
Mubarraz has been on the decline from a peak of 30,000 barrels per day in
1979 to about 15,000 b/d.
An award of new exploration and development rights in Abu Dhabi could
bolster Cosmo's financial performance. Exploration and production is where
profits are to be made, although Japanese oil companies have concentrated on
downstream operations, said Mr Nicholas Smith at Jardine Fleming.
Oil companies and the Japanese government have been keen to win development
rights in the Gulf to ensure a steady source of oil for the country, which
has few energy resources of its own.
Japan depends on the Middle East for 70 per cent of its oil imports.
But Japanese equity in international oil reserves accounts for only only 13
per cent of the country's total imports.
The Japanese government wants to raise this to about 30 per cent in the
medium term.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: European spinning set to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The west European spinning industry is set to suffer further sharp falls in
output as production shifts to the Far East, according to a report* by
Textiles Intelligence and the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The report predicts that spun yarn production in western Europe will fall to
2.3-2.6m tonnes by 2000, from a peak of 3.3m in 1987, in spite of
technological advances and improved yarn quality.
The industry's fastest growth will be in China, India and Pakistan, where
labour costs are low and raw cotton is locally available. Asian producers of
yarn will also benefit from the rapid growth in textile and clothing
manufacturing in the Far East.
Conversely, European spinners will face an ever-declining market for their
products, the report predicts, in a trend that will get worse as quotas are
liberalised under the new Gatt agreement. In the five years from 1987, only
Italy, which accounts for 30 per cent of European spun yarn production, and
Benelux maintained production levels. Other leading producers experienced
sharp falls in output, with UK production off by 30 per cent.
Cotton yarns are expected to be the hardest hit in Europe, with output set
to fall by a quarter between 1991 and 2000. Synthetic fibre yarns also face
sharp declines in output, of up to 18 per cent.

FT  03 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Brussels recommends trade benefits
overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday recommended an overhaul of trade benefits
for around 60 developing countries, with new incentives for improving
environmental and labour standards.
The guidelines are part of a review of the generalised system of preferences
which grants tariff advantages to developing countries to help them export
to the EU market.
The GSP review, which takes place every 10 years, is part of a wide-ranging
Brussels effort to update trade policy toward the developing world.
The Commission is waiting to hear views from EU ministers and the European
Parliament before it decides on how to apply the new GSP scheme to specific
countries and sectors. But the broad outlines of reform are already clear
ahead of the Commission's ambitious deadline of January 1 1995 for starting
the new scheme.
First, the Commission wants to offer extra trade benefits to encourage
countries to pursue sound environmental policies and follow international
labour agreements on the lines of the ILO convention. Brussels officials
argue that this amounts to 'positive' discrimination which should not
therefore arouse opposition from Gatt.
Mr Pierre Defraigne, senior Commission official in charge of North-South
relations, added that Brussels had deliberately underlined the link between
social and environmental policies and trade.
Second, the new guidelines are supposed to be simpler to manage. Starting
with Gatt's Most Favoured Nation status as a baseline, Brussels wants to
offer new flexible rates which will decline progressively from 50 per cent,
75 per cent and 100 per cent of MFN.
Third, the goal is to reduce the number of countries eligible for GSP, with
'super-competitors' such as fast-growing east Asian economies dropping out
of the running. The criteria for GSP eligibility will be per capital GDP and
the proportion of manufacturing for exports which directly competes with
European products in the EU market.
Fourth, the Commission wants to introduce a safeguard clause which will be
'very close to the Gatt safety clause', said Mr Defraigne. This would
operate against as yet unidentified 'sensitive' products.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Drugs revelations win Chuan a breather: Opposition disarray
that plays into hands of Thai PM's coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few Thais were astonished when the government let it be known two weeks ago
that 17 opposition politicians were suspected by the US of drug trafficking.
Thai politics is not for the squeamish, and the corruption and
unscrupulousness of many politicians have never been in doubt.
But the latest round of drug revelations - which obliged the US to confirm
that it had indeed blacklisted at least two opposition MPs already named in
public - was adroitly timed to give the fragile coalition government a
much-needed breathing space.
In March, the opposition had joined forces with the military-dominated
Senate and thrown out plans to make the constitution more democratic. Since
these reforms were among the main aims of the 20-month-old administration,
some government supporters believed Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister,
would be forced to dissolve parliament and call an election.
So far he has avoided a dissolution. Government MPs have put a brave face on
the defeat, saying that they can amend the opposition's own draft
constitution enough to reach a satisfactory compromise, and they have
simultaneously put the opposition on the defensive with a flurry of leaks
about drug trafficking and other misdemeanours.
Mr Thanong Siripreechapong, an MP for Chart Thai (Thai Nation), the largest
opposition party, was forced to resign after being accused of earning more
than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) by smuggling marijuana to the US. Another
Chart Thai MP was found by police at an illegal gambling den, and the usual
cover-up to protect his reputation failed to take place. Yet another
opposition MP who was refused entry to the US on suspicion of drug smuggling
tearfully declared his innocence in parliament and accused the government of
'a devilish and dirty tactic'.
Government MPs have denied any campaign to discredit the opposition by
leaking information on drug cases. 'I must deny it,' said Mr Akapol
Sorasuchart, a government MP in Bangkok from Mr Chuan's Democrat party. But
he added: 'The timing is on the government's side, we must admit.'
The publicity surrounding the scandals has infuriated Mr Banharn
Silapa-archa, who recently took over the leadership of the Chart Thai party
and is regarded as a possible future prime minister.
Mr Banharn is known as 'the mobile ATM' (automatic teller machine) because
of his generosity and his expertise in the traditional patronage-politics of
Thailand. He has good contacts in the armed forces and the bureaucracy.
Suphanburi, his constituency, boasts plenty of new roads and new schools and
is jokingly called Banharn-buri by Thais.
But the scandals have been a setback for Mr Banharn's efforts to promote the
opposition as a serious national alternative to the Chuan government, and he
has vowed to avenge the Chart Thai party with 'eye-for-eye, tooth-for-tooth
policies in dealing with the government'.
Mr Chuan, seen as the inheritor of the 'angel' mantle of those who fought
against the armed forces on the streets of Bangkok to restore democracy in
1992, is meanwhile under attack from the left as much as from the right.
By Thai standards the upper levels of this government are remarkably free of
corruption, but liberals are incensed that Mr Chuan has backed down on the
constitution - he at first wanted, among other aims, to reduce the size and
power of the appointed Senate - and has failed to spread democracy to local
government.
Mr Chalard Vorachat, a former Democrat MP, is staging a hunger strike
outside parliament in Bangkok and says he will fast to death unless the
constitution is thoroughly reformed. Mr Chuan can take little comfort from
the fact that right-wingers have set up food-laden tables near Mr Chalard's
tent and are mocking him by threatening to gorge themselves to death.
At least Mr Chuan does not fear an imminent coup d'etat in a country once
famous for them; the army's influence is declining. The prime minister and
his supporters say the civilian government has made a start in promoting
economic development in rural areas and is presiding over an economy growing
at a healthy 8 per cent annually.
But Mr Chuan's critics - including members of the Palang Dharma (Moral
Force) party that is one of the five parties in the coalition - are uneasy
about his willingness to compromise on the constitution and annoyed that he
has yet to make a decision on how to solve Bangkok's notorious transport
problems.
Negotiations on the constitution, conducted in a parliamentary committee
dominated by the opposition, are likely to drag on for two or more months.
There is also bound to be plenty of information about the dubious activities
of opposition MPs that has yet to be revealed.
Neither the government nor the opposition parties seem confident at present
about winning an election, although some political analysts believe MPs from
both sides are manoeuvring for an election in September or October - a scant
two years after the last one.
No elected government in Thailand has survived its full four-year term. Mr
Chuan would like his administration to be the first to do so, but it would
be hard to find a Thai politician prepared to bet any money on the idea.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Yemenis back peace call as war goes on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Feuding North and South Yemen yesterday endorsed the United Nations call for
a ceasefire in their month-old civil war, but continued to battle around the
southern stronghold of Aden.
Northern forces were reported to have taken the town of al-Hawtah, 21 miles
north of Aden, and then to have advanced at least four miles further south.
Battles were also raging on other fronts near Aden.
Forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh launched two missiles against
the port city at dawn. One exploded over the Sheikh Othman district,
wounding 20 worshippers at a mosque.
The north's carefully worded acceptance of the UN ceasefire call appeared to
be a gesture to world and particularly Arab opinion. But the Sanaa-based
government did not specifically say it would stop fighting.
Mr Abdul Rahman Ali Al-Jifri, vice-president of the breakaway south, earlier
condemned the northern missile attacks and appealed to the international
community to bring more pressure on the North Yemeni leadership to stop the
war.
He acknowledged the south's position was serious and that the next 24-36
hours would be crucial in its fight against the north.
The UN, meanwhile, named former Algerian foreign minister Lakhdar Brahimi as
special envoy to try to end the fighting. The Security Council resolution on
Wednesday called for an immediate ceasefire, an arms embargo on the warring
parties and despatch of a UN fact-finding mission.
The north had stepped up its drive against the south over the past week,
trying to achieve a military victory before international pressure can be
brought to end the war.
The sound of heavy explosions resounded through Aden yesterday, as southern
jets resumed bombing runs from the airport, attacking northern troops based
at Zinjibar, about 45 miles east of Aden.
Though bombed by northern jets nearly a month ago, Aden airport remains
operational for military aircraft and has provided the backbone of the
south's defence. Southern military officials said they still had air
superiority over the north.
Among civilian casualties, eight children were reported injured on Wednesday
after a bombing raid on Aden by two northern jets aiming at an oil pipeline.
The jets dropped Soviet-made bombs containing 30-40 smaller explosive
canisters.
Similar bombs loaded with nuts and bolts hit Aden a week ago, causing
extensive civilian injuries, western observers said.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Israel air raid kills up to 45 Hizbollah
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Israel yesterday launched its bloodiest air raid in seven years on guerrilla
targets in Lebanon, killing up to 45 members of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah
group in a dawn attack which provoked retaliatory rocket strikes from
Hizbollah fighters into northern Israel.
Lebanese officials said four Israeli jets and two helicopters launched the
raid on a mountainside Hizbollah training camp at Ain Kaoukaba in the
eastern Bekaa Valley. Lebanese troops had fought off 'an Israeli landing
attempt' near Baalbek, close by.
Long columns of Israeli tanks and artillery later began moving towards
Lebanon as Hizbollah fighters in south Lebanon fired at least 40 Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel and about two dozen into Israel's self-declared
'security zone' in south Lebanon, hitting buildings in the Israeli town of
Nahariyya.
The Lebanese government condemned the Israeli raid as a 'barbarian
aggression.' A statement called for a meeting of the United Nations Security
Council to discuss the attack. President Elias Hrawi called it a disaster
for Middle East peace hopes.
The raid came two weeks after Israel provoked anger in Beirut and Damascus
with a dawn raid deep into the Bekaa to abduct Mr Mustapha al-Dirani, an
Islamic militant suspected of having kidnapped Mr Ron Arad, an Israeli
airman missing in Lebanon since 1986.
Mr Faris Boueiz, Lebanon's foreign minister, said 45 Hizbollah 'martyrs' had
died in the raid. Hizbollah put the death toll at 30, but said the figure
was likely to rise.
The exchanges were the most serious since Israel launched artillery and air
attacks on towns in south Lebanon last July, after a spate of Hizbollah
rocket attacks. More than 120 people died in those raids, eight of them
Hizbollah militants.
Hizbollah said yesterday it would make a 'comprehensive response on all
levels' against Israel, threatening to increase fighting in south Lebanon
from the skirmishes which have continued between Israel, its proxy forces
and Hizbollah since last July.
Mr Mordechai Gur, Israel's deputy defence minister, asserted the raid was a
'pure and successful military strike'. He said the Hizbollah militants
killed had taken part in attacks on Israel or were training for future
strikes.
Raised tensions in south Lebanon will further strain peace talks between
Israel and Syria, whose leader, President Hafez al-Assad, has long used
Syrian influence on Hizbollah as an important card in his talks with the
Israelis.

   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Long-standing plans to build a Rs64bn (Pounds 1.3bn) integrated steel plant
near Calcutta, one of the country's largest investment projects, have been
thrown into doubt following the withdrawal of Caparo, the UK engineering
group, as principal promoter.
Mr Swraj Paul, Caparo chairman, said Indian economic reforms, though on the
right track, had not progressed far enough to 'attract industrial
investment' and regretted steel was not given the 'kind of priority it
deserves'. He blamed Indian state financial institutions for not committing
sufficient funds.
Caparo had been ready to invest Dollars 90m (Pounds 60m) in the equity of
Kalinga Steel, a company formed to implement the 1.5m-tonnes-a-year project
at Daitari in Orissa state, south-west of Calcutta. The Orissa government,
the joint promoter, was ready to contribute nearly Dollars 30m. Davy
International of the US , according to Mr Paul, had been prepared to put
Dollars 70m into Kalinga Steel but pulled out after failing to agree terms
with the Indian financial institutions.
According to Mr Paul, 'there is no way we can build a Rs64bn steel plant
without a debt:equity ratio of 3:1. But the Indian financial institutions
are insisting on a debt:equity ratio of 2:1' - although, he said, the higher
gearing had been approved by the Indian Foreign Investment Promotion Board.
Mr Biju Patnaik, chief minister of Orissa, said the land earlier allotted to
Kalinga Steel had now gone to Mesco, a diversified Indian business house, to
put up an export-oriented steel plant.

FT  03 JUN 94 / US steps up N Korea pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday vowed to press for United Nations sanctions against North
Korea, as a UN agency admitted it could no longer verify the Pyongyang
regime had not diverted nuclear materials for weapons purposes.
The move for economic sanctions gathered pace despite a call by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin for an international conference to make the Korean
peninsula nuclear-free instead of immediate steps to punish the North.
A senior official with President Bill Clinton in Rome said the US would
begin consultations with other members of the UN Security Council. But the
US could face problems in winning the backing of Russia and China, each of
which could veto sanctions.
Mr Clinton earlier blamed North Korea for the deepening crisis over its
refusal to co-operate with the UN International Atomic Energy Agency.
The Vienna-based IAEA said its inspectors could no longer give any assurance
that North Korea had not diverted plutonium from its 5MW nuclear reactor at
Yongbon to a nuclear weapons programme. This was because of North Korea's
recent unsupervised unloading of spent fuel rods from the reactor.
The IAEA said it was reporting this finding to the Security Council. Its
chief, Mr Hans Blix, is expected to fly to New York to brief the Security
Council, possibly today.
Mr Yeltsin's remarks, showing Russia's desire for more say in world affairs
but also echoing South Korean caution, were made at a news conference with
South Korea's visiting President Kim Young-sam. 'It is too early to talk
about sanctions,' Mr Yeltsin said. There should first be a meeting of North
and South Korea, Russia, the US, Japan and China.
North Korea, meanwhile, accused the US of using a U-2 spy plane to carry out
a survey of its coastline in preparation for an invasion.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Jobs priority at OECD and G7 meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With 35m unemployed in the industrial world, it is no surprise that jobs
will be topping the agenda of next week's annual ministerial meeting in
Paris of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the
economic summit of the Group of Seven nations in Naples in July.
Underpinning the discussions of ministers of finance, labour, trade and
foreign affairs from the 25 OECD member states next Tuesday and Wednesday
will be an in-depth study by the OECD secretariat, containing 57 detailed
recommendations, intended to form the basis of tailor-made policy programmes
for individual member states.
Virtually all OECD member states face unemployment problems of some sort,
which the OECD believes rest in an insufficient ability to adapt to a
fast-changing world economy.
The OECD study, two years in the making and to be published late next
Tuesday, puts the jobless problem in the context of globalisation and
technological change, forces which have undermined many traditional patterns
of work and overwhelmed many long-established responses to unemployment.
The paper's main recommendations are expected to detail how to:
Enhance creativity and diffuse technical know-how. The OECD believes its
members need to encourage high-wage jobs with high productivity, and that it
is more important for countries to diffuse new technologies than create
them.
Increase flexibility of working hours. The paper will stress many workers no
longer need to be pinned down to traditional working hours in office or
factory because new technology allows them to work from home. Many
households have two earners and not all workers want to work full time. But
the study will warn against governments imposing work sharing.
Encourage a more entrepreneurial climate in many member states. OECD
economists have been struck by the ease with which companies can be set up
in the US compared with parts of Europe.
Increase flexibility of wages and labour costs. Potentially, this is one of
the most contentious areas of the report. The US has created far more jobs
than Europe, but at the cost, critics say, of creating poverty in work for
the unskilled.
The OECD will focus on non-wage labour costs, such as employers' social
security payments, which are very high in many European countries which also
have inflexible wages.
It believes employment can be created in such countries if non-wage costs
are cut and the resulting gap in government finances plugged through other
taxes. But in the US, where wages are flexible and non-wage costs are low,
increased levies, to cover health-care for example, should not hit
employment.
Weaken employment protection legislation, which has the perverse effect of
discouraging job creation. This is a particular problem in some European
countries such as Spain, Ireland, France and Italy. Encourage active labour
market policies that link unemployment benefit with seeking a job or
training. The OECD is convinced paying people for doing nothing is damaging.
Improve the overall competence of labour. This goes beyond vocational
training to ensuring member states have suitable school curricula. Overhaul,
where necessary, the interaction of the labour market and social benefit
systems to ensure help is targeted where it is needed and benefits do not
act as a disincentive to job seeking and job creation.
The OECD paper will tell governments to maintain solid macroeconomic
policies based on low inflation, sound public finances and sufficient
savings to sustain investment.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Yeltsin seeks nuclear-free Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin, in another display of Russia's newly assertive
foreign policy, yesterday called for an international conference to make the
Korean peninsula nuclear-free before attempts to impose sanctions on North
Korea.
The Russian leader said that if such a conference failed to make North
Korea, a former ally of the old Soviet Union, comply with the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty it had signed, Russia and the world would have no
choice but to turn to sanctions.
'Today, when no decision has been taken to convene an international
conference, it is too early to talk about sanctions,' he told a joint news
conference with South Korea's visiting President Kim Young-sam. 'If it got
to the point where North Korea sought to undo the non-proliferation treaty,
Russia will be forced to gradually begin to solve the problem: first to
issue warnings (to North Korea) and then the world community must decide
whether to impose sanctions on North Korea.'
The crisis over North Korea's refusal to permit inspection of nuclear
facilities deepened yesterday as Pyongyang threatened to scrap previous
pledges and warned that sanctions against it could have devastating results.
But Mr Yeltsin said it was too early to talk of sanctions as long as a
conference gathering North and South Korea, Russia, the US, Japan and China
had not been convened. He said he would try to talk to President Bill
Clinton, now on a tour of Europe.
In Rome Mr Clinton said he would press for international economic sanctions
against North Korea if the International Atomic Energy Agency found
Pyongyang violated nuclear safeguards accords.
The IAEA wants to inspect spent fuel rods being removed from a reactor to
ensure the North has not diverted nuclear material for weapons purposes.

<TEXT>
Kenyan police charged a local businessman yesterday with cheating the
central bank of some 13bn shillings (Pounds 158m), the biggest fraud in
Kenya's history, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Prosecutors told Nairobi magistrate's court that Mr Kamlesh Pattni stole
from or defrauded the central bank on 36 occasions between April and
December 1993. Mr Pattni, 33, pleaded not guilty.
Mr Eliphas Riungu and Mr Lazarus Wairagu, who were sacked by the central
bank last December, were charged as accomplices. They also pleaded not
guilty.
Police said they would detain Mr Pattni until Monday when his plea for bail
would be heard. The case is unlikely to be heard for several months.
Economists said the figure was roughly equal to a sixth of Kenya's annual
gross domestic product and was the largest fraud charge since independence
from Britain in 1963.
It was not immediately known whether the charges were linked to Dollars 210m
(Pounds 140m) which Mr Micah Cheserem, central bank governor, has said was
lost in a forward foreign exchange contract with Mr Pattni's Exchange Bank.
Bankers says the alleged fraud was discovered last year when the
International Monetary Fund questioned why the central bank had two accounts
abroad.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Yemen's military forces, continuing to seek a military victory over
their southern opponents, yesterday launched missile attacks on Aden in
defiance of an overnight United Nations resolution calling for a ceasefire
in the month-old civil war.
Southern leaders, acknowledging the seriousness of the situation, repeated
their appeals for international help to end the fighting.
At dawn yesterday, hours after the UN issued its call for a ceasefire,
northern forces fired two missiles at the city.
One exploded over the Sheikh Othman district, wounding 20 worshippers at a
mosque, while the other was brought down by southern anti-missile barrages,
causing no injuries.
Mr Abdul Rahman Ali Al-Jifri, vice-president of the breakaway south,
condemned the attacks and appealed to the international community to bring
more pressure on the north Yemeni leadership to stop the war.
He acknowledged the south's position was serious and that the next 24-36
hours would be crucial in its fight against the north.
Northern military units continued their ground advance on Aden, capturing
the village of Sabir, about 8 miles from the outskirts of Aden. Other
northern units, advancing eastward from Tur Al-Baha, were also reported to
have arrived at Sabir and were poised for a final joint southward thrust to
Aden.
The sound of heavy explosions resounded through Aden as southern jets
resumed bombing runs from the airport, attacking northern troops based at
Zinjibar, about 45 miles east of Aden.
Though bombed by northern jets nearly a month ago, Aden airport remains
operational for military aircraft and has provided the backbone of the
south's defence since hostilities began on April 27. Southern military
officials said they still had air superiority over the north.
The northern leadership has stepped up its drive against the south during
the past week, aiming to achieve a military victory before international
pressure can be brought to end the war.
Apart from increased attacks on the military front, northern forces have
also struck at civilian targets. Eight children were reported injured on
Wednesday after a bombing raid on Aden by two northern jets aiming at an oil
pipeline.
The jets dropped Soviet-made bombs containing 30-40 smaller explosive
canisters. Similar bombs loaded with nuts and bolts hit Aden a week ago,
causing extensive civilian injuries, western observers said.

<TEXT>
Taiwan's top government watchdog impeached eight generals yesterday for
allegedly wasting taxpayers' money in an arms scandal involving upgrading of
32 anti-submarine aircraft, Reuter reports from Taipei.
One four-star general, two three-star generals, two major-generals and three
lieutenant-generals formed the largest group of military officials ever
impeached by the watchdog, the Control Yuan. The eight, who included Gen Kuo
Ju-lin and Gen Chen Hsing-ling, former air force commanders-in-chief, were
impeached because 'the upgrading of S2T propeller planes lacked thorough
planning and the negotiated price did not meet regulations', an official
said.
'Delivery was delayed but there was no stipulation in the agreement for any
penalty. Payment was made even before the upgrading was completed, wasting
taxpayers' money and delaying upgrading of combat capability.'
The Committee on the Discipline of Public Functionaries will decide what
action to take against the generals. They could be dismissed if still in
office but will not face criminal proceedings unless prosecutors decide on
an inquiry. The impeachment could stop Gen Kuo, 73, a national policy
adviser to President Lee Teng-hui, and Gen Chen, 69, a strategic adviser to
the president, returning to office.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Serbs learn to come to terms with sanctions: The United
Nations trade ban has hurt but not changed many minds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Serbia's leaders are in buoyant mood; the governor of the rump Yugoslavia's
central bank says oil coming into the republic is being held up more by its
own customs officials seeking tariffs on petrol imports than by any
international officials policing sanctions; and President Slobodan Milosevic
brags that Serbia could survive sanctions for a millennium.
It is not all nationalistic blather. There are some statistics around that
give it substance. Hyperinflation appears to have been defeated, industrial
production is bottoming out and, on the ground, businessmen and
entrepreneurs are telling stories about how they have little trouble, though
some additional expense, exporting their wares.
'I have to pay DM3,000 (1,200) to the Bulgarian police and DM6,000 to
international inspectors from the CSCE (Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe) or the UN on the border,' says Mr Miodrag Nikolic,
owner of Feman, an electrical and machine tools company in Jagodina, central
Serbia. 'But one lorry-load is worth half a million so it does not add too
much to the price.'
Mr Nikolic says his small business has actually benefited from sanctions,
gaining access to markets usually reserved for Serbia's huge state
companies.
'It sounds funny but sanctions gave us a chance to export,' he says of his
company which in April had a turnover of DM850,000.
Sanctions have even helped Feman seize control of the market in Macedonia,
Serbia's small southern neighbour, which finds tools from western European,
or even Slovenia, expensive, says Mr Nikolic. 'Our prices are 45 per cent
below even after sanctions.'
Sanctions were imposed on the rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) two
years ago because of the Serbs' role in the bloody partition of Bosnia.
'Trade takes place but exports are 20 per cent cheaper and imports 20 per
cent more expensive,' says Mr Ljubomir Madzar, professor of economics at
Belgrade University.
For some companies, however, the sanctions have not been so benign. 'We
cannot smuggle out living room sets,' says Mr Slobodan Stojanovic, director
of foreign trade for Simpo, once a Balkan giant in the furniture industry.
'The only way we have managed to keep our old partners', says Mr Vlastimir
Kostic, representative of Metalprogres, a small socially-owned company which
makes tools, 'is by selling to them at the lowest price.
'Our customers who risked trading with us during sanctions will be rewarded
when they are lifted. We have made sacrifices in order to keep our
customers,' who he says are from Italy and Egypt.
Mr Kostic says production costs are up 30 per cent as a result of sanctions.
'In the long term sanctions have hurt us, making our goods non-competitive.'
It is difficult to gauge the broader economic effects of the sanctions. The
official figure is that they have cost the two rump Yugoslav states Dollars
45bn (Pounds 30bn).
Industrial production has fallen to a third of its level in 1990. Factories
are operating at below half capacity. Per capita gross national product has
fallen to less than Dollars 1,000 from Dollars 2,148. Unemployment is
running as high as 50 per cent if you include the hundreds of thousands of
workers sent on 'forced holidays' over the past two years.
However, Mr Madzar points out that sanctions alone cannot account for this.
He cites the break-up of Yugoslavia, the interruption of trade and transport
links among the country's former republics, the collapse of the socialist
system, the cost of war, hyperinflation and 'horrible' mistakes in economic
policies.
There are, however, some signs of tentative improvement. While industrial
production remains far below the pre-sanctions level, it has grown over the
past four months, It rose by 3 per cent in April compared with March, though
this followed a 24 per cent rise over the previous month, according to
official statistics.
Mr Ivan Vujacic, a Belgrade economist, says industrial growth can be
expected in the aftermath of hyperinflation, but says it would be impossible
to sustain an increase in production while sanctions are still in force.
Meanwhile, Serbian officials say this year's harvest will be good. The
republic has traditionally been self-sufficient in food, exporting wheat,
meat, fruits and vegetables.
The central bank governor, Mr Dragoslav Avramovic, architect of the economic
programme that overnight in January brought inflation from 300m per cent to
zero, says sanctions are no longer of crucial importance for Yugoslavia.
President Milosevic thinks the economic situation has improved so much that
he is no longer in a hurry to reach an agreement on Bosnia. Previously, he
has appeared anxious to get an agreement in order to secure the lifting of
sanctions.
Indeed, western diplomats based in Belgrade say that they have never seen
the Serbian leadership so self-confident since sanctions were imposed.
'If the goal was to punish Serbia, the target was hit,' says Mr Predrag
Simic, director of the Belgrade Institute of International Politics and
Economics. 'But it was missed if the aim was to push the voters in Serbia
towards a change.'
In the distorted political climate of Serbia, the reason for sanctions is
unclear to most people. According to a recent poll in Nin, a Belgrade
newsweekly, 42.5 per cent of the Serbian population does not know why
sanctions were imposed or how they can be lifted. The next largest group,
19.5 per cent, is convinced that 'nothing can be done because the world
hates us'.
Mr Simic says people have adjusted to a drop in their living standards,
blaming the west instead of the Belgrade leadership. In fact, nine out of 10
people, according to the survey in Nin, feel hardest hit by the ban on
international sports competition rather than the economic situation. The
severing of cultural, sports, and educational links have devastated Serbian
society. Tens of thousands of educated people have emigrated in search of
future prospects.
Meanwhile, Serbia's geographical position undermines the sanctions. Despite
its status as an international pariah, last month, Mr Milosevic was received
in Romania with all the honours traditionally reserved for a head of state.
'Sanctions cost our neighbours. Even the rich countries do not have money to
compensate these states. So the cheapest thing to do is lift sanctions,'
says Mr Avramovic.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations yesterday called off crucial talks in Geneva between the
warring Bosnian factions after the Bosnian Serbs failed to withdraw forces
from the safe haven around the eastern town of Gorazde.
Bosnia's Moslem leaders have refused to attend the talks until this
condition is met, and the UN accepted their contention that the Serbs had
reneged on promises to comply. Despite the setback, the powers involved in
talks on Bosnia signalled their continued determination to bring the parties
to the table.
The French government announced that representatives of the 'contact group'
on Bosnia, which includes the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, hoped
to convene tomorrow, two days earlier than planned.
UN officials said there was a slim chance that talks between the warring
parties could begin today, but only if the Bosnian Serbs fulfilled a pledge
to remove all armed personnel, military and civilian, from the 3km exclusion
zone around Gorazde.
Some 150-200 Serb militia and para-military police, as well as some armed
civilians, remain in the zone to 'protect' Serb civilians, in contravention
of a UN agreement.
The Bosnian Moslems accuse the Serbs of blurring the distinction between
soldiers and civilians, with some fighters donning civilian clothes and
posing as 'refugees' resettling the area.
Dr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said on Wednesday that all armed
personnel would leave Gorazde immediately. But yesterday afternoon the UN
reported there had been 'no movement' and senior Bosnian government
representatives remained in Sarajevo.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of UN operations in former Yugoslavia, who had hoped
to negotiate a four-month cessation of hostilities across Bosnia, had no
choice but to abandon yesterday's talks.
The deadlock between the Bosnian parties cast a shadow over the
international negotiations planned for tomorrow in Geneva.
These talks, under the auspices of the five-nation contact group, are aimed
at securing a two-way split of Bosnia between the Bosnian Serbs and the
newly-formed Croat-Moslem federation.
Dr Karadzic and other members of the Bosnian Serb delegation arrived in
Geneva yesterday, as did Mr Kresimir Zubak, the Bosnian Croat leader who was
this week elected interim president of the new federation.
There has been some confusion over the relative seniority of Mr Zubak and
the Bosnian government headed by Mr Alija Izetbegovic.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Kravchuk defied over election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ukrainian parliament yesterday voted to proceed with presidential
elections, over-riding proposals for a postponement from the incumbent, Mr
Leonid Kravchuk.
Mr Kravchuk, one of seven candidates registered for the June 26 poll, had
asked parliament to delay elections pending a clear definition of the
consitutional powers of the president, prime minister and government. But in
the past few days he seems to have resigned himself to his fate.
He virtually abandoned his attempt to cancel the election less than a month
away and has reluctantly relaunched his campaign. Before the vote, he
softened his plea to deputies, saying: 'I believe the election must take
place. But it must take place only when supported by a legal basis. If
parliament wants Ukraine to remain independent and democratic, it must take
reponsibility to prepare these documents by June 26.'
Deputies voted 201-69 in favour of a resolution which said postponing the
election was impractical as the campaign was already well under way. The
resolution called for parliamentary committees to set down the powers of
state institutions within 10 days.
The vote against Mr Kravchuk's proposal represents a rare consensus in the
Kiev assembly. The recently elected parliament, deeply divided between
Russia-oriented leftists and Europe-leaning nationalists, is barely able to
sit in the same room together while it waits for a third of its ranks to be
elected. Kiev is threatened by separatism in its Russian-dominated Crimea
region and an unresolved dispute with Russia on dividing the Black Sea
fleet.
Mr Kravchuk's antics over the presidential election have added to the
confusion. First he made 'a final decision not to run' and floated a plan to
cancel the election and rule by decree. Badly received, the plan was ditched
for an alternative strategy: registering as a candidate, but launching a
campaign of persuasion to postpone the elections.
Mr Kravchuk's repeated appeals arguing further elections would bring about a
'vacuum of power' fell on deaf ears. While his control over the nation's
media failed to earn him support, he took his postponement message to
Ukraine's regions, cutting deals with local bosses. But his competitors,
seeing Mr Kravchuk trails in polls in most of Ukraine, set up a momentum
toward proceeding with the presidential elections.

Moscow's mayor, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, yesterday stepped up his campaign against
Russia's privatisation drive, accusing Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime
minister in charge of privatisation, of leading the economy into a dead-end.
He said Mr Chubais should take responsibility for the fact that Russians had
lost confidence in privatisation vouchers, distributed in 1992. Long an
opponent of large-scale privatisation, the mayor restricted land and
property sales in the capital earlier this year and banned the registration
of joint stock companies if they were formed from state-owned enterprises.
Mr Luzhkov said the state privatisation committee was simply creating
conditions for speculators to buy up state property cheaply and sell it
later for higher prices. 'We support the market economy and privatisation.
But we do not want state property to be sold off for almost nothing. We
wanted to create a class of owner-producers in Russia. But everything has
been bought up by speculators,' he said. Mr Chubais responded by vowing to
take legal action against Mr Luzhkov, accusing him of prompting a social
explosion by violating existing laws.

Norway cleared the way for future oil prospecting off its southern coast
yesterday despite strong opposition from neighbouring Sweden. The Labour
government won a deal with the opposition to allow exploration in the
Skagerrak strait, but agreed to make further environmental studies before
starting drilling. The opposition Conservative party backed the plan in
return for a government promise to review controversial rules allowing the
state to raise its stake in profitable oil and gas fields. The new
exploration areas will open up 16 per cent more of Norway's continental
shelf for prospecting, making it possible to drill under 56 per cent of the
waters off the coast. Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer,
currently pumps some 2.5m barrels a day, mostly from the North Sea. Output,
however, is expected to fall in few years unless new discoveries are made.
Sweden, fearing pollution from oil prospecting in the waters between itself,
Norway and Denmark, has requested inter-government talks before a decision
is made. Norway's state pollution board has sharply criticised previous
studies of the consequences of opening Skagerrak and areas off mid-Norway
for exploration, calling them inadequate.

Environment ministers from east European countries meeting in Copenhagen
yesterday called on the international development banks to provide them with
soft loans for environmental investments. The conference, called by the
Danish minister, Mr Svend Auken, to give the east Europeans a chance to put
their views to the banks, was attended by ministers from 16 east European
countries and by representatives from the World Bank, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the Nordic Investment Bank and the European
Commission.
The east European governments made clear at a conference last year on the
environmental condition of the Baltic Sea that they would not be able to
make environmental investments unless loans were granted on especially
favourable terms. Clearing up the most serious sources of pollution in the
Baltic would require at least Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn), according to Mr
Auken: 'It is impossible to find financing of this order without changes in
the rules of the game.' The development banks have insisted so far that all
loans to east Europe, including environment loans, must be based on 'sound
banking principles'.

Greek interbank interest rates fell sharply yesterday as financial markets
stabilised after almost three weeks of turbulence. The overnight borrowing
rate dropped to 35 per cent, while the three-month interbank rate came down
to 40 per cent. Dealers said a squeeze on liquidity in the banking system,
which kept short-term interest rates at over 100 per cent last week, had
eased. The government succeeded in raising Dr450bn (Pounds 1.2bn) needed
this month to finance the public debt through sales of treasury bills at
interest of up to 27 per cent and Ecu- and US dollar-linked bonds. But
interest rates on government bonds are expected to remain at record levels
as next month's borrowing requirement will also be higher than usual.
The drachma declined yesterday against the D-Mark, closing at Dr149.45, down
from Dr149.15 on Wednesday. Mr Yannos Papantoniou, economy minister, said
the currency was no longer threatened with devaluation. Economists said it
would depreciate at a faster rate against other EU currencies over the next
few weeks.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Plea for EU to guard against over-regulation: Questions on
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Percy Barnevik, 53, has been chief executive of the Swedish-Swiss
international engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri since 1988. He was
previously chief executive of Sweden's Asea. Q: Where should the European
Union place its top priorities in economic and social policy?
A: Priority No 1 is to resist the temptation to over-regulate. Instead, the
EU should continue creating conditions for the free play of market forces.
This includes the fight against protectionism - particularly involving
central and eastern Europe, which badly needs to increase trade. It also
includes the completion of the single market and initiatives for joint
public and private transeuropean networks in the transport, energy and
telecommunications sectors to lead European economies out of the present
recession.
Q: Do you believe the European parliament should be given greater powers?
A: I am a great believer in parliamentary control of governments and
therefore favour giving the European parliament the means to exercise this
control. However, I realise the parliament's power has been increased
through the Maastricht treaty, so we must now guard against too much
bureaucracy which could paralyse the European legislation process.
Q: What is the earliest date at which EU membership by former communist
countries might be practicable?
A: We must allow no delays for the target year of 2000 for the EU membership
of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
Q: Has the single market expanded your business opportunities throughout
Europe?
A: The single market has clearly started to expand business opportunities
through the liberalisation of public procurement and facilitation of
cross-border traffic. There is, of course, no guarantee for entrepreneurial
success - all these measures have increased competition and thereby tend to
decrease margins. . . . to be a winner you have to be even leaner, more
efficient and attractive to the customers. The losers will be the ones who
cling to remaining protection and who ask for government support.
Q: Does the choice of the next president to the European Commission matter
to you? Whom would you prefer to see in the job?
A: I would wish that the most capable candidate gets the job and not just
the politically most opportune one; for example, a 'lowest common
denominator' which sometimes happens when people cannot agree. Europe needs
a strong leader.

Unemployment in the European Union rose to a record 11 per cent in April
with some 18m people out of work, the European Commission's statistics
office, Eurostat, said yesterday. It was the first rise since December when
the seasonally-adjusted jobless rate rose to 10.9 per cent from 10.8 per
cent. The figure stood at 10.4 per cent in April last year. The largest
increases over the year were in Spain, where the jobless rate climbed from
21.3 per cent to 23.1 per cent. The only two countries to register a drop
were Britain, where the rate dipped from 10.3 per cent to 9.9 per cent, and
Ireland, where it slipped from 18.4 per cent to 17.9 per cent.
The Bank of France said it cut its intervention rate to 5.3 per cent from
5.4 per cent at a securities repurchase tender held yesterday to allocate
funds for injection into the money market today. Italian money supply as
measured by M2 grew an average 8.1 per cent year-on-year in the three months
to end-April compared with the revised average growth figure of 7.6 per cent
in the three months to the end of March, the Bank of Italy said.
Italian total bank lending in lire fell by 4 per cent year-on-year in April
compared with a revised fall of 2.7 per cent in March, according to the
central bank.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Germany's FDP struggles to stay afloat: Former kingmakers
acknowledge their fate is tied to Kohl's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leadership of Germany's Free Democratic party, the junior partner in the
governing coalition, will today in Rostock begin its struggle to convince
disillusioned supporters the party is still worthy of being called the
'kingmakers' of the German political system.
The party, which made and broke ruling coalitions of the 1960s, 1970s and
1980s, is struggling to keep its head above the German electoral water. A
spate of recent opinion polls gives the FDP just about 5 per cent, the
minimum to secure representation in the Bundestag, or lower house.
Any successful outcome of this three-day congress depends on Mr Klaus
Kinkel, the foreign minister, who less than a year ago was elected chairman.
His task is to impose discipline on an unruly party which increasingly
realises, and fears, that its fate is tied to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union.
Mr Kinkel, a former civil servant and head of Germany's secret service who
joined the party only three years ago, has found it difficult to stamp his
authority on the party - unlike his predecessor, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
who still hovers in the background.
Earlier this year, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the party leader in North
Rhine-Westphalia and former economics minister who had to resign over a
scandal, suggested that the FDP ditch Mr Kinkel and name its own candidate
for chancellor.
The party rallied around Mr Kinkel. But the internal dissent has continued
largely because the FDP is losing a sense of what role 'liberalism' plays in
a party which has shared power for nearly 25 years. 'We see ourselves as
upholders of free-market values in the coalition, and of civil liberties,'
said one senior party official. Yet its ability to practise what it purports
to stand for has been increasingly undermined, particularly over the past
four years in power with the CDU.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the FDP economics minister, has been unable to gain
enough support for a plan to introduce deregulation, particularly in the
energy sector. His colleague Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the party's economic
spokesman, was this year forced to shelve his own plans for a revived 1994
federal budget in order to cut the deficit to DM70bn (Pounds 28bn).
The liberals have also disappointed the left wing of the party by having to
support the CDU's law and order campaign and possible powers for the police
to bug private homes. As a further affront, Mr Kinkel, despite much dissent,
secured enough backing - in the third and final ballot - for Mr Roman
Herzog, Mr Kohl's candidate as federal president. In doing so, the FDP
signed up to support the CDU and ruled out any possible future coalition
with the Social Democrats.
Last month's presidential election showed that, despite ideological
differences with the CDU, one principle binds the FDP together: the wish to
remain in power.
'If the truth be known, we are no longer the great king makers any more,' a
deputy said. 'We know our fate is now tied to Kohl. We are seen by the
electorate as part of the government. If the CDU goes up in the polls, it
can only do us good. We cannot jump ship now and move over to the SPD. By
backing Herzog, we backed the CDU in their bid for extending power after
next October.'
Yet the traditional liberals would probably argue that it is time the FDP
had a stint out of power in order to re-group and redefine their role in a
united Germany. 'We might be out for ever then,' one official quipped,
adding that this prospect alone might give the chance for Mr Kinkel to unite
the party and march behind the chancellor. But its disillusioned supporters
will need much persuading between now and October that the party deserves to
be returned to the Bundestag.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Outsiders hit by a strain of Euro-fever: Hugh Carnegy and
Ian Rodger find referendums in the air in applicant states - European
Elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro-election fever is definitely in the air in Austria, Finland, Norway and
Sweden, the four European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries whose
governments hope to join the European Union at the beginning of next year.
But these outsiders looking in at the elections to the European parliament
are only bit players, for the moment, in the story. Their attention,
instead, is firmly focused on the campaigns for the referendum votes to be
held in each of the four on whether to join the EU.
This is particularly so in Austria, where the referendum will be on June 12,
the same day as the EU parliamentary vote. The streets of Vienna, are decked
out with posters hoisted by the two sides in the fervent referendum contest.
The debate turns on issues vital to Austrians, such as the country's
neutrality, its environment and the survival of its mountain farmers. The
gap between the Yes and No camps has narrowed, with a poll earlier this week
showing Yes on 48 per cent, its lead cut to just two percentage points.
In the three Nordic countries, the referendums are not due until autumn.
Finland will vote on October 16, Sweden on November 13 and Norway on
November 28. In Sweden, the vote will be preceded by a general election on
September 13.
But in all three nations, the EU debate is already well under way.
Television and radio debates on the issue are frequent, newspapers are full
of the story and it is a subject of lively private discussion.
While the Efta countries are preoccupied with their own referendum
campaigns, the outcome of the European parliamentary elections could have an
influence on how those campaigns develop.
This has already happened in Austria, where the referendum date was
deliberately set to coincide with the parliamentary vote among existing
members. The country's mainstream political leaders, united in their desire
for a Yes vote, were concerned to make the conditions surrounding the
referendum as favourable as possible for a positive result.
That led them initially to choose to hold the referendum in June, so that
the issues involved would not become confused with those in a national
election that must be held later in the year.
They initially favoured June 19 or June 26, giving them as much time as
possible for passing the enabling legislation and rallying support to the
pro-Europe cause.
But it was felt that an unsavoury outcome to the European parliamentary
elections on June 12, such as the election of fascists to the Strasbourg
assembly, could put many Austrians off Europe entirely. So the referendum
was brought forward.
A similar fear among EU supporters of a boost to the No camp from the
European elections exists in the three northern countries, where most
government and opposition party leaderships are, as in Austria, in favour of
membership.
In Finland, the Yes campaign remains firmly in the lead - with latest polls
showing a margin of 46 per cent in favour to 25 per cent against, with the
balance undecided.
But in Sweden and in Norway, the No vote has sustained a significant lead
despite slipping somewhat after the applicant countries completed their
accession agreements with Brussels in March.
Latest polls in Sweden put the No camp ahead at 42 per cent, with the Yes
vote slipping since April to 31 per cent. In Norway, excluding undecided
voters, the No side is holding steady, with about 57 per cent support
against, 43 per cent for the Yes camp.
The worry for the social democratic and conservative leaderships in
Stockholm and Oslo is that the long-standing No ascendancy could be further
cemented if the European elections show extremists gaining strength - and a
blaze of publicity - in Strasbourg.
Equally, a low turnout would deepen the impression in the Nordic countries
that the existing citizens of the EU are less than enthusiastic about the
union - notwithstanding the FT opinion poll this week which showed a large
majority of EU voters in favour of entry by the Efta four.
These are unlikely to be decisive factors in themselves. In Finland, Norway
and Sweden, the debate about EU membership turns on more fundamental
questions about political and economic sovereignty.
But the problem for the Yes campaigns in all three countries is the lack of
momentum they have so far been able to generate. Having already got most of
the trade benefits of Union membership through the completion last year of
the European Economic Area agreement between Efta and the EU, the argument
for the long-term need to participate in the EU's political structures has
been undermined by the seemingly endless internal problems besetting the
Union.
No sooner had the Nordic and Austrian governments proclaimed the success of
their accession negotiations in March than their enthusiasm was punctured by
the row that followed in the EU over the distribution of voting rights in
Union decision-making after enlargement.
This was particularly painful for the right-centre Swedish government of Mr
Carl Bildt, which was put in the miserable position of having to explain the
stubborn resistance to change by its supposed close ally, the British
conservative government.
Mr Bildt and his Finnish and Norwegian counterparts, Mr Esko Aho and Mrs Gro
Harlem Brundtland, will be hoping the European elections will not throw up
any further hurdles in their already obstacle-strewn paths.
They will also be praying that on the same day the Austrians will vote Yes
to set the ball rolling in their direction.
So far, the No campaigns in the north have made little reference to Austria.
But if Austria rejects membership, parallels will undoubtedly quickly be
drawn between the four nations, with their small populations, their
traditions of independence and their tough farming conditions. 'Oh yes,'
exclaimed Ms Eva-Britt Svensson, leader of the Swedish 'No to the EU'
organisation this week. 'An Austrian No would be a big boost for us.'

The campaign in Denmark for the election to the European Parliament has
turned into a verbal punch-up between the prime minister, Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, leader of the Social Democratic party, and the pugnacious Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the Liberal party and the country's foreign
minister from 1982 to 1993.
The current slanging match is just a rehearsal for a more important
confrontation in the autumn, when a general election to the Folketing will
be held, and Uffe, as he is widely known, will be trying to unseat his
Social Democratic rival.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen has gone out on a limb by proposing that the country
should drop the 'opt-outs' from the Maastricht treaty, which Denmark
obtained by the Edinburgh agreement in December 1992 (they covered
participation in the final phase of Emu, the common defence programme,
common legal policies, and European citizenship).
The opt-outs were the essential element in a compromise which followed the
referendum defeat of the Maastricht treaty in the first Danish referendum on
June 2, 1992, and they enabled the government to put the treaty to a second
referendum on May 18 last year, when the voters finally endorsed the treaty.
The opt-out from the common defence programme, which means that Denmark
refuses to become a member of Western European Union, places Denmark in an
'absurd situation', argues Mr Ellemann-Jensen.
He urges a referendum now to enable Denmark, which is a member of Nato, to
join WEU, and accuses the government of a head-in-the-sand policy on
European security, reminiscent, he tells his audiences, of the 1930s, when
Denmark met the rise of Hitler by pursuing a policy of unarmed neutrality.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen's straight talking appears to be paying off. If the
opinion polls are any guide, the Liberal party may win 30 per cent or more
of the votes cast and four or five of Denmark's 16 seats in the Strasbourg
assembly, compared with the three seats they have in the present parliament.
A tough fight for second place is taking place between the Social Democrats,
who should retain the four seats they have now by winning about a quarter of
the votes cast (much less than the 37 per cent they won in the last general
election), and the Anti-European Alliance.
This consists of two non-party anti-European organisations, the People's
Movement Against the EU, represented with four MEPs in the present
parliament, which was founded in the aftermath of the 1972 referendum that
took Denmark into the EU, and the June Movement, named in memory of the June
2 defeat of the Maastricht treaty in 1992.
The anti-Europeans include members and supporters from all parts of the
political spectrum, but their leading candidates, law professor Ole Krarup
for the People's Movement and Mr Jens Peter Bonde, a current MEP, for the
June Movement, are well known left-wingers.
The most colourful candidate is, perhaps, Ms Lone Dybkjaer, fighting on
behalf of the coalition government's Radical Liberal party. She is a former
minister of the environment and present live-in companion of the prime
minister.

FT  03 JUN 94 / French and Belgian police search Paris HQ of Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French and Belgian police searched the Paris headquarters of Groupe
Schneider as part of a fraud investigation into Mr Didier
Pineau-Valencienne, the chairman of the French electrical engineering group
who has been held in a Brussels prison since last week, the company said
yesterday.
Schneider said it had co-operated with the search, which took place on
Wednesday and yesterday morning. The police, accompanied by two French
judicial officials, took accounting documents and correspondence from the
offices to assist in their investigation into Schneider's management of
Cofibel and Cofimines, two Belgian subsidiaries at the centre of the
invest-igation.
The search and the seizure of documents follows Wednesday's ruling by a
Brussels court to extend the detention of Mr Pineau-Valencienne and Mr
Valentino Foti, an Italian businessmen arrested as part of the same
investigation. Lawyers for both men said they would appeal against their
imprisonment, which could see them detained for up to a month. The appeal
will be heard within 15 days.
The continued detention of Mr Pineau-Valencienne prompted a sharp fall in
shares in the company, one of Europe's largest electrical engineering groups
with annual sales of about FFr56bn (Pounds 6.52bn).
The shares, which were suspended on Wednesday pending the announcement of
the court ruling, yesterday lost 5.5 per cent of their value, falling from
FFr390.5 to FFr368.9.
Industry observers in Paris said the detention of the Schneider chairman was
unsettling for investors. 'The subsidiaries involved are relatively small,
less than five per cent of the group's total assets,' said one analyst. 'But
the damage to the image of the company is much greater.'
The accusations facing Schneider centre on its treatment of Cofibel and
Cofimines and a bid to buy out minority share-holders in the two
subsidiaries which was launched in 1992. Belgian prosecutors claim there
were irregularities in the offer.
They claim that offshore companies and assets were concealed from regulators
and investors in the subsidiaries and believe that Schneider received more
than BFr3bn (Pounds 58m) at the expense of its Belgian subsidiaries between
1988 and 1992.
Belgian prosecutors are also examining the alleged non-payment of dividends
to all the subsidiaries' shareholders by the offshore companies.
Schneider denies the accusations and says it has not acted against the
interests of minority shareholders.

FT  03 JUN 94 / 29 killed in RAF helicopter crash: Disaster claims lives of
top Ulster security officials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's security effort in Northern Ireland suffered a heavy blow last
night when a helicopter containing senior policemen, army officers and civil
servants crashed on the west coast of Scotland.
The 29 victims, who included the top members of the Special Branch of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, were on their way from Belfast airport to
Inverness for sensitive discussions about security in the province.
The crash of the 51-foot Chinook transporter with twin rotors is likely to
prove a serious setback to the authorities' struggle against terrorism.
Apart from the four crew, 10 RUC men, nine army personnel and six civil
servants were killed.
While the incident prompted questions about possible sabotage, heavy fog and
poor visibility appeared to be the most likely cause of the crash. 'It seems
almost certain this helicopter hit some kind of steep terrain,' said Mr
David Learmount, a writer on aviation safety.
It is understood that the RAF's Chinooks have not been fitted with the
latest weather radar equipment, an optional extra that would cost several
hundred thousand dollars per machine.
The incident occurred near a lighthouse on the Mull of Kintyre, about 10
miles from the port of Campbeltown, shortly after 6pm. A local woman raised
the alarm after hearing a loud explosion and seeing a fireball.
Asked about the possibility of sabotage, Mr Ian Lang, the secretary of state
for Scotland, said on ITN's News at Ten: 'That's speculation at this stage.'
A senior Scottish policeman, Chief Constable Leslie Sharp, told reporters
later: 'At this time there are no reasons whatsoever to suspect that we are
dealing with anything other than a terribly tragic accident.' He said the
bodies of the four crew and 25 passengers had been taken to a temporary
mortuary in the town of Machrihanish.
The crash comes at a time when the British government is engaged in delicate
moves to bring about a ceasefire in Northern Ireland. The ability to wage
continued war against terrorism, in the event that peace moves fail, has
been vital to the government's credibility. One senior RUC man said: 'The
force is devastated. It seems the upper echelon of the special branch is
missing.' Up to 10 members of Special Branch were thought to have died.
In November 1986, 45 people were killed when a Chinook pitched into the sea
while ferrying oil rig workers back from a platform in the North Sea.
However, Mr Jack Satterfield, a spokesman for Boeing Helicopters, defended
the performance of the Chinook, a model which has been in service for 30
years and is used by about 20 countries. He said the Chinook had 'one of the
better safety records'.
The machine which crashed had recently been upgraded at the headquarters of
Boeing Helicopters. The RAF Chinook fleet is half-way through a
modernisation programme which is intended to prolong their working lives by
up to 20 years.

FT  03 JUN 94 / House price fall triggers Halifax warning on rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender, yesterday
reported the biggest monthly fall in house prices for 12 months and warned
the government not to damage the fragile housing market by raising interest
rates.
Halifax said UK house prices fell on average by 1.6 per cent during May,
compared with the previous month. It is the second month in succession that
the society has reported a price fall. In April, prices fell 0.3 per cent.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst with stockbroker UBS, said yesterday
he was halving his forecast for house price increases in 1994 from 7 per
cent to 3.5 per cent after the Halifax survey. 'This is a serious wobble on
the road to recovery,' said Mr Wriglesworth.
Halifax, which previously had forecast that house prices would rise on
average by 5 per cent this year, says it now expects smaller increases,
possibly of 2-3 per cent.
Tax increases which took effect in April and a rush to complete purchases
ahead of the ending of fixed price mortgages which caused a bunching of
sales earlier this year, were the most likely causes for the decline, it
said. The latest falls mean the average price of a home of Pounds 62,728 has
remained static over the previous 12 months. It is the first time since
August 1993 that the Halifax has not reported a year-on-year price rise.
Only three months ago, in February, Halifax reported a year-on-year increase
of 3.8 per cent, the highest annual increase since November 1989.
In a clear warning to the government, it said concern that inflation might
be returning, particularly asset price inflation, had been 'greatly
overblown'.
'Any moves to raise interest rates, tighten fiscal policy or mount a further
attack on housing market subsidies would risk destroying a very fragile
recovery.'
Signals from the housing market, however, remain mixed. Average prices for
new homes, for example, rose by 0.6 per cent last month, according to
Halifax.
Housebuilders, are estimated to have increased sales by 10-15 per cent
during the first five months of this year.
Halifax's latest survey also conflicts with a study by Nationwide, the
country's second largest building society, which reported on Wednesday that
house prices had risen by 1.4 per cent in May compared with the previous
month.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations director, warned: 'Recent indicators
of market activity have been mixed. The underlying strengthening of the
market which began in the spring of last year is likely to be maintained but
progress is steady rather than spectacular.'
The Council of Mortgage Lenders said the revised 1994 forecast for house
prices by Halifax was in line with its own assessment of the market.
Mr Wriglesworth, in spite of reducing his 1994 forecast, believed the market
would bounce back this month. Houses were the most affordable for many
years, and mortgage interest rates low, he said.

Prime minister John Major hardened the tone of his attacks on European
integration as a Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph suggested that the
Conservatives face disaster in Thursday's elections for the European
parliament.
It puts the Conservatives in third place behind the Liberal Democrats and
more than 30 percentage points behind Labour. It estimates support for the
Conservatives at just 21 per cent, compared with 21.5 per cent for the
Liberal Democrats, and 54 per cent for Labour.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Stocks stage recovery on bond rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds staged a recovery yesterday, giving a strong boost to
the London stock market.
Dealers reported cautious buying of long-dated gilts, where yields rose
close to 9 per cent earlier this week. However, some warned the recovery was
a technical correction after recent heavy selling.
Mr John Kendall, chief economist at Baring Brothers, said dealers' attitudes
had not shifted significantly. 'I think we have further to go before things
calm down,' he said.
The London stock market shrugged off its prolonged run of weak sessions
after the gilt rally and a stronger performance from stock index futures.
The FT-SE 100 index recorded its best daily gain for the year, closing at
2,980.8, a rise of 48.9.
In the gilts market the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose more than three
points to around 103 1/2 , to yield 8.41 per cent. The September contract of
the long gilt future traded on Liffe, the London futures and options
exchange, jumped more than two points to 100 11/16.

FT  03 JUN 94 / Bonds rally gives boost to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds staged a recovery yesterday, giving a strong boost to
the London stock market.
Dealers reported cautious investor buying of long-dated gilts, where yields
had risen close to 9 per cent earlier this week. However, some warned the
recovery was largely a technical correction after the market had been
heavily oversold in recent days.
'The recovery doesn't reflect a significant shift in people's attitudes,'
said Mr John Kendall, chief economist at Baring Brothers. 'I think we have
further to go before things calm down,' he cautioned.
Bond prices were also helped by short covering in the futures market where
traders squared their positions ahead of today's release of US May
employment figures.
The London stock market, helped by the gilt rally and a stronger performance
from stock index futures, shrugged off its prolonged run of weak sessions,
signalling to some fund managers that the near 5 per cent fall in share
prices over the past two weeks may have been over-done.
The FT-SE 100 index recorded its best daily gain for the year, closing at
2,980.8, a rise of 48.9. It was the biggest daily advance since December 29
when the FT-SE 100 jumped 49.7.
In the gilts market the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose more than three
points to around 103 1/2 , to yield 8.41 per cent. The September contract of
the long gilt future traded on Liffe, the London futures and options
exchange, jumped more than two points to 100.
Europe's other bond markets put on a patchy performance, but many traders
said the heavy selling of recent sessions had abated. They said a holiday in
many parts of Germany had calmed the German government bond market, which
has led recent declines.

FT  03 JUN 94 / VAT rebate claims for hospitality under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over-enthusiastic claims by companies for rebates of value added tax on
business entertainment expenses yesterday prompted HM Custom &amp; Excise to
threaten a clampdown on corporate hospitality.
Custom &amp; Excise believes that goods or services bought for the purpose of
business entertainment should not be eligible for VAT refunds, even if they
are also partly used for other more serious and sober business activities.
European and English law has long prevented VAT relief on pure business
hospitality, but it has left a grey area when it comes to other business
activities which include an element of entertainment.
In the light of a series of contradictory VAT tribunal and court judgments,
Customs said yesterday it would put all appeals on entertainment-related
cases on hold while seeking guidance from the courts.
The problem started with Plant and Repair (South Wales), a small
Cardiff-based company, which tried to claim back as office expenses some of
the VAT on its costs for maintaining a box at Cardiff Arms Park, the Welsh
national rugby stadium.
The company insisted it used the box primarily as an office and only
incidentally for entertaining clients at the weekend. The VAT tribunal was
unconvinced and forbade any rebate.
It took the same sceptical view of a rebate claim from Thorn-EMI, which
asked for its VAT back on some of the costs of running its hospitality
chalet at the Farnborough Airshow.
But the High Court upheld the company's claim in March, arguing that its
chalets were temporary offices and that it was possible to apportion its
expenses between business and entertainment costs.
Customs said yesterday it would take the case to the court of appeal, while
conceding in the meantime that companies may claim back VAT on their
non-entertainment costs. It also said it would consult companies to assess
their views.
Mr Andrew Ball, a tax partner with accountants Touche Ross, said: 'It is
extraordinary that Customs is appealing.'
He added that he did not believe most companies offering corporate
hospitality at events such as Wimbledon or Glyndebourne even attempted to
claim VAT rebates. Those affected were more likely businesses attending
trade fairs.
Whatever the ultimate finding, it will have little impact on Plant and
Repair and its box at Cardiff Arms Park. The company has since gone into
liquidation.

FT  03 JUN 94 / (CORRECTED) MEPs look for younger voters: Coming up on MTV,
a hot new quartet of European politicians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Correction (published 23rd June 1994) appended to this article.
The contest for younger Dutch voters in the European elections will take a
new twist this weekend.
On Sunday, Mr Gijs de Vries, one of the country's most prominent members of
the European parliament, is scheduled to take part in a programme broadcast
by MTV, the US-based pop music and video-clip channel, to a potential
audience of some 25m European households.
His appearance, along with that of three other aspiring MEPs from other
states of the European Union, is calculated to put Mr de Vries in touch with
the Netherlands', and Europe's, youth.
'Young people have a real hunger for information about Europe,' he says.
'One of the most frequent questions I get is how can I get a job in Europe,
or how can I do a student internship with a foreign company elsewhere in
Europe.'
Though he is only 38, Mr de Vries is a veteran Dutch MEP, having served the
right-wing Liberals in Europe since the age of 28, when he was barely older
than most members of today's 'MTV generation'.
Dutch young people may be interested in pursuing pan-European careers, but
most voters in the Netherlands, traditionally a stronghold of pro-European
feeling, are displaying a distinct lack of interest in the European
Parliament campaign.
Mr Jan Marinus Wiersma, an MEP candidate for the Labour party, says, 'There
is some voter fatigue out there because this is the third election they've
had since March.' Besides the municipal polls in March, the Dutch also held
a general election in early May.
Mr Wiersma disagrees with the view that there are no fundamental differences
between the parties. 'There is a fight going on about the future of the
'Rhineland' model of combining an active government stance with freedom for
market forces.' The left wants to create jobs while the right wants to lower
wages, he says.
Mr de Vries of the Liberals also highlights differences. 'In social policy,
the question is whether we want a 35-hour week, which the Socialists favour,
or rather greater flexibility in labour laws, as we want.'
All parties are broadly in favour of the European Union, and there is no
hint of anti-Maastricht fervour.
Mr Sam Rozemund, an analyst at the Clingendael institute for international
relations in The Hague, says that domestic rather European politics are
dominating the latest campaign. 'But that's little different from European
elections in other years,' he notes.
What is different, however, is that Dutch politicians are still trying to
put together a government coalition, meaning the June 9 poll is being seen
as a referendum on the result of the May 3 general election.
The ruling Christian Democrats and Labour both fared badly in the national
elections, losing support to the Liberals and D66, a left-of-centre party.
Much will depend on the level of voter turnout. 'Christian Democratic voters
tend to turn out for the European election, so that could favour them,' Mr
Rozemund argues.

In the Financial Times of June 3, it was reported that MTV Europe has an
audience of 25m households. MTV estimates that its audience is over 60m
households.

Finland's Kone yesterday extended its concentration on its core elevator
operations by announcing the sale of Kone Wood, a supplier of wood handling
equipment, to Andritz AG of Austria.
The sale, on undisclosed terms, is Kone's third big disposal in the last
nine months. Last September it sold Mac-Gregor-Navire, the world's leading
supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment, to Sweden's Incentive for
about SKr500m (Dollars 63.3m) and in March it sold its cranes unit for more
than FM600m (Dollars 110m).
Kone's majority owner, the Herlin family, recently rejected an offer from
Germany's Thyssen group for its entire shareholding. It controls about 40
per cent of Kone's capital and 70 per cent of the votes.
Kone, one of the world's three leading elevator manufacturers, says its
remaining non-core activities, Kone Instruments, GS-Hydro and a steel
foundry are also for sale.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Loss at Postipankki widens to
FM163m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at Postipankki, the Finnish state-owned banking group, rose
to FM163m (Dollars 29.6m) from FM101m in the first four months as higher
costs and reduced income offset a reduction in credit losses.
Mr Seppo Lindblom, chief executive, said the bank would make another loss in
1994, after last year's FM353m deficit.
Rising long-term interest rates and reduced foreign exchange income helped
lower group income to FM1.20bn from FM1.28bn. The fall would have been
greater but for last year's purchase of Savings Bank of Finland assets,
although costs associated with the acquisition helped drive expenses up 30
per cent to FM934m. Credit losses fell to FM369m from FM599m.
Last week Unitas, Finland's second largest banking group, said it had cut
pre-tax losses by 18 per cent to FM444m in the first four months, in spite
of a 15 per cent increase in credit write-offs to FM976m.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Move to cool Crimea row thrown out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's divided parliament yesterday rejected a proposal by President
Leonid Kravchuk to set up a constitutional court to resolve the status of
the disputed Crimean peninsula. Instead, it voted for a four-point
resolution which suspended the quasi-independence constitution reintroduced
by Crimea two weeks ago and called on the president to come up with a list
of 'concrete measures' by June 6 to ensure Crimea's compliance with Kiev's
wishes.
It also set up a parliamentary commission to seek ways of harmonising
Ukrainian and Crimean legislation within the next month.
The rejection of Mr Kravchuk's proposals was another step in the internal
power struggle between parliament and president but merely led to the search
for another formula which gave the semblance of activity while holding back
from actions which carry the risk of conflict between Ukrainians and ethnic
Russians.
The long-standing dispute between Kiev and the ethnic-Russian dominated
Crimean parliament reignited earlier this month when the latter unilaterally
reintroduced a constitution which barely stops short of bestowing full
sovereignty on the region.
The peninsula, a holiday area, was part of Russia for two centuries until
transferred to Ukraine in 1954. A 10-day Ukrainian-imposed deadline to
rescind the constitution passed unobserved two days ago.
Mr Kravchuk's attempt to cool the temperature of a dispute which threatens
to grow into violent conflict between Russians and Ukrainians earned a
contemptuous response from many Ukrainian nationalist MPs in the deeply
divided Ukrainian parliament. It was interpreted as a sign of weak
leadership from a lame duck president hobbled by the proximity of
presidential elections on June 26.
The Crimean dispute is closely linked to the status of the former Soviet
Black Sea fleet, which is based in the peninsula. Three days of talks
between the Russian and Ukrainian prime ministers last week failed to remove
the impasse.
Mr Kravchuk stated yesterday that while Russia had no objective need for a
fleet based on Ukrainian territory it was unrealistic for it to be withdrawn
immediately.
Yesterday was doubly humiliating for Mr Kravchuk as rejection of his
constitutional court proposal by the bitterly divided Ukrainian parliament
was matched by the studied indifference on the part of the Crimean
parliament to his repeated call for Crimea to rescind its quasi-independence
constitution.
During hours of heated and often confused debate several nationalist MPs in
the Kiev parliament demanded the establishment of direct presidential rule
over the peninsula. while Mr Serhiy Holovaty, from the democratic
opposition, summed up the attitude of many to the president's proposals when
he complained that 'one month is a long time and we have no guarantee that
the court will be formed in that time or that it will carry authority'.
Mr Holovaty advocated the calling of a state of emergency, while MPs from
eastern Ukraine, where separatist demands similar to those of Crimea are
brewing among the many Russian-speakers, argued that Ukraine should move,
like Russia, towards a federal structure in which all regions would have
more autonomy.
Mr Gennady Ugarov, an MP from of the 'Unity' faction spoke for many ethnic
Russians when he told the parliament: 'We must take reality into account and
accept Crimea as it is, whether we like it or not.' The stand-off continues.

FT  02 JUN 94 / VW pressure on Madrid over Seat funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAMBURG, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen said yesterday it hoped to end talks with the Madrid government
'in the next two weeks' to clear the way for further restructuring at Seat,
its loss-making Spanish subsidiary.
The company said it wanted Spain to contribute DM820m (Dollars 500m) to fund
redundancies at Seat. It claimed there were 'positive signals' that the
government would make funds available and a further meeting was scheduled
for next week.
However, in Madrid, the industry ministry said it would only be willing to
pump more money into the Barcelona-based car company for new development
projects. The government also argues that its scope for providing help is
limited by European Union rules.
Mr Juan Ignacio Molto, secretary of state for industry, told VW
representatives on Tuesday the government was not prepared to fund
redundancy packages. Excess labour was 'a problem for private sector
management'. However, the Spanish authorities are anxious to see Seat
maintained as a separate company within the VW group. The regional
government of Catalonia, also under pressure to assist the loss-making
company, has criticised Madrid for delay in resolving the issue.
Meanwhile, VW announced that it had had 'positive results' at company and
group level in April and May but would not give details of profits. The
company has already said it hopes to improve on its 1993 profit of DM71m at
company level this year and to break even at group level following a loss of
DM1.4bn last year.
Worldwide deliveries in the first five months rose 6.1 per cent over the
year before to total 1.4m units. Germany was the only market where
deliveries fell - by 4.1 per cent - a fact VW blamed on weak demand there
generally and poor sales at Audi.
Several shareholders were angry that the VW management had not foreseen the
DM1.84bn losses at Seat last year but there was broad support among the
3,500 shareholders for Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the VW production
chief at the centre of suspicions about industrial espionage.
Both Mr Ferdinand Piech, the chief executive, and Mr Klaus Liesen, the
chairman of the supervisory board, made impromptu comments after prepared
speeches, reflecting the anger about Opel allegations in the days before the
annual meeting. 'There is up to now no evidence which would justify the
charge of industrial espionage,' Mr Liesen told applauding shareholders. Mr
Piech, in turn, denied all suggestion that Mr Lopez would move to Seat.
Seat lost DM350m in the first quarter of this year and VW hopes the group
will end the year with a loss of around DM1bn, compared with a loss of
DM1.84bn in 1993. The company is expected to become profitable again in
1995.
Mr Piech said there were two solutions at Seat. A 'friendly' one would be to
leave Seat as an independent subsidiary. A more drastic alternative would
involve merging Seat with other VW operations, leaving only an independent
sales unit. It has asked the Spanish government to fund the redundancy of
older workers, who are entitled to three years' redundancy payment which
will cost about DM820m. Otherwise, VW says it will spend DM160m to shed the
same number of younger workers.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (13): Down-to-earth treasurer -
Profile, Richard Desmond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Desmond, group treasurer of BAT Industries, the tobacco and
insurance group, sees a lot of bank presentations in his London office.
When, during a presentation earlier this year, one banker airily talked
about 'the client's views' on foreign exchange movements, Mr Desmond
interrupted him. 'We don't have views, we have exposures,' he said. 'And if
we don't have an exposure, we don't have a view.'
That epitomises the down-to-earth conservative approach of Mr Desmond, who
lectures on foreign exchange management and was a former president of the
Association of Corporate Treasurers.
Mr Desmond points out that, at BAT, which had sales of Pounds 13bn last
year, 'the size of the organisation is large in relation to the size of the
foreign exchange risks'. This, he believes, leads to a couple of advantages
in risk management. 'We don't have to keep pressing for the last farthing in
savings. And we can often take more conservative risk management
approaches.'
The treasury department may be centred in the UK but Mr Desmond has only a
small team of five professionals at headquarters. Nevertheless, he claims
that 'the quality of our treasury staff is as good as any in London'. His
team both deals and devises the foreign exchange strategies.
The group reports to shareholders in sterling but is a worldwide operation,
with costs and revenues in many different currencies. 'We tend to be long
dollars, yen and Deutschemarks' says Mr Desmond. Exposures across the group
are netted so that a subsidiary which has, for example, dollar costs can
obtain dollars from the head office at a budget rate.
As the BAT treasurer points out, there are four potential elements of a
company's foreign exchange risk: the third party transactions of operating
groups; non-remitted profits of subsidiaries; dividends and other financial
flows to the core; and foreign currency assets.
On third party transactions, Mr Desmond says that 'every subsidiary should
be managing its foreign exchange exposure' although he points out that most
subsidiaries' exposures should not be large, since they have local cost
factors.
The subsidiaries are not without guidance on how they should handle their
foreign exchange dealings. BAT runs a course in which all financial staff
are trained in the style of the group. The head office also has a range of
policies which cover what the subsidiaries can do, and substantial
transactions have to be approved at the sub-operating group level.
Non-remitted profits, which are being retained by subsidiaries for future
growth, are not hedged. They are recorded by the parent company after having
been translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Dividends and other financial flows are managed actively but conservatively,
according to Mr Desmond. 'When volatility goes up, our strategy gets more
conservative; when it goes down, we become slightly more active. If
volatility goes down a bit, we use an option strategy. The cost is lower if
the volatility is lower.'
For much of the time, BAT makes straightforward transactions in the spot and
forward markets, or using stop-loss strategies, with the target of achieving
the average exchange rate for the year. However, Mr Desmond says the company
is quite prepared to use sophisticated techniques, but on strict conditions.
'We take a practical approach' he says. 'We don't aggregate risks, we like
to retain our flexibility. When we use a product, we make sure we understand
the potential out-turn.
'Furthermore,' he adds, 'before we buy a product, such as a zero cost
collar, we will run a programme to see not only what our strategy will
achieve but also the cost of unwinding it half-way through.'
When it comes to dealing with the exchange risk created by foreign currency
assets, Mr Desmond says there are three possibilities.
The first is make it abundantly clear to shareholders that the group has
foreign currency assets, which are not hedged, and let them assess the
attractions of the shares on that basis.
This approach would mean that all the company's borrowings would be
denominated in sterling, the currency in which the results are reported.
The second strategy is to match the debt exactly with the assets in currency
terms so that when foreign exchange markets bob up and down, the value of
the group's reserves stays the same.
Mr Desmond says BAT uses a third approach. 'We are a little bit more
sophisticated. We look at the currency ratio of the future cash flows as
well as of the assets.'
He explains that this means that 'when currencies move our debt/equity ratio
and interest cover ratio will tend to be stable.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (14): Top of the chartists -
Profile, Brian Marber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few activities conjure up a dull stereotype as readily as the chartist,
whose dogged study of the past as a guide to the future can appear an
intellectually arid exercise.
Few men, however, confound this stereotype more thoroughly than Brian
Marber, doyen of the trade. Maverick and man of strong views, an hour or two
in his company is enough to make anyone turn to charts.
Unfortunately, Mr Marber is not quite the marketing gift he first appears.
Indeed, he has a somewhat ambiguous relationship with his calling. 'I told
the secretary of the Society of Technical Analysts that it was not in the
interests of the society to promote itself. We would do ourselves more good
if we go around pretending to be weirdos. The efficiency of technical
analysis is in inverse proportion to its acceptance,' he says.
Mr Marber did not receive his first fee-paying client until June 1979, when
he successfully predicted that the dollar would drop against the D-Mark.
Within two years Mr Marber had left his position at the stockbroking firm
Simon and Coates - In his last six years on the stock exchange, he had been
voted best technical analyst in the City - and Brian Marber and Co soon
followed, being set up in September 1981.
Mr Marber will not discuss the size of his client base, but says it 'was
originally all corporates - people who were fed up with forecasts from the
banks.' Initially he called himself a forecaster. 'They would not have known
what a chart was 15 years ago, and if they had they would have laughed]'
Mr Marber may not enjoy marketing, but he knows a thing or two about
advocacy. With the practised skill of one who has many times fought off the
sceptics, he sets out his stall:
A 1989 Bank of England study shows that 90 per cent of all FX decisions made
in the market had some degree of technical analysis in them;
60 per cent thought technical analysis 'at least as useful as fundamental
analysis'.
To those who argue that maybe fundamental analysis is more useful further
out, over six to 12 months, Mr Marber replies pungently: 'I can tell you
that is absolute rubbish.' He cites a biannual survey where analysts are
asked for their forecasts one year out. Of the 24 surveys he has monitored,
in only 10 of those has the mean forecast been correct on the trend.
The figures show, he argues, that fundamental analysts get the trend right
about 40 per cent of the time. 'Random chance would have it that you would
be right 50 per cent of the time, wouldn't it?'
The same Bank study found that technical analysts were right no more than 50
per cent of the time. While Mr Marber concedes that charts will not help in
a ranging market, he says 'they will never leave you on the wrong side of a
trend'. Research shows that foreign exchange is the only market to trend,
and it does so 58 per cent of the time. 'That is sufficient to make money,'
he says.
Nothing gives Mr Marber more pleasure than laying into the
'fundamentalists'. Purchasing power parity? 'A load of bullshit. The dollar
was undervalued for 10 years in terms of PPP in the 70s. How the hell does
that help you make a decision?' Interest rate differentials? 'Lex wrote the
most arrant nonsense recently: if interest rates go up, currencies go up.'
He then pulls out a chart of dollar/D-Mark going back a number of years
which shows that the currencies followed interest rate trends only - wait
for it - 40 per cent of the time. To Mr Marber, none of this is surprising.
'The function of markets is to try and discount the future. They concentrate
on anticipating future interest rate differentials, not current ones.'
In fact, sceptics have long ceased to be a problem. The enemy is now within
 -the problem to be faced is how to deal with success. Fifteen years ago
banks did not employ chartists and people wanting to see the dollar/D-Mark
relationship plotted had to come to people like Mr Marber. Now it is the
mere push of a button away. 'Everybody thinks he's a bit of a chartist,' he
says.
The problem now is that interbank trading in foreign exchange dwarfs
trade-related flows. But most interbank trading, Mr Marber argues, is guided
to a greater or lesser degree by technical analysis. The danger is that it
then becomes self-destructive as 'there is no follow through, since no-one
else is there'.
He applies this logic to the range trading in foreign exchange markets since
September 1992. Why? 'Because there are too many technically-inspired
decisions. Give me a market that isn't subject to technicians. It's much
easier.'
Longer-term calls have become much more difficult, says Mr Marber. In the
case of cable (Pounds /Dollars ), the one-year average used to change
direction every three years. 'Nowadays, by the time you have called the
change it has topped.' Mr Marber puts this down to improved communications.
'Arbitrage works on bad communication. Where are the fundamentals when
people close positions at the end of the day?' he laments.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (15): Erring on the side of
caution - Profile, David Shaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's undignified exit from the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM)
in September 1992 was the catalyst for Legal and General revising its
approach to currency management, says David Shaw, head of strategy.
Sterling's 14-15 per cent decline 'brought home to us just how exposed our
assets, and by extension our policy holders, had been.' He adds that 'such
events are becoming increasingly common and institutions like L&amp;G need to
assess the risks and take appropriate action'.
Institutional investors are among the more cautious creatures found on
foreign exchanges. So Mr Shaw is quick to stress that the discretion he is
allowed by his board and trustees is tightly constrained. At the level of
currency selection only two sizes of position are allowed: the minimum
position is 2.5 per cent, and this has to be justified by an expected total
return on the preferred currency of at least 7.5 per cent.
The maximum permitted position is 5 per cent of underlying assets, with an
expected total return of 15 per cent. 'No conviction, no bets,' he says.
Five per cent may not sound much, but can add up to large numbers when one
considers that L&amp;G has more than Pounds 30bn assets under management, of
which about 20 per cent is in non-sterling assets. Across the breadth of UK
institutional investors, nearly Pounds 250bn is probably invested in
non-sterling securities.
Mr Shaw stresses that these large bets are rare. In 1993 L&amp;G did not take
any 5 per cent positions, and only placed one 2.5 per cent position on the
dollar, which paid off.
This year has proved tricky. Mr Shaw is in good company when he admits that
L&amp;G had a bet on the dollar against the yen which went wrong. The group was
saved from embarrassment by placing a stop-loss order at Y107.50, which
minimised the loss to 2 per cent.
While the 2.5 and 5 per cent limits are very rigid compared to many other
currency trading operations, they still represent a considerable change in
modus operandi from the situation just two years ago. 'The asset allocation
view was initially (taken) without any serious assessment of the relative
attractiveness of the currencies involved,' says Shaw.
Partly this reflected trustees' concern that managers not be seen to be too
pro-active in their management of currencies. It was also a function of the
relatively low currency volatility since October 1990 when sterling had
formally entered the ERM.
Now the group does one-year currency forecasts, roughly consistent with its
typical investment time horizon. The focus is on the four main currencies -
dollar, D-Mark, yen and sterling - and each month L&amp;G uses fundamental
economic analysis to rank the currencies in terms of expected performance.
With about 80 per cent of group assets in the UK, the key is the sterling
cross with the other three currencies.
The degree of discretion in managing currency exposure is an ongoing subject
of internal debate. An important concern from a taxation perspective is to
be classified as an investor, not a trader - a fine distinction which turns
on investment time horizons.
Overall, says Mr Shaw, 'there is an increasing willingness on the part of
trustees to be more flexible in allowing currency management'. There is,
however, a job of persuasion to be done. Some trustees are financial
ingenues, who need to be persuaded that currency management is not
speculation, while others, for example, will feel that selling sterling is
in some way unpatriotic.
With trustees more willing, the currency decision is now increasingly
separated from the underlying asset decision, says Mr Shaw, 'because the
economic fundamentals that drive currencies are not the same set that drive
the bond and equity markets'. The decisions are taken 'separately but
simultaneously'.
While progress has been made, Mr Shaw is careful to stress that they have
not reached the stage where, like hedge funds, proprietary traders or
currency funds, they purely take a view on a currency. 'What we do is
currency management, and it is the currency management of an underlying
asset,' he stresses.
A concern that Mr Shaw expresses is that just as investment managers are
mastering currency management, the game seems to be changing. 'We've padded
up for the village cricket match to find we're playing in the World Series,'
he quips.
The worry is that the advent of highly leveraged trading, conducted mostly
by proprietary traders and hedge funds, may have fundamentally changed that
nature of markets in a way which renders the more cautious strategies of
institutional investors both anachronistic and inadequate. This concern was
heightened by the volatility of financial markets during the first quarter
which left many fund managers with red faces.
It is early days yet. The first quarter may be a one-off, in which case it
can be ignored. Otherwise, Mr Shaw may find himself having to manage his
currency exposure as actively as he manages the underlying assets.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (12): 'Cowboys' of the markets -
The role of hedge funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the beginning of 1994, there were at least two certainties in the eyes of
most global asset managers: the US dollar and European bond markets, had to
rise.
It is a matter of history, of course, that events turned out otherwise, with
most fund managers reaching the end of the first quarter nursing battered
balance sheets and wounded egos.
In the search for scapegoats, the finger was quickly pointed at the hedge
funds - large pools of speculative capital, whose predatory trading
instincts and penchant for highly leveraged trade has conferred on them a
reputation as the cowboys of modern financial markets.
Figures about the size of the hedge fund industry are notoriously vague,
mainly because many hedge funds are organised so as to avoid the application
of most securities laws, and hence exist in something of a regulatory black
hole.
Republic New York Securities, a firm that tracks hedge fund activities,
estimates that there are more than 800 hedge funds representing Dollars
35bn-Dollars 40bn capital. These estimates were largely corroborated by
recent testimony from Barbara Pedersen Holum, acting chairman of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), at hearings on hedge fund
activities held in the US by the House Banking Committee. The CFTC regulates
US commodity futures and options markets and has information on most hedge
funds of any size that use these markets. CFTC data indicates a total of
Dollars 31.5bn under management of 'self-declared' hedge funds, and Dollars
48bn under management by all listed investment partnerships combined.
These figures need to be kept in context. The total net value of the
regulated mutual fund industry in the US was Dollars 2,100bn at the end of
1993, with at least 10 mutual funds having a net asset value greater than
Dollars 9bn. Other US institutional investors had, at the end of 1993,
Dollars 6,500bn in assets under management.
Estimates by John LaWare, a governor of the US Federal Reserve, are that
perhaps a dozen hedge funds have a net asset value greater than Dollars 1bn
with another 25 having capital between Dollars 100m and Dollars 1bn. George
Soros's group is believed to be the largest with about Dollars 9bn of
capital.
How active are hedge funds on foreign exchanges? Testifying before the House
banking committee, Mr Soros provided the following appraisal: using 1992
data from the Bank for International Settlements, showing global net
turnover of the nine largest foreign exchange markets to be about Dollars
946bn per day, 'all hedge funds in the aggregate control at most 1/180th (or
0.005 per cent) of the daily global trading volume in the foreign exchange
markets'.
This is based on the assumption that Soros Fund Management (SFM), on an
average trading day in foreign exchange, might engage in transactions with a
total value of around Dollars 500m; and that SFM constitutes about 15 per
cent of the money invested in hedge funds.
Against this rather benign view of hedge funds, two points must be made.
First, their ability to leverage their funds, and willingness to take big
bets, means that some of their trades can be very large indeed. Also,
despite their self-styled contrarian instincts, hedge funds do often end up
trading as a pack. In such cases their ability to move markets is beyond
dispute.
But Mr Soros does have support for his view that the influence of hedge
funds can be exaggerated. The CTFC, for example, found that the more
prominent hedge funds 'have not contributed to volatility in CFTC regulated
markets'. The CFTC examined its records of hedge fund activity during
February and March, when financial markets experienced considerable
volatility, and found it 'not significant'.
More specifically, on February 14, when the US dollar plunged to a six-month
low against the yen, hedge funds 'were not active participants in yen
futures on this day, none appearing among the 30 largest net traders . . .'
Arguably as important a development as hedge funds has been the mushrooming
of proprietary trading activities by leading banks - that is, trading done
on their own account where capital is at risk.
Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, noted recently that
bank trading activities were 'growing at an uncontrolled, rapid pace. At the
top 10 bank holding companies, trading account assets have increased about
400 per cent in the past four years and now top Dollars 140bn.'
Insofar as regulators are concerned with the threat of financial
instability, it may well be that they will in future concern themselves as
much with banks' proprietary trading, and the activities of institutional
investors, as with hedge funds. Mr Soros argues that 'trend-following
behaviour' is necessary to cause a market crash, and that this is most
likely to come from institutional investors in general, and mutual funds in
particular, aggravated by hedging practices associated with derivative
instruments.
Large hedge funds like to argue that their contrarian instincts actually
make them a smoothing influence in financial markets. This view also enjoys
support from regulators. Indeed, the Fed's Mr LaWare told the House
committee that 'the activities of hedge funds add depth and liquidity to
financial markets and can be stabilising influences. It would be wrong to
single out hedge funds as being responsible for moving global prices of
financial assets or as being a major source of risk in financial markets.'
It may be that markets have already done the regulators' work for them.
Indeed, if reports about the extent of hedge fund and proprietary trading
losses in the first quarter are to be believed, then a pruning process is
already well under way. Hedge funds and proprietary traders have still to
prove themselves in bear markets.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (11): Technology on the march -
The progress made by electronic brokerage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the untrained eye the change is indiscernible, but in dealing rooms
across the world, electronic brokerage is slowly becoming part of the
foreign exchange landscape.
The fondly nurtured stereotype of brokers, resplendent in loud braces,
bawling down telephones as they barrel vast sums of money around the world
is not under serious threat. But the trading desks of large banks are
increasingly acquiring automated dealing systems which simulate the services
offered by traditional voice brokers.
It is early days yet, and the market share of electronic brokerage is still
very small. It also remains to be seen whether there is space in the market
for the existing three operators. But there is a clear sense of technology
on the march, with no compelling reason why the broking community should
prove immune to change.
The most significant recent development was the launch last September of the
Electronic Broking Service (EBS), a system backed by 13 leading banks in
foreign exchange. This followed on the earlier launch of two other
electronic broking systems: Dow Jones Telerate launched the Minex system in
April 1993, and the launch in May 1992 by Reuters of the 2000-2 dealing
system.
EBS's origins were essentially defensive, with the banks anxious to prevent
Reuters assuming such a dominant market position that it would be able to
influence the way in which the market functions.
It already had a strong hold on the foreign exchange markets with about 50
per cent of global foreign exchange turnover transacted through its main
dealing systems, Reuters 2000-1 and Reuters Monitor.
Although EBS was essentially set up in opposition to Reuters, the real
competition lies with the voice broking community. Brokerage still plays an
important part in currency dealing. At the time EBS was conceived, and
electronic brokerage is too immature for these figures to have changed
substantially, roughly 60 per cent of deals in the currency market were done
by traders in two banks - or counterparties - who call each other up
directly. The remainder were done by brokers who bring together buyers and
sellers.
Figures released by EBS suggest it is making solid progress. It is now
starting to achieve consistently more than 2,000 trades a day. For the week
ended May 6, most trades (59 per cent) were in the Dollars /DM cross, with
other good performers being DM/Swiss franc and DM/French franc.
The number of users has also increased to 188 bank branches in 18 cities.
Since January, 48 new counterparties have been added, and only 10 of these
are branches of the 13 EBS partnership banks.
EBS is keen to resist the idea that it exists only because it can attract
captive business from its shareholders. It notes that partner banks now
represent less than 50 per cent of total users on the system. Reuters,
meanwhile, announced recently that it had passed the 5,000 matches/day mark
on the 2000-2 system. It is found in about 550 bank branches, and Portugal
will soon become the 22nd country where 2000-2 systems are used.
Minex has a strong position in Asia and claims to transact 6 per cent of the
daily broker turnover in dollar/yen in Tokyo.
The voice broking community claims that the influence of electronic broking
has so far been negligible. Indeed, one leading broker says that in the case
of the D-Mark/franc pair, 'we have found since they established themselves,
our turnover has gone up as well'. He concedes that the effect would be
different in a more established currency pair, such as dollar/D-Mark.
Although electronic brokerage systems claim that they can cut brokerage
costs, brokers argue that currency dealers are more concerned with
generating turnover than controlling overheads. Brokers also believe the
human factor should not be underestimated. 'A computer can't take you out
for a drink after work,' quips one. Some critics have wondered whether bank
dealers would use EBS were it not for the fact that they have a stake in the
system. Users, however, are adamant this is not the case. Tim Broome,
assistant director at Barclays global foreign exchange, comments: 'EBS on
our dealing floor currently stands on its own merits.'
Mr Bartko is confident that EBS is succeeding in terms of the key criterion
that determines the success of a broker: the liquidity it generates. This,
in turn, is a function of having prices to quote, to a critical mass of
counterparties. He argues that EBS has generated liquidity which people are
prepared to pay to have access to. This is particularly so in the
dollar/D-Mark, D-Mark/Swiss Franc and D-Mark/French franc crosses. EBS has
been less successful in generating liquidity in the other five currency
pairs it offers. Mr Bartko says he is at a loss to explain why some currency
pairs have succeeded better than others.
Traders are generally quite complimentary about EBS, with two caveats.
First, younger traders tend to be more receptive to the new technology than
older ones. Indeed, many in the market cite the cultural challenge of asking
people to change deep-seated work habits as the most serious challenge
facing electronic broking.
Second, EBS is used more in quiet markets. In heavy trading, the inclination
is still to revert to habit and trade on established systems, or with voice
brokers.
One early division between EBS and Reuters is that the former,
understandably given its backers, has a dominant position among the large
banks in the interbank market, while Reuters has a strong position among
their counterparties, especially the retail market banks. 'They have got the
market-makers and we have got the hitters,' says Bob Etherington,
international marketing manager at Reuters.
Naturally enough, both EBS and Reuters claim that they are making inroads on
the other's market. Certainly, there are examples of banks who use more than
one of the electronic systems.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (8): Rude awakening for investors
 -The amount of interest in exotic currencies in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the rather giddy romance between investors and exotic currencies in
1993, the first quarter of 1994 has proved to be a chastening experience.
The attraction lingers, but investors are now wary and more mature than they
were only six months ago.
Last year interest in exotics, particularly in south-east Asia, soared on
the back of the emerging markets story. The motor for this growth was the
internationalisation of US pension and mutual funds, partly a secular trend,
but also a function of the search for higher yields at a time when US
interest rates were lower and domestic equities expensive.
Two events in the first quarter combined to spoil the story. One was the
carnage in international bond markets. The liquidity pressures this
generated - for example, the need to raise cash against losses suffered in
European bond markets - spilled over into selling pressure elsewhere.
Unhappily, as investors were to discover, exotic currencies are not
so-called for nothing, and selling out of a currency was not as easy as some
assumed.
Jon Bowen, head of the exotics desk at Midland Global Markets, comments:
'People couldn't work out why they could enter the market over five days,
but not exit in one.'
Perhaps fittingly, the second event involved Bank Negara, the Malaysian
central bank. Ironically, given the bank's reputation until recently as one
of the foremost speculators in world currency markets, it decided to step in
to curb the influence of speculators on the Malaysian ringgit. The effect of
Negara's intervention was to cause the ringgit to fall, between Christmas
and New Year, by more than 5 per cent against a bakset of currencies,
inflicting heavy losses on many investors.
The discovery, says one broker, 'that the central bank could call a stop and
change the rules, came as a big shock to a lot of people'. Negara, he says,
was 'the big stick that taught people these currencies are not what you are
used to. You can't just drive them around with flows of money'.
For US fund managers in particular, the newest kids on the block, and many
naive in the ways of the developing world, these events were a rude
awakening. Mr Bowen notes that the Negara episode has had a 'noticeable
impact on trading', particularly in the Thai baht and the Indonesian rupiah.
He says turnover in the five leading Asian currencies - the Hong Kong
dollar, Malaysian ringgit, Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah and Singaporean
dollar - has, if anything, shrunk in the first half of 1994.
Negara, of course, is not alone in the hands-on management of its currency.
Singapore is also a country which does not want its currency
internationalised, in the sense of allowing the free market to determine the
rate.
Exotics, of course, mean more than south-east Asia alone. Indeed, it
encompasses any currency beyond the dollar, yen and those of western Europe.
The other main exotic blocs are Latin America, with eastern Europe also an
emerging area. Investors in these and other areas also come armed with a
healthy stock of cautionary tales.
An obvious recent example concerns the Turkish lira, where concern about
government economic policies caused the currency to fall by more than 50 per
cent against the dollar during the first quarter.
Latin America remains the almost exclusive preserve of US banks, which have
something of a 'backyard' perspective on the region. Trade is handled mostly
from New York. Volumes, however, are still tiny compared to Asia.
Albert Maasland, managing director at Chase Manhattan in London, says
eastern Europe is probably on a par with Latin America, but business is
largely one way - money going into the currency for local investment. 'We
can buy the local currency, but can't sell it for foreign currency. Often
this can only be done through a local bank.' He adds: 'We see lots of
opportunities there, but they are years behind the Asian market.'
The problem south-east Asian countries have faced is that the clamour to
invest has caused their currencies to appreciate. This obviously effects
export competitiveness, and countries such as Singapore and Malaysia, which
have long-term economic development plans, do not like outsiders coming
along and upsetting the environment.
Notwithstanding recent tribulations, for those who know the market - Chase,
Standard Chartered, Barclays, Midland, Natwest and Citibank are the main
players in London - it remains an exciting prospect. Mr Maasland says they
continue to see 'dramatic growth in trading, especially in Asian
currencies'. He estimates that trading activity in the five Asian currencies
rose 50-100 per cent year on year.
'In a number of them we will quite regularly see Dollars 50m-Dollars 100m
transactions, which was not the case two or three years ago,' says Mr
Maasland.
It is not only a case of greater volumes. There is also more use of foreign
exchange derivatives, though immature domestic capital markets still act as
a constraint on trading.
Investment into the region is likely in future to be more cautious. 'The
trend is still there, but the problem was that it was a fashion,' says Mr
Bowen. 'We've been through the boom times, now times are quieter. I do think
we will see it grow again, but not at the rate of last year for a while.'
Until liquidity in some of the markets improves, investors are likely to
limit the size of their deals. Liquidity, in turn, will improve as
deregulation progresses.
As David Clark, treasurer Europe at HSBC, notes: 'Deregulation is the friend
of the foreign exchange market - it encourages people to operate across
borders.' The other side of this coin, however, is politics and as Mr Clark
observes: 'Politics still plays a bigger part in foreign exchange than
economics does.'
As the story of the yen in 1994 shows, you do not have to go to developing
countries to discover this truth. But it is especially true with exotic
currencies in the developing world, where politics still has the upper hand
over markets.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (10): Revenge of the central
banks - This time around, speculators have lost heavily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the halcyon years of 1992/3 when bull markets in financial assets and
one way bets in the ERM swelled foreign exchange trading profits, 1994 has
proved to be more challenging.
In contrast to the earlier period when the ERM crises saw currency markets
dominate the headlines, the recent ructions in financial asset markets did
not spill over directly into currencies. But the overall nervousness, as
investors contemplate whether a bear market is under way, has not helped
foreign exchange trading rooms which depend on cross-border deals for their
volumes.
Indeed, there is a sense in which 1994 has witnessed the revenge of the
central banks. In 1992/3, many of them were humbled by speculators who
profited handsomely at the expense of taxpayers. This time round it has been
the 'speculators' who have lost heavily, with just about everyone appearing
to have got the dollar wrong against the yen.
Up-to-date national and global foreign exchange trading figures are not
available, but the overall picture is one of volumes having returned to
roughly the levels before the ERM shake-up (though some claim volumes are as
high as ever).
A consultant to a leading European bank active in foreign exchange argues
that the total volume of foreign exchange business in London, easily the
largest market, grew by 10 per cent last year.
Although there have been periods of considerable intra-day volatility, the
general complaint is that trading has been trendless, with foreign exchanges
taking their tune from other asset markets.
The one glaring exception, of course, has been the steady downward path of
the dollar, with most investors on the wrong side of the trend.
Profit trends are also not easy to determine. UK banks do not report on a
quarterly basis, while US banks tend not to disaggregate their trading
revenues.
In general, though, those banks which rely more on an established client
base than own-account trading are likely to have done better. And as the
first quarter results of leading US banks like JP Morgan, Bankers Trust and
Citicorp made clear, trading revenues were sharply lower.
Within these figures, foreign exchange revenues probably fell proportionally
less than bond and equity revenues. Banks appear to have lost most of their
money during the first quarter in emerging market securities and European
bonds.
The two bits of hard information about 1994 trading come from Chase and
Citibank which show a separate foreign exchange revenue figure. Looking at
the income line, Citibank's revenues fell to Dollars 66m from Dollars 156m
in the fourth quarter and Dollars 240m a year ago. At Chase, the comparable
figures were Dollars 85m, compared to Dollars 75m in the fourth quarter and
Dollars 103m in the first quarter of 1993.
Citibank's figures form the basis for a widely-held market view that the
industry leader performed worse than expected. But Citibank says this figure
is distorted by accounting vagaries and notes that if its revenues are
broken down by trading activity, foreign exchange is flat at Dollars 200m
compared to a year previously.
With proprietary profits more difficult in a trendless market, the focus has
switched sharply back towards the customer. This has helped a bank such as
Midland, a distribution-led outfit that functions more as a market-maker
than as a position taker, relying on a core client base to generate
business.
Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets, says that he
is still seeing growth in both the funds and the corporate side of the
business. Foreign exchange earnings, he says, were also better in the first
quarter of 1994 than the same period in 1993.
Chris Deuters, head of foreign exchange at Lehman Brothers, says although
the first quarter of 1994 was a difficult one, the aim remains the same: to
use foreign exchange as a separate asset and investment class, with a
premium on the relationship with the customer. It is a case, he says, of
'back to basics', of getting close to the client to understand his needs.
With 'central banks no longer in the middle, dishing out taxpayers money',
says Mr Deuters, there is a greater premium on relationships and good
traders. Getting close to the customer is hardly novel, but 'it's not the
originality of the idea that differentiates the bank. It's the execution.'
Another key challenge he stresses is the globalisation of the business.
'Clients' risk doesn't end at 5pm, so you have to be global.' Putting this
operation together, without having multiple trading rooms in the same time
zone, is an important task.
For Julian Simmonds, managing director foreign exchange and money markets,
Europe at Citibank, a key difference between 1994 and 1993 is the shift in
emphasis between costs and revenues. Whereas business was so hectic during
1992/3 that managing the huge turnovers was a full-time activity, the
quieter period offers opportunities to look at costs.
It also allows greater time for strategic thinking, such as how to embrace
the challenge of emerging markets.
In terms of costs, Citibank is looking at whether it can tidy up its
operations on the process and technology side. It has now centralised the
back-office function for clearing its European business in London. Mr
Simmonds hopes also to standardise dealing rooms. 'I've got to believe that
there should be much more commonality among our systems. The days are gone
where every branch can have 100 per cent of what it wants.'
He is quick to add, however, that 'this is not a revolution. It's an
evolutionary process. Ask the questions, and then try and change things
slowly.'
Mr Simmonds is also concerned about the 'effervescent' state of the labour
market. 'Packages are being offered as rich as at the height of the boom. I
find that strange. Market participants have failed to recognise that things
are changing. People need to become more realistic about what is
attainable.'
Another important challenge which all businesses face is the increasing
integration of foreign exchange, capital market and derivative functions.
'Customers require solutions that cut across the products,' says Mr
Simmonds. 'You have to think more broadly.'
Quieter times need not signal lower profits, as Chase's first quarter
performance shows.
David Clark, treasurer Europe at HSBC, adds: 'You don't need a lot of big
moves to make money. Foreign exchange dealers can live quite easily with the
volatility we have.'
What about the future? Mr Simmonds comments: 'Foreign exchange is in
transition. I suspect bitter disappointment for those who are gearing up to
face the last two years again. I don't think any of us have had to manage
against this backdrop before.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (9): Quest for order continues -
The pressures for greater stability in currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world has now been living for 21 years with a monetary system dominated
by floating exchange rates. But there continues to be a yearning among some
policy makers, active and retired, for more order, reminiscent of the
currency stability that existed under the post-war Bretton Woods system of
fixed exchange rates.
Despite all the problems suffered by members of the European exchange rate
mechanism in 1992 and 1993, finance ministers from continental Europe have
put greater exchange rate stability back on the international monetary
agenda.
Announcing this step after the spring meeting of the policy-making Interim
Committee of the International Monetary Fund, Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian
finance minister and committee chairman, said the Fund's executive board had
been asked to study, and report back by October, 'possible ways to introduce
a greater degree of discipline in the present exchange rate system'.
Around the same time, Helmut Schmidt, the distinguished former chancellor of
Germany, called for Franco-German co-operation to restore orderly currency
relationships for Europe against the dollar and yen 'that were lost at the
beginning of the 1970s'.
Other eminent former policy makers are beavering away in a grandly named
Bretton Woods Commission which is due to report next month on the 50th
anniversary of the Bretton Woods agreement. Their objective is to 'formulate
and agree on proposals for the reform of the international monetary system,
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank which will help set their
course as the 21st century approaches'.
At first sight there is much merit in the goal of greater exchange rate
stability. More fixed exchange rates are of obvious benefit to international
travellers and businesses that import and export. In spite of sophisticated
hedging techniques, it is likely that exchange rate volatility hinders
international trade and investment. Long-term misalignments, such as the big
appreciation of the US dollar in the early 1980s, distort investment
decisions and can foster protectionism.
Moreover, with hindsight, the period of fixed exchange rates in the
industrialised world that followed the second world war looks like a golden
age. Growth was faster than it has been since the collapse of Bretton Woods
in 1973 and the industrial countries, which now support a 35m-strong army of
unemployed, could boast of full employment in the 1950s and 1960s.
But it was also an age of strict controls over capital movements in which
comparatively few rich countries called the shots. Changes in the world
economy since the early 1970s make it very difficult to imagine a successful
return to Bretton Woods.
When the Group of Seven leading industrial countries tried to stabilise
their exchange rates through the Louvre Accord of February 1987, some,
notably Japan and Britain, found that their domestic economic stability was
undermined.
In Japan's case an excessively easy monetary policy, that was intended to
prevent appreciation of the yen, fuelled the now notorious 'bubble economy'.
In Britain, Chancellor Nigel Lawson's struggle to prevent sterling
appreciating against the D-Mark hindered a much needed tightening of
monetary policy to curb a growing boom. The result was a rapid increase in
UK inflation, followed eventually by soaring interest rates and a very
damaging recession.
More recently, massive free-flowing capital movements triggered crises in
the European Monetary System in 1992 and 1993.
After such experiences, it is not surprising that there are no official
moves afoot to replace the present 'non-system' of floating exchange rates
with a more orderly system of fixed parities.
For starters, the adoption of narrow fluctuation bands akin to the Bretton
Woods system of near stable exchange rates would require countries to reach
agreement on appropriate parities. This, says Morris Goldstein, deputy head
of the IMF's research department, 'would be no easy task'. Still more
problematic would be the subordination of monetary policy to exchange rate
goals, that would be required if such a system were to survive.
But if fixed exchange rates are not the route to greater discipline in the
international monetary system, what is?
An indication came in the response of Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing
director, to Mr Maystadt's announcement in April. Mr Camdessus said his
'instinctive reaction' was that there was more prospect of addressing
exchange rate instability at the world level through strengthened
surveillance and co-ordination of economic policies than through
co-ordinated intervention in the foreign exchange markets.
In other words, the best way to exchange rate stability begins at home. This
maxim is likely to be endorsed by the Bretton Woods Commission, when it
reports in July, and the IMF executive board when it submits its findings to
the Interim Committee's next meeting in Madrid in October. It would be
surprising if both groups did not lay great stress on the need for
convergence of inflation rates, greater savings and domestic investment and
determined action to reduce fiscal deficits as the path to greater currency
stability.
It is unclear, however, whether the two bodies will go so far as to suggest
that such domestic-oriented approaches could one day lead to 'target zones'
in which the monetary authorities would keep the principal trading
currencies - the dollar, D-Mark and yen - within relatively narrow ranges of
each other.
Last month Mr Camdessus expressed his doubts. As well as a high degree of
convergence and increased attention to macroeconomic co-ordination,
achieving exchange rate stability through target zones would require an
'exceptionally high degree of collective determination . . . given the high
cost that may have to be paid for this in terms of growth and employment in
the short term.'
Such collective determination does not exist. It was 'not accepted to the
same degree in the three major currency areas of the world,' he said.
Mr Goldstein is doubtless right when he says that a fundamental reform of
the international monetary system is 'not on the near-term horizon'.
But Mr Maystadt's initiative in the April Interim Committee and the musings
of men such as former chancellor Helmut Schmidt show it is a subject that
will not go away.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (8): Retreat from the brink - Trade union
militancy loses some of its edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On paper the proposal looked startling. The workforce was to face a 20 per
cent cut in pay. Half of the employees would be Chinese, And as further
provocation the would-be purchasers were demanding partial exemption from
employers' social security contributions.
But when a group of Chinese bidders made precisely these demands earlier
this year, as part of their bid for the bankrupt New Tubermase steel mill in
Liege, Flanders, the local union's response was even more surprising. In
place of public protests, the local branch of the FGTB, Belgium's main
socialist union, quietly started negotiations with the Chinese bidders.
'We can't accept a 20 per cent pay cut. But between 0 per cent and 20 per
cent there is a lot of room for negotiation,' explained Mr Jean Potier of
the FGTB, who explained that the union was simply being 'pragmatic', given
that the plant's 700 former workers had already been laid off five months
ago.
In the event, the Chinese offer fell through. But the episode highlights a
shift in Belgium's labour relations where, after decades of wielding
formidable political power, the unions are increasingly on the defensive. On
paper at least, their numbers remain impressive, with union membership rates
of some 70 per cent. Although the proportion of active workers who are
unionised is rather lower - the 70 per cent figure includes members who are
currently unemployed and on early retirement - this nevertheless leaves
Belgium one of the most unionised countries in Europe, second only to
Scandinavia.
But the ongoing erosion of Belgium's heavy industries is leading to an
erosion of the unions' power base and bargaining power. Almost two thirds of
Belgian employees now work in the service sector, with almost 13 per cent of
the total workforce part-time. Unemployment stands slightly above 13 per
cent, after almost touching 14 per cent last year.
Meanwhile, the Belgian Christian Democrat government of Jean-Luc Dehaene has
started to wage a new war of fiscal austerity. This is designed to curb not
only the country's huge public debt but also its high labour costs,
currently calculated to be almost three times higher than average labour
costs in France, Germany, UK, Italy and Netherlands.
The unions, split three ways between Christian Democrat, liberal and
socialist groups, are not taking the shift quietly. Last November, the
unions called the country's first general strike for 58 years in protest
against the new austerity package, which proposed a BFr75bn cut in Belgium's
social security expenditure - including a reduction in employers' social
security contributions - and a pay increase limit of 2 per cent for the next
three years. Allowing for inflation this 2 per cent limit amounted to a
virtual wage freeze.
The one day strike effectively paralysed the country, prompting an angry
response from employers, who are now demanding tougher government controls
to prevent a repetition of the rough picket tactics used last year. Mr Jan
van Holm, director of labour relations at Federation of Belgium Enterprises,
the main employers group, said: 'At first we (in the FBE) were astonished
and then very upset about these new tactics, which seemed to breach the
usual range of human freedoms.'
But after a few brief flashes of violence, the protest subsided and the
government pushed through most of the controversial points of its austerity
package - including the 2 per cent freeze on wages increases for the next
three years. According to Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de
Banque, that the main outcome of the strikes may have been to illustrate the
union's dwindling influence.
'The strikes were more of a symbolic nature. The general feeling we have is
that they proved that the unions were not very combative,' he says, adding
that the most powerful pressure against the 2 per cent wage increase ceiling
may finally come not from the unions but employers themselves. If the
Belgium economy picks up later this year, as predicted, companies may start
to demand that the ceiling is dropped to allow them to attract the best
labour, he suggests.
The unions themselves strongly disagree. 'Talk of the union's decline is
exaggerated. The strikes showed we could mobilise the workers - and could
force the government to negotiate,' insists Mr Roland DeWulf of the CSC, the
Christian democrat union. Although he concedes that the results of the
strike 'were not exactly desirable', he insists that the unions have no
intention of changing their tactics or campaign.
At the same time none of the unions expects a this type of industrial
conflict to recur this year, although they say protests could be stepped up
when negotiations are re-opened on a proposed inter-professional agreement
at the end of the year.
Meanwhile, interim negotiations between the employers and employees have
achieved a small, but symbolically significant breakthrough. After years of
wrangling, unions have finally officially accepted that Belgium does face a
labour costs competitiveness problem - although they remain at loggerheads
with the employers about how to define it.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (9): Spring is in the air - The economic
auguries are promising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian economy is showing signs of a springtime recovery after last
year's wintry mixture of recession, currency crisis and political
uncertainty.
After a 1.4 per cent contraction of national output in 1993, this year's
budget assumes a modest 1.1 per cent recovery in gross domestic product.
However, officials are privately looking at a possible 1.9 per cent GDP
growth, pulled along by brighter prospects in Germany and France.
Such bald figures, however, tell little of the horror of last year or of the
formidable challenges which still lie ahead.
For Belgium, 1993 was traumatic. The recession and unemployment bit hard,
and the franc suffered its worst battering since 1982 from speculators, when
in August the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) imploded and all
currencies within the grid were set free to float within wide bands.
The Centre-Left coalition led by Christian Democrat Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene
frequently seemed on the brink of collapse, bruised by scandals affecting
its Socialist partners, challenged from within and from the unions over
austerity measures, and in the final difficult throes of turning Belgium
into a federal state to enable French-speaking Wallonia, Dutch-speaking
Flanders and polyglot Brussels to cohabit.
To cap it all, King Baudouin, the embodiment of Belgium's fragile unity,
died suddenly in August.
Yet the glue holding Belgium together, and the vitality of its economy, were
stronger than most people had guessed.
If there was a single turning point, it was probably the government's
mid-November adoption of the Global Plan, a package to rein in budget and
social security deficits, boost industrial competitiveness, and freeze wages
in real terms until the end of 1996.
These measures were designed to release the strength of a high-productivity,
export-oriented economy, weighed down by huge public deficits and a growing
wage gap with Belgium's main trading partners. Pushed through stubbornly by
Mr Dehaene against trade union strikes and protests, they appear so far to
be working.
It is still hard to pin down the precise reasons for the better than
expected growth in output.
On the heels of a surprisingly severe wage freeze - the government quietly
subtracted fuel and tobacco from the retail price index to which Belgian
wages are linked - recovery is being driven by exports rather than domestic
consumption.
The authorities predict a handsome current account surplus for the
Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union this year of BFr400bn, or 5 per cent of
GDP. This is double the average surpluses of the second half of the 1980s,
but, most importantly, the mix has changed.
About half of the surplus is on the trade account, and three fifths of it is
Belgian, whereas the banking centre of Luxembourg traditionally accounted
for around three quarters.
The government is closely studying why Belgium's exports and market share
should be rising. Belgium exports around two thirds of its output, and two
thirds of that goes to Germany, France and the Netherlands, its neighbours
and peers in the 'hard-core' group of ERM currencies.
But wages had risen more slowly in those depressed markets, and Belgium was
and is paying a competitive price for its franc fort policy of shadowing the
D-Mark. 'We are trying to figure out the paradox,' smiles Mr Phillipe
Maystadt, the finance minister.
He and his officials suggest the margin between wages in Belgium and in its
competitors was relatively small in the light of the persistent trend
towards higher Belgian productivity gains.
'I'm afraid the adjustment is being made not through the current account but
the rise in unemployment,' Mr Maystadt says, forecasting a jobless rise to
10.1 per cent by year-end before things improve.
But the improvement could then be quite rapid. Mr Peter Praet, chief
economist at Generale de Banque, points out that inventories have been cut
drastically, leading to one of the lowest ever levels of stocks. Export-led
growth now should therefore feed into a revival of investment, then of
domestic demand, and then of jobs.
Unlike the recessions in 1975 and 1980-82, most of Belgium's generally low
debt and cash-rich companies remain respectably profitable. The overburdened
social security system has taken a good deal of the shock of lay-offs and
early retirements, while the BFr30bn take from new energy taxes is being
recycled into the tradeable goods sector to reduce employers' payroll costs.
Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the governor of the central bank, reckons these
transfers alone should create 50,000 new jobs over the next four years. 'For
a politician four years is an eternity but not for Dehaene,' he remarks.
Sticking with the Global Plan of which this is part is vital. Mr Dehaene is
now in the running to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission, but his tough managerial reputation is more likely to be needed
to ensure the success of the Plan - and to take the further, sensitive
measures needed to deal with Belgium's debt.
The Plan and spending cuts made last year look as though they will quickly
bring the social security deficit into rough balance, and cut the budget
deficit from 7.2 per cent in 1993 to 5.7 per cent - under the likely EU
average - this year.
Still to be attacked is the debt stock, equivalent to 130 per cent of GDP,
which towers over the economy and the franc even though Belgium's huge stock
of household savings, equivalent to 175 per cent of GDP, far outweighs it.
The debt is over twice the 60 per cent debt-to-GDP ratio set down in the
Maastricht treaty as the marker for economic and monetary union (Emu) by
1997 or 1999 - to which Belgium is firmly committed.
The debt stock is a useful alibi for pushing through structural reform of
public finances and attacking the budget deficit.
Lower interest rates plus the repricing of virtually all Belgium's more
expensive debt has, moreover, brought significant savings on an interest
bill which had grown to 11 per cent of GDP.
As Mr Verplaetse points out, 'once nominal growth exceeds the deficit, we're
in a virtuous circle,' helping bring down the debt/GDP ratio, probably from
1995. Growing privatisation receipts could also be used to retire debt.
But a new assault on public finances will almost certainly be needed before
1996, when the Maastricht review of early candidates for Emu will take
place. For instance, the Brussels region is in trouble because of its
shrinking tax base, while the education system on both sides of the language
divide (but especially in Wallonia) is heading for insolvency.
This would need a very tight budget for 1996. But that is virtually
impossible unless federal elections are brought forward from their November
1995 deadline. Even then, going further than the government has already done
will be socially and politically risky.
In Mr Praet's view of the medium-term, 'you need somebody like Dehaene to
take these sorts of decisions.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (10): A force to be reckoned with -
Profile, Central Bank Governor Alfons Verplaetse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somewhere near the top of the list of movers and shakers in modern Belgium
stands Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the central bank.
His affable manner - accompanied by guttural chuckles and the occasional
'ooh-lah-lah' when describing the tumultuous events in the currency markets
in 1993 - offers few clues as to the importance of his job. But make no
mistake: 'The Fons' is a force to be reckoned with.
As head of the National Bank of Belgium, Mr Verplaetse is the guardian of
the national currency. He is the co-architect and standard bearer of the
long-standing policy of shadowing the D-Mark, a policy which has served as
the counter-inflationary anchor for Belgium but which came under severe
strain during last summer's currency crisis inside the European Monetary
Suystem.
Mr Verplaetse also played an influential, if at times mildly controversial,
backroom role last year ahead of negotiations between government, employers
and trades unions on the global pact to bolster competitiveness, cut social
spending and create more jobs. The governor supplied the intellectual
framework (and the number-crunching) for the pact.
Mr Verplaetse has been governor of the National Bank since 1989. Born in
Zulte, in western Flanders, he took a degree in commercial science at the
Catholic University of Leuven, and joined the bank in 1953. His career took
off when he became chef de cabinet of then prime minister Wilfried Martens,
where his formative experience was preparing the currency devaluation in
1982 which set Belgium back on the path of fiscal orthodoxy.
Mr Verplaetse is a numbers man to his fleshy finger-tips. He rolls off
figures with ease, pausing only to confirm their accuracy in the ever
present annual report of the National Bank. Similarly, he pays discreet
reference to his daily telephone conversations with his counterparts in
Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Paris, and Frankfurt - one more sign of the close
co-operation these days between the 'hard core' currency club within the
European exchange rate mechanism.
The spirit of co-operation was sorely tested last summer when market
scepticism about the pace of interest rate reductions in Germany triggered a
wave of attacks on the Belgian franc, the Danish krone and the French franc.
Finance ministers responded by widening the ERM fluctuation bands from 2.25
and 6 per cent to 15 per cent on either side of the central rates.
Mr Verplaetse supported the decision, but it led to severe pressure on the
Belgian franc throughout the autumn. Market operators, having witnessed the
virtual collapse of the ERM, were determined to test the resolve of the
Belgian authorities.
Looking back, Mr Verplaetse says the National Bank's strategy was
straightforward: 'We had to buy time for the government.' This involved two
separate manoeuvres. The first was a rise in short-term interest rates which
risked choking off the early signs of economic recovery. The second was a
more complicated effort to support the government's plan to secure an
agreement on an austerity pact with unions and employers.
In retrospect, even Mr Verplaetse is guarded about the experience. On the
one hand, the social pact included some 80 per cent of the Verplaetse
panel's recommendations; but the experience of not being able to secure a
consensus across the board clearly came as a surprise to the governor. 'It
was a new phenomenon,' he says, noting that in 1982 it was easier.
A Belgian Cabinet minister is blunter: 'It was a mistake, and it will not
happen again.'
However noble the political intention, the impression was left that the
National Bank was ready to compromise its independence, just at the time
when central bank independence is a key tenet of the Maastricht treaty's
provisions for European monetary union.
Yet without the contribution of Mr Verplaetse, it is doubtful if the global
pact would have got off the ground.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (7): Beacons in the monetary haze
 -The former communist countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Understanding of the crucial importance of a sound currency to the success
of economic reforms has grown rapidly among economic policy-makers in the
former communist world over the past 18 months.
The latest converts have been among the former practitioners of the planned
economy who now govern Russia. 'A strong rouble is the indispensable
condition for the revival of the Russian economy,' Victor Chernomyrdin, the
Russian prime minister, recently told FT readers in a lengthy article which
stressed his government's commitment to market reforms, albeit tailored to
the specific and extraordinary circumstances of a giant country whose
inherited distortions are also on an epic scale.
The attention of Russia, largest of the former communist states, has been
attracted partly by the successful creation of independent national
currencies in several of the new states released from Soviet control over
the past five years. Three currencies in particular stand out like beacons
in the monetary haze left behind by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
disappearance of the transferable rouble. These paragons of stability, all
well launched on the path to full convertibility, are the Czech crown, the
Estonian kroon and the Slovene tolar.
In each case the countries concerned were the most westerly and most
developed parts of the former Soviet bloc, or of former Yugoslavia in the
Slovene example, and enjoyed specific advantages. But all three share a
strong political commitment to sound money as the basis for a rational
economy and thriving trade.
The Czech crown has been remarkably stable against the dollar and other hard
currencies since 1991. With capital inflows of Dollars 1.4bn last year,
balanced budgets and low foreign debt the crown is being groomed for full
convertibility by 1995. The Estonian kroon, which is umbilically linked to
the D-Mark, is managed on a currency board basis by the central bank which
recently pledged to keep the currency fixed at eight kroons to the D-Mark
until at least the turn of the century. The Slovene tolar is similarly
backed by steadily rising hard currency reserves now that Slovenia no longer
has to subsidise the rest of Yugoslavia.
The importance of a sound currency was first underlined by the architects of
the Polish stabilisation programme in 1990. Their reforms made the Polish
zloty internally convertible and managed to halt hyperinflation. Heavily
undervalued at the start of monetary reform, the zloty steadily appreciated
for 18 months until the first of a series of devaluations. The currency was
last formally devalued in August last year by 8 per cent but regularly loses
value by 1.6 per cent a month against a trade-weighted basket of currencies.
This 'crawling peg' devaluation is needed to compensate for inflation which,
although falling, hovers around 30 per cent annually.
Hungary, which inherited the largest per capital foreign debt in the region,
has also made recourse to forint devaluation to maintain the competitiveness
of exports but has managed to attract foreign investment which has allowed a
strong growth of reserves despite a worrying rise in the current account
deficit in recent months.
With their shift in trade to western markets and commitment to continuing
market reforms and privatisation, however, the economies and currencies of
central Europe are on track to becoming 'normal' by the end of the decade.
They are being followed, with a time lag, by Albania, Romania and Bulgaria.
In recent months the Romanian central bank has created the conditions for
internal convertibility of the Romanian lei by raising domestic interest
rates and taking other measures to close the gap between official and black
market exchange rates. The Bulgarian lev by contrast came under pressure
towards the end of last year as a reflection of higher than expected
inflation and declining hard currency reserves.
The picture is much more complex in the states of the former Soviet Union.
The disintegration of the rouble zone, originally opposed by Moscow and the
IMF, was the logical consequence of the emergence of new states. It has led
to the emergence of a plethora of new currencies such as the Kyrgyz som and
the Kazakh tenge alongside slightly longer established currencies such as
the Ukrainian karbovanets. All the former Soviet currencies are traded on
the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange while three, the karbovanets, the
tenge and the Belorussian accounting rouble are also traded on the central
Moscow stock exchange.
The currencies of the former Soviet Baltic states, led by the Estonian
Kroon, are in a class of their own with both the Latvian lats and the
Lithuanian litas moving to modified forms of currency board management. But
the fate of most other post-Soviet currencies accurately reflects the lack
of consistent reform and the high inflation resulting from loose monetary
policies.
Some, like the Armenian dram, the Azerbaijani manat and the Georgian coupon,
have been even further devalued by war and civil strife. Faced with
hyperinflation and inconvertible currencies trade in such countries has been
largely reduced to smuggling and barter and those with access to hard
currencies have become the new rich.
If Mr Chernomyrdin's newfound commitment to sound money does lead to tough
restrictions on government subsidies to hard-pressed military plants and
collectivised agriculture and adherence to lower inflation targets, the
Russian rouble could strengthen after its long decline. After all, the
rouble is backed by the enormous natural resources of a Russia which is no
longer obliged to subsidise the less developed parts of the former Soviet
empire.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (6): Emu hinges on political will
 -Contrary to expectations, the EMS has been remarkably calm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central bankers, in the words of William McChesney Martin, a distinguished
former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, are the people who 'take away
the punchbowl just as the party is getting merry'.
Last summer, central bankers and finance ministers from the 12 European
Union countries took away the biggest ever punchbowl from the global foreign
exchange markets.
In the early hours of Monday, August 2, 1993, they widened the fluctuation
margins in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System to 15
per cent either side of the EMS bilateral central rates from 2.25 per cent
and 6 per cent previously. That decision followed a year of crisis in the
EMS that had seen sterling and the Italian lira leave the system and
numerous devaluations of other member currencies.
As the officials left Brussels after their difficult emergency meeting that
weekend, few observers were prepared to bet that the EMS had much of a
future. The new margins were so wide that they almost constituted a free
float. It was generally expected that most of the currencies linked to the
D-Mark through the ERM would depreciate sharply. With the EMS in apparent
disarray, the European Union's ambitious plans for economic and monetary
union by 1997 at the earliest, and failing that, by 1999, also seemed doomed
to fail.
But contrary to expectations, the EMS has been remarkably calm for most of
the past 10 months. France and the other core members of the ERM resisted
the temptation to follow the UK example of slashing interest rates and
allowing a depreciation of their currencies against the D-Mark. After an
initial weakening, virtue was rewarded with the gradual return of the French
franc and other core currencies to levels that were either within or close
to the old intervention floors against the D-Mark.
Although the ERM is no longer perceived as a 'glide path' to Emu, the return
of calm to continental exchanges has revived interest in Emu. Few expect
Europe will have a single currency and central bank by the earliest deadline
of the Maastricht Treaty, but the prospect of Emu by the end of the century
is no longer laughed out of court.
Stage two of the Maastricht process has been under way since the beginning
of this year. This involves intensified co-operation on economic
policy-making among the 12 through the council of economics and finance
ministers. In addition, the European Monetary Institute, which may be the
embryo of the planned European central bank, began operating at the
beginning of this year and is engaged on technical preparations for the
third and final stage of Emu.
However, the obstacles to Emu are still formidable.
At a practical level, the EU has done little to ensure that bank notes,
coinage or payments systems will be adapted in time for the proposed
introduction of a single currency.
Politically, both the UK and Denmark have secured the right not to join Emu.
Economically, only Luxembourg of the 12 EU members at present meets the
tough convergence criteria that the Maastricht treaty sets as a condition
for entry to stage 3.
Of the criteria, the targets of low inflation and low long-term interest
rates appear relatively unproblematical for most member states.
Because policy makers generally agree that it would be folly to return to
the old ERM narrow bands following the experiences of 1992 and 1993, it is
also possible that EU states will opt for a generous interpretation of the
requirement for exchange rate stability before joining Emu. The condition
that entrants to Emu should have stable exchange rates within the 'normal
bands' of the ERM for two years prior to joining could be construed to cover
stability within the present 15 per cent bands.
But even though the Treaty allows some flexibility, the requirement that the
EU states control their fiscal deficits and overall debt looks daunting.
Under the criteria, a country is supposed not to become an Emu member if its
fiscal deficit exceeds 3 per cent of gross domestic product or its stock of
government debt is more than 60 per cent of GDP. The latest Commission
forecast, published last month suggested that only three countries -
Ireland, Luxembourg and Germany - would meet the deficit rule by the middle
of the decade. At present, a majority of EU members exceed the debt
guideline with four countries having stocks of debt that are more than 50
per cent in excess of the Maastricht limit. Belgium and Italy, two members
of the original EEC, have debt to GDP ratios of 138 per cent and 116 per
cent respectively while Greece and Ireland have debt of 114 per cent and 93
per cent of GDP.
Henning Christophersen, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs,
has predicted that during 1997 a majority of present EU members should
fulfil the criteria 'with a return to normal growth'.
But given the EU's relatively high real interest rates and typically
moderate growth rates, it is hard to imagine Belgium, Italy, Greece and
Ireland ever being able to meet the 60 per cent debt to GDP ratio.
Meanwhile, senior members of the Bundesbank central council and the German
constitutional court have taken public positions against any weakening of
the debt and deficit criteria to ease entry to Emu for member states.
So far, the political will of the 'hard core' of EU members to move towards
Emu has been remarkably strong. The project, too, is better anchored than
previous plans for a single currency and central bank because the Maastricht
process has the backing of a treaty.
But there have been signs this year that tight EU integration is losing
support among electors in several countries including France and Germany.
Much will depend on the lessons, if any, that policy makers draw from this
month's elections for the European parliament and the outcome of the
elections for the German national parliament in October and French
presidential elections in early 1995.
When the EU member states convene a planned inter-governmental conference in
1996 to discuss the progress being made towards Emu, improved economic
conditions in continental Europe could give the project a fair wind.
But the big decisions on whether Europe gets a single currency and central
bank for its next millennium will depend on politics.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (7): Flair, boldness and originality -
Fashion houses win a growing reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GREENWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium is best known for beer, frites, chocolate - and fashion. Next to the
old Belgian brand-names of Stella Artois and Cote d'Or, a host of new names
is making its mark in the international fashion world.
Dries Van Noten, Anne Demeulemeester, Dirk Van Saene and Walter Van
Beirendonck may not be as big as Chanel and Yves St Laurent, or as famous as
Armani and Lagerfeld; but their labels are much sought after among the
cognoscenti and word is spreading fast.
The new Belgian designers can be spotted today in stores ranging from
Bergdorf Goodman in New York and Nieman Marcus in Los Angeles to Whistles
and Joseph in London, Joyce in Hong Kong, and to outlets in an increasingly
fashion-conscious Tokyo. Back at home, Queen Fabiola has become an
ambassador for the Belgian fashion industry, sporting Watelet dresses,
Strelli coats, Marie Storms jewellery and, always, the Delvaux handbag.
The rise of contemporary Belgian fashion began in the early 1980s in
Antwerp, at the Academie Royale, the town's now famous art school. It was
driven by a small group of talented, avant garde and ambitious students who
became known as the Antwerp Six.
The Belgian government helped to promote these designers not through direct
financial aid but through a competition known as the Golden Spindle.
Originally set up to give a shot-in-the-arm to the ailing textile industry,
the award acted as a magnet for designer talent, helping young cash-strapped
artists to forge an image. Still, these were hard times. Dirk Van Saene
recalls how they all shared the same van for a fashion show in London.
Today, the collective approach is out. Each designer wants to be treated as
an individual with a distinct label. Martin Margiela is typical of the
contemporary Belgian style, with his unfinished edges, asymetrical hemlines
and recycled material. This deconstructionist mode marks a clear break from
the glitz and glamour of the 1980s and reflects a more restrained style for
the politically chic, environmentally correct 1990s.
Dirk Van Saene, who has had his ups and downs in the volatile fashion
business, believes the market is developing in two directions. In one corner
stand the large multi-label department stores who can be expected to
dominate the market in terms of volume; but there will always be plenty of
room and profits for the specialist stores with the small exclusive labels.
The public is always looking for something exclusive and will always be
willing to pay for it, he says. That does not mean that customers want to
wrap themselves in the excesses of the catwalk; rather they are looking for
something simple, serene and understated.
Van Saene's latest collection is simple and elegant, reminiscent of the
early 1960s and Jackie Onassis. It is hand-finished in luxurious materials -
and expensive. With only 16 clients, he estimates that he generated a
turnover of around BF 6m. He relies on ateliers in the Ghent, Brussels and
Antwerp region, all paid on a piece-work basis; but his textiles come from
Ireland, Scotland, Italy and France.
Walter Van Beirendonck found it impossible to produce his line in Belgium,
preferring instead the more sophisticated technical skills of northern
Italy. Seated in the Academie Royale overseeing a student show earlier this
month, Van Beirendonck cut an imposing figure with his shaven head, beard
and fingers armour-plated in silver. His approach to the market is
two-pronged.
First, there is a commercial line called W. &amp; L. T. - code for Wild and
Lethal Trash. His publicity states flatly: 'WALT is colour. WALT is style.'
Translated, this means affordable, available and adaptable - the Walt
fashion philosophy. In practice, it means fun clothes for the street:
T-shirts for BFr 1,500 (Dollars 45); sweaters for BFr 5,000. All are
produced and distributed by Mustang Italia, part of the German Mustang
Group.
Second, Van Beirendonck has for the past three years run a separate
collection of knitwear which draws its inspiration from Naive Art. The style
is bright and humorous. Dresses and sweaters range from BFr 15,000 to BFr
35,000. Sold world-wide, he claims these high priced items are in enough
demand to be recession-proof.
Traditional Belgian industry has not been slow to spot the demand for avant
garde Belgian products. In 1985, Monarca, an old Belgian family shoe
company, adopted Dirk Bikkemberg who had just won the Golden Spindle
competition.
Today, Monarca produces around 15,000 pairs of Bikkemberg shoes annually
from its factory in Lier, just outside Antwerp. The shoes are made of
Belgian and Italian leather, for distribution in markets ranging from
Switzerland to the US. Bikkemberg says its complete line of shoes, knitwear,
clothing and accessories generated BFr 25m-30m last year.
Such talk of facts and figures are anathema to Gerald Watelet, the
self-styled 'imposter' on the Belgium fashion scene. This youthful,
audacious 30-year-old from southern Belgium knows little of art schools, or
the deconstructionist mode; but he has made his name on sheer talent - and
an unusual partnership with a Flemish architect called Norbert Norman.
Watelet was brought up in Namur, Wallonia. In line with his parents' wishes,
he steered clear of the fashion world and trained in the hotel business. At
21, he became the youngest maitre d'hotel in Belgium. But before long he
switched direction, to indulge his lifelong passion for elegance.
He and Norman opened a haute couture salon in Brussels. Today, located in
the prestigious Avenue Louise, they sell 80 per cent of their products to
Belgians. Their clientele are predominately working women aged 40 to 65
seeking a simple, timeless mode. For Watelet, couture is not just a fashion
show; it is about cut, and what people can wear in practice.
Watelet and his team exemplify French fantasy and Flemish business acumen in
action and stress timely deliveries, superior quality and high visibility.
It looks like a winning combination - and it explains why Belgian fashion is
here to stay.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (6): Intact after the earthquake - The
aftermath of the upheaval in the government bonds market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most revolutions pass Belgium by. Yet even the most conservative
practitioners in the Kingdom's financial markets have understood the wisdom
of Edmund Burke's dictum that it is necessary to reform in order to
preserve.
The changes underway in Belgium cannot claim to match the Anglo-Saxon 'Big
Bang' which shook New York in the 1970s or the City of London in the 1980s.
Yet they are significant in Belgian terms.
Over the past five years, the country has witnessed a restructuring of the
government bond market; the introduction of an active market in short-term
Treasury bills; and the creation of a Belgian Futures and Options Exchange
(Belfox) - all of which have increased the liquidity of the domestic bond
market dramatically.
'It shows you can have an earthquake without the demolition,' says Mr Peter
Praet, chief economist of Generale de Banque.
Little Bang began in 1989 when Mr Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance
minister, decided to restructure the government bond market in a fashion
similar to changes already underway in neighbouring France.
The reforms meant scrapping the traditional means of financing public debt
through a favoured consortium of banks, along with interest rates set by the
National Bank of Belgium.
The old system was cosy, profitable and uncompetitive. A secondary market
barely existed; and the intricate tax processing of 'classic' government
bonds kept foreign investors away. And the banks themselves were lagging
behind their European counterparts in innovation.
Mr Maystadt, who has since become one of the most respected finance
ministers in the European Union, calculated that he could get a better price
for government debt by opening up the market. He was right: the new, highly
liquid 20-year, 10-year, and short-term linear bonds (OLOs) have saved the
Belgian government billions of francs, according to Mr Praet. With an
outstanding net debt of BFr9,000bn, Belgium's public debt ratio to GDP is
hovering around 125 per cent - higher than Italy's. Last year alone, the
debt increased by BFr784bn, double the actual budget deficit.
This makes the government bond market one of the most important in Europe.
But it also explains why Mr Maystadt, a fervent advocate of European
monetary union, is looking to save every sou so as to meet the demanding
Maastricht criteria required to join EMU.
In 1993, the state raised BFr1.530bn, while finding investors for converting
BFr601bn in long-term OLOs. Mr Jean-Paul Parmentier, head of fixed income
bonds at Kredietbank in Brussels, argues that the more flexible management
of debt helped tide the government over a sticky summer when the franc came
under speculative attack.
Ms Jane Edwards, economist with Lehman Brothers in London, agrees. In her
opinion, the National Bank's success in narrowing to within a hair's breadth
the spread in short-term interest rates with Germany, while maintaining the
currency link with the Deutsche Mark, has been 'remarkable'.
Similarly, the spread in 10-year bonds has narrowed from around 100 basis
points at the start of the year to between 80 and 85 basis points, while
other countries such as France have watched spreads widen.
Some bond market observers believe that the Dehaene government would like to
exploit this new-found flexibility, perhaps by mining the short-end of the
market, where interest rates are lower. The reason is that, with only two
budgets remaining until the European Commission's 1996 review of EU member
states' economic (and debt) performance, the government wants to produce the
best debt figures possible ahead of a political judgment on EMU.
Such a move could, however, strain the official policy of consolidating the
debt into long-term, stable debt. It also assumes that the recent rise in
long-term interest rates in Europe is temporary only. (Any further upward
trend would, of course, cost the government money). Mr Maystadt insists that
judgments on refinancing debt are taken according to commercial logic, and
there is no special effort to move into two- or three-year covenants.
In the minister's view, the second phase in Belgium's reform programme
should be to promote the diversification of products and stimulate greater
competition among operators. There is plenty of scope.
A recent Generale de Banque study argued that Belgian investors interested
in bonds still have a restricted choice in their home country, and could be
wooed more effectively.
The study estimated that Belgians bought an estimated BFr350bn to BFr400bn
in foreign bonds, around one third of which was in Luxembourg francs (an
indication of how much of Belgian savings is sloshing around in neighbouring
Luxembourg, where there is no withholding tax).
Small investors have been attracted by treasury certificates, but Generale
de Banque still estimates that financial and credit institutions are the
largest investor group with an 83 per cent share.
What else is to be done? Belfox could certainly borrow some of the liquidity
which the OLOs enjoy. Its average daily volume is increasing; but a range of
between 2,000 to 3,000 contracts a day shows that it is much less liquid
than in Germany.
Second, the private bond market could be nourished. The market is small, and
Belgian companies still seem wary of issuing securitised debt in Belgium,
mainly on cost grounds.
Third, there is more scope for innovation in the market for longer term
index contracts, for example for one to two years.
But Mr Maystadt argues, correctly, that Little Bang has forced the banks to
come up with new derivative products. Recent changes in the law should open
the door to the kind of 'securitisation' of bank loans and mortgages which
is routine in the US.
In short, those in Belgium who thought that Little Bang would be a zero sum
game - with either the government or the banks losing out to competition -
have been proved wrong. Belgium's quiet financial revolution, as far as it
goes, has paid off for both sides.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (4): Stable pound confounds
cynics - Sterling has benefited from being on the sidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the excitement of 1992, when sterling left the exchange rate
mechanism, the pound has been remarkably stable.
Apart from a brief dip in February and March of 1993, the pound has tended
to trade in a range around the DM2.50 level and in an even narrower band
around Dollars 1.50.
In part, this is because the worst fears aroused at the time of the ERM
departure have not been realised. For once, devaluation has not led to a
resurgence of inflation in the UK. Indeed, underlying inflation (excluding
mortgage payments) has dropped to its lowest level since the 1960s.
Furthermore, throughout 1993, the UK's status, along with the US, as one of
the few growing economies in the developed world made it a home for
portfolio capital.
Sterling has also benefited from being on the foreign exchange sidelines
over the past 18 months. Traders' focus has been on the breakdown of the
narrow band ERM and on the dollar/yen cross-rate.
Over the medium term, there are probably two key factors for sterling. The
first is whether Britain has conquered its old problems - high inflation and
balance of payments crises - or whether the demons will return as soon as
the recovery hits its stride. The second is whether the Conservative party
is merely suffering its normal mid-term blues or is finally going to lose
office.
The government has worked hard to try to create credibility for its economic
policies after the ignominious departure from the ERM. A new monetary
framework has been created, with the Bank of England at its forefront.
Underlying inflation is now targeted at 1-4 per cent, with the aim of
getting the rate into the lower half of the range by the end of the
parliament.
The Bank writes quarterly inflation reports, is allowed to choose the timing
of base rate changes and has its views aired in the minutes of the monthly
monetary meetings. All this is designed to reassure financial markets that
'steady Eddie' George, the Bank governor, is looking after their interests,
rather than inflation-prone politicians.
The new arrangements have not gone without a hitch. February's decision to
cut base rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.25 per cent was not
received well by the markets, and may have limited the scope for further
cuts.
Gilt markets have consistently signalled inflationary expectations of 4 per
cent or so, indicating some scepticism about the government's ability to
meet its target. Signs of a pick-up in the annual growth rate of average
earnings will have confirmed bearish fears. Nevertheless, producer price
figures and survey details, continue to show that inflationary pressures are
subdued.
On the balance of payments problem, Mark Geddes, treasury economist at
Midland Global Markets, says that while 'recovery in Europe should
increasingly help UK exporters, the size of the current account deficit
following several years of below trend growth and a 10 per cent devaluation
of the pound, remains a worry. The inaccurate nature of current trade
statistics potentially disguises the true problem, and a prerequisite for
sterling's ability to maintain a value above DM2.50 over the longer term
will be a stabilisation in the trade deficit.'
Trade within the European Union is now recorded under the Intrastat system,
based on the value added tax returns, and this has led some to believe that
the statistics are under-recording imports. Furthermore, official figures
showing that exporters have been raising prices, rather than chasing market
share, are contradicted by Confederation of British Industry evidence.
Other fundamental factors - economic growth and interest rates - may be
moving in opposite directions. Keith Skeoch, director of research at James
Capel, feels that the medium-term outlook for sterling is quite good. On
interest rates he expects 'German rates will get down to around 3 per cent
on the back of sluggish growth and low inflation, while there is increasing
evidence that we are close to the bottom of the base rate cycle in the UK.
The pound should start to benefit from a positive interest rate
differential.'
He also believes that rate differentials will help the dollar strengthen
against the D-Mark, and adds that 'sterling normally does reasonably well in
an environment where the dollar is running'. He believes the pound could
climb to DM2.70.
However, because European countries are expected to come out of recession
this year, Mr Geddes thinks that Britain's 'growth advantage' will start to
disappear.
The political outlook might not seem to matter, given that the government
does not have to call an election until 1997. But, according to Skeoch, 'the
main uncertainty in the medium term is that Major stays and is perceived by
the markets as a lame duck PM.'
So pronounced is sterling's record of depreciation, that cynics will need
overwhelming evidence to believe the bull case for the pound. That evidence,
or the depressingly familiar bearish story, can only come when the UK is
further advanced in its recovery, and cyclical factors have had their
maximum chance to inflict damage on the inflation and balance of payments
numbers.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (3): Yen for the yen hits dollar
 -The strong Japanese currency has upset business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent trade friction with the US has been highlighted by the Japanese
media as the main reason for the yen's rise, but a closer look indicates
that there may be more technical forces at work.
The capital flows into and out of Japan provide some explanation for the
recent trend of a rising yen and a weakening dollar - Japanese investing
less in overseas bonds, shares, and golf courses, and foreign investors
buying yen to purchase Japanese shares.
During the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s, Japanese institutional
investors were the largest suppliers of capital in the international
markets. According to the Bank of Japan annual net outflow of long-term
capital averaged Dollars 110bn between 1985 and 1989. This fell sharply in
the 1990s and in 1992 there was a total outflow of Dollars 28.5bn while last
year the outflow was Dollars 78.3bn.
The ratio of overseas securities to total investment assets at Japanese life
assurers, the country's leading institutional investors, for instance, fell
to 9.2 per cent at the end of last year, down from 15.7 per cent in 1989.
The customary repatriation of funds during the January-March quarter, the
final quarter of the business year, when institutions sell their foreign
securities holdings to shore up dwindling profits, has also put downward
pressure on the dollar and pushed up the yen.
The liquidation of US real estate assets has had the same effect. Last year,
Japanese corporations sold or partially disposed of Dollars 17.59bn of US
properties, nearly a quarter of the total US property portfolio built up by
the Japanese institutions since the start of the investment boom in 1985,
according to Kenneth Leventhal, the US accountancy firm.
Japanese investors have also reduced the purchase of US financial assets
this year because of a tightening of US interest rates. During the final
quarter of last year, Japanese institutions bought Dollars 37.5bn of US
shares and bonds. That figure declined sharply to Dollars 3.5bn for the
first two months of this year.
Meanwhile, the buying of Japanese shares by overseas investors has also
helped boost the yen. The Bank of Japan says overseas investment in Japanese
stocks was a record Dollars 34.5bn during the first quarter, the demand
coming mainly from US pension funds.
The strong yen has triggered an outcry from the business community, because
it affects severely the competitiveness of Japanese companies. The Economic
Planning Agency estimates that Japan's export industries are on average
competitive at Y117 to the dollar. The Keidanren, the business leaders'
federation, reckons each 5 per cent rise in the yen-dollar rate knocks 0.3
of a percentage point off annual gross domestic product growth.
But while capital flows may influence the underlying strength of the yen,
much of the latest volatility has been caused by speculators. The breakdown
of the US-Japan bilateral trade talks - the US is pressurising Japan to cut
its large current account surplus by stimulating demand and improving market
access - prompted expectations that the US will use the currency market to
curb Japanese exports, triggering aggressive buying of the yen against the
dollar.
But in late April, when the dollar looked like falling to a record low,
below Y100, the US Federal Reserve and other central banks stepped in to
support the US currency, not least because of the destabilising effect of
dollar weakness on the US bond market.
Central bank intervention in itself is normally insufficient to support a
currency, but some analysts believe that the recent rise in US interest
rates, and the easing of short-term money market rates in Japan, will widen
interest rate differentials enough to curb the further rise of the yen.
Shrinkage of Japan's current account surplus, and lower capital inflows,
would assist further.
With the US administration seemingly adopting a more moderate stance towards
Japan, Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, believes that the yen's appreciation has
entered the final phase. 'Over the next few months the yen is expected to
weaken toward an exchange rate of Y110 to the dollar,' it says. Others,
however, believe the market may yet test the Y100 level before weakening.
With both US and Japanese trade officials making positive noises on
bilateral trade, the volatility on the currency market which accompanied the
breakdown of the talks in March will probably be reduced. Although
comprehensive tax reforms may be delayed, due to the minority government, an
announcement of a continued income tax cut into next fiscal year is expected
to be acceptable to the US.
A key issue is when Japanese institutions will start investing overseas?
Keeping funds in the domestic markets will not yield attractive returns. The
central bank has eased short-term interest rates to historical lows of less
than 2.1 per cent, and the domestic bond market offers little better
returns, with the compound yield at around 3.8 per cent.
However, fears of suffering currency losses on overseas investments as the
yen appreciates has kept most investors cautious. The sharp decline in
unrealised profits due to the stock market plunge has also wiped out the
cushion for possible investment losses, and eroded the Japanese
institutions' ability to take risks.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (5): Europe's 'anchor' still
intact - The economic recovery has helped the German currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite consensus among economists that the dollar should rise against the
D-Mark during 1994, the German currency has proved stubbornly strong.
Economists put the D-Mark's resilience down to two factors - inherent
weaknesses in the outlook for the US currency, coupled with increasing
support from economic fundamentals for the D-Mark.
On the US front, economists cite a host of factors which led to dollar
weakness, despite the likelihood of further Fed tightening of interest
rates. These range from investors' demand for a higher yield on US
securities to compensate for the risks of holding such investments after a
period of high volatility in the US government bond market, to the
perception that President Bill Clinton's administration considers it
politically desirable to see a weaker dollar versus the yen to enhance the
US's trading position relative to Japan.
While trade relations between Japan and the US do not directly touch the US
currency's relationship with the D-Mark, the D-Mark strengthens by default
as a result. The German currency is helped by the growing conviction that
Germany is pulling out of its worst recession since the second world war.
Expectations that the German economy is to endure a double-dip downturn - ie
a lurch downwards this summer - have been contradicted by a mass of economic
data suggesting that a more than modest recovery is under way.
Figures on order intake, exports and employment, coupled with increasingly
bullish polls of business expectations and a spate of good news from the
corporate sector, have changed the climate of expectations. One telling
expression of this was the forecast in April from four out of five of
Germany's leading economic institutes: they predict a pan-German growth rate
of 1.5 per cent for the year, representing a slow but sure recovery.
Financial institutions are even more optimistic: Dresdner Bank, for example,
expects the economy to grow by 2 per cent.
The rosier outlook for the economy has forced the financial markets to
revise their expectations on the scale and timing of further cuts in
short-term interest rates. The rationale for the change in outlook is that
recovery makes it more likely that the Bundesbank will start increasing
interest rates again to check the inflationary impact of better than
expected growth.
Despite economists' expectations of further cuts in the discount rate during
the year, euromark futures - which give rates for three-month borrowing -
tell a more pessimistic story. They suggest that the interest rates will
reach a low point for the current monetary policy cycle in September this
year at 4.7 per cent, compared to the present 5.1 per cent three-month rate.
Thereafter rates will rise to 5.60 per cent by the end of next year, the
futures market suggests, a reversal of earlier expectations that rates would
carry on falling towards 4 per cent within 1994.
'This represents a sizeable correction in short-term rate expectations,'
comments Mr Joachim Fels at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt.
With German interest rates set to rise again as of the turn of the year, and
the German economy pulling out of the doldrums, it is not surprising that
the D-Mark's status as a 'safe haven' currency is intact. This is true in
respect of the US dollar - and in Europe where the D-Mark has in the medium
and long-term staged a dramatic appreciation against other currencies.
Despite doubts, the D-Mark has preserved its role as the 'anchor currency'
for Europe and the currencies belonging to the slimmed-down European
exchange rate mechanism.
The appreciation of the D-Mark against certain European currencies since the
end of 1991 (up 29 per cent against Spanish peseta, 27 per cent versus the
Italian Lire and 14 per cent against the pound ) has worsened the
competitive position of German industry - but the corrective in industry's
favour will come not via a depreciation in the nominal value of the D-Mark.
Germany will strive to regain its competitiveness through an improvement in
labour costs.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (2): Japanese trade row clouds
the future - More turbulence may lie ahead for the US currency in the short
term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After opening the year on a bullish note, supported by the US economy's
strong performance and expectations of higher domestic interest rates, the
dollar dropped sharply in April as short-term negative influences - an
ill-conceived government dollar policy, deteriorating US-Japan trade
relations, and political uncertainties at home and abroad (notably in Korea
and Mexico) - overwhelmed the positive fundamentals. The situation
deteriorated so quickly that by early May massive intervention by up to 17
central banks was required to halt the US currency's free fall.
While the central banks' actions appeared to have set a short-term floor for
the dollar around DM1.65 and Y104, the foreign exchange markets wonder what
the next six to 12 months holds for the beleaguered greenback: further
depreciation, or recovery?
Although currency analysts warn that more turbulence may lie ahead in the
short term, most feel that the outlook is brighter for the dollar, if only
because the Clinton administration - after attempting to 'talk down' the
dollar to narrow the trade gap with Japan - has finally changed the course
of its policy.
Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Lehman Brothers, says: 'We've seen
the bottom in the dollar. The main reason is that the US administration has
(realised) that allowing the perception to exist that the US has a dollar
depreciation policy was a big mistake. It was clearly counter-productive,
because (any benefit derived from) the opening of Japanese markets that
might have come from using the dollar as a political club against Japan was
much less than the political cost of the higher interest rates that come off
a lower dollar.'
Realising that it cannot afford, for political reasons, to allow a weaker
dollar to pull long-term interest rates higher, the US government is now
committed, in word and deed, to support the US currency against the yen and
the D-Mark.
John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, says: 'There were no magic
wands waved by the intervention that will completely change the outlook for
currencies. Yet, the G7's actions, and the change in US policy regarding the
dollar . . . have truncated the downside risks for the dollar. The G7 is not
trying to draw a line in the sand, or define a specific target band for
currencies - but the message is clear. Additional dollar depreciation,
especially in the context of weakening capital markets, will be resisted by
the US authorities, with the co-operation of other central banks.'
Analysts are confident that the foreign exchange market has got this
message, because institutional investors and currency speculators realise
that the central banks have the room within their domestic monetary
frameworks to take whatever action is needed to protect the dollar. As Mr
Lipsky puts it: 'There is no policy dilemma facing central banks in
supporting the dollar,' because the needs of European and Japanese economies
are likely to require further stimulation from easier monetary policy in the
near future.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut 50 basis points off German interest rates
on May 11, for example, was taken with one eye fixed on the dollar. Although
the Bundesbank explained the move in purely domestic economic terms, it was
in its interests to provide the dollar with a much-needed lift, for a weak
US currency was posing a danger to Germany's export recovery.
The May cut in German rates should shift the interest rate differentials
further in the US currency's favour if, as is expected, the Federal Reserve
continues to tighten US monetary policy during the late spring and early
summer.
Much also depends on how US financial markets behave over the coming months.
Declines in the price of US assets was one of the factors behind the
dollar's recent slide. Anticipating trouble ahead for the inflation-obsessed
US bond market, and for the vulnerable and US stock market, international
investors steered clear of dollar-denominated assets during March and April.
Ironically, further monetary tightening by the Fed - normally negative for
bond and equity prices - might come to the US markets', and thus the
dollar's, rescue. If, by raising rates a few more notches the Fed convinces
the bond market that it will be able to stave off a resurgence of inflation,
long-term bond yields should start to come down. This would breathe new life
into US equities, and in the process make international investors more
likely to buy dollars to purchase US financial assets.
While the US administration's new dollar policy, improving interest rate
differentials, and a possible strengthening in US financial markets are all
factors in the dollar's favour over the coming months, there is one cloud
hovering above the US currency that will not go away: US-Japanese trade
relations.
The failure of the new Japanese prime minister Tsutomu Hata to build a
majority in parliament makes another general election likely, probably after
the passage of the next fiscal budget in June. With so much uncertainty
surrounding the political situation in Japan, an early resolution of the
trade dispute between the US and Japan cannot be expected. Consequently, the
dollar is likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term to speculative
selling against the yen. Some analysts predict that the US currency could
fall through the headline-grabbing Y100 level, albeit only temporarily.
Over the longer-term, however, analysts feel confident that a gradual
improvement in the US's trade balance with Japan, prompted by a
strengthening US export sector and some modest opening up of Japanese
markets to overseas goods, will allow the dollar to climb back from its lows
against the yen.
Mr Sinai at Lehman envisages the dollar reaching Y105 by midsummer, then
appreciating to Y110 or more by the end of the year, while Mr Lipsky at
Salomon makes a similar prediction, forecasting Y110 by the year end.
As for the dollar/DM rate, analysts expect a widening differential between
the two countries' interest rates and economic performance to boost the
dollar to at least DM1.70 by the summer and DM1.75 by Christmas.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (5): The fight goes on - Industry's bid to
contain costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like most other countries in the European Union, Belgium is only just
emerging from a long and hard recession. With the fragile recovery has come
a revival of hope in the country's manufacturing sector. But the problems
for heavy industry are far from over.
The sector remains a robust and important part of the Belgian economy.
Manufacturing accounts for roughly a quarter of gross domestic product, and
employs about 28 per cent of the labour force. But exceptionally high social
security costs have made industrial employers fear that Belgian enterprise
is pricing itself out of the market.
'We are the only country in the world where we still have automatic and
general indexation of salaries, even during a recession,' says Georges
Jacobs, president of UCB, the chemical and pharmaceutical group, and head of
the Federation of Belgian Enterprise. 'We have the most generous social
security system in the world.'
The problem has become something of a fixation with Belgian industrialists.
According to another prominent company president, workers in Antwerp are 20
times more expensive than workers doing the same thing just over the border
in Rotterdam, Holland.
Prompted by the pain of recession, the government last year took action to
lower employers' costs. This included a BFr75bn cut in social security
expenditure and a pay increase limit of 2 per cent for the next three years,
effectively a freeze on wages once inflation was taken into account. But the
Federation for Belgian Enterprise argues that the measures were inadequate.
'The government has done something, but it has not gone far enough,' says Mr
Jacobs, head of the FEB. 'They are not doing enough to encourage Belgian
enterprise.'
If ever there was a time for the government to assist the overburdened
manufacturing sector, last year's company results show that today is the
ideal time. According to figures from the FEB most industrial sectors
experienced their first rise in production in December last year, for the
first time since the end of 1992. But for the whole of 1993, figures were
negative virtually across the board. A sectoral breakdown shows:
METAL, ELECTRICAL: deliveries dropped by 3.4 per cent in 1993, although
excluding cars, the drop was a more worrying 7 per cent. The financial
health of the sector is meanwhile threatened by the high number of
restructurings undertaken last year and a rise in bankruptcies. Orders from
other countries, however, picked up towards the end of last year and should
help the sector stabilise in this.
STEEL: action by the European Union to stabilise steel prices should help
the Belgian steel sector recover from the recession, although high social
security costs continue to diminish the competitiveness of this sector
against other EU producers.
CHEMICALS: This year is likely to be better than the last, following a
stabilisation of production in the fourth quarter of 1993. Prices have
stopped falling and in certain sectors prices have begun a timid rise.
TEXTILES: production dropped by 7.6 per cent in the first half of the year
and by 5 per cent in the second. However, exports of carpets - in which
Belgium leads the world - rose a spectacular 58.9 per cent measured by
volume in 1993, principally thanks to exports of cheap carpets to Eastern
Europe.
According to the companies themselves, the worst is over. Solvay, the
chemicals company, and Belgium's second biggest enterprise, suffered
particularly badly from the world recession. Cheap imports of soda ash from
Eastern Europe and the US also prompted the need to restructure.
As a result, 11 consecutive years of profit came to an end in 1993 with a
spectacular annual loss of BFr6.9bn. Almost Bfr3bn of the loss was caused by
restructuring costs after the closure of several plants last year including
two soda ash plants, one in Belgium and one in Germany, and a PVC plant in
Austria.
Now, however, the company is hoping for a better year. It expects a very
slow recovery this year, and faster growth next year. The pick-up will be
assisted by the start of production of hydrogen peroxide at a new plant in
eastern Germany.
Prospects are also rosier at Petrofina, Belgium's largest industrial group.
Like Solvay, the company was hit by the global recession,although it managed
to stay in profit last year.
The group has refocused on core activities, abandoning those where the
company was not competitive, such as coal, shipping, insurance, and
property. It now expects a 5 per cent gain in productivity this year through
investment and the gradual shedding of 2,000 jobs since 1991. A BFr26bn
upgrading of its Antwerp refinery should be complete by September, and the
company expects oil and gas output to go up 15 per cent this year.
At UCB, Mr Jacobs is sanguine about prospects for his enterprise. He
describes the company, which concentrates on a fairly narrow range of
pharmaceuticals, films and packaging, as 'the small, clever guy'. Following
a 17 per cent drop in profits last year, he now predicts that profits will
be 'at a good level' this year.
So overall, Belgium's manufacturing sector can probably expect a reprieve
this year from the doldrums of 1993, even if growth remains unimpressive. Mr
Gert Lambrecht, a senior economist at Kredietbank, one of Belgium's biggest
banks, says activity will be weak, but it won't fall further.
'It is also likely that wage costs will remain under control,' he says,
adding that lower short term interest rates and a bounce back from two years
of falling capital investment will boost growth in the manufacturing sector.
Furthermore, the far reaching restructuring undertaken by many of Belgium's
big industrial companies such as Solvay should start to pay off this year
and next, restoring prosperity to the sector.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (2): Flemings, Walloons, Germans -
Pluralist Belgium has loosened its unitary ties in favour of federalism.
Emma Tucker asks if it will work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over a year ago a complex and protracted process reached its conclusion
in Belgium. The small country, with a population of barely 10m, completed
its change from a highly centralised, unitary state into a federation of
regions and language communities.
The country's divisions have many permutations. There are two main cultural
communities - the Flemish and the French, plus a smaller German community.
These occupy three distinct regions - Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels.
The risk with federalism is one of duplication and hence inefficiency. As a
Walloon government official put it: 'There is a danger that we have
complicated the set-up so much, that it has become ineffective.'
But one year on, the verdict on fully-fledged federalism is so far, so good.
Rather than complicating the process of government, the new system has made
it simpler.
'Thirty to forty years of Belgium as a unitary state did not work,' says
Xavier Mabille, a Belgian political analyst. 'There is less risk of doubling
now than before.'
The process towards federalism began way back in 1970 when the existence of
two main cultural communities and three regions was recognised under the
constitution. In 1980 the communities were given, in addition to cultural
responsibilities such as language-use and the arts, responsibility for areas
that could be dealt with at the 'personal' level. This covered policies for
the elderly and the handicapped, for example. Meanwhile, regional
institutions were given responsibility for areas such as the environment,
rural development and the economy.
In 1988, powers for both the communities and the regions were enlarged to
include education, public works, transport, science policy and oversight of
the communes and provinces within the regions. The communities and regions
were also given responsibility for their own finances.
Last year, the transition was completed. Under an agreement known as the St
Michael accords, Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels were granted their own,
directly elected parliaments. The parliamentary bodies of the communities
were also to be elected directly. Significantly, powers over foreign trade,
agriculture, scientific policy and some aspects of international relations
were transferred to the regions and the language communities.
Since last year many of the fears of those who distrusted federalism have
been allayed.
'I would have preferred not to live in a Federal State, but in a regional
one,' says Mr Charles Picque, president of the Brussels region. 'But we have
to live with it, and organise our structures around it.'
Of all the administrators facing last year's dramatic changes, those in the
Brussels region probably had most to fear. As a bilingual region - part of
it is Dutch speaking, while most in the capital speak French - the stresses
were likely to show up more here than elsewhere.
'With two communities, there is a temptation for separatism,' says Mr
Picque. But for all his doubts, and even during a long recession, such
forces have remained at bay. More troubling in the short term, are the
economic implications of federalism, if Belgium the federal state - a keen
and dedicated member of the European Union - is to meet the convergence
criteria for monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty.
One fear of Mr Peter Praet, senior economist at Kredietbank, Belgium's
leading bank, is that the new arrangements will make it very difficult for
Belgium to meet Maastricht's stringent demands, particularly on control of
the budget.
The real test will come in 1996, by which time Belgium, in order to take
part in a single currency, will have to have reduced its notoriously
run-away government deficit to just 3 per cent of GDP.
The new federalism also throws up potential problems for foreign policy.
Since last year, Belgium's three regions have had the right to sign treaties
with other nations. Indeed, Flanders - the most chauvinistic of the three
regions - has already signed a treaty on water with the Netherlands.
Inevitably, such a devolution diminishes the standing of the Federal
government.
Attitudes towards these new powers vary from region to region. Mr Luc van
den Brande, president of the government of Flanders, is an enthusiast. The
right to sign treaties will, he says, 'do much to stimulate and facilitate
relations between Flanders and its European and international partners'. In
line with this, Flanders has set up a network of 70 economic representatives
over five continents. It also has its own diplomats in Vienna, The Hague,
Washington, Tokyo and Brussels.
His approach contrasts sharply with that of Mr Picque. 'It may be possible
for us to sign treaties with other nations, but it is unlikely that the UK
or France would bother to sign treaties with a region,' he says. As far as
Brussels is concerned, it will continue to operate through the Federal
government's embassies.
Another problem is that of transfers of resources. With regions free to
collect certain taxes, there is a danger of a two-tier system developing in
and around Brussels. Those who are wealthy enough to commute are gradually
moving out of the Brussels region, to set up home just over the border in
Flanders where taxes are lower. As a result, the tax base in Brussels is
gradually shrinking, leaving the regional government short of funds and
creating resentment that it has to pay for the city's infrastructure used
daily by high numbers of 'free-riders'.
Many of these areas could in the future create resentments and tensions.
Further, the ambitions of the regions differ widely. With Wallonia and
Brussels more or less content with the current set-up, Mr van den Brande has
publicly stated his desire for a totally independent Flanders.
Three things however, should act as a brake on the separatist forces.
Firstly the monarchy, very much a symbol of Belgian's unity. Secondly, the
city of Brussels and the problem of how, if total independence should be
granted to the regions, the city would be split. Thirdly, there is the
Belgian people's common history and a high level of intermarriage. These
aspects, together with the lack of any religious tension, should ensure that
at least for the time being, the loose federation will continue to thrive.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (4): 'This is only the beginning' -
Interview, Luc van den Brande, Flanders' regional leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month, when football fever grips the world, Mr Luc van den Brande,
minister-president of the Flemish government, will be supporting the Belgian
team, the Red Devils, writes EMMA TUCKER.
As yet, no Flanders team exists for him to support. Like the Belgian
monarchy, the Red Devils remain one of a handful of institutions that
inspire people like Mr van den Brande to call themselves Belgian, even if it
is just for the duration of a football match.
The rest of the time, Mr van den Brande is without question Flemish.
Minister-president of the region since 1992, he has steered Flanders through
its first year of full federalism.
For the 49 year old politician this is only the beginning. Although wary of
what he says - he has been rebuked by the King for thinly-veiled calls for
Flemish independence - Mr van den Brande is keen to see yet more powers
devolved to the regions. 'Is this the end?' he asks of last year's St
Michael agreements, which completed Belgium's long transition from a unitary
state to a loose federation. 'I don't think so. It is possible that new
competences, such as social security, will be transferred to the regions,
but linked to the new framework.'
'The debate in my view does not revolve around whether or not the Belgian
level of government is disappearing, but around the way in which the Flemish
and French-speaking communities may best live together in a modern federal
state,' he says. 'I believe that the Flemish and French-speaking communities
must in future work out, on a basis of equality, what it is they wish to
undertake jointly and are able to do better jointly.'
He maintains that the conditions for federalism, together with consensus
where required at a national level, are now in place. For a start, the St
Michael accords have lowered the tension of Belgian politics.
For example, Mr van den Brande says that two years ago a Belgian from
Flanders would not have wanted to turn up for the annual festivities in
Namur, capital of French speaking Wallonia. 'Since St Michael the pressure
has become less,' he says. 'It was necessary to have this reform. It was the
best way of managing the controversies between the two major parts of the
country.'
Meanwhile, Flanders is making the most of its newly acquired
responsibilities, enthusiastically pursuing its own foreign policy on the
one hand, while remaining 'intense and loyal' to the Belgian diplomatic
service on the other. It has been particularly active on trade, using the
Flemish Foreign Trade Board as a defender and promoter of Flemish exports.
On the economics front, Mr van den Brande would like to see the levying of
social security transferred to the regions, not least because in order to
attract foreign investment to Flanders, he would like the authority to lower
employers' costs. 'It is not normal for us to have our own regional
industrial policy, but to not have any say over social security,' he says.
Although he will not put a date on it - preferring instead to talk about
Belgium's natural evolution - the Flemish minister president's ultimate aim
is to see an even more decentralised Belgium, in which the federal
government does little more than act as an 'accepted go between' for the
regions.
Such a vision, he maintains, is not out of line with the process of European
integration, as it conforms to the notion of subsidiarity - devolving
decision-making down to the most appropriate level.
His ambitions for Flanders tie in nicely to such a structure. And by the
time Europe gets round to it, Flanders may even be sending its own football
team to the World Cup championship.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (1): Chastened traders yearn for
trend - Peter Norman assesses the outlook as the markets try to cope with
frustrated expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The time for easy pickings is over.
After several years of rapidly growing turnover and strong profit growth,
the global foreign exchange business is suffering.
The markets this year have had to adapt to adverse conditions and cope with
frustrated expectations. The dollar has been weak, instead of rising as
widely predicted. This year's bloodbath in the world's bond markets has
inflicted heavy losses on some of the more aggressive currency traders
leading to a shrinkage of liquidity and an injection of caution into their
activities.
'The mood among the big foreign exchange and bond players is grim,' says Jim
O'Neill, head of global research at Swiss Bank Corp in London. According to
one senior analyst, trading conditions 'are the worst they have been for six
years and some people have made big losses'.
The current gloom contrasts with the boom years of the early 1990s when
global turnover soared to Dollars 1,000bn a-day and currency traders and
investors were presented with a number of relatively safe bets.
With the industrial countries in recession, it was easy to work on the
assumption that interest rates were heading downwards and make money
accordingly. The market could also exploit policy errors, such as the
determination of the UK and Italian governments to defend sterling and the
lira in the European exchange rate mechanism until their forced exits in
September 1992.
The decision last August of the European Union's finance ministers to widen
the ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent either side of the system's
bilateral central rates from 2.25 per cent and 6 per cent previously,
removed one of the biggest one-way bets from the market at a stroke. The
French franc and British pound have been effectively sidelined in currency
trading this year.
Most action has been in the 'triad' currencies - the dollar, the yen and the
D-Mark. And it is in those currencies that some of the smartest operators
have come unstuck.
At New Year, the forecasters' consensus was that the dollar would fluctuate
between Y112 and Y114 and DM1.75 and DM1.78 between Easter and the end of
the year. Early last month, it was heading towards record low levels against
the yen and threatened to breach the psychologically important Y100 barrier.
The dollar remains groggy despite subsequent central bank intervention,
rising US interest rates and falling rates in Germany.
The dollar's weakness has been a reminder of how fickle markets can be. In
January, the dollar looked sure to rise because the US economy was generally
expected to grow faster than its main trading rivals, forcing interest rate
differentials to move in the dollar's favour as the US tightened monetary
conditions and Germany, and possibly Japan, eased.
Instead a US-Japanese confrontation on trade and the spill-over effects of
higher US interest rates on highly leveraged bond markets achieved the
reverse effect.
The Clinton administration's aggressive tactics and 'shoot-from-the-lip'
diplomacy to force Japan to cut its bilateral trade surplus with the US were
construed - rightly or wrongly - as signs that the US wanted a higher yen to
achieve its trade goals.
Open disagreement between President Bill Clinton and the former Japanese
prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, at a meeting on February 11 caught
speculative traders, including some lightly regulated offshore hedge funds
and the proprietary trading desks of some large investment banks, off guard.
As the US currency slumped in response to the trade news, they were forced
into a costly liquidation of positions built on borrowed funds in
anticipation of a rising dollar.
The decision of the Federal Reserve Board earlier in February to start
raising US interest rates was intended as a pre-emptive, confidence-building
strike against inflation. Instead, it caught the global bond markets
unprepared.
The subsequent scramble out of bonds caused heavy losses among highly
leveraged operators including hedge funds, destroying part of their capital
and curtailing their ability and willingness to indulge in further
speculation in the foreign exchange and other financial markets.
There had already been some victims from the ERM upheavals of 1992 and 1993,
including Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, which made the costly
mistake of backing sterling in 1992. This year's speculative turmoil has
claimed new scalps. George Soros, the financier who reported making Dollars
1bn during the 1992 sterling crisis, admitted losing Dollars 600m when a bet
against the yen went sour.
One senior analyst estimates that this year's trading losses have shrunk the
hedge funds' capital from around Dollars 30bn to Dollars 15bn. On the
assumption that such funds leverage their capital tenfold, their losses have
taken about Dollars 150bn in liquidity from the market. Possibly reflecting
the hedge funds' problems, recent attacks on the Greek drachma and
Portuguese escudo have appeared half-hearted compared with the assaults on
EU currencies in previous years.
This year's trading upsets have encouraged some other changes in behaviour.
Symptoms of a 'back-to-basics' trend are a determination among some banks to
pay more attention to customer business and a revived interest in
'fundamentals' in the analysis of currency movements.
More attention is being given to the global flow of funds. Some
fundamentalists ascribe the dollar's weakness to a continuing
diversification by US financial institutions, such as pension funds, of
their investments outside the US while Japanese investors are pulling back
from involvement abroad.
Others, such as Neil MacKinnon, Citibank's chief currency strategist, say
the market paid insufficient attention to 'volume analysis' showing that
market participants were very heavily invested in the dollar last summer.
That has meant little natural demand for the US currency even when it has
appeared a bargain.
Another group, including Mr O'Neill, a long-time dollar bear, argues that
the dollar is bound to be soft given the chronic US current account deficit
that has totalled Dollars 1,025bn since 1984. The International Monetary
Fund has forecast a continuing deterioration in the US current account to
Dollars 166bn in 1995 from Dollars 109bn last year.
If nothing else, constrained liquidity and increased uncertainty have
enhanced the power of one group of players: the central banks. Intervention
by up to 17 central banks headed by the US Federal Reserve successfully
halted a threatened fall by the dollar through the Y100 level last month.
But although this was the first instance of large-scale concerted
intervention since October 1992, it does not presage a new drive by the
leading industrial nations to enforce currency stability. The collapse of
communism and the installation of an 'America-first' administration have
weakened the ties among the Group of Seven nations. Concerted intervention,
if and when it takes place, will reflect an opportunist consensus or
temporary identity of interests among the big industrial powers and is
therefore likely to be a relatively rare event.
These various forces have left the market 'yearning for a trend to emerge',
says Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Union Bank of
Switzerland. After investing heavily in their foreign exchange operations in
recent years, few operators are happy with the present regime of relatively
small plays and correspondingly small gains.
A clear trend could appear if the current uncertainty over the dollar
crystallised into either a break with, or confirmation of, what remains of
the bullish consensus for the US currency. That would mean renewed
volatility in trading, offering a chance for this year's losers to rebuild
their profits.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (1): Faster recovery than expected -
Political and business leaders are trying to regain their confidence after
riding out Belgium's worst recession for 60 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Belgium is looking at a brighter future. After one of the most painful
recessions since the 1930s, the Kingdom is advancing again much more rapidly
than expected.
Economic recovery will bring relief for Belgium's beleaguered political and
business classes whose goal over the past 12 months can be summed up in one
word: survival.
Like all members of the European Union, Belgium has been buffeted by rising
unemployment, intermittent labour unrest and popular disillusionment with
politicians, few of whom can aspire to the stature of the immediate
post-World War II generation led by Paul-Henri Spaak.
The economic crisis peaked last summer when a wave of speculation threatened
to force the fragile coalition government led by Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene to abandon its policy of shadowing the D-Mark, a move which would
have put Belgium's long-standing anti-inflation strategy at risk.
Although siren calls were heard in favour of a UK-style dash for growth
through lower interest rates and a devaluation of the currency, the Dehaene
government and the Belgian National Bank stood firm. Together they refused
to break ranks on interest rates with their partners in France, Germany, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg - the informal hard currency club which continues
to enjoy the best prospects of forming a European monetary union later in
the decade.
Mr Dehaene plunged ahead instead with a 'global pact' between government and
employers, the most ambitious attempt to curb social spending since the
second world war. True, he failed in the end to win the support of the
trades unions; but the lengthy political bargaining which accompanied the
plan bought time for the government in the winter, as well as offering the
prospect of significant budgetary savings in the medium-term.
Mr Dehaene, who looks like a slimmed-down version of Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of Germany, has seen his reputation enhanced as a result of the global pact
and his chairmanship of the widely acclaimed Belgian presidency of the
European Union which ended last December.
Somewhat to the surprise of the Belgian public, he has been encouraged by
France and Germany to put himself forward as a candidate to succeed Mr
Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission at the end of the
year.
Sitting in his prime ministerial suite in Brussels, Mr Dehaene declines
politely to talk about his ambitions to move up the road to the Commission.
His biggest indiscretion is a loud roar of laughter in response to suggested
Cabinet permutations which would allow him to leave his post. Yet he clearly
relishes his reputation as the 'fixer' or the 'plumber' in Belgium, and
would not be averse to trying out his skills on a bigger stage.
'Many people thought that, because we were a government with socialists, it
(the pact) was not possible. We proved that it was possible,' he says.
'After a period of uncertainty between August and November (1993), we
re-established international confidence in the Belgian economy, in the
Belgian currency, and in the Belgian flag.'
The government's resilient response to the summer currency crisis underlines
a consensus at the heart of Belgium's complex domestic politics, in which
linguistic and cultural tensions between the French, Flemish and the tiny
German minority are contained in a loose federal framework. This consensus
rests on an assumption that Belgium's needs are best served by deeper
co-operation and integration in Europe.
Though Mr Dehaene says pointedly that the ordinary Belgian's enthusiasm for
Europe is not what it was, he still portrays his country as a test-case for
tackling the problems of the European Union itself: slow growth, high
non-wage costs, high public debt and popular disenchantment with political
elites (reinforced in Belgium by a corruption scandal in Wallonia which has
already claimed the scalps of three leading members of the local socialist
party).
Belgium's global pact drew inspiration from Mr Delors' White Paper on
employment, growth and competitiveness which was endorsed by the 12 heads of
EU government at the Brussels summit last December. The government's
measures to encourage companies to recruit young people under 25 without
paying full employment costs anticipated the White Book's own
recommendations; so too, the global pact's goal of holding down the real
wage growth to less than the rate of inflation for the next three years.
The ultimate prize for Belgium is European monetary union. The government
and the central bank are at one in striving towards this goal, believing
that in the long term a single European market without a single currency is
not workable. Yet it is also clear that the government's huge public debt -
built up during the spend-thrift 1970s  - makes it difficult for the country
to meet the Maastricht treaty's criteria for EMU membership.
Mr Dehaene is convinced that Europe's political leaders will exploit the
treaty language in the most flexible way possible to allow EMU to proceed.
Yet doubts remain about where to draw the line. If Belgium were welcomed
into the monetary union, protests from Spain and Italy seeking reciprocal
treatment would surely follow.
Peer pressure inside the EU has helped to steady Belgium's economic
performance, but Union membership has also served as an anchor for the
Belgians themselves. Without the Union, Belgians would be much more
vulnerable to tensions between Wallonia in the South and Flanders in the
North, where the Flemish population is becoming increasingly assertive in
pressing for greater political and economic autonomy.
Belgium's drive toward greater devolution of power to the regions started
almost 25 years ago, and it has been gathering pace ever since. The most
important shift took place as a result of the Saint Michael agreements last
summer which transferred powers over foreign trade, agriculture, and trade
export promotion to the regions.
The St Michael accords leave the national government with foreign and
defence policy, internal security, the budget and social security. Critics
argue that the national government has become nothing more than a glorified
co-ordinating committee; and there seems little doubt that Mr Luc van den
Brande, the garrulous Flemish minister president, sees the agreements as the
prelude to full autonomy.
Already, there are concerns in official circles about the ability of the
national government to rein back regional spending. Mr van den Brande has
also questioned why rich Flanders should contribute such a high proportion
of the national social security budget to compensate for poorer Wallonia.
Whether these tactics stir up or steal the thunder of the right-wing Flemish
national movement remains unclear; clues may emerge from this month's
European parliamentary elections.
Mr Dehaene regrets the controversy over social security, a matter which he
considers should be non-partisan. He plays down the threat of an eventual
split in the country between north and south.
In his view, the Belgian approach to regional and ethnic tensions compares
favourably with the failure to hold former Czechoslovakia together, let
alone contain the separatist violence in Spain and Northern Ireland. 'This
has never been, in the view of the population, a revolution.' Yet devolution
and regionalisation still represent something of a conjuring act. There is
something of a 'Now you see it, now you don't' quality about modern Belgium,
particularly when the visitor travels outside Brussels into the Flemish
heartland. It is only when something dramatic happens - such as the death
last year of King Baudouin, a monarch truly loved by his people - that the
national spirit comes alive.
To a lesser degree, Mr Dehaene, though far from popular, has also emerged as
a figure around which the diffuse ethnic and political coalitions in Belgium
can rally. He has done so for more than 15 years, first behind the scenes as
a power broker and chef de cabinet for prime minister Wilfried Martens and
latterly as prime minister himself from 1991 when no one else could win
sufficient support for the job.
If Mr Dehaene were to move to the European Commission, it could remove a
critical hub in Belgian politics. Leaving aside the rival claim of Mr
Lubbers, Dutch prime minister, this is his biggest obstacle to succeeding Mr
Delors.

FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Granada advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Granada firmed 10 to 501p after the company unveiled results at
the top end of market expectations. Profits came in at Pounds 103m, a jump
of 51 per cent, with turnover up from Pounds 640.2m to Pounds 941.4m.
Granada shares have been a weak feature in recent sessions as rumours in the
market suggested merger problems with LWT. Yesterday the stock's supporters
were quick to point out the Pounds 4.7m contribution among the 64 per cent
rise in television profits. Smith New Court and NatWest Securities both
reiterated their buy recommendations.
A number of prominent retail stocks weakened in the face of a couple of
large programme trades. Among these, Great Universal Stores slid 20 to 559p,
WH Smith 'A' 10 to 465p and Marks and Spencer 11 1/2 to 380p. Rank
Organisation receded 19 to 359p.
Hoare Govett reiterated its positive stance on MFI ahead of preliminary
results due shortly. The shares hardened a penny to 156p. Laundry group
Sketchley moved forward 5 to 110p after good results, boosted by the first
contribution from Supasnaps, bought in April last year.
There was an element of disappointment in the market with the 13.7 per cent
increase in Northern Ireland Electricity's dividend total. Some of the
utilities sector's super-optimists were said to have been looking for an
increase in the region of 15 to 16 per cent, a figure which would match
potential increases by the regional electricity companies. Switching from
Northern Ireland to the 'recs' left the former 19 lower at 222p.
The building sectors of the market were hit by the general pessimism on
domestic interest rates, which many analysts expect to move up later this
year.
There were very few pockets of resistance in the housebuilders/contractors,
where Bryant Group dipped 3 to 147p, Wimpey 5 to 164p, John Laing 'A' 6 to
292p and Persimmon the same amount to 250p.
CAMAS, the demerged construction materials division of English China Clays,
began trading at 73p and gradually improved to end the session at 76p.
English China Clays, whose shareholders were given one CAMAS share for every
ECC share held, commenced trading in ex-CAMAS form at 355p and settled at
360p.
Wolseley, the builders merchant group, was undermined by news of a placing
of around 7.4m new shares at 748p apiece to fund the purchase of US
photographic equipment group Calumet for Pounds 28m. Wolseley fell 15 to
764p.
Brewers were generally firm as bargain hunting was encouraged with some
broker recommendations. Bass, up a penny at 519p, and recommended by SG
Warburg on Tuesday, was reported to be also tipped by Hoare Govett, the
broker advising a switch out of Guinness, down 5 at 472p. Having held up
well on Tuesday, Grand Metropolitan retreated 14 to 425p. Elsewhere,
Whitbread gained 5 at 519p but Scottish &amp; Newcastle slipped 9 to 505p.
Engineering group Siebe gave up the previous day's advance to close 9 lower
at 547p in volume of 1.8m in nervous trading ahead of today's figures.
NatWest Securities urged investors to look closely at the margins in the
controls division when the figures are published. The engineers team at the
securities house said: 'However good the 1994 results are and however well
supported the shares seem to be on fundamentals, the scope for share price
outperformance will be dictated by how well Siebe's controls margins
respond.' NatWest expects full-year profits for the year to March 1994 to be
Pounds 212.5m.
A stock overhang was reported in British Aerospace, where the shares gave up
6 to 455p. Powell Duffryn, which reports figures today, closed 12 down at
621p.
Worries about increasing competition in the bread market weakened Tomkins,
owner of food manufacturer RHM. The shares relinquished 7 to 214p in trade
of 1.8m.

FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher weaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailing conglomerate Kingfisher suffered a volatile day's trading, ending
the session sharply lower as a cautious agm statement was compounded by
renewed worries over a potentially acute stock overhang.
Dealers said the fear that some shareholders in Darty, the French electrical
retailer bought by Kingfisher last year, might exercise their option from
tomorrow to sell some 20m Kingfisher shares had hit the stock in afternoon
trading. 'No one wants to chase the stock if a few million shares are about
to come into the market,' commented one seasoned trader.
Having started the session weak, Kingfisher shares rallied as the agm
unfolded, with the market cheered by positive news on gross margins.
However, subsequent revelations over sluggish sales growth and cautious
comments from the chairman renewed the pressure and the shares continued to
slide. They eventually closed 21 down at 522p after 2.3m traded.

FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Water sector alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water shares outpaced the rest of the utilities as dealers picked up
whispers that the indicative 'K factors' passed by Ofwat, the industry
regulator, to the water companies three weeks ago may be more generous than
originally feared.
The 'K factor' is the amount by which Ofwat allows water companies to raise
prices every year, over and above inflation. Fears that the regulator might
impose negative factors on some water companies lay behind steep falls in
water shares earlier this year.
Although the K factors passed to the companies are strictly confidential,
market rumours have suggested that there will be be no negative K factors
and that the overall range will be from zero to 4 per cent. This would be
better than the market had been expecting, and would compare favourably with
the treatment meted out to British Gas, which was given an inflation minus 5
points formula, and BT, which has to work under an inflation minus 7.5
points formula. After consultations with the individual water companies,
Ofwat will announce its final decision on K factors on July 28.
The rumours triggered keen demand for many of the water stocks, with South
West leading the sector and closing a net 6 higher at 503p. Anglian, 475p,
and Southern, 512p, rose 5 apiece, while North West edged up 2 to 497p, as
did Severn Trent, to 497p. Yorkshire put on 5 at 495p ahead of today's
preliminary figures.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries on inflation sent bonds tumbling and led to another sharp setback in
stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The firm opening of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,970 was
described by traders as follow-through buying after the late recovery
towards the close of business on Tuesday. The improvement in European bond
markets also did much to boost sentiment in the first hour of trading.
However, the decline in German bonds following worse than anticipated output
figures brought a reversal in the fortunes of June, and the contract came
under heavy selling pressure, pulling the underlying cash market lower.
A brief respite over the lunch time period was undermined by the release of
US purchasing managers' data. This led to renewed selling and the contract
fell to the day's low of 2,899. At one point June was trading at a discount
of 30 points to cash.
June ended at 2,908, down 51 from its previous close and around 27 points
below its fair value premium to cash of about minus 3 points. Volume was
18,278 lots.
Turnover in traded options improved to 36,389 contracts, with most of the
sector's activity concentrated in the index options. The FT-SE 100 option
saw business of 18,189 lots and the Euro FT-SE 7,433 lots. Marks and Spencer
was the most active stock option, with 1,417 contracts dealt.

FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation concerns bring a renewed
downturn - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation worries caught hold strongly on both sides of the Atlantic
yesterday, prompting another savage setback in the UK equity market. Heavy
losses in British government bonds increased the pressure on share prices,
with the June futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index again taking much of
the strain.
The first hour of official trading saw the stock market edge higher, with
the Footsie moving 15 points ahead as London responded to improvement on
other European bourses. But when stock index futures failed to hold initial
gains and UK bonds reacted to a reversal of fortune in German bonds, share
prices began to fall steeply.
At the close the FT-SE 100 was down 38.6 at 2,931.9, virtually the lowest
point of the session, following a final extinction of the last of two
attempts to rally. The broader market followed suit, the FT-SE Mid 250
shedding 26.6 to 3,537.7 as profits were taken and share prices were marked
lower.
Traders commented that while selling pressure in equities had not been
heavy, the marketmakers had suffered severely from the renewed volatility in
both gilts and equities. The Footsie 2,900 mark remained clearly at hazard
in a stock market now a long way from the nearest support levels on the
analysts' charts.
These charts show the market possibly unsupported above the Footsie 2,800
mark, a level still identified as a potential low point last weekend by Mr
Nicholas Knight, international equity strategist at Nomura Research.
Howver, many analysts continued to maintain that equities should be bought
at current levels. The first half of the session appeared to confirm that
selling pressure is still light, although this was counter-balanced by
renewed pressure in stock index futures, which have become the first forum
for fund managers seeking to change stance in the stock market.
Volume in equities increased towards the close, when Wall Street was 13 Dow
points lower in response to the sharp increase in the May pricing index of
the US National Association of Purchasing Managers. For the full session,
Seaq volume in UK stocks reached 530.7m shares, against 505.2m on Tuesday
when retail business dipped to Pounds 1.1bn.
There was some disappointment that the Bundesbank trimmed its weekly repo
money market rate by only 5 basis points, although uncertainty was also
fuelled by comments expressed by Bundesbank council members.
But the first blow to confidence came when bond markets turned off as news
that German industrial output had risen sharply in May increased inflation
concerns. UK markets reacted badly when the September long-dated gilt-edged
futures fell below par. The further blow, from the US purchasing managers'
report, hit UK gilts hard again and completed the rout in share prices.
The general weakness in equities overshadowed trading statements from
several leading names. The market took a very bearish view of comments at
the annual meeting of Kingfisher, the retail group with interests
encompassing the Darty group in France and the Woolworth and Comet groups in
the UK.
The UK stock market appeared highly nervous at the close and traders said
that the near term direction must depend on developments in UK government
bonds.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers initial fall on
inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks finished with modest gains yesterday after recovering from
early declines touched off by inflationary jitters in the bond market,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.46 higher at 3,760.83,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.13 at 457.63.
Volume on the New York SE was moderate, with 278.5m shares changing hands.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite shed 0.57 to 439.88 but
the Nasdaq composite added 0.33 at 735.52.
For most of the session, stocks moved in step with the US Treasury market.
Its first move was down sharply. At mid-morning, bonds went into a tailspin
when the National Association of Purchasing Management released the results
of its monthly survey.
The closely watched report actually offered a mixed view of the economy. Its
overall May index was unchanged from the previous month, but the prices
index showed a big rise from April. The data suggested that a gradual
escalation of demand for raw materials had begun to feed through to prices
paid by manufacturers. The trend, reasoned inflation-sensitive bond traders,
would soon lead to higher prices paid by consumers.
But government securities managed to stabilise and gradually retrace all the
ground lost immediately after the NAPM's announcement. Sliding prices for
gold and other commodities helped to soothe nerves, as did talk of outright
bond purchases by the Federal Reserve, a move which carried no policy
implications.
During the afternoon, bonds continued to move ahead, ending the day with
solid gains. The gradual improvement in the Treasury market helped the Dow
industrials to a point. After falling by as many as 25 points during the
morning, the bellwether index could only manage to nudge slightly into the
plus column.
A few cyclical stocks were stubbornly anchored in negative territory.
Caterpillar lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 105 1/2 and Cummins slipped
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 42 1/4 . But Chevron, up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 88
1/4 , Sears Roebuck, Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 51 7/8 , and
International Paper, Dollars 1 3/4 ahead at Dollars 71, rallied during the
afternoon.
Banking issues also pushed higher in late trading. Bankers Trust gained
Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 72 1/4 , Chase Manhattan added Dollars 1 5/8 at
Dollars 39 3/8 and Chemical Bank ended Dollars 1 3/8 better at Dollars 39
3/4 . Analysts said the gains may reflect a shift away from cyclical issues
in response to the recent evidence of a cooling economy.
Takeover speculation in the pharmaceuticals field emerged once again. This
time the potential target was US Surgical, the medical equipment supplier.
The stock jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 21 1/2 on expectations that
Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss drug group, would launch a takeover bid.
International Game Technology improved Dollars 1 to Dollars 23 1/8 . Its
management issued a positive assessment of the company's prospects in an
effort to arrest the recent slide in its share price.
Canada
Toronto tumbled in moderate trade, dragged down by a dropping gold price and
weak Canadian bonds. The TSE 300 index fell 37.1 to close at 4,289.7 and
declines led rises by 466 to 288 in volume of 56.2m shares.
Canadian bond markets felt the impact of heavy foreign selling of Quebec
bonds due to nervousness over forthcoming elections in the province.
Bond prices recovered somewhat but the TSE 300 index managed only a slight
rally from its intraday low.
Brazil
After opening easier following disappointment over the failure by a
congressional committee to agree a revision of the constitution late on
Tuesday, the Bovespa index picked up again. By the close the index stood a
net 593, or 2.4 per cent, higher at 25,265.
Brokers said liquidity had risen by late morning as foreign investors
returned to the market. The day's turnover reached Cr348.6bn (Dollars
182.7m).
An announcement shortly after the market closed by Mr Rubens Ricupero, the
economy minister, of new rules for Brazil's new currency, the real, to be
introduced on July 1, was seen as providing support for Friday's opening.
Brazilian markets are closed today due to the Corpus Christi holiday.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei tops 21,000 for
first time in 1994

<TEXT>
Equities extended their run to a fourth consecutive high for the year, the
Nikkei 225 average closing above the technically significant 21,000 mark for
the first time since last September, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The index gained 79.52 at 21,053.11, within striking distance of last year's
peak of 21,148.11, after a day's high of 21,090.72 and low of 20,896.38.
First section volume on the TSE was estimated at 700m shares and winners
outnumbered losers by 613 to 419, with 158 issues unchanged.
The capital-weighted Nikkei 300 average ended at 309.89, up 2.10, and the
Topix index of all first section stocks rose 11.08 to 1.693.58. In London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 2.41 at 1,405.42.
The market moved higher at the opening as foreign buyers returned after
Monday's holidays in New York and London. With some exceptions, domestic
institutions and arbitrageurs continued to sell throughout much of the
morning, but they were no match for foreign investors.
Trading was characterised by active demand for highly priced high-technology
shares, encouraged by a government panel's report yesterday which advised
governmental investment in fibre-optic infrastructure to create a national
multimedia network.
Fujitsu, a world leader in fibre-optic switching systems, put on Y30 at
Y1,130. Other multimedia-oriented companies also gained ground.
NTT, positioned to be a leader in the expansion of the nation's
telecommunications infrastructure, advanced Y27,000 to Y892,000. Heavy
electricals were also mostly higher, Hitachi rising Y20 to Y1100.
Oil shares moved up on a broad front, supported by higher prices for crude
oil and projections that China's need for oil would increase as its economy
expands. Nippon Oil moved forward Y18 to Y778 and Japan Energy finished at
Y458, up Y9.
In Osaka the OSE average rose 148.83 to 23,311.19, with 40.9m shares
changing hands. OSE volume for May was 36.5 per cent higher than in April,
reaching 579.6m shares.
Roundup
Sentiment in the region was mixed to better, with selectivity in evidence.
MANILA climbed by 2.7 per cent on a higher than expected GNP growth rate, a
late rally in an already bullish market driving the composite index up by
83.67 to 3,114.44 after a bout of profit-taking.
GNP-related stocks were favoured, with San Miguel 'A' shares up 4.9 per cent
to 107 pesos and Meralco 'A' 3.3 per cent better at 312.50 pesos.
SYDNEY recovered on economic data, rising futures and stronger commodity and
gold prices, the All Ordinaries index closing 15.4 firmer at 2,097.2 in
turnover of ADollars 456.2m.
Brokers said that while the 1.9 per cent rise in March GDP was not good for
bonds, it fuelled buying of equities because of the prospect of higher
company earnings.
Among resource stocks, CRA jumped 26 cents to ADollars 18.36, Western Mining
climbed 10 cents to ADollars 7.80 and MIM added 4 cents at ADollars 3.17.
TAIPEI saw waves of buying in electronics shares which pushed the weighted
index up by 69.89, or 1.2 per cent, to 5,961.45 as turnover increased from
TDollars 53.96bn to TDollars 63.03bn.
Rises in electronics were led by the leading computer manufacturer Acer,
TDollars 2.50 stronger at TDollars 66.50 on newspaper reports of a higher
1994 profits target.
Petrochemical issues also attracted buying, on expectations of higher
product prices. China Petrochemical was up TDollars 1.20 at TDollars 28.10
and Union Petrochemical advanced TDollars 2.80 to TDollars 44.20.
BANGKOK featured banks and building materials as the SET index moved ahead
11.48 to 1,368.35 in turnover of Bt6.7bn. The banking sector rose 2.55 per
cent.
HONG KONG was subdued on a lack of domestic news and the absence of foreign
initiatives, the Hang Seng index declining 41.49 to 9,512.07 as turnover
recovered from HKDollars 3.21bn to HKDollars 3.97bn.
SINGAPORE fell as general sentiment was weakened by retail margin selling in
Malaysian shares traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index
slipped 13.79 to 2,267.88.
Volume came to 110.45m shares. Singapore Press foreign shed SDollars 1 to
SDollars 26 and Sembawang Corp 80 cents to SDollars 12.
KUALA LUMPUR dropped 1.1 per cent on forced selling linked to margin calls
by stockbrokers, the KLSE composite index closing 10.93 down at 982.80.
after hitting an intraday low of 976.26.
SEOUL fell for the fourth consecutive session, depressed by institutional
inactivity and by worries about North Korea's nuclear programme.
The composite stock index dipped 6.72 to 932.77. Reports that an
international sanction against North Korea was imminent, and that Pyongyang
had test-fired a missile over the Sea of Japan on Tuesday, brought an extra
chill to sentiment.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Downward spiral continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bear phase among the world's emerging markets continues to deepen and
the consensus is that the current downward cycle has further to run, writes
John Pitt.
Foreign &amp; Colonial observes that over the last 20 years emerging markets
have seen four downward corrections. 'Three of these falls,' it notes,
'lasted less than eight months, and the other, in the early 1980s, a little
over 2 1/2 years.' On the evidence that the IFC composite index has dropped
by some 9 per cent since the beginning of the year, F&amp;C suggests that the
current correction probably has 'a couple more months to run and another 3
per cent to fall'.
Baring Securities, in its latest strategy document, argues that having been
driven higher by the flood of US money throughout 1993, emerging markets are
likely to remain under pressure over the next three months given further
tightening of US monetary policy. However, Baring does see comfort ahead,
especially in the second half of 1994, as trading prospects in general
improve. More specifically, Baring finds favour with the north east Asian
region, South Korea in particular, and, in Latin America, recommends Mexico,
suggesting that Argentina could 'be tripped up by rising US interest rates'.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris off 2.4%, CAC-40
breaches 2,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tuesday's intraday recovery was reversed as bourses faced weakness in bond
and futures markets and, in the afternoon, early declines on Wall Street,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS could not hold above the 2,000 level in the CAC-40 and closed at its
lowest point since the end of July 1993.
The final kick downwards was triggered by Wall Street. But, once again, the
real pressure on equities was imposed by the futures and bond markets as the
CAC-40 index ended the session down 50.22, or 2.4 per cent, at 1,979.68,
slightly above the day's low of 1,972. June futures finished at 1,951, with
turnover in the equity market estimated at nearly FFr5bn.
Analysts commented that the equity market was 'on the ropes', and that it
was extremely difficult in the present climate to make an assessment of when
it would be a good moment to return on the buy side. The very seasonal
nature of the French market - the first quarter was traditionally seen as
the period when stocks rose against the European average and summer a time
of decline - was also advanced as a backdrop to the present situation.
Among the fallers, UAP closed below its privatisation price, down 5.5 per
cent at FFr143.80 while, against the trend, Eurotunnel put on 1 per cent at
FFr32.95 as the group provided bullish estimates of traffic volume.
FRANKFURT registered a new low in bund futures and fell away after an early,
pre-bourse high of 2,146.62. The Dax index closed the session just 2.00
firmer at 2,129.70 and ended the post-bourse at 2,113.62.
Turnover eased from DM6.7bn to DM6.4bn. Major blue chips seemed studiously
inert, with big price changes confined to Lufthansa, up DM8 to DM195 in an
extension of this year's speculative run, and to the engineering sector,
where Deutsche Babcock moved ahead DM10 to DM247.
At B Metzler, Ms Barbara Altmann said that investors were sitting on their
hands; but, she added, there was beginning to be a case for selective buying
with Bayer, for example, some 10 per cent off its high for the year at
DM362.50 after hours, on a prospective 1995 p/e of 10.7.
AMSTERDAM was buffeted by a combination of negative influences from outside
the equity market. The Aex index, which at one point had fallen to a session
low of 396.08, closed off 3.25 at 397.52.
In spite of the overall gloom a few bright spots enlivened investors'
interest. KLM, for instance, which reports its 1993/94 fourth quarter reults
today, advanced 60 cents to Fl 51.90, bringing its rise on the year to date
to 24 per cent. Analysts were looking for the airline to come in with a
profit in the Fl 50m range.
A broker's buy recommendation helped retailer Ahold to a rise of 30 cents to
Fl 47.80, while ING, the financial services group, which also reports
figures today, slipped 60 cents to Fl 75.30.
The heavily weighted Royal Dutch also added some stability to the overall
trend, the shares adding Fl 1.50 to Fl 196.30 and benefitting from a
positive broker's note.
ZURICH added buying of defensive stocks to the selling of cyclicals which
marked Tuesday's trading, and the upshot was a rise against the general
trend.
The SMI index rose 8.9 to 2,731.5. Roche certificates rose SFr90 to
SFr6,800, UBS by SFr17 to SFr1,212 in banks and, in insurers, Winterthur by
SFr25 to SFr715.
Among cyclicals, BBC Brown Boveri continued its downward career, SFr25 lower
at SFr1,235, and Schindler accelerated with a fall of SFr350 to SFr8,200.
MADRID followed the pricing of the Endesa and Santander issues with an above
average drop in the general index, 5.62 or 1.7 per cent lower at 321.38.
Turnover shot up from Pta25bn to Pta42bn.
An interaction of futures, basket trading and the new issue closures was
mooted as Endesa lost Pta150 at Pta6,400, and Santander Pta165 at Pta4,885.
Elsewhere, Repsol and Telefonica fell Pta145 to Pta4,135 and Pta75 to
Pta1,765 respectively.
WARSAW fell sharply as profit-taking in second-tier stocks coincided with
falls in major blue chips which had already been undermined by weak investor
sentiment.
The all-share Wig index declined 870.7 or 7.2 per cent to 11,166.0, while
turnover dropped 36 per cent to 1,000bn zlotys and volume 46 per cent to
1.6m shares.
ISTANBUL, in contrast, rose 5.2 per cent, helped by sustained buying of
state companies. The composite index gained 774.36 to 15,523.46, recovering
most of its losses since the start of the week.

FT  02 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Crisis of confidence as Tel Aviv drops
further 2.6%
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli stock exchange registered its third successive day of heavy
falls yesterday, with the Mishtanim index dropping nearly 3 per cent, writes
David Horovitz in Jerusalem.
The market has been drifting downwards for several weeks, and has lost in
excess of 25 per cent of its value in the last month.
Analysts said that the market was going through a crisis of confidence, and
ascribed the latest falls to a variety of factors: a financial crisis in the
country's largest health fund, Kupat Holim Clalit, unexpectedly poor results
published recently by several large companies, deadlock in the peace process
with Syria, and soaring house prices that have been fuelling inflation,
prompting recent interest rate rises.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Focus stays on futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges yesterday again played second fiddle to interest rate
markets, where prices fell across the yield curve, writes Philip Gawith.
Trade in Euromark and short sterling futures was robust and prices very
volatile. The December sterling contract closed at 93.49 from 93.59, while
the equivalent Euromark future fell by six basis points to 94.81. Movements
in the back month contracts were even more dramatic.
Bond market weakness spilled over into some of the Scandinavian currencies,
with both the Danish and Swedish crowns declining, apparently on the back of
bond sales by foreigners.
Elsewhere, the dollar continued its recent pattern of range-bound trading,
paying little attention to economic data released. It ended in London at
DM1.6428 from DM1.6435 and against the yen at Y104.650 from Y104.655. The US
currency finished New York trading at DM1.6463 and Y104.50.
Strong first-quarter GDP figures boosted the Australian dollar, which
climbed to a 21-month high against the US dollar, closing at Dollars 0.7407
from Dollars 0.7383.
Sterling finished the day firmer at DM2.4922 from DM2.4846. Against the
dollar it ended at Dollars 1.5171 from Dollars 1.5118.
The Belgian central bank cut its key central rate to 5.2 per cent from 5.25
per cent.
The mood in the interest rate futures markets was again very gloomy. One
analyst said the market seemed 'determined to creep towards some sort of
financial Armageddon'.
The pattern was again set at the long end of the market, with bunds feeding
into gilts, which then spilled over into short sterling. Some of the back
month (longer) contracts have now lost a full percentage point in the past
week.
The market actually started firmer, but began to lose ground once the German
repo announcement - the rate was cut by 5 basis points to 5.15 per cent -
came through. Expectations of a reduction as large as 10 basis points had
built up in advance of the announcement, so there was some dis-appointment
in the market.
Analysts said there appeared to be tremendous value at current levels, but
there was no buying interest. It was difficult to persuade clients to buy
when prices seemed, inexorably, cheaper the following day.
Volumes were fairly large, with December short sterling trading 40,000 lots,
and the December Euromark nearly 51,000 lots.
The dollar was unaffected by the release of the May purchasing managers'
index, which was steady at 57.7, although the price component rose to 71.5,
from 63.2 in April.
Analysts said the US currency would stay in its recent narrow trading range
of DM1.6390 to DM1.6480 until the release tomorrow of the non-farm payroll
figures. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in
London, said 'expectations about the US economy are so solidly in place that
it is difficult for a set of figures to make much impact'.
The dollar managed to resist some potentially negative comments from two
Bundesbank council members. Although Mr Guntram Palm said there was still
room for movement on the repo rate, he also added: 'At the current time it
would appear that a stopping point, if not a turning point, is in sight for
interest rate policy.'
Mr Olaf Sievert, meanwhile, head of the regional central bank for Saxony and
Thuringia, effectively discounted the prospect of imminent Bundesbank
intervention to support the dollar.
'The Bundesbank is not at the ready, waiting to intervene in the market at a
dollar rate of DM1.64 . . . all rates in the region of DM1.70 or DM1.65 are
not a problem for us . . . ,' he said.
In Europe the Danish krone closed at DKr3.929 against the D-Mark, down from
DM3.9160 on May 30. The Swedish krona also fell, ending at SKr4.78, from
SKr4.68 on May 30.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said
the weakening of these currencies was driven by foreign investors selling
bonds. One possible explanation for the trend is that markets are suffering
from greater competition for banks' funds, with more money diverted, for
example, into corporate lending.
The JP Morgan analyst said the reason the Scandinavian currencies had been
particularly affected was that both were fairly exposed to international
investors, and less liquid than some other markets.
Mr Persaud said international investors were also concerned that governments
faced with elections would not be able to administer the sort of fiscal
medicine their economies required. He predicted that other countries such as
Spain and France, faced with a similar confluence of events, might also
experience currency weakness in future.
The Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 35m to UK money
markets after forecasting a Pounds 350m shortage. Overnight money moved
between 4 per cent and 6 per cent.
German call money fell back to 5.15/5.25 per cent, from 5.75/5.95 per cent
on Tuesday.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kenya's pyrethrum dominance
challenged - Prospects for the major producer of the only true organic
pesticide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GRIFFIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A record Kenyan crop of pyrethrum, a vital ingredient in many insect-control
formulations, will more than compensate for losses arising from the
cataclysm in Rwanda, formerly the world's third largest producer of this
natural pesticide. But the further concentration of supplies in a
drought-prone region with its own record of recent ethnic violence is cause
for concern among the product's few big buyers.
Pyrethrum first surfaced commercially in Dalmatia and Japan before being
transplanted in the 1920s to the Kenyan Highlands, where it is grown as a
cash crop by over 40,000 small-scale farmers. Since then, Kenya has
regularly produced 60-70 per cent of annual world demand of 20-22,000
tonnes, processing it for export into powdered or liquid concentrates at a
refinery in Nakuru on the edge of the Rift Valley.
Despite a nation wide failure of the rains earlier this year, the
state-controlled Pyrethrum Board of Kenya (PBK) has reported a harvest of
18,000 tonnes of dried flowers, 45 per cent up on the previous season's
12,400 tonnes. 'To have a stockpile puts us in a position of being able to
promote pyrethrum and its level of usage,' says Mr Job Wainaina, PBK's chief
executive.
With prices remaining firm at Dollars 60 per kilogram of extract, the new
crop gives Kenya a commanding 80 per cent share of world production.
The existence of this daisy-like flower lends support to the belief that the
divine plan, with its generous provisions for cockroaches, mosquitoes, house
flies and fleas, may have been subject to later, more thoughtful revision.
For processed pyrethrum yields the world's only truly organic pesticide, a
quick-acting, bio-degradable powder that is non-carcinogenic, non-toxic to
humans and animals and has no history of insect resistance.
Ninety per cent of all pyrethrum is used in the control of these four main
pests, usually through aerosol formulations. But pyrethrins, the active
ingredient, are deployed wherever human or animal health are more important
considerations than kill ratio; the protection of stored grain, beverages
and fruits; food preparation and canning; pest control in kitchens, gardens,
restaurants and airplanes; and in a variety of veterinary applications. But
where pyrethrum falls fatally short, in scientific and commercial terms, is
that it has no staying power, breaking down rapidly under ultra-violet
light.
With the growth of a mass market for household insecticides in the 1950s
there came a demand for the development of cheaper, long-lasting
alternatives to pyrethrum. There are now over 40 synthetically-produced
substitutes.
With Kenyan independence a second reason for diversification emerged: the
fear that political instability or poor management would choke off
deliveries from the world's largest producer.
'If it were not for doubts over the regularity of supplies, I think the
invasion by synthetic pyrethroids would not have been as intense as it has
become.' says Mr Wainaina,
As it is, the PBK will be lucky to lift exports beyond last year's Pounds
10m, in spite of the record crop. Pyrethrins touch the lives of everyone but
80 per cent of the trade is controlled by a handful of large insecticide
manufacturers - among them Johnson and Johnson, Roussel, Bayer, Sarah Lee
and Sumitomo. As the producer of a raw material which can be utilised or
omitted as they see fit, the PBK has an almost apologetic relationship with
the buyers, aware that they need its unique product but conscious too that
they will cut and run as soon as proprietary substitutes can be found.
Until recently, shoppers for pyrethrum had little alternative but to troop
up to Nakuru, the Kenyan market town at the heart of the industry. The cool,
surrounding highlands allow flowers to be picked for nine months of the
year: elsewhere they yield just a single bloom. The PBK headquarters has a
down-at-heel, faintly academic atmosphere not inappropriate to a colonial
institution that has mysteriously survived into the present day. With a 90
per cent recovery rate, no fresh investment is envisaged in the existing
processing technology.
Two factors have now come to disturb this complacency. For the past 18
months, the Rift Valley has been the scene of a low-intensity range war in
which Kalenjin and Masai people, loyal to President Daniel arap Moi, have
driven Kikuyu supporters of the opposition from their farms and businesses.
Though the violence clearly did not effect this year's crop, it has had an
impact upon growers in the Mau Escarpment.
A greater challenge to Kenyan pre-eminence is emerging on the other side of
the world in Tasmania. In collaboration with large-scale farmers,
Commonwealth Industrial Gasses (CIG), a British Oxygen Group subsidiary, 15
conducting field trials on the viability of intensively-produced pyrethrum,
using high-quality clones on irrigated land.
The acreage is still small and the climate not as suitable as Nakuru's, but
Tasmania is already in a position 'to influence the supply', according to Mr
Wainaina.
If trials show that, despite the shorter season, mechanised farming can be
profitable, nothing would then prevent pesticide manufacturers from bringing
pyrethrum-growing back to Europe where it started more than 150 years ago.
EC regulations on 'set-aside' land already permit the cultivation of crops
with an industrial, non-food end-use.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Selling spree hits copper and
coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodities and precious metals prices tumbled yesterday in Chicago, London
and New York as investment funds and speculators sold heavily.
However, maize and soyabean prices, which rose so strongly in Chicago on
Tuesday, held on to most of those gains yesterday after early set-backs.
Coffee and copper prices, which have been the main beneficiaries of the
recent buying spree in London, went into reverse. Copper for delivery in
three months on the London Metal Exchange dropped by Dollars 39.50 a tonne
to close at Dollars 2,227.50. Traders suggested that a slowing in copper's
rally, and its failure to move close to recent 16-month highs after a short,
downward movement last week, possibly unsettled some speculators.
Coffee prices slid by Dollars 56 a tonne in London in a round of
profit-taking with the September futures contract at the London Commodity
Exchange down at Dollars 2,035 a tonne. The market was led down by an early
slump in New York where traders were concerned about Friday's expiry of
options contracts.
But London trading was thin and volatile and in this case speculators and
hedge funds were absent from the market. Ms Judy Ganes, soft commodities
analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, said that a combination of Tuesday's
auction of stocks in Brazil which had failed to sell as much as expected,
and a lower than expected drop in US stocks, had unsettled the market.
US maize and soyabean futures dipped at yesterday's opening at the Chicago
Board of Trade as speculators took profits after a weather-induced rally on
Tuesday. However, evidence that unseasonably warm, dry weather was
persisting in the upper Midwest crop areas bolstered prices after the
opening.
At midday, maize futures were little changed from Tuesday's strong closes,
and soyabean futures were only 4 to 5 cents per bushel lower.

oil drilling

<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday called on Norway not to proceed with plans to drill oil
exploration wells in the Norwegian sector of the Skagerrak, saying the
project could damage its fisheries and tourism industries and threaten its
rugged west coast.
The plan to allow four exploration wells in the Skagerrak is part of a wider
project to increase offshore exploration acreage by 16 per cent in a bid to
offset a steep decline in crude oil production expected after 1996 by
Norway.
The proposals are due to be voted on by the Norwegian Storting by June 15.
But opposition is also mounting within the parliament to allowing any
drilling in the Skagerrak, about 50km off the southern Norwegian coast.
Environmentalists and fishermen have rallied support for their objections,
despite the government's intention to restrict drilling to one well at a
time and to bar drilling during the summer prawn harvest.
Opposition has been voiced from within the ranks of the minority ruling
Labour party as well as by the chief opposition parties and the state
pollution control authority.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers 'lose out' on futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodity producers in third world countries are losing out from the
roller-coaster ride on the world's futures markets and not seeing much
benefit from higher prices, according to Mr Carl Greenidge, deputy secretary
general of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries.
Mr Greenidge is in London to lobby candidates in the forthcoming European
parliamentary elections.
'We hope to press European countries to look more sympathetically at
commodity protocols with economic clauses,' he will tell a conference
organised to the World Development Movement today.
'The markets that will allow the sort of chaos we've seen over the last
five-to-six years are clearly not the sort of markets that will facilitate
investment in industry or stable incomes for producers,' he stresses.
The WDM, a third-world campaign organisation, has calculated that from a
Pounds 1 chocolate bar, a cocoa farmer receives only 8p, whilst the UK
Treasury eats up double that amount in taxes.
In addition, the movement says that EU tariffs imposed on third world
producers discourage them from manufacturing finished products.
The Lome Convention, a preferential trading agreement between the European
Union and ACP countries is being reviewed this year and Mr Greenidge says
there are some clauses that need tightening up.
He highlights the problems many African countries experience in repaying
debts and calls for better returns for these countries from the basic
commodities they sell.
'The unpredictability of the markets makes it impossible for producers to
plan ahead in a sensible fashion,' Mr Greenidge emphasises.

banana import plan
</HEADLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Cesar Gaviria, the president of Colombia, has said that the European
Union's banana import regime is fair to both Latin American and Caribbean
exporters, and that this was the reason for his government's acceptance of
it despite continuing criticism from some Latin American producers.
'Colombia considered the Lome Convention convenient and good, and understood
why Caribbean countries had special access to the European market,' Mr
Gaviria told a radio station in Barbados.
'We wanted an agreement with the European Union in relation to bananas.
That's why we accepted the EU proposal.' Latin American producers had
attacked the EU's import regime which allows duty free access for fruit from
traditional suppliers in the Caribbean and other countries in the African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, while imposing duties on the quota
granted Latin exporters.
The EU has proposed increasing Latin American imports from 2m tonnes per
year to 2.1m tonnes this year, and to 2.2m tonnes next year.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum market moves into
balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The platinum market, having suffered a supply surplus for some years, is now
moving back into balance.
Prices should show strong gains during the next 18 months and consolidated
in a range between Dollars 450 and Dollars 500 a troy ounce, according to
analyst Ms Rhona O'Connell in a special report for T Hoare and Co.
Platinum closed last night in London at Dollars 401.90 an ounce.
Ms O'Connell points out that there is an estimated 700,000 ounces of annual
platinum production capacity in South Africa alone that could be brought
into operation if prices were right. But she suggests prices will not go
high enough to trigger all of this.
Nevertheless, she would 'not be at all surprised to see Impala reinstate
shelved expansion plans and Rustenburg implement its Lebowa expansion or,
more importantly, expand output at the low-cost PP Rust mine.'
Mr O'Connell suggests, however, that even higher prices will not save Gold
Fields of South Africa's new Northam mine which is likely to be closed
because of technical mining problems.
If Northam does remain open there would be a platinum supply surplus of
136,000 ounces this year, she forecasts, and one of 54,000 ounces in 1995.
Ms O'Connell points out that investment activity over the past six years has
accounted for 328,000 ounces annually and the lowest level in 1989 was
160,000 ounces. 'In theory, therefore, the market should start to see
above-gound, industrial stocks drawn down during this year and, all other
things being equal, for that drawdown to be relentless.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Investors stay on sidelines despite higher
yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds took another tumble on continued futures and cash
selling, and although long yields have risen sharply in recent days, they
failed to lure investors back into the market.
'It is increasingly unclear what is pushing the markets down,' said Mr Peter
Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt, but
after the recent heavy losses, 'there is a lot of fear, and a self-feeding
downward momentum in the market.'
In addition to technical selling in the futures pits, traders reported
significant sales of cash bonds by institutions opting to end the pain of
watching their long-term positions go deeper into the red.
'People who have held on and on since February are fed up and have begun
offloading loss-making positions,' said one dealer.
Higher than expected German production data and the release of a strong US
National Association of Purchasing Management index also pressured prices.
German bunds opened slightly higher on early short-covering after Tuesday's
sell-off. The Bundesbank lowered its securities repurchase rate by five
basis points to 5.15 per cent but that failed to give prices a lift,
especially after earlier rumours of a larger cut. Stronger-than-expected
industrial production further pressured prices, fanning fears that economic
recovery might fuel inflation pressures.
Contradictory comments from Bundesbank council members added to the market's
confused state. While Mr Guntram Palm, president of the state central bank
of Baden-Wurttemberg, said that recent cuts in the discount and Lombard
rates mark at least a stopping point and 'maybe even a turning point' in
monetary policy, Mr Olaf Sievert, president of the state central bank of
Saxony-Turingia, said that 'a definite end of the monetary easing has by no
means been indicated, and has certainly not been agreed upon'.
Activity is expected to be calmer today with large parts of Germany closed
for the Corpus Christi holiday.
The June bund future fell to around 92.30, down 0.54 points on the day.
France heavily underperformed Germany, with the June notional bond contract
on Matif falling by 1.16 point to 116.56.
Plagued by inflation fears and weakness in neighbouring markets, UK gilts
were one of the day's worst performers.
The June long gilt futures contract fell through the psychologically
important 100 level - the lowest level for the front-month contract since
January 1993 - to close around 99 25/32 , down 1 1/32 on the day.
Traders reported selling of cash bonds by institutions and no buying
interest, even though current yields are seen to offer good value. The
10-year gilt currently yields 8.79 per cent, some 191 basis points above its
German counterpart.
Europe's peripheral markets also fell sharply, with Denmark and Sweden again
severly weakened by heavy foreign selling, which also weakened their
currencies.
In Italy, the June BTP contract dropped 1.13 points to 107.04 and in Spain,
which faces a government bond auction today, the June bond future fell 0.97
points to 93.71.
Even in Japan, which has held up well recently, prices were hit by stronger
economic data, causing the September JGB contract to fall by 1.11 points in
Tokyo, and another 0.49 points in London to 110.82.
US Treasury bonds staged an impressive recovery yesterday afternoon from an
early sell-off triggered by fresh signs of inflation.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/2 higher
at 86 15/32 , with the yield dipping to 7.379 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was  1/32 better at 99 13/16 , to yield 5.959 per cent.
The late rally was tied to declining commodity prices and reports of an
unannounced bond purchases by the Federal Reserve.
In the morning, the National Association of Purchasing Management had
re-ignited the market's fears of inflation with the release of its May
survey. The overall index came in at 57.7, unchanged from the April reading.
However, the prices index, viewed as an accurate leading indicator, was up
sharply at 71.5, against 63.2 the previous month.
The data suggested that the economy's expansion over the past six months had
finally created shortages of raw materials, which were feeding through to
the prices paid by manufacturers.
As a result, bonds across the board lost ground quickly. Longer-dated
securities, whose value is eroded by inflation, suffered the worst damage,
dropping by nearly  3/4 points within minutes of the mid-morning
announcement.
Later, prices stabilised and recovered amid talk of the Fed buying
three-year and five-year notes on the open market. The move carried no
policy significance.
The release of the NAPM survey overshadowed one shred of favourable economic
news on offer. The Commerce Department said construction spending had risen
a tepid 0.6 per cent in April, against expectations of a 1 per cent gain.
The session brought only light activity, which may have exaggerated the
price swings.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: News Corp relies on Lords
ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers acting for News Corp, the media, film and publishing group
controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, are relying on a landmark ruling by the
House of Lords to limit their client's liability in a potentially costly
dispute stemming from the publication of an erroneous notice.
The notice, published in the Financial Times last December on behalf of a
subsidiary of News Corp, advised holders of News Corp preference shares,
which were exchangeable into shares which the company had bought in Pearson
in the 1980s, that they were also entitled to shares in Royal Doulton, the
fine china manufacturer, as part of the exchange property.
When Pearson, the media, banking and entertainment group which publishes the
Financial Times, demerged Royal Doulton last year, it offered its
shareholders one Royal Doulton share for every 10 held in the parent.
At the time, dealers estimated that holders of News Corp's preference
shares, denominated in sterling and guilders, and News Corp's D-Mark
convertible bonds would receive 5 1/2 m Royal Doulton shares worth Pounds
15m.
However, in January, News Corp stunned the market with another notice which
said it was taking legal advice over whether the Royal Doulton shares were
part of the exchange property. In February, News Corp said holders were not
entitled to the Royal Doulton shares because, in its view, there had not
been a change in the composition of the exchange property.
Since then, a number of investment banks have been seeking compensation from
News Corp for the financial losses which they and their clients incurred as
a result of the first notice. The losses could run into millions of dollars.
Claimants say while News Corp's London-based solicitors, Allen &amp; Overy, are
taking a sympathetic approach to claims by individuals who were holders at
the time of the erroneous notice, they are taking a much tougher line with
those who dealt in the shares as a result of the notice, citing the legal
precedent set in Caparo Industries v Dickman.
In 1990, the House of Lords ruled that auditors had no 'duty of care' to
individual shareholders or other users of accounts, and only to the company
and to shareholders as a collective body.
Allen &amp; Overy are drawing an analogy between the Caparo ruling and News
Corp's position since the company gave notice to persons registered as
holders of the preference shares, not the whole market. Therefore, in their
view, News Corp's duty is only to them and not to anyone else who relied on
the notice to make investment decisions.
The claimants, some of whom are also believed to be contesting News Corp's
claim to the Royal Doulton shares, say it is by no means clear that the
Caparo principle will apply in News Corp's case. For example, News Corp had
called the issues around the same time as the erroneous notice was
published, forcing the market to act.
News Corp declined to comment on the matter apart from to confirm that it
was corresponding with a number of people who had written to Allen &amp; Overy
to make claims. 'We don't feel that it will be useful for us to make general
statements about the claims in the press in view of this ongoing
correspondence,' News Corp said.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Banks follow corporates into
short-dated dollar sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for short-dated dollar denominated debt finally persuaded some banks
to follow the lead taken by the big corporates.
Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan both tapped the market, pushing the total raised
via two-year and three-year dollar debt since AT&amp;T's successful issue last
week to Dollars 2bn.
Syndicate managers at the two banks were nervous about whether there was
still enough appetite, but said they had been persuaded to issue by other
banks who were continuing to see strong demand from continental Europe.
Private investors who had liquidated their holdings in long-dated bonds to
escape from volatile price moves at that end of the yield curve have
recently been looking for a home for their dollars.
JP Morgan served up the big deal of the day, raising Dollars 300m via
three-year paper priced to yield 11 basis points above Treasuries. When the
syndicate broke, the spread on the bonds widened to 14 basis points on the
bid and some rivals argued that that niche had already been saturated and
the US bank had come to the market too late.
Syndicate managers were also bemused that a bank with such a high-profile
name would need to joint-lead the issue with Morgan Stanley.
JP Morgan said its banking arm was keen to maintain impartiality over the
choice of syndicate managers and that Morgan Stanley had also bid
aggressively for the business.
In its view, the three-year debt offered a coupon of 6.5 per cent, compared
with only 6 1/8 per cent for the two-year area, and demand was still strong.
Deutsche Bank chose the two-year maturity for its Dollars 200m issue which
was priced to yield 5 basis points over Treasuries and which maintained the
spread after trading began.
The bank, which arranged the issue with Goldman Sachs, said: 'We were
sceptical but we had calls from intermediaries who had sold out of previous
issues and wanted more and we got confirmation of the demand from our own
investors.'
Elsewhere, Olivetti raised L400bn through a five-year bond convertible into
ordinary shares from January next year and offering an indicated yield of 7
to 7.5 per cent. The issue was targeted at Italian, US and European
institutions.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ethane deal prompts ICI
Australia to plan pipeline

ICI Australia, a subsidiary of the UK-based group but traded separately on
the Australian stock exchange, looks set to go ahead with a ADollars 250m to
ADollars 300m (USDollars 184m-USDollars 221m) ethane pipeline connecting the
South Australia gasfields to its Botany Bay petrochemical plant.
The company has reached an outline ethane supply agreement with Santos, the
Adelaide-based oil and gas group, for 10 years. The volume of ethane
concentrate would be around 310,000 tonnes a year and, according to Santos,
'based on the current structure of prices in the oil futures market, the
price formula agreed is economically equivalent to the current natural gas
price with CPI indexation'.
The deal also includes a possible extension for a further five years, on
terms to be negotiated at that stage. The two companies aim to sign a formal
contract within two months, and ICI hopes to set up similar arrangements
with other producers in the Cooper Basin.
ICI Australia said yesterday that it hoped to construct the 1300km pipeline
between Moomba and Botany, which would come into operation in May 1996. The
cost of the pipeline is put at more than ADollars 200m, and modifications to
the Botany plant will take total project costs to more than ADollars 250m.
The new pipeline will follow a similar route to the existing Moomba-Sydney
pipeline, which is being sold by the federal government to AGL, the
Australian utility, Canada's Nova and Petronas, the state-owned Malaysian
oil company.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia has sold its 50 per cent shareholding in
stockbroking firm Burdett Buckeridge &amp; Young for an undisclosed sum, Reuter
reports from Sydney. The purchasers were US institutional stockbroking firm
Jefferies Group and Hong Kong-based joint venture investment bank Asian
Capital Partners.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Net earnings at Anglo American
rise 23%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Anglo American, South Africa's largest corporation, yesterday reported a 23
per cent increase in net earnings for the year ending in March to R2.98bn
(Dollars 543m), up from R2.42bn a year ago.
Net income after tax rose 19 per cent to R2.24bn from R1.83bn, while
attributable earnings rose to R1.68bn from R1.40bn, a gain of 20 per cent. A
final dividend of 300 cents was declared, bringing the total for the year to
395 cents, up from 345 cents last year and above market expectations of
around 370 cents.
The company's net asset value after the dividend recorded a substantial 55
per cent jump to R54.98bn, reflecting the continued buoyancy of the
Johannesburg stock exchange.
The results have been modified in accordance with the international moves
towards greater accounting comparability and provide for stricter treatment
of extraordinary items, but the effect on earnings figures has not been
material, resulting in a 3 per cent increase in 1994's net earnings and a 2
per cent decline in 1993's restated figures.
Of the group's divisions, mining finance remained the most profitable,
accounting for R754m of total net earnings, up from R617m last year, while
gold rose to R400m from R277m on the back of the higher gold price.
Industry and commerce recorded a 17.7 per cent increase to R529m from R381m,
while diamonds rose to R642m from R463m, but platinum and other mining
declined slightly to R127m from R155m. Coal's contribution also dipped to
R134m from R240m, although this was largely a reflection of the
disappearance of last year's R114m tax rebate from the figures.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was confident the earnings
improvement would carry through to the current year as a result of the
continued improvement in both the South African economy and the
international trading environment. He also expressed confidence in the
country's new government, praising both its 'welcome commitment to
reconciliation' and President Nelson Mandela's 'commitment to prudent
economic policies'.
However, he refused to be drawn on a time frame for the corporation's
planned unbundling of its interests in rival mining house Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments and the anticipated sale of some of that company's
largest divisions to black shareholders.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Academics take issue with
Nasdaq spreads - A study which sharply criticised dealers on the
screen-based Nasdaq market has reopened the issue of the quality of US stock
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-simmering debate over the quality of US stock markets heated up
last week when an academic study sharply criticised dealers on the Nasdaq
market for maintaining unnecessarily wide spreads between buy and sell
prices.
Wide spreads are bad for investors, because they are denied the opportunity
to pay a little less when buying a stock, or receive a little more when
selling. Dealer firms like wide spreads, because they translate into bigger
profits - the wider the spread, the more money the dealer can make on the
difference between the price he pays and the price at which he sells.
The study - conducted by two college finance professors, William Christie of
Vanderbilt University and Paul Schultz of Ohio State University - found that
for 71 of the 100 most actively traded Nasdaq stocks of 1991, dealers
rarely, if ever, listed stock quotes ending in an odd-eighth of a dollar
when posting bid (buy) and offer (sell) prices on their computer screens.
Instead of using the full range of eighths, such as Dollars  1/8 , Dollars
3/8 , Dollars  5/8 and Dollars  7/8 , the study found that dealers almost
always quoted spreads of even-eighths, such as Dollars 1/4 , Dollars  1/2 ,
Dollars  3/4 or a whole dollar. In contrast, spreads quoted on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (ASE) were found to be
consistently narrower than those on the Nasdaq, with the exchanges'
'specialists', or dealers, regularly using odd-eighths as well as
even-eighths when quoting prices.
Nasdaq, the large screen-based dealer market, run by the National
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) is the second-largest forum for
trading equities in the US after the NYSE, and its system of competing
dealers posting buy and sell prices on computer screens has been duplicated
by exchanges around the world, including London.
The study has attracted attention because the authors not only criticised
the wide spreads posted by Nasdaq dealers, but also argued that the
extremely rare use of odd-eighth quotes suggested dealers may be working in
concert to keep spreads wide.
'Despite extensive research, there is little explanation as to why as many
as 50 dealers, all in competition, would neglect one-half of all possible
price options if not for implicit collusion,' said Mr Christie and Mr
Schultz.
The study was immediately seen as providing support for the long-held view
of floor-based exchanges that their system of allowing the flow of orders to
set prices - with specialists ready to step in and participate in a trade
only when necessary - provides investors with a better service than Nasdaq's
system of letting dealers set prices to attract orders. Although the NYSE
declined to comment, sources at the exchange said privately that the
findings proved the Nasdaq system did not encourage competition.
The NASD quickly attacked the study's findings, arguing that there was no
evidence of collusion between dealers. While he did not dispute the study's
facts on spread sizes, Mr Richard Ketchum, vice-president, said the wide
spreads were a reflection of one of Nasdaq's strengths, 'a great deal of
liquidity at a single price'.
This has always been the main argument put forward for the Nasdaq system:
that what investors lose from wider spreads, they more than get back from
the guarantee of liquidity afforded by the multiple dealer system.
By allowing dealers to maintain, and profit from, spreads of a quarter of a
dollar, the NASD says it is ensuring that there will always be enough
dealers in the market.
It argues that tighter spreads would, by cutting into dealers' profits,
deter dealers from making a market in many stocks and reduce liquidity.
While this argument makes sense when discussing the liquidity of small,
lightly-traded stocks, it carries less weight when it comes to the biggest
stocks on the Nasdaq system, like Apple Computer, Intel and Lotus
Development. Even with these three giants, which in theory should attract a
multiplicity of dealers eager to compete for business, the Christie-Schultz
study found that spreads were almost never quoted in odd-eighths.
The study on Nasdaq spreads, however, does raise the wider issue of the
quality of US stock markets, and whether they provide investors with the
best possible service. Mr Junius Peake, professor of finance at the
University of Northern Colorado and a long-time observer of US stock market
practices, says dealers are able to keep spreads wide to maximise their
profits because the systems are designed that way.
'As long as the trading systems are built by entities controlled by
market-makers, such as the NASD and the exchanges, they will be built to
serve those interests first. Only when we have independent commercial
operators trying to serve the best interests of the end-user, the investor,
will the system be designed to best serve investors.'
Systems which do not rely on intermediaries to bring buyers and sellers
together do exist. The majority of trades on the NYSE and ASE, for example,
are completed without a specialist becoming involved. Yet the specialist,
through his monopoly on the trading of each stock, still exerts considerable
control over pricing in the market, and the exchanges, like Nasdaq, are
controlled by their communities of dealers and brokers.
There are a handful of trading systems and markets run by independent
entities - including Instinet (run by Reuters), Posit (run by Jeffries &amp;
Co), and the Arizona Stock Exchange - which allow investors to deal
exclusively with each other, but they account for only a fraction of all
trading on US stock markets.
They are growing as more investors find they prefer non-dealer systems in
certain circumstances, but the lack of liquidity restricts their usefulness
to investors, particularly individuals.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris keeps the markets
guessing - Food and tobacco group has made an about-turn over a spin-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, going to spin off its
cigarette making operations? The stock market was left guessing after the
unusual corporate turnabout that took place last week.
Last week Philip Morris put out a terse statement after a
six-and-a-half-hour board meeting saying it had decided to take no action on
the possibility of separating the company's food and tobacco businesses.
But how were shareholders to reconcile this with an announcement just six
weeks earlier saying that a spin-off of the tobacco operations was being
considered?
In mid-April, Mr Hans Storr, the company's chief financial officer, said
that Philip Morris was looking at the possibility of a spin-off as one
option for increasing shareholder value.
The move appeared to make sense. Philip Morris - like RJR Nabisco, the next
biggest US food and tobacco group - had long believed its share price was
unduly depressed because of adverse sentiment about cigarette manufacturing.
The downward pressure increased last year when Philip Morris started a
bruising price war to win back market share from low-cost brands. More
recently, US cigarette makers have faced an unprecedented wave of attacks
from the anti-smoking lobby, government officials and Congress.
Meanwhile investors fear that, one day, someone will win a multi-million
dollar lawsuit against US cigarette makers requiring them to pay
compensation for suffering caused by smoking-related diseases. So far, the
cigarette makers have successfully defended themselves against every action,
but one success could open the floodgates.
When the Financial Times reported Mr Storr's remarks, the company was
flooded with requests from stock market analysts and the media for
confirmation of a possible split.
Philip Morris duly obliged, saying it was 'currently studying such a
separation'. And during the next two weeks, as analysts sent out 'buy'
recommendations to their clients, the stock price rose by more than 10 per
cent.
On April 25, Philip Morris said it was continuing to study a possible
demerger, so when the board met last Wednesday, expectations for an
announcement were running high. Instead, the company said the board had
rejected a split - and the next day further dashed hopes by saying: 'It is
not anticipated that this issue will be before the board in the foreseeable
future.'
Philip Morris declined last week to elaborate on its brief announcements, so
analysts were left to speculate on the reasons for the turnabout. Some
believed the plan was a dead duck; others thought it needed more work.
But Philip Morris had always emphasised that a spin-off was only one of the
options for enhancing shareholder value, and could involve problems. Among
the difficulties that could have confronted the board were:
A reluctance to overturn the logic that originally brought the tobacco and
food operations together - that is, the idea that the cashflow from the
tobacco operations should be used to fund the expansion of the food
operations.
Uncertainty that a split could protect the demerged food operations from a
successful lawsuit against the tobacco operations if the courts saw the
demerger as an attempt to circumvent liability.
The possibility that a free distribution of shares in a demerged tobacco
business would give shareholders an unwelcome tax liability.
Fears of an adverse political reaction from the anti-smoking lobby in
Washington to a move that could be seen as conferring benefits on the
country's biggest cigarette maker.
On the other hand, experience from other recent US demergers suggests that
most of these problems could have been overcome.
So analysts like Ms Becky Barfield of CS First Boston, the Wall Street
investment bank, wonder if there is a simpler explanation for what happened.
Clearly, the management favoured a demerger - because it would not have
published statements saying it was being considered; equally clearly, the
board was against the plan - because it turned it down. 'It sounds to me
like there was a fight,' Ms Barfield says.
Whatever the explanation, the debacle has done Philip Morris - and its
languishing share price - little credit. But where does it go from here?
One likely option is to boost earnings per share by accelerating the current
stock repurchase programme.
Another possibility would be to increase the proportion of earnings paid out
in dividends.
On the other hand, one positive outcome of last week's meeting was the
elevation to the board of Mr Geoffrey Bible, head of Philip Morris's
world-wide tobacco operations. Some analysts thought that could be a first,
tentative step towards a future demerger - once the board felt it could
decently come back to the plan without losing face.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ireland set to overhaul trading
in gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) plans an overhaul of
government bond trading which would replace the order-driven system with
market-making.
NTMA says the shift to a market-making system would improve liquidity,
reduce the cost of borrowing to the Irish exchequer and improve the market
for financial derivatives.
The changes are expected to increase annual turnover of the IPounds 14.5bn
(Dollars 21.5bn) stock of gilts from three to six times.
The proposals would create a new tier of primary dealers, which would be
separately incorporated from existing brokers. They would have capital
resources of at least IPounds 4m each, and quote firm two-way prices in nine
designated benchmark stocks.
Deals would be in minimum units of IPounds 2m for shorter maturities up to
five years, and in minimum units of IPounds 1m for longer maturing stocks.
Maximum spreads would be between 0.1 and 0.3 per cent, depending on stock
maturity.
NTMA says it would give exclusive access to market makers to tap sales,
would provide them with stock-switching arrangements, would facilitate the
development of stock lending and repurchase arrangements, and would be
prepared to intervene in secondary markets 'in times of major financial
turbulence'.
The average gross issuance of new government bonds is around IPounds 2bn per
year, of which IPounds 1.7bn is in respect of refinancing maturing debt.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japan bucks trend in government
bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the fourth consecutive month, most government bond markets fell in May,
according to JP Morgan's government bond index.
Japan was the only exception, topping the local currency performance charts
for the second straight month with a return of 1.2 per cent. Japanese bonds
have been supported by the country's sluggish economy, low interest rates
and receding inflation.
European government bonds were worst hit, falling 1.75 per cent on the
month, bringing the year-to-date performance to minus 5.22 per cent,
compared with minus 3.5 per cent in the year to date for the US bond market
and minus 4.08 per cent on the global index.
European falls were caused by concern that monetary easing may be coming to
an end. Germany was Europe's top performer, with a loss of 0.66 per cent in
May in spite of the half-point cut in the Bundesbank's discount rate to 4
1/2 per cent.
In spite of a spate of corruption scandals which caused the 10-year yield to
vault to 9.8 per cent, Spain was the second-strongest European market,
losing 0.71 per cent in May.
Europe's worst performer was the UK market, which lost 3.78 per cent on
inflation expectations, bringing the year-to-date loss to 11.29 per cent.
US bonds only shed 0.06 per cent in May, but the market remains nervous.
'With jobs growth replacing interest rates as the force behind increased
spending in the US economy, investors are becoming increasingly concerned
with the Fed's ability to contain the risk of upward price pressures,' the
report states.

<TEXT>
The Norwegian government's continued control of commercial banks risks
distorted competition in the sector, Mr Finn Hvistendahl, Norwegian Bankers
Association chairman, yesterday warned.
Mr Hvistendahl, who is also president of Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest
commercial bank, said the government should make it an objective to
re-privatise state-owned commercial banks.
'The government stake in the major Norwegian commercial banks will
inevitably affect competition in the (domestic) banking industry,' he told
the association's annual meeting.
Norway's banks returned to profit last year for the first time in several
years, after emerging from the country's worst banking crisis since the
second world war.
The crisis forced the government to make a far-reaching rescue operation, in
which it became the single biggest owner of the capital of the top three
commercial banks, DnB, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank.
In March, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
warned against that continued dominant government involvement in the banking
industry.

Compaq Computer has sharply reduced the prices of several of its personal
computer products in an attempt to expand market share.
The Texas-based company has set its sights on overtaking IBM and Apple
Computer to become the PC market-leader by 1996.
The price reductions range from 4 to 29 per cent, with the deepest cuts
applying to its sub-notebook PC, the Contura Aero, which will sell in the US
at Dollars 999 for the basic model.
Compaq also lowered prices on its multimedia Presario models, which
incorporate a CD-ROM player, by about 13 per cent. Prices will now start at
Dollars 1,299.
High-performance Pentium-based desktop PCs and servers were reduced by up to
18 per cent.
With its latest price cuts, Compaq is moving aggressively to undercut its
largest competitors. 'With this move we (will) set the pace for value
leadership in the PC industry,' said Mr Ross Cooley, senior vice-president.
Compaq's US shipments outstripped those of IBM and Apple in the US market
for the first time during the first quarter of this year, according to
Dataquest, the US market research group.
'Compaq took advantage of Apple's PowerPC transition and IBM's traditionally
slow first quarter to jump out to an early US PC shipment lead - but we
expect it to be a close three-way race by year-end,' said Mr Philippe de
Marcillac, director of Dataquest's PC group.
Compaq captured the first-quarter lead by shipping nearly 55 per cent more
PCs in the US than in the same period last year, he said.
The US PC market as a whole showed strong growth, with shipments up by more
than 17 per cent over the first quarter of 1993.
The top 10 PC manufacturers accounted for all of the growth, with sales by
smaller PC makers declining, according to Dataquest.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Workers seek to stop USAir
contract move

<TEXT>
Labour unions at USAir, the US carrier in which British Airways holds a 22
per cent stake, say they are seeking a federal injunction to stop the
airline's plans to contract out its airfreight and mail handling operations
at 35 cities, writes Richard Tomkins in New York.
USAir announced the move last week, saying it would save Dollars 10m a year.
The 510 full-time and 122 part-time workers affected would be invited to
apply for other jobs within the company, it said.
Just before USAir announced the move, a majority of its 8,000 fleet service
workers had voted to join a union.
Yesterday, the United Steelworkers of America, one of the unions covering
the industry, accused USAir of trying to discourage employees from joining
by creating the impression it would retaliate with lay-offs.
USAir said the union's suit was 'baseless and without merit'.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Matra in part-sale of US space
subsidiary

<TEXT>
Matra, the military arm of France's Lagardere group, has agreed the partial
sale of its US subsidiary, Fairchild Space and Defense Corporation, to
Orbital Sciences Corp of the US in a Dollars 105m deal.
Matra is to be paid in cash and shares, giving it a stake of more than 15
per cent in Orbital. The French company will still own Fairchild's
buildings, worth Dollars 39m, which it will lease to Orbital.
Matra bought Fairchild in 1989. It said yesterday the deal was prompted by
the 'almost unavoidable necessity' of mergers because of the cuts in US
military and space spending.
Orbital is a fast-growing space company, with turnover of Dollars 190m last
year. Its technology includes Orbcomm mini-telecom satellites, the Pegasus
system of launching the mini-satellites from aircraft, and techniques in
map-making from pictures taken from space.
Fairchild has a large amount of government business, including work on the
US Air Force's F-22 advanced tactical fighter.
Matra said its interest in the deal was primarily product-related. It wanted
to associate its own French-based space business and that of Fairchild with
Orbital.
Orbital Sciences, based in Fairfax, Virginia, earned Dollars 4.6m last year,
up from earnings of Dollars 3.8m on revenues of Dollars 174.6m in 1993.
The company has successfully launched 16 space missions, including the
Pegasus rocket and suborbital launch vehicles.
Mr David Thompson, chief executive of Orbital, said earlier this year the
company had been exploring ways to apply its space launch and satellite
systems technologies to higher-growth commercial markets.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dash of drama in theme park saga
 -Alice Rawsthorn profiles the Saudi billionaire rescuing Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are lots of gallant heroes in Walt Disney's cartoons, but few are
quite as dashing as Zorro, the masked horseman whose bravery won him a
starring role in a EuroDisneyland commercial, where he gallops through the
theme park to slip a crystal slipper on to Cinderella's foot.
Yesterday a real-life Zorro rode to EuroDisneyland's rescue. Prince
Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the 37-year-old nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia,
stunned the international investment community by unveiling plans to buy
between 13 per cent and 24.5 per cent of Euro Disney, the theme park's
troubled owner.
The prince's arrival, only a few days before an extraordinary general
meeting at which Euro Disney is expected to announce the terms of a FFr6bn
(Dollars 1.04bn) rights issue, adds yet another dash of drama to the saga of
the ill-starred theme park. Yet drama has become a familiar phenomenon to
Prince Al-Waleed in his short but action-packed business career.
Prince Al-Waleed may have begun life with the pomp and privileges associated
with being a member of the Saudi royal family. But he has since built on his
hereditary advantages with the verve of a rags-to-riches entrepreneur by
turning his original 'stake' of Dollars 15,000 into a personal fortune
estimated at Dollars 4bn.
His early life was typical of the cosmopolitan Arabs of his generation. He
spent his childhood in Beirut and Riyadh before being educated in the United
States. He returned to Saudi Arabia in 1985 where he began his first
business - the Kingdom Establishment construction company - with his token
Dollars 15,000.
Kingdom Establishment expanded rapidly and has since been involved with
construction projects worth more than Dollars 20bn. Within three years the
prince had started to diversify, turning his attention to banking with the
acquisition of a significant stake in United Saudi Commercial Bank, the
Riyadh-based banking group of which he is now chairman.
But it was not until 1991 that Prince Al-Waleed made his name on the
international scene when, after weeks of secret negotiations, he paid
Dollars 800m for a 14.8 per cent stake in Citicorp, the US banking group,
where he is still the biggest single investor.
Two years later he expanded further in the US by buying 11 per cent of Saks
Fifth Avenue, the famous department store. Earlier this year he surfaced in
the French investment arena, when he teamed up with Mr Paul Dubrule and Mr
Gerard Pelisson, joint chairmen of the Accor hotel group, in their bid for
the Meridien luxury hotel chain from Air France, the state-controlled
airline.
The Meridien deal, which brought Prince Al-Waleed and Accor into conflict
with Forte, the UK leisure group, is still on the negotiating table as the
Air France board mulls the merits of their competing bids. The French press
at the time made much of the size of the prince's personal fortune, given
that he has promised to finance the entire FFr1.6bn bid.
But that deal pales in comparison with Euro Disney. The prince is not only
committed to spending around FFr1.5bn on his stake of up to 24.5 per cent,
but has also offered to invest an additional Dollars 100m to build a second
conference centre at the theme park.
Moreover, the intricate terms of the deal may mean that Prince Al-Waleed
ends up buying a significant holding of Euro Disney stock from Walt Disney,
its powerful US parent (although the prince's total holding is not allowed
to be worth more than half that of Walt Disney).
Whatever the outcome, Prince Al-Waleed appears committed to a long-term
investment in Euro Disney. If Walt Disney ever decides to reduce its holding
further, or if Euro Disney starts to cast around for capital to finance its
desired second theme park, Prince Al-Waleed might be asked to play Zorro for
a second time by riding yet again to the rescue.

<TEXT>
Grasim Industries, one of India's leading industrial companies, plans a
Dollars 100m issue of global depositary shares (GDS).
It is the first Indian company to receive government approval to tap the
international capital markets since the failed Dollars 1bn euro-equity
offering by VSNL, the state-controlled telecommunications group, a month
ago.
Part of an industrial group run by Mr Aditya Birla, Grasim is the largest
manufacturer of viscose fibre in India, and a big cement and steel producer.
The shares, which will be priced next week, will be fungible with an
existing Dollars 90m GDS issue.
The money will go towards the company's Dollars 387m capital expenditure
programme over the next three years.
The company is building a cement works and a power plant, as well as
expanding textile production.
Mr Birla said: 'This is important for me and for the country. Grasim was the
first company to come successfully to the international market in 1992, and
the first after the VSNL failure. A lot of people will be watching us very
carefully.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Norway warned on banking
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Norwegian government's continued control of commercial banks risked
distorting competition in the sector, Mr Finn Hvistendahl, Norwegian Bankers
Association chairman, yesterday warned.
Mr Hvistendahl, who is also president of Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest
commercial bank, said the government should make it an objective to
re-privatise state-owned commercial banks.
'The government stake in the major Norwegian commercial banks will
inevitably affect competition in the (domestic) banking industry,' he told
the association's annual meeting in Bergen.
Norway's banks last year returned to profit for the first time in several
years, after emerging from the country's worst banking crisis since the
second world war.
The crisis forced the government to undertake a far-reaching rescue
operation, in which it became the single biggest owner of the capital of the
top three commercial banks. DnB received more than NKr7bn (Dollars 981m) in
state cash, while Christiania Bank, the second biggest bank, received a
NKr9bn injection.
The Labour government has repeatedly stressed its intention to maintain a
minimum 50 per cent shareholding in DnB and Christiania Bank, at least for
now.
Last year, the state boosted its stake in DnB, to 87.5 per cent from 69 per
cent, by converting NKr3.5bn in preference capital in the bank to 350m new
shares.
The state reduced its stake in Christiania to 68.9 per cent from 98.8 per
cent last December. It remains the sole owner of Fokus Bank.
In March, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned
against continued dominant government involvement in the banking industry.

<TEXT>
Prazske Pivovary, the fourth- largest Czech brewer, is to raise up to Kc3bn
(Dollars 107m) to fund a five-year modernisation of its three brewing
divisions and expand overseas sales of its leading brand.
Mr Alfie Vaughan, a director of Prazske Pivovary, said that the aim was to
improve efficiency and modernise brewing methods.
Prazske Pivovary, in which Bass of the UK has a 34 per cent stake, expects
to tap the Czech capital markets for the funds. However, the technical
problems of raising long-term capital in the Czech Republic will have to be
overcome. 'Our debt profile is very short-term, which must change,' Mr
Vaughan said.
The main beneficiary of new investment will be the company's Smichov
brewery, which makes Staropramen, its leading brand with an estimated 10 per
cent of the Czech market.
Staropramen is to be marketed abroad as a premium lager. It will be launched
in some UK pubs owned by Bass from October, backed up by 'a very substantial
marketing budget', Mr Vaughan said.
Bass paid Pounds 9m (Dollars 13.6m) for its stake in Prazske Pivovary late
last year.

Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transport equipment group reported a

its 50-passenger regional jet and strong demand for snow-mobiles and
watercraft resulted in a 33.7 per cent gain in first-quarter net profit
while sales advanced 27 per cent.
Bombardier earned CDollars 52.4m (USDollars 37.9m), or 31 cents a share,

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kmart loses backing of investor
for stake sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's biggest institutional investor is joining a rebellion against
plans by Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, to sell stakes of up
to 30 per cent in its four specialty retailing subsidiaries.
The influential College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), which holds 1.1bn
of Kmart's 455.9bn issued shares, said it wanted Kmart to sell the
subsidiaries completely, so that management could concentrate on improving
the core discount store business.
It also said it would withhold support for all five of Kmart's 13 directors
seeking re-election this year, citing the company's 'significant long-term
decline in market share, profitability, operating earnings and share price'.
With only a day to go before the company's annual meeting on Friday, the
CREF is the biggest of five investors to have spoken out against Kmart's
strategy.
The others are the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the 10
largest US pension funds; the Florida State Board of Administration; the
Ohio State Teachers Retirement System; and the Amalgamated Clothing and
Textile Workers Union.
Between them, these investors control only a small percentage of Kmart's
shares. However, they are hoping their public opposition to Kmart's plans
will swing other shareholders against the company.
Kmart, which has been struggling to compete with its more successful rival,
Wal-Mart, ended five years of stagnant earnings by plummeting into net
losses of Dollars 947m last year. Plans for recovery include the creation of
new shares in its specialty retailing subsidiaries and the sale of up to 30
per cent of the shares in the marketplace.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Prodi may stay on as interim Iri
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The resignation of Mr Romano Prodi as chairman of Iri, the Italian state
holding company, has given the Berlusconi government a free hand to reshape
and accelerate privatisation policy.
Mr Prodi resigned on Tuesday after the Iri board had approved 1993 results
which showed losses had more than doubled to L10,230bn (Dollars 6.4bn).
Yesterday the four other members of the board announced their resignations.
The government has yet to accept the resignations. Mr Prodi indicated
yesterday he would not change his mind. Iri has debts of L75,000bn, almost 5
per cent of GDP.
'I returned to Iri to deal with its finances and impose a restructuring plan
with a view to privatisation. Now it is the time, after the presentation of
the annual accounts, to hand over matters to the new government,' Mr Prodi
said yesterday.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, commenting on the resignation
yesterday said: 'This is a problem which we still have to work on.'
This suggests that Mr Prodi will stay on in an interim capacity until the
June 30 shareholders meeting before formally stepping down. This would
enable him to approve the privatisation of Ilva's special steel operations.
Iri became a public company with the treasury as the single shareholder in
August 1992. At present the government appears inclined to appoint a new
chairman whose basic task will be to act as a kind of 'liquidator'. The
chairman would sell off or re-distribute all worthwhile assets while the
remainder would be gradually liquidated.
The procedure could be similar to that applied to Efim, the industrial
holding company placed in liquidation in July 1992. However, government
officials insist if such a procedure were adopted, they would seek to avoid
the mistakes of Efim - in particular antagonising foreign creditors.

lifts profits

<TEXT>
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, preparing for privatisation in 1996, lifted
profits before taxes, write-offs and government transfers to DM7.6bn
(Dollars 4.5m) last year, up from DM7bn, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
After special write-offs of DM3.2bn and taxes and transfers to the state of
DM6bn, the group reported a net loss of DM2.9bn, Telekom said yesterday.
Group sales rose by 9.3 per cent, to DM59bn from DM54bn, reflecting a surge
in business in eastern German states where turnover rose to DM4.5bn from
DM3.5bn.
The law for privatisation is expected to come into force in 1995, providing
for the transformation of Telekom into three operating companies. It will be
Germany's biggest privatisation to date.
The first tranche in the telecommunications arm will be offered in mid-1996
with a market value of DM10bn-DM15bn. The market capitalisation of the group
as a whole is set to be about DM60bn.

GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French transport and engineering group yesterday said
it had taken control of Linke-Hoffman-Busch, the German rail equipment
manufacturer.
GEC Alsthom said it bought 51 per cent of the shares from Preussag for an
undisclosed sum. The acquisition is the first by the Anglo-French joint
venture in the railway sector in Germany and is aimed at strengthening its
presence in European markets.
'It fills an important gap for us,' the company said. GEC Alsthom has large
operations in Germany in two other core divisions - power generation and
power distribution. GEC Alsthom has sales of about DM1.2bn (Dollars 706m) in
Germany and employs about 4,000.
LHB, which has annual sales of about DM450m and a workforce of 2,000, is
based in Satzgitter, near Hanover. It is involved in the design and
manufacture of trains, trams, electric and diesel locomotives, freight
wagons, bogies and couplers.
LHB participates in the manufacture of the ICE, the high-speed train which
has been developed and built by a consortium led by Siemens. The ICE is the
principal European competitor for the Train a Grande Vitesse, built by GEC
Alsthom.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: ITT likely to take control of
Ciga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT Sheraton of the US is expected to try to gain effective control of Ciga,
the luxury Italian hotel group, after acquiring a 14 per cent stake.
ITT confirmed yesterday that it acquired the stake at an auction of Ciga
shares last month. The US group refused to comment on whether it planned to
increase its stake further.
However, Italian regulations require a shareholder in ITT's position to make
a public offering for a further stake equivalent to the one it already
holds, which would take ITT's holding to 28 per cent.
Gaining control of the luxury chain would be a coup for ITT. Its ambitions
to acquire the Italian group appeared to have been thwarted last April by a
successful Ciga rights issue and a rise in its share price.
Acquiring Ciga now would be significantly more expensive than originally
envisaged. ITT's initial offering last February valued the group at L740bn
(Dollars 465m), although observers believe the assumption of the group's
liabilities and payment of bankers' fees would have brought the total to
L900bn.
At current share price levels, a bid is likely to value Ciga at more than
L1,200bn.
ITT emerged as a surprise buyer for Ciga earlier in the year when it edged
out Forte of the UK, then the front runner. Following ITT's bid, Ciga
launched the rights issue and share auction; at L1,000 a share, the rights
issue was expected to fail. This would deliver the hotel group to its
creditor banks as underwriters, and they would then sell it to ITT at L740 a
share.
The rights issue was a success, however, as was the subsequent share
auction. Ciga's shares have been trading consistently at a level above
L1,000.
Ciga said yesterday that the rights issue and auction had brought in
L1,003bn, which would cover its short-term debt. The group owes L950bn to
banks and a further L50bn to suppliers whose payments are overdue.
Italian hotel analysts said they did not believe Ciga could continue as a
quoted company with a diverse group of shareholders.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Fleming to pay Dollars 1.1bn for
Scrivener food distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fleming, the second biggest wholesale food distributor in the US, is to buy
Scrivener, the country's third biggest distributor, from its German parent
company for Dollars 1.1bn in cash.
The purchase, announced yesterday, will turn the combined companies - close
neighbours in Oklahoma City - into the biggest food distribution group in
the US, pushing the Minneapolis-based Super Valu Stores into the number two
slot.
Since 1977, Scrivener has been a subsidiary of Franz Haniel - a family-owned
German conglomerate with interests in transport, trading and
pharmaceuticals. Mr Franz Haniel is understood to have agreed sale of the
subsidiary to pay off debt incurred last year when it bought Office
Commercial Pharmaceutique, a French pharmaceutical company.
Fleming said its purchase of Scrivener would create a group with combined
annual sales of Dollars 19bn. It would strengthen Fleming's customer base in
the Midwest and east, and take the group into seven new markets: Iowa, the
Carolinas, western Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and Minnesota.
The enlarged Fleming will serve more than 5,800 independent and chain
supermarkets and more than 2,800 convenience stores in the US.
Of the Dollars 1.1bn purchase price, some Dollars 388m is for Scrivener's
equity and most of the rest will be used to pay off Scrivener's loans.
Fleming said Scrivener made operating profits of Dollars 106m last year.
Fleming has been suffering from static or declining profits caused by weak
retail food sales and a lack of food price inflation. Excluding
extraordinary items, net profits fell to Dollars 99.3m from Dollars 118.9m
last year on a 1.5 per cent increase in turnover to Dollars 13.1bn.
At the beginning of this year Fleming embarked on a reorganisation to
restore profits growth by cutting costs.
Yesterday, Mr Robert Strauth, chairman, indicated that a similar
're-engineering' process would be applied to Scrivener, and could take some
Dollars 20m out of the company's operating costs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH), one of Poland's largest banks, is to be
privatised by the end of this year through a stock exchange flotation of 50
per cent of the equity, the finance ministry announced.
The sale of the Krakow-based bank will be followed next year by an
invitation to foreign and domestic investors to take up a large share of the
remaining equity in 1995. Three per cent of the bank's shares are to offered
to management and employees.
The bank, which reported a 773bn zloty (Dollars 35.5m) net profit last year
on a balance sheet worth 33,071bn zlotys, was originally to have been sold
by the middle of this year to a strategic investor and through a public
share offer.
However, this method was used for the sale earlier this year of Bank Slaski,
the last state-owned bank to be privatised. It led to the resignation of Mr
Marek Borowski, finance minister, and the ministry's top banking officials,
and put a question mark over the BPH disposal.
Critics charged that Bank Slaski had been sold at an excessive discount.
Meanwhile, Mr Janusz Quandt, the BPH chairman who has in the past five years
built a nationwide retail network and who sees the bank combining this with
an investment banking role, has been urging for a capital increase for the
bank through a sale of new shares to selected domestic investors. He has
argued against having one strategic investor buy into the bank.
The finance ministry has chosen to auction half of the bank's equity through
the bourse and then search for a strategic investor once a market price has
been established for the BPH.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom buys Pounds 50m
Astra stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the German state-owned telecommunications and
post office group, has bought a large stake in Astra, the satellite
television company, in a deal believed to be worth Pounds 50m (Dollars
75.2m).
The German company has bought 25 per cent of the privately-held share
capital of Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Astra holding company.
Two-thirds of SES is held by private European investors including Thames
Television, which along with the Financial Times is a subsidiary of Pearson,
the media and entertainment group.
The other third of SES is owned by Luxembourg state-owned financial
institutions.
Although it is most unlikely that SES will be sold - the Luxembourg
government will want to keep its stake and its control - the deal would give
a notional value for SES of more than Pounds 500m. SES declined to reveal
the purchase price of the Telekom stake.
The deal suggests that Thames Television's 10 per cent stake in SES could be
worth more than Pounds 50m. Pearson paid Pounds 100m for Thames, and in
addition to the SES stake, the deal included the company's continuing
programme supply business with Independent Television, its Teddington
studios, programme library and stakes in satellite channels.
SES has three Astra satellites broadcasting 50 television channels to cable
television networks and satellite dishes across western Europe. A fourth
satellite capable of broadcasting a further 16 channels is due to be
launched in September.
SES revenues in 1993 increased 23 per cent over 1992 to Pounds 128m. Profits
rose 19 per cent to Pounds 55m.

FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Endesa price fall clouds future
offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The issue price for the partial privatisation of Endesa, the state
electricity utility, has fallen below expectations, raising doubts about
future public equity offerings.
The offering in Endesa, which reduced the state holding by 9 per cent to 65
per cent, realised only Pta144bn (Dollars 1.06bn). This compared with
Pta200bn that had been anticipated when the disposal was planned in
February.
'We've had really bad luck with the markets over the past three months and
our subscription closed on a particularly criminal day for equities,' said
Endesa.
The offer was priced at Pta6.450 per share, a price that was set by Endesa's
closing price in New York on Tuesday and which was down on its earlier
Tuesday Madrid close of Pta6,550.
Yesterday, as the Spanish stock exchange continued to fall, the utility's
share price dropped further to Pta6,400 in Madrid as a heavy volume of about
2m Endesa shares were traded.
The price falls came as a shock. In the past, equity offerings by Spanish
public companies - including Endesa, which first tapped the international
markets in 1989 - had been unqualified successes.
The only comfort for Endesa was that the offering, which was co-ordinated by
Goldman Sachs, had performed somewhat better in its domestic retail tranche,
where the offer was 3.25 times subscribed with 200,000 applications for an
average of 100 shares each.
The utility had purposely weighted the offering towards Spanish investors,
and the demand from domestic retailers meant that it was able to exercise
its clawback option and reduce shares offered to institutions by 16 per
cent.
Analysts in Madrid said yesterday that the ill-fortune surrounding Endesa's
equity offer was bound to influence other public disposals that are in the
pipeline.
These include an equity offering by Repsol, the oil, gas and chemicals
group, which is tentatively planned for the end of the year, and possibly
one by Argentaria, the state banking corporation.
'It's quite clear that partial privatisations are no longer a well spring on
which the government can rely,' said Mr Juan Bastos, chief executive of
brokers Ibersercurities.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chesterton sees 34% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chesterton International, the property consultancy, is predicting a 34 per
cent increase to Pounds 5.1m in profits before tax for the year to end-June,
helped by a strong increase in property activity in southern England.
Chesterton issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday for a flotation which
will value the group at more than Pounds 50m and offer about 40 per cent of
its enlarged share capital through a placing.
About 25 per cent of the offer will comprise new shares, raising Pounds 5m
for the group to lower debt and fund future expansion.
Two thirds of the old shares being placed will come from former employees
and 'near-term retirees'. The remainder, amounting to approximately Pounds
5m of shares, will be be sold by current employees, who will retain more
than 50 per cent of the company's shares.
At the current minimum issue price of 100p, the shares would be issued on a
p/e of about 14.
Chesterton, like most consultancy businesses, has few assets, and post
flotation, shareholders funds will amount to some Pounds 10m.
Employees are its key asset, and a costly one to maintain. Staff costs
amounted to Pounds 25.8m in the year to June 1993, up from Pounds 21.7m.
The company has already seen significant improvement in profit margins from
its core consultancy businesses.
Advisory fees accounted for 72 per cent of last year's revenue, and
Chesterton intends to build up further its consultancy business to maintain
a more consistent earnings base in a business renowned for volatility.
The flotation is sponsored by Robert Fleming; pricing will be announced on
June 15.

British Midland Airways, the UK's second largest scheduled airline,
yesterday further extended its network of international partnerships by
forging a ticket code-sharing agreement with Austrian Airlines, writes Paul
Betts.
Under the deal, the Austrian flag carrier will offer seats on British
Midland services to Belfast, Dublin, Glasgow and Edinburgh, Teesside and
Leeds Bradford via London's Heathrow airport.
In turn, British Midland passengers will be able to make twice daily
connections into Austrian's hub in Vienna.
Code sharing allows two airlines to use their respective ticket codes on
each other's flights.
The British Midland-Austrian agreement will start on July 1 and travellers
will be issued with connecting flight boarding passes and advance seat
selection at their point of departure.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Warner-Wellcome starts its European
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European operations of Warner-Wellcome, the new consumer health joint
venture between Wellcome of the UK and Warner-Lambert of the US, came into
being yesterday, two weeks after being given the go-ahead from the European
Commission.
'We received a 'comfort letter' from the Commission indicating that there
were no objections,' said Mr James Cochran, European operations director of
Wellcome.
The Commission said in March that it was reviewing the deal.
A letter of intent was signed by the two companies in July 1993 and the
North American arm of the operation came into existence in January 1994.
Warner-Wellcome is 50-50 owned by the two partners in Europe and 70 per cent
owned by Warner-Lambert in the US.
Mr John Walsh, president of Warner-Lambert's consumer products division,
said the venture should double its worldwide sales of over-the-counter
medicines from a current level of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in the next
five years.
The European operation will sell a range of products including Listerine
mouthwash, Actifed cold treatment and Zovirax, Wellcome's anti-viral drug
for use on cold sores.
Mr Walsh said that the market for OTC products would grow from Dollars 30bn
to Dollars 40bn a year by 2000. The joint venture's sales would double over
five years thanks to 'switch products' - prescription drugs such as Zovirax
that receive approval for OTC sales.
The venture has a licence from Glaxo to sell an OTC version of the world's
biggest selling prescription drug - Zantac, the ulcer treatment.
Zovirax is yet to receive OTC approval in the US. The terms of the contract
between Wellcome and Warner-Lambert provide for a review of the joint
venture if the drug fails to secure approval.
The company will be seeking further licences to sell OTC versions of
prescription drugs, said Mr Cochran, although none were close to being
secured. The OTC market would grow quickly because individuals wanted to be
able to treat themselves without having to consult a doctor, he added.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cost cuts help NIE to Pounds 75m - Some 510
staff leave core business, further reductions planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Job cuts and above average sales growth helped Northern Ireland Electricity,
which was privatised last June, to increase annual pre-tax profits by 28 per
cent, from Pounds 58.7m to Pounds 74.9m.
The comparative figures are on a pro forma basis.
NIE cut 510 staff from its core business in the 12 months to March 31,
leaving 2,756 in place.
It plans to lose at least another 200 by March 1996.
The jobs cuts were one of the factors behind a 5 per cent reduction in
controllable costs during the year.
The company also benefited from a 2.4 per cent growth in unit sales for the
year, compared with an average of 1.1 per cent achieved by power
distributors in Great Britain.
Operating profit increased to Pounds 81.9m (Pounds 72.3m) on turnover of
Pounds 482m (Pounds 453m). The pre-tax line, however, was depressed by an
Pounds 8.2m exceptional item for reorganisation and restructuring costs
mainly incurred in reducing staff.
Earnings per share were ahead 32 per cent at 36.7p (27.8p). A proposed final
dividend of 8p gives a total of 11.39p.
Sir Desmond Lorimer, outgoing chairman, said the company had told the
industry regulator that it favoured the introduction of competition into the
market.
The regulator has already tabled proposals for the creation of a pool
trading system.
Sir Desmond said NIE had 'highlighted the need to avoid structures which are
uneconomic or which might compromise stability'.
COMMENT
The pattern is familiar enough. A recently privatised company finds the
scope for cutting costs is far greater than it had imagined when it was
negotiating with the government on setting the price for the sale. It
happened when the power industry in England and Wales was privatised four
years ago and it has happened again with NIE. Consumers and taxpayers will
no doubt complain, but shareholders need not worry too much. They can
rejoice that, unlike the England and Wales power companies, NIE will escape
major regulatory reform this summer. They should also congratulate the
management whose control on job numbers and capital expenditure should
ensure that gearing will reach nothing like the 60 per cent levels once
predicted for the late 1990s; even 40 per cent may seem excessive now. With
dividend cover last year at 3.2 times, there is plenty of scope to increase
the distribution to shareholders. This year could see about 13p, putting the
shares on a prospective yield on a fully paid basis of 4.6 per cent, nearly
a percentage point lower than the England and Wales power companies.
Nonetheless, the shares have been strongly outperforming recently. In the
short term their progress will be arrested as the June 28 deadline
approaches for paying the second instalment for the shares.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Towles rejects Australians
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Towles, the lossmaking clothing manufacturer which last week was the subject
of a Pounds 4.22m cash bid from London City Equities, yesterday dismissed
the offer, saying it 'undervalued the company'.
London City, an Australian investment group which has 51 per cent of the
equity but only 14 per cent of the votes, said it made the offer because it
was 'outraged' at Towles' continuing losses.
The offer, announced last Friday, comprises 265p for each ordinary share,
115p for each A ordinary share, 52p for each A preference share, and 78p for
each B preference share.
Towles reported losses of Pounds 236,000 from turnover of Pounds 15.7m for
the year to end-February. London City said it planned to introduce new
management if it was successful.
The Towles board yesterday said it would provide detailed advice in due
course. Meanwhile, shareholders were advised to take no action.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Aberdeen Trust ahead to Pounds
3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An expanding range of investment trusts and substantially improved margins
lay behind an impressive first-half performance from Aberdeen Trust.
Turnover at the fund management and accountancy services group improved by
25 per cent during the six months to March 31 - from Pounds 7.15m to Pounds
8.96m - but pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 3.51m, a figure that compared
with Pounds 981,000 last time and exceeded the outcome of Pounds 3.15m
achieved in the group's last full year.
The advance was attributed to increased income growth and reduced fixed
overheads resulting from the rationalisation programme implemented last
year.
Directors said that a further Pounds 74m had been committed by investors in
1994 following the launch of Abtrust High Income Trust and capital issues
from Abtrust New Dawn Investment Trust and Abtrust Scotland Investment.
Total funds under management at the period-end amounted to Pounds 2.33bn, a
rise of 22 per cent.
The group has used the sizeable gain in operating cash flow to reduce
borrowings; gearing was 32 per cent at end-March, down from 45 per cent at
the September year-end and 67 per cent at the same stage of 1993.
The interim dividend rises 20 per cent to 0.6p, payable from earnings of
2.92p (0.81p).

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Harrods agrees deal with former director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrods, the Knightsbridge department store, has 'resolved amicably all
differences' with its former managing director Mr Peter Bolliger, whose
departure from the company in April provoked a bitter war of words.
Mr Bolliger insisted he had resigned after it became impossible for him to
work with Mr Mohamed al-Fayed, the store's 'hands-on' co-owner.
'He likes to feel he is running the store. He will even go behind a counter
and cut salami,' Mr Bolliger said at the time.
Harrods claimed Mr Bolliger had been sacked for his unsatisfactory
performance, in particular in his running of the Kurt Geiger shoe chain, and
handling of the dismissal of a senior manager.
The company later said it was suing Mr Bolliger for breach of contract and
lodged a writ with the High Court.
Mr Bolliger moved out of his Knightsbridge home and returned to his native
Switzerland, but his solicitors have released a statement saying that
'Harrods have resolved amicably all differences with Peter Bolliger on terms
acceptable to all parties.'
Neither side would comment on the terms of the agreement.
Harrods had also passed on a dossier detailing alleged irregularities by Mr
Bolliger to Chelsea CID, but it is thought the police investigation is
unlikely to proceed.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant used car sales behind rise at
Lookers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lookers, one of the top 10 UK motor dealer groups, more than doubled interim
pre-tax profits thanks largely to buoyant used car sales, writes Caroline
Southey.
Pre-tax rose from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds 3.09m in the six months to
end-March on turnover ahead by 14.2 per cent to Pounds 187m (Pounds 164m).
The group raised its interim dividend by 20 per cent from 2p to 2.4p. The
pay-out is covered more than three times by earnings of 7.8p (2.6p) per
share.
Mr Ken Martindale, chairman, said that profits had increased chiefly as a
result of a 19 per cent increase in used car sales coupled with improved
margins.
Sales of new cars to the fleet sector fell slightly, he said, but sales to
retail customers had risen by 13.5 per cent.
'We felt that margins at the top end of the fleet market were not worth
getting into and we did not get into deep discounting. But with constant
hard work I am confident we will be able to hold our improved margins,' Mr
Martindale said.
Increased personal taxation from April had interrupted the rising sales
trend, but Mr Martindale predicted a steady increase through to the end of
the year.
He said the company would be looking at expansion opportunities next year in
the light of a further reduction in its gearing, which had fallen to 36 per
cent at the end of March from 53 per cent a year ago.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Sketchley bolstered by Supasnaps
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A move into the photographic film business helped Sketchley, the dry
cleaning and photo processing group, increase pre-tax profits by 6 per cent
before exceptionals to Pounds 5.1m in the year to April 1.
Supasnaps, the photo processor acquired for a total cash payment of Pounds
6m in 1993, offset a difficult year in the core dry cleaning business.
The new division contributed Pounds 1.4m to operating profits of Pounds
6.6m. This compared with a total operating return of Pounds 5.8m last time,
which was depressed at the pre-tax level by a Pounds 1.7m exceptional
charge.
Sales were also boosted on the back of the acquisition, rising by 37 per
cent to Pounds 142.9m. Excluding Supasnaps, sales fell by 3 per cent to
Pounds 101.4m.
Mr John Richardson, deputy chairman, said that he was optimistic about the
current year, particularly given the recent increase in dry cleaning
volumes.
In four of the first five months of 1994, there had been a rise in sales of
about 2 per cent.
An increase in the dividend was intended to pass that confidence on to
shareholders, he said.
The pay-out is increased by 10 per cent to 2.2p, for a total up 7 per cent
at 3.2p, payable from earnings per share ahead from 4.9p to 6.7p.
The integration of Supasnaps was going forward as planned, with substantial
cost savings yet to be realised. Sketchley had cut Pounds 1.2m in costs last
year and expected a further Pounds 800,000 in savings this year.
The group merged 40 Supasnaps outlets with dry cleaning shops, and planned
to combine a further 50 this year.
Textile rental suffered an Pounds 800,000 drop in operating profits, due to
the accelerated closure of British Coal pits.
Mr Richardson said Warrender Aircraft Services, purchased six weeks ago for
Pounds 8m, was expected to contribute more than Pounds 1m this year.

</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas has asked the Philippines government for more time to consider a
possible bid for the state-owned Manila Gas Corporation.
The company, which was due to be sold last Monday, distributes natural gas
to industrial, commercial and residential users in Manila.
Reuters yesterday reported that the government had deferred the sale in
order for the National Development Company, the state owner of Manila Gas,
to evaluate new offers from British Gas and two Japanese companies.
But British Gas said it had not yet decided whether to go ahead with a bid.
The government wants to sell its 90 per cent holding in Manila Gas.
The remainder will be sold to small investors.
A government official yesterday said the interest of British Gas and the
Japanese companies was 'an improvement over the 20 or so potential buyers
who expressed interest only in the real estate assets'.
Expansion in south-east Asia is known to be a priority for British Gas.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tapping into a seam of experience - The
south Wales coal interests of Powell Duffryn and Wimpey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is almost impossible to consider the south Wales coal industry operating
without Powell Duffryn or George Wimpey. The two companies between them have
more than 150 years experience of digging, washing, grading and transporting
coal from the region.
It seems perfectly natural, therefore, that Powell Duffryn, now a
diversified engineering and distribution company, should seek to join forces
with Wimpey, a large construction, housebuilding and opencast mining group,
to bid for British Coal's south Wales operations.
For Powell Duffryn it would maintain a 130-year link with the region. The
company, founded in 1864 by a south Wales family, claimed to be the world's
largest independent coal mining company before the British coal industry was
nationalised in 1947.
Wimpey, which currently operates three of the region's nine opencast mines,
has operated in the area for more than 40 years.
The companies' experience may prove invaluable given the extreme geological
complexity of the region: 'God put the coal in, then he trod on it. Seams
double back on themselves making even opencast mining difficult,' said one
coal board official.
The joint venture will include all of the two companies' British coal
operations which last year had a combined turnover of about Pounds 80m,
generating pre-tax profits of about Pounds 4m.
Turnover is expected to rise to more than Pounds 200m if the joint venture
acquires all of British Coal's south Wales interests. The companies have not
ruled out taking a stake in other regional coal companies and are also
seeking to pre-qualify as a bidder in north-east England.
Their greatest interest, however, is in south Wales. The companies, in
addition to the nine opencast sites on offer, could also acquire one
remaining deep mine, Tower colliery, placed on care and maintenance, and
which is being sold separately.
The three sites operated by Wimpey produced about half of the region's
opencast output of more than 2m tonnes during the 12 months to the end of
March, accounting for about a sixth of British coal production. Tower's
production added another 900,000 tonnes.
About half the region's coal production is anthracite, a natural smokeless
fuel which commands a premium price and is sold mainly for burning in homes
and, according to Wimpey, has a strong export potential including to
Germany.
Powell Duffryn operates three of the region's five coal distribution sites
where it also washes and grades coal ready for sale to customers. Its
British coal operations, which have shrunk in recent years, accounted for
about 6 per cent of the company's Pounds 28.6m pre-tax profit in the year to
March 31 1993.
It sells about 500,000 tonnes of coal nationally on its own behalf as well
as providing processing and distribution services to British Coal.
Three years ago it sought to sell its British coal interests to concentrate
on its other engineering and distribution activities, including transport
and storage of bulk liquid chemicals. It subsequently withdrew the coal
businesses from the market because the offers it had received were too low.
Wimpey, by comparison, has remained steadfastly committed to its opencast
mining operations started in Britain during the second world war as a means
of increasing coal production by using machines rather than valuable
manpower. It was one of the first private sector contractors to move into
this market.
The company regards mining as an important diversification away from its
cyclical construction and housebuilding business. It remains one of the
country's biggest opencast contractors, producing 2.5m tonnes of coal last
year.
The two companies employ about 600 people in various coal operations in
south Wales, including 200 at Ffos Las, the region's biggest opencast site.
South Wales sells about 1m tonnes of coal a year to Aberthaw power station.
The region's opencast mines have proven reserves of 7.9m tonnes and fully
and partly proven reserves at prospective opencast sites of 45m tonnes, says
British Coal.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wolseley expands with Dollars 42m US buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley, the heating and plumbing merchant, is expanding its photographic
equipment distribution business with the purchase of Calumet Holdings of the
US for Dollars 42.3m (Pounds 28m).
Wolseley is already the leading distributor of professional photographic
equipment in Europe and believes the deal will make it the largest supplier
in the world.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman, said that Chicago-based Calumet's expertise
in mail order made it particularly attractive for Wolseley. 'We are
interested in developing mail order and believe it may be appropriate for
some of our other businesses.'
Calumet, which is being acquired debt-free, made an operating profit of
Dollars 5.06m on sales of Dollars 62.8m last year. Mr Lancaster said that
Wolseley was paying about 12.5 times after tax profits and that the deal
would enhance group earnings per share.
Wolseley, which has a policy of funding acquisitions with shares, is raising
Pounds 55m from a placing of shares with institutions at 748p. The new
shares, which represent almost 2.9 per cent of the share capital, will also
fund a number of further bolt-on acquisitions.
Wolseley first moved into photographic equipment distribution in 1986 when
it acquired Grovewood Securities from BAT Industries. This included a
leading distributor, Pelling, which Wolseley subsequently expanded with the
purchase of its rival Keith Johnson.
Mr Lancaster said buying Calumet would improve the group's purchasing terms
and make it a more attractive outlet for manufacturers.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Life Style postpones float in weak market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tumbling stock market claimed another new issue victim yesterday when
the flotation of Life Style Care, the nursing home group, was postponed.
Albert E Sharp, the company's sponsor, had been marketing the shares to
institutions for a couple of weeks and the issue was set to be priced next
week.
'The reaction from institutions was very positive but in view of the
incredibly volatile market conditions it was decided it was not the right
climate to go ahead,' the company said.
Several new issues were pulled last week and sponsors are now looking hard
at some companies in their pipelines. 'I would be very surprised if all ours
went ahead on schedule,' said one corporate broker.
Life Style Care, which has 14 homes with 564 beds, was planning a Pounds 10m
share placing which would have valued it at between Pounds 20m and Pounds
25m.
The family of Mr Ramesh Sachdev, the founder, which owns 85 per cent of the
equity, was looking to sell about Pounds 2m worth of shares with the rest of
the money going to the company to pay off borrowings.
Life Style Care, which specialises in caring for the elderly mentally
infirm, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m on turnover of Pounds 5.3m in
the year to last June.

Pentland yesterday made a small dent in its Pounds 185m cash pile with the
acquisition for up to Pounds 20m of a German sports goods company.
The group is paying DM30m (Pounds 12m) for Karl Reusch Handschufabrik, which
markets, licenses and manufactures specialist sports clothing and equipment.
A further DM20m will be paid in 2000 if Reusch meets profits targets between
1997 and 1999.
Reusch is perhaps best known for its goalkeeping gloves. Pentland estimates
that 75 per cent of the goalkeepers at the World Cup this month will be
wearing Reusch gloves.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: US software purchase for Micro Focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Micro Focus Group, the Berkshire-based computing services company which has
seen its share price slide sharply over the past year, is to pay up to
Dollars 13.5m (Pounds 8.9m) to acquire Burl Software Laboratories, a North
Carolina software house.
The deal calls for the exchange of between 400,000 and 800,000 of Micro
Focus ADRs and possibly some cash. It will be treated as a pooling of
interests under US accounting rules.
Micro Focus, a developer of software for personal computers which makes
large scale software easier to write, has seen the value of its shares fall
from Pounds 30 to less than Pounds 10 on fears that growth was slowing.
Excellent first quarter results partly reversed the trend. Yesterday the
shares stood at Pounds 10.78p.
Burl, established two years ago, now has 12 employees and negligible assets
and profits. It makes a software tool for the analysis of existing systems
written in Cobol.

Ionica, the private Cambridge-based telecommunications company pioneering
radio access technology, has raised Pounds 30m this year.
A strategic partnership with Pulsar, the Mexican conglomerate, accounts for
most of the investment, which takes Ionica's equity base to Pounds 45m.
Ionica aims to offer a telecoms service for 'fixed' phones in competition
with BT, using radio links for its local network instead of underground
cable. It is piloting its technology in East Anglia and plans to launch its
service next year.
Pulsar plans to use the technology to offer a similar service in Mexico.

Sturge Holdings, the Lloyd's underwriting agency, reported pre-tax up from
Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 493,000 in the six months ended March 31 1994.
The directors said an increase of Pounds 1.6m in stockbroking income to
Pounds 7.95m was more than offset by a reduction of Pounds 2.9m in insurance
agency income to Pounds 4.85m, which resulted from lower capacity under
management and reduced levels of run-off management fees.
The operating loss of insurance agencies was Pounds 1.84m (Pounds 1.99m)
while stockbroking profit was Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 951,000).
Net profit emerged at Pounds 243,000 (Pounds 196,000) and earnings per share
were 0.5p (0.4p). The interim dividend is held at 1p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Ramco Oil Services, the USM-quoted energy services group,
slipped from Pounds 349,000 to Pounds 323,000 in the year to end-December.
Turnover fell from Pounds 5.43m to Pounds 4.78m.
Earnings emerged at 0.6p (1.88p) and the dividend for the year is halved to
0.5p.
The directors said the fall in turnover reflected lower levels of activity
related to declining oil prices.
In December last year Ramco commissioned its one-stop tubular service centre
at Badentoy, near Aberdeen, and completed the sale of its former site at
Altens.
A placing of 800,000 new shares at 121 1/2 p took place in May 1993, and a
further 485,000 were placed at 125p in August. The funds raised helped
enable the completion of the first phase of the Badentoy facility.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Revamped Borthwicks returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borthwicks mounted a sharp recovery in the first full year following
disposal of its lossmaking meat interests, with pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.71m for the 12 months to April 2, against losses of Pounds 1.99m.
The natural flavours company achieved sales of Pounds 29.2m, up 11.5 per
cent on last time's Pounds 25.6m from continuing operations.
The outcome took in losses of Pounds 117,000 on disposals; the previous
year's deficit was struck after Pounds 3.08m of losses on disposals and
reorganisation costs.
'This year saw Borthwicks for the first time focused on its future as an
international flavours business and we are pleased with the turnround to
profit. In operating terms this side of our business has always made money
and we will continue to build on its reputation,' Mr Peter Brackenridge,
chief executive, said yesterday.
Operating profits from continuing operations rose 12 per cent from Pounds
2.03m to Pounds 2.27m, but rose only 2.8 per cent if losses by F&amp;C Hong
Kong, a flavours and fragrance maker acquired in July, were taken into
account.
Sales in the UK market, which account for two thirds of turnover, remained
flat although exports showed an increase of 14 per cent.
Trading remained strong in the US where sales of Borthwicks Flavours USA
rose by 16 per cent in dollar terms and 28 per cent in sterling terms.
Earnings per share were 2.5p compared with losses of 3.8p. A recommended
final dividend of 0.8p lifts the total by 8 per cent to 1.3p.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo bid extended as controversy grows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil yesterday extended its hostile bid for rival explorer Lasmo
until June 17 amid increasing controversy over the target's allegations that
it had breached accounting standards.
Officials from the Takeover Panel are believed to have discussed the
accusations with Lasmo as part of their on-going examination of the bid.
Separately, Lasmo is believed to have written to both the Financial
Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, and the US Securities and
Exchange Commission, to complain about Enterprise's accounting policies.
It claims that Enterprise contravened SSAP 23, the standard on acquisitions
and mergers, in its treatment of the acquisition of the Beryl oil field
properties in 1988 and Texas Eastern in 1989.
Enterprise is offering 27 Enterprise A shares and 12 warrants for every 80
of Lasmo's. Any revised offer must be made by June 17.

FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail pays Pounds 6.8m for local radio
portfolio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Daily Mail and General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail, yesterday
increased its presence in commercial radio with the purchase of a portfolio
of radio investments previously owned by MAI, the broadcasting and financial
services group.
The purchase by Harmsworth Media, a subsidiary of Daily Mail and General
Trust, was for a total of Pounds 6.8m.
MAI had gained the stakes through its purchase of Anglia Television and did
not see itself as a player in the radio market.
As a result Harmsworth now holds 18.5 per cent of Chiltern Radio, 19.2 per
cent of East Anglian Radio and 13.3 per cent of Essex Radio.
The company already owned 19 per cent of GWR, the Bristol-based group; 4 per
cent of Classic FM, 39 per cent of Radio Trust; a collection of stakes under
10 per cent and 18 per cent of Swansea Sound.
At the moment Harmsworth, as the subsidiary of a national newspaper group,
is unable to own stakes of more than 20 per cent in commercial radio
stations.
The government is, however, in the middle of a reviewing cross-media
ownership rules and some degree of liberalisation is likely.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Seagram seeks seat on Time Warner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Seagram, the international drinks company, has indicated that it wants a
seat on Time Warner's board, but has no plans to raise its 14.9 per cent
stake in the US entertainment and publishing group.
The issue of Seagram's representation on the Time Warner board has
contributed to an awkward relationship between the two companies in the 16
months since Seagram began building up its stake. Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, who
took over as Seagram's chief executive from his father yesterday, said that
'we would prefer to be invited'.
Although Mr Bronfman speaks to Time Warner chairman Mr Gerald Levin once a
week and the two men have met regularly, Mr Bronfman said 'the request for a
board seat will not come from Seagram'.
Time Warner has so far indicated a reluctance to invite Seagram on to its
board, apparently fearing that the drinks company would use its position to
acquire control.
There had been rumours that Seagram was talking with Time Warner over a
possible standstill agreement that would allow Seagram to increase its stake
to more than 15 per cent without Time Warner invoking its 'poison pill'.
However, Mr Bronfman said 'there had been no discussions in that regard'.
Mr Edgar Bronfman Snr who remains chairman described the purchase of the
stake in Time Warner as a calculated decision. 'That was our decision and
remains our decision,' he said.
His son told the annual meeting that the main purpose of the Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) investment was to generate funds to expand Seagram's core
beverages businesses. He compared the Time Warner investment with Seagram's
forays into oil and gas and its existing 25 per cent stake in Du Pont, the
US chemicals group.
Mr Bronfman Jr, aged 39, predicted that the value of Seagram's stake in Time
Warner will rise 'dramatically' over the next five to 10 years. 'Patience
will be our reward with Time Warner as it was with Du Pont,' he said.
Seagram yesterday reported a 22 per cent rise in first quarter earnings to
Dollars 197m, or 53 cents a share, in the three months to April 30, from
Dollars 162m, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Operating income rose to
Dollars 162m from Dollars 148m. The figure excludes a one time accounting
charge of Dollars 75m, or 20 cents a share. Sales rose 3.5 per cent to
Dollars 1.2bn.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Floodgates open to admit a steady trickle: Foreign
investment in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When South Africa's soon-to-be president Mr Nelson Mandela issued his public
plea last autumn for foreign investment in his country, it created a frisson
within the global investment community. US institutional investors generally
and pension funds in particular, barred for more than a decade from
investing in South Africa, seemed poised to rise to the challenge.
So far, of the near 180 US cities, counties and states which had imposed
bans on pension fund investment in South Africa, all but 35 have acted to
lift them, according to the Washington-based Investor Responsibility
Research Center. Meanwhile, several leading US money managers, including
Morgan Stanley and Alliance Capital, have set up specialist funds for South
African investment.
Wilshire Associates, the California-based pension scheme consultants, will
lead a group of investment directors and money managers on a South African
tour later this month. And just last week, two leading UK firms, Smith New
Court and SG Warburg, announced ties with South African stockbroking firms
to help them sell specialist services to US investors.
But for all the cheerleading, it is not clear how much money US institutions
are prepared to invest. Mr Paul Moses, who monitors South African investment
for the IRRC, says those who count on a sudden inflow of funds are probably
mistaken. 'Institutions are thrilled that they are allowed to invest in
South Africa again. But they feel no moral obligation to do so.'
Most investors are likely to take the line of the Ford Foundation. Mr Clint
Stevenson, investment director, says that it will be up to the external
managers of its international portfolio to decide whether to invest. The
TIAA-CREF pension scheme, with more than Dollars 125bn (Pounds 83.3bn) in
assets, has similarly lifted its ban on South African investment but made no
formal commitment.
Investment bankers concede they may be gearing up for a boom that will never
come. Mr Steve Oke, head of South African research and sales at Smith New
Court, says that only when South African stocks and bonds look like a good
buy will cash migrate there. But investment experts point to two encouraging
imminent developments.
First, two leading world stock indices - by Morgan Stanley and the
International Finance Corp, the private sector arm of the World Bank - are
to include a South Africa country weighting. 'This means that passively
managed funds which track indices will have to invest in South Africa,' says
Mr Oke. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley said it would probably be included
in its emerging markets index, rather than its country index, 'because of
the political uncertainties'.
With a market capitalisation of roughly Dollars 200bn, South Africa is the
world's 10th largest stock market, according to Mr Ken Costa, managing
director at SG Warburg. It could account for 15-20 per cent of the emerging
markets index and, at that level, US fund managers would need to put up to
Dollars 6bn into the country to maintain a neutral weighting.
Second, a credit rating for the country's debt and a debut on the world
capital markets are likely this autumn. The government has retained Goldman
Sachs to assist in gaining a rating.
Investment bankers expect South Africa to win the minimum investment grade
rating of BBB. While the credit rating will mean more for fixed interest
investors, an investment grade would provide some comfort to equity
investors debating the political and economic risks.
However, years of economic isolation have led to structural shortcomings in
the South African stock market. 'You can't buy anything,' Mr Moses says. The
top handful of companies own large stakes in each other, leaving little
available for institutional investors. The cross-holdings were encouraged by
local rules forbidding investment outside the country.
Data from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange show that total turnover in 1992
was 4 per cent, rising to 7 per cent in 1993. Since the early part of 1994,
aided partly by 'unbundling' by some conglomerates, turnover has risen to
around 11 per cent.
Although there are 638 companies listed on the JSE, buying shares below the
30 largest will be problematic, Mr Oke says. 'It will be difficult for an
institution to get a line in any of the medium-sized stocks.'
Moreover, the pattern of cross-holdings raises questions about corporate
governance and management accountability to shareholders. Mr Moses points
out that while an institutional investor with a 5 per cent stake may have
considerable influence over a US corporate board, 'a 5 per cent stake in
Johannesburg is nothing because there is somebody else who has 30 per cent'.
The JSE has appointed a panel to examine corporate governance. Mr Michael
Katz, a partner at the Johannesburg law firm of Edward, Nathan and Freedlund
and chairman of the panel, suggests one remedy: the abolition of exchange
controls which force large domestic corporations to invest in each other. If
Mr Mandela's government lifts these, as expected, liquidity in shares should
improve. However, the government would have to be convinced that domestic
corporations would not respond by instantly sending their cash abroad.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Zurich Insurance joins the direct sales movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich Insurance, one of Europe's largest insurance companies, is to launch
a telephone-based direct sales operation next month in preparation for the
imminent deregulation of the European insurance market.
The new service, called Zuritel, will be launched in Switzerland and then
extended.
Mr Rolf Huppi, president and chief executive, expects competition to
increase as a result of liberalisation, especially in motor, home and life
insurance. 'The opening of the market will mean an enormous pressure on
business costs. This is one of the reasons why we are introducing low-cost
distribution systems.'
EU member states must implement the so-called framework directives by July
1. These will abolish the system of minimum prices, and insurers will no
longer need approval from local regulators for new policies or changes in
policy wording.
One of Zurich's German subsidiaries, Deutsche Allgemeine, already sells some
insurance direct to the public through 42 shops. But the market for personal
lines insurance in Germany, Switzerland and some other EU states is still
dominated by networks of agents selling exclusively for one company.
Mr Huppi believes this pattern is likely to change and predicts
telephone-based direct writers will win a market share of up to 50 per cent
of the private motor insurance market in some countries, citing recent
developments in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
Zuritel, to be based near Zurich airport, will reach its customers through a
combination of mass media advertising and telephone sales, as do direct
writers in the UK and elsewhere. Sales personnel will underwrite policies
with the help of sophisticated computer software.
Winterthur, another large Swiss company, has been one of the pioneers of
direct writing through its UK subsidiary Churchill. It has also recently
launched a direct writer in the Danish insurance market.
Zurich also announced the launch of a new life insurance policy, with
premiums invested in equities and property as well as bonds. The policy will
resemble the 'unit linked' variety popular in the UK.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Granada eyes Yorkshire TV: Pre-tax profits rise 51% to
Pounds 103m - Acquisitions weigh in with Pounds 27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada Group has identified Yorkshire-Tyne Tees as its next television
target if, as seems likely, the government decides on a further
liberalisation of the rules on television ownership.
Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of the broadcasting, leisure, rental and
business services group, yesterday identified Yorkshire as a possible
acquisition target. His comments accompanied the group's announcement of a
51 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 103m.
Such a move would create a greater northern television empire, plus London
Weekend Television - acquired for about Pounds 760m early this year.
The government is looking into the whole issue of cross-media ownership and
plans to report before the autumn.
Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada chairman, said yesterday that all the group's
principle businesses had recorded improved profits in the 26 weeks to April
2. Some Pounds 11.8m of the growth in profit before interest was organic,
while Pounds 27.1m came from acquisitions, mainly Sutcliffe Catering and
Spring Grove Services.
LWT, included for just one month, made a Pounds 4.7m contribution to pre-tax
profits. Mr Robinson said he had been 'rather confused' by City rumours that
the integration of LWT was going badly. 'In fact it is one of the easiest
integrations we have been involved with.'
Twenty people have already gone at LWT and the Granada chief executive said
there would be further announcements in five or six weeks. Some expect
around 100 jobs to go.
Turnover totalled Pounds 941.4m, compared with Pounds 640m in the same
period last year. Earnings per share rose from 9.8p to 13.8p and the interim
dividend goes up by 10 per cent to 3.33p.
Granada's share price rose 10p to close at 501p yesterday.
Sutcliffe's revenues grew 10 per cent during the period and margins improved
substantially, helped by improved purchasing clout.
Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at Smith New Court, yesterday increased his
full-year pre-tax profit forecast from Pounds 245m to Pounds 256m.
'We kept looking for the catch but we couldn't find it,' he said. Ms
Katherine Pelly, media analyst at Kleinwort Benson, raised her forecast to
Pounds 252m.
UK rental profits grew 5 per cent to Pounds 52.4m, computer services rose 10
per cent to Pounds 4.4m, television, including LWT, was up 64 per cent at
Pounds 34.8m and leisure grew 38 per cent to Pounds 11.7m.
Mr Robinson, who said he was now seeing clear evidence of regular sustained
growth, added that over the past 18 months the company had become better
balanced and had developed 'a group of highly cash generative companies
operating in strong, predictable markets'.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Kingfisher shares fall on AGM comment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the Kingfisher retailing group fell a further 21p to 522p
yesterday, after it said sales growth in the first quarter of this year had
been slower than in 1993.
Kingfisher's shares have fallen from 778p at the end of December, amid City
nervousness about Kingfisher's strategy under the chairmanship of Sir
Geoffrey Mulcahy.
Sir Geoffrey's comments to the annual meeting yesterday did little to allay
those fears. He said sales in two of Kingfisher's businesses had fallen,
although gross margins were generally improving and costs were being tightly
controlled.
'Overall sales have grown at a slower rate than in the same period last
year, though they have shown an improving trend,' he added. Kingfisher
stressed that sales growth had been strong in the first quarter of 1993,
before slowing later.
It said the higher gross margin did not reflect a retreat from the 'everyday
low pricing' strategy, but lower levels of markdowns, discounts and
shrinkage.
Sir Geoffrey, who enjoyed a 36 per cent rise in total pay excluding pension
contributions to Pounds 1.05m last year, said sales growth at Woolworths had
remained slow. After a depressed February, there had been some recovery to
show an increase of about 1 per cent for the quarter.
At B&amp;Q, the DIY business, sales to the end of April were 4.9 per cent ahead.
But analysts believe like-for-like sales, which exclude new stores, were
flat.
A brighter spot was Darty, the French electricals business, where sales grew
3.1 per cent. Sir Geoffrey said there were signs of economic improvement.
But sales at Comet, the UK electricals chain, fell 2.1 per cent. Analysts
believe that after a healthy contribution from new stores, like-for-like
sales fell even more heavily.
Superdrug, the discount drug store chain, saw a 0.7 per cent decline.
'The margin news was taken as some comfort,' said one analyst. 'But the
sales figures were pretty poor - especially considering sales figures for
the rest of the retail industry have not been too bad.'
Some of the higher City pre-tax profits forecasts for the current year were
downgraded, leaving the consensus at about Pounds 350m, against Pounds
309.3m.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Dutch PM warns Bonn and Paris on top EU job: Call for open
choice on successor to Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE HAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime minister and candidate for the presidency of
the European Commission, gave a warning yesterday against the dangers if
Germany and France should dictate the choice of a successor to Mr Jacques
Delors.
In the face of clear signals that Paris and Bonn favour Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
prime minister of Belgium, Mr Lubbers appealed to all other EU member states
to make up their own minds on who should win the top executive post in
Brussels.
Mr Lubbers, the longest-serving Dutch prime minister, praised Franco-German
co-operation but told the Financial Times he had no plans to drop out of the
race, in spite of the apparent Franco-German snub.
His determination to carry on may deadlock the European summit in Corfu on
June 24-25, when the EU heads of government are to choose unanimously a
successor to Mr Delors. But it might also open the way for a compromise
candidate to emerge, such as Britain's Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade
negotiator, or Ireland's Mr Peter Sutherland, the outgoing head of General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In the interview, Mr Lubbers paid tribute to the Franco-German axis for
giving direction to the European Union. But he also said that the political
balance of the EU depended on all member states feeling that their views
were being taken seriously.
Earlier this week, Mr Francois Mitterrand and Mr Helmut Kohl agreed at a
Franco-German summit on a joint candidate for the presidency of the
Commission. The two leaders did not disclose their preference, but senior
officials in both camps said they backed Mr Dehaene, who has yet to declare
publicly. 'Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand also have a
responsibility themselves in the balancing act,' Mr Lubbers said.
He said his candidacy had moved beyond the issue of personalities. It also
touched upon the place of the Netherlands in the Union and its status as a
founder member. Warning that Dutch enthusiasm for Europe was waning, Mr
Lubbers noted that there had been an outcry in the Dutch press this week
about reports of French and German opposition to his candidacy.
Mr Lubbers said Mr Dehaene had 'excellent qualities', but emphasised that Mr
Delors' successor should be chosen by consensus among the 12 EU member
states. 'The choice that has to be made now is not only a choice by Bonn and
Paris,' he said.
The Dutch prime minister, tipped for years as the next Commission president,
waited until after last month's general election campaign in the Netherlands
to launch his bid for the job.

FT  02 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Anglo American
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 55 per cent increase in net assets per share reported by Anglo American
Corporation is indeed striking. But it is also a reflection of the strength
of the Johannesburg stock market on which many of its investments are
quoted. That strength contributed to earnings as well, since high stock
market values allowed Anglo to raise more from sales of investments. The
R250m increase in the surplus on such sales offset setbacks in both coal and
platinum. One issue raised by Anglo's results is thus whether buying in
anticipation of the change in government pushed the stock market to levels
that now limit its attraction.
Having more than doubled in the final quarter of last year, Anglo's share
price needs more good news to propel it forward. The group may have
difficulty repeating last year's strong performance in diamonds, but there
is a chance of gold adding some further lustre. Though the dollar price of
gold has been slow to respond to the revival of inflationary fears in the
US, a weaker rand and careful cost containment have helped boost mining
margins. One risk is that high wage demands following the elections could
undermine these cost advantages. It would help if the international bullion
price were to show signs of stirring. Since they are subject to the vagaries
of the financial rand, foreign investors in particular may increasingly need
comfort on this score.

FT  02 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Wolseley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley's addiction to equity shows no sign of abating. Yesterday's placing
of shares to fund a US acquisition is its third in little over a year. The
company has raised around Pounds 220m - equivalent to more than a tenth of
its market capitalisation - in that time by selling shares to institutional
investors or the vendors of businesses it bought. Since Wolseley is one of
the most tightly-held stocks in the FT-SE 100 index, the market is hardly
awash with paper as a result. Even so, one might question whether Wolseley's
aversion to debt is really necessary.
With the proceeds of the latest placing tucked away, the company will have
around Pounds 80m net debt against shareholders' funds of Pounds 560m at the
last count. While borrowings could rise in line with working capital as
organic growth comes through, gearing of around 30-40 per cent would not
look irresponsible at this point in the business cycle. The stronger
argument is that equity is a perfect match for the kind of risks being
assumed through acquisitions. But it takes a leap of logic to conclude that
all acquisitions should be immediately funded by a matching issue of shares.
True, Wolseley's sequence of placings has saved it the bother and expense of
a rights issue. But shareholders not on the list of privileged institutions
have seen their stake in the business diluted over time. Given its
relatively small circle of institutional investors  - and exemplary record
of growth - there is no question of shareholder revolt. As Wolseley matures
and increases its international reach, though, old habits may have to
change.

FT  02 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK gilts market passed another milestone yesterday when the June future
slipped through par for the first time since January 1993. Those groping for
reasons may cite the steep growth in M0 money supply and evidence that the
economy is continuing to grow despite April's tax increases. Such factors
may indeed prompt the Bank of England to start wondering about when it
should tighten monetary policy again. But cash selling has been limited.
Gilts' weakness has been above all driven by speculative selling of the
futures. That in turn leaves markets looking prey to some pretty irrational
fears.
The short sterling contract, for example, suggests that base rates will be
as high as 6.5 per cent by December and that they will rise by a total of
two percentage points between September and June next year. That might just
happen with a sudden resurgence of inflation and a sharp fall in sterling.
The balance of probability is that it will not.
Cooler heads might prefer to consider yields of almost 9 per cent available
on 10-year conventional gilts and nearly 4 per cent in index-linked paper.
Gilts yield nearly two full percentage points more than their German
equivalent. That is a rare premium which compares with a differential of
only around 50 basis points when the market peaked. The water may still be
choppy but fundamental value is discernible on the shore.

FT  02 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada grows hungry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada's ambitions to expand its television and catering arms look sensible
enough. While it is still too soon to know whether the LWT acquisition will
enhance shareholder wealth, Granada was bullish yesterday at its interim
results on how things are progressing so far. There would be an opportunity
to apply the same rationalisation formula on another ITV company, with
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television the group's favoured target.
Similarly, there is presumably scope for rationalising Britain's fragmented
catering industry. Granada has already proved it can manage such businesses.
Margins at Sutcliffe, bought last year, are up 60 per cent. Chief executive
Mr Gerry Robinson retains an affection for the industry from his days at
Compass. And while there is nothing obvious on the market at the moment to
bid for, Gardner Merchant could become available in a couple of years.
Financing further acquisitions should not be a big problem. The group as a
whole, and the rental side in particular, are strongly cash-generative.
Though the LWT deal has temporarily pushed gearing above 100 per cent, the
more important measure of Granada's financial strength is its interest cover
of 6.6. As cash from the BSkyB refinancing flows in, group gearing and
interest cover will improve. If Granada is able to sell its BSkyB stake,
worth about Pounds 500m, the position would be stronger still.
The longer-term question is whether there is any point in keeping TV, rental
and catering operations in the same group. Mr Robinson shows no desire to
split them. But investors watching Thorn EMI inch its way towards a demerger
may have other ideas.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Belgian action on company head upsets France
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Brussels court yesterday ordered Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of
France's Groupe Schneider, to remain in prison following a decision to
confirm charges of fraud and swindling relating to two Belgian subsidiaries
of the electrical engineering group.
The continued detention of Mr Pineau-Valencienne is expected to exacerbate
strains between France and Belgium over the affair. French business leaders
were shocked by the detention of the Schneider chairman, a prominent
industrialist, while politicians have expressed concern about the case.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who has been detained in Brussels' Forest prison
since last Friday, faces up to a month of detention while the investigation
continues. He has 24 hours to appeal against yesterday's ruling. Mr
Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman who faces the same charges as the
Schneider chairman, has also been further detained.
Belgian prosecutors clarified their charges against Schneider yesterday.
They claim that offshore companies and assets worth about BFr4.8bn (Pounds
93m) had been concealed from regulators and shareholders in Cofibel and
Cofimines, the two Schneider subsidiaries at the centre of the
investigation.
The prosecutors also charge that dividends from offshore companies belonging
to the subsidiaries were not distributed to all shareholders. In all,
prosecutors alleged that Schneider had received about BFr3bn at the expense
of its Belgian subsidiaries.
Minority shareholders in the two subsidiaries had claimed that their
companies had been undervalued when Schneider launched its 1992 offer to buy
them out. Schneider reached agreement with minority shareholders earlier
this year, but previous legal complaints by the minority shareholders
triggered the investigation by Belgian judicial authorities.
Schneider said it deplored the decision to detain Mr Pineau-Valencienne,
adding that it was convinced the accusations are groundless. Schneider
shares, which were suspended yesterday pending the ruling, are due to resume
trading today.
It denies harming minority shareholders and claims that, although nominally
chairman of Cofibel and Cofimines, Mr Pineau-Valencienne played no part in
the management of the subsidiaries.
The case has prompted concern from French politicians. Mr Pierre
Mehaignerie, the French justice minister, described Mr Pineau-Valencienne's
detention as exceptional.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Financial reforms create a 'Wall Street' elite in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Financial reforms are creating a new elite in India, bringing Wall Street
investment banks, aggressive headhunting and salary packages that tower over
the earnings of the bank clerks of Bombay.
Salaries for the sought-after have risen 300 per cent in the past year and
could climb further as US and European investment banks rush to set up shop
in India's commercial capital to take advantage of the government's
liberalisation drive.
Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers of the US have recently hired senior
managers for salaries estimated at Dollars 400,000 (Pounds 266,500)
including bonuses.
At that rate, the pay is at least five times more than these bankers were
paid at their previous jobs at the old-established foreign banks in Bombay,
and at least 100 times more than the salary of a typical Indian bank clerk.
'The cost of hiring in India is hitting international levels,' Morgan
Stanley Asset Management said. Mr Rafiq Dossani, a director of Jardine
Fleming's Indian affiliate, added: 'The difference between India and the
rest of the world is narrowing sharply.'
The differences are also being reduced by the arrival of non-resident
Indians from the US, the UK and elsewhere. Companies are finding it
difficult to pay their locally-hired top executives less than the
non-residents who are also bringing with them a modern work culture.
Lap-top computers, digital diaries, and Mont Blanc pens have become
commonplace among the financial elite. The top earners are beginning to
imitate the lifestyles of the city's established business families. Taxes on
imported cars are still prohibitively high, but owning two or three Indian
models is well within the reach of bankers on better salaries.
Clothes are mostly bought abroad. Slick gelled-back hairstyles are the order
of the day. Membership of Bombay's top dining clubs - the Belvedere at the
Oberoi Hotel and the Chambers at the Taj Hotel - has become almost
mandatory. The talk is no longer of trips to hill stations but of weekends
in Singapore.
Women as well as men are getting top jobs, though not in the same numbers.
Ms Ratna Kakkar, who has recently joined Smith New Court, the British
stockbroker, says: 'Things are definitely more fast-paced and there's more
risk of burn-out.'
Salaries are being pushed up by foreign companies establishing offices or
increasing their staff.
The arrivals are hiring middle- and junior-level staff including research
analysts, corporate financiers and fund managers.
Median annual salaries for such people have reached Dollars 30,000-Dollars
40,000, a senior executive at one foreign broker said.

Eugene Rotberg, former treasurer of the World Bank, has a tall tale
concerning a banker, a corporate treasurer and a dog.
The banker and treasurer perambulate past a pet shop window and spy a dog
for sale. The banker buys it for Dollars 5, then sells it to the treasurer
for Dollars 10. A few days later, the banker wants it back, so he bids
Dollars 20. The dog keeps changing hands until the banker buys it for
Dollars 1m.
Then the dog escapes from the bank and is killed by a car. The treasurer is
furious: 'Couldn't you have been more careful?' he complains to the banker.
'Don't you realise how much money we were making on that dog?'

Six months after his 23-year rule over Volvo collapsed, we are still in the
dark about Pehr Gyllenhammar's precise role in the final days up to the
Volvo management and shareholder revolt against his plan to merge with
Renault.
But yesterday he decided to give a sneak preview, through a letter sent to
the chairman of the Swedish parliament's constitutional committee.
Before the fateful board meeting on December 2, according to the letter, PG
was uncertain if the merger would be torn up. Such was the 'drama'
surrounding the affair, he says, that his position as chairman was neither
'the only nor the best source of information' on the outcome. Instead he
refers - somewhat darkly - to 'powerful interests' who decided to dump the
project.
The constitutional committee has stirred controversy by suggesting that a
cabinet minister - Ulf Dinkelspiel, minister for European affairs, whose
company profited from trading in Volvo shares at the time - may have had
inside knowledge from briefings Gyllenhammar gave the government on the
affair that the merger was doomed.
So what did happen, PG?

Poor old Denis. Lady Thatcher's husband should have been in his element at
Tuesday night's bash at the Royal Academy, laid on by Guinness to celebrate
its sponsorship of the RA's Summer Exhibition. Sir Denis's old golfing chum,
Lord MacFarlane, chairman of Guinness's United Distillers, had asked him
along as guest of honour, to thank him for all his help over the years,
opening factories and suchlike.
But when it came to the highlight of the evening - the gift of a special
bottle of hooch to mark the 500th anniversary of Scotch whisky - up popped
the lady herself to accept the gift.
With her usual aplomb, Britain's ex-prime minister went on to argue that the
RA was a 'pure Thatcherite' organisation, because it was not supported by a
'penny piece of taxpayers' money'.
As for the exhibits, she opined that she shared Sir Winston Churchill's
view: modern artists should not be let loose until they had proved they
could paint a real picture.

For the acting editor who 'broke' - or is it brokered? - the story in The

Piers Morgan, 29, has been promoted to full editor. Patricia (ubiquitously
known as Patsy) Chapman, 45, who has been on sick leave since January, is

Now it seems increasingly likely that the unwell Manfred Worner, Nato's
59-year-old secretary general, will soon retire - he is not chairing a
meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Istanbul next week - the hounds are
already sniffing at the gate.
But although he has all the right credentials, one hopeful is facing
disappointment. Denmark's Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the Danish Liberal
party, has already had his card marked by none other than a fellow Dane,
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the Social Democratic party and head of the
present government.
Ellemann-Jensen is the one Danish politician who easily strides across the
international arena. Foreign minister between September 1982 and January
1993, he is revered in many east European countries for having stuck his
neck out in support of their anti-communist independence drives.
But at home Ellemann-Jensen's habit of sharp-tongued straight- talking has
earned him powerful enemies. Rasmussen has let it be known - via that
trusted method, the media - that his government will not support
Ellemann-Jensen, should he want the job.
Still, Ellemann-Jensen will only be available if he is still in opposition
after this autumn's general election to the Folketing. And no one is ready
to place bets on Rasmussen's being around by Christmas.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Case for global social security
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The richest fifth of the world's population generates - and enjoys - 85 per
cent of world output. The poorest fifth produces - and struggles to survive
on - just 1.4 per cent. This extraordinary maldistribution of global
prosperity seems difficult to justify. But it also means that a great deal
can be done for the poorest at relatively limited cost to the richest. To
the credit of its authors, at least parts of the agenda put forward in this
year's United Nations Human Development Report for next year's World Summit
for Social Development meet that test of practicality.
One of the peculiarities of 20th-century social security systems is that
what might seem a universal moral obligation upon the rich to help the poor
is turned into a narrower obligation to help fellow citizens. This treatment
of national income as a form of private property is politically inevitable.
Its moral justification is rather harder to detect.
It also has very practical consequences. At present, the industrial
countries allocate 15 per cent of their combined national incomes to
providing social security at home, while only 0.3 per cent goes on foreign
aid. The domestic social safety net helps those 100m fellow citizens who
receive average incomes of less than Dollars 5,000. But the poor in
developing countries number some 1.3bn, with average incomes of less than
Dollars 300 a year. Yet, incredibly, the impression persists, particularly
in the US, that foreign aid is a major diversion of resources from the more
deserving at home to the undeserving abroad.
Tricky choices
The challenge of securing what the report calls 'sustainable human
development' is therefore just as much to the supposedly caring left of the
political spectrum of the advanced countries, as to the allegedly unfeeling
right. Everyone would have to accept large changes to their normal way of
looking at things.
The report also shows that once wealthy countries, under the influence of
their powerful environmental lobbies, have raised the standard of global
sustainable development, it is they, yet again, who face the tricky moral
choices. 'The north has roughly one-fifth of the world's population . . .
and consumes 70 per cent of the world's energy, 75 per cent of its metals
and 85 per cent of its wood.' If global resources and carrying capacity are
indeed limited, as environmentalists insist, then the north's free access to
these globally scarce assets cannot be justified. Yet if, for example, the
environment were correctly priced and permits issued on the basis of
population, as well as gross domestic product, rich nations might have to
transfer 5 per cent of their combined national incomes to the poor.
Human development
When confronting people with choices this painful, it is wise to offer them
a way out. One of the report's escapes is a specific practical proposal,
justified under the label 'human security'. It argues inter alia for a
compact on human development, aimed at meeting the basic needs of everyone:
access to primary education and healthcare, clean drinking water and
sanitation; immunisation of all children; halving of maternal mortality;
access to family planning services for all who want them; halving of adult
illiteracy; and elimination of severe malnutrition. Among the benefits of
this programme could be a marked reduction in fertility.
This programme, it argues, would cost a mere Dollars 30bn-Dollars 40bn a
year, about a third of what developing countries spend on their military and
5 per cent of the global arms budget. This could be provided by devoting 20
per cent of total developing country budgets and 20 per cent of industrial
country aid to these objectives.
This compact is, of course, a long way from the report's more ambitious
ideas for a 'global human security fund', financed by global taxation. It
would not of itself halt the political and social disintegration that now
threatens the survival of such countries as Afghanistan, Angola, Haiti, Iraq
and Mozambique. But the merit of the report is that it does more than make
readers think large thoughts about the peculiar world in which we live. It
also presents such politically and organisationally practical ways of making
it somewhat less peculiar.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Sad jubilee of a white paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although most of the junkets which economic scribes are attending this
summer relate to the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods institutions  -
the IMF and World Bank - and the 300th anniversary of the Bank of England,
it is arguable that another anniversary is almost as important. I refer to
that, last week, of the 1944 white paper on unemployment policy by the UK's
wartime coalition government. This expressed the determination of British
leaders not to return to the horrors of interwar unemployment. In the UK, as
elsewhere, full employment was once an uncontroversial bipartisan objective,
actually achieved between the end of the war and the early 1970s.
A common feature of the platform of all the candidates for the Labour
leadership is their expressed determination to restore full employment.
This, of course, is easier said than done, as can be seen from the example
of France, which has been mostly under Socialist rule since the early 1980s,
but where unemployment is 2 1/2 percentage points higher than in the UK; or
Sweden, which maintained low unemployment for much longer than most
countries, but where the jobless rate has now soared to 8 1/2 per cent.
It is, indeed, now quite usual for historically minded economists of all
schools of thought to pay justified tribute to the wisdom and prescience of
the white paper, which warned - decades in advance - of the difficulties
that might occur. But at the time it was a compromise document. It trod a
middle way between the apostles of Keynesian demand management in the
economic section of the Cabinet Office and Treasury officials concerned to
balance the budget at least over a business cycle, worried that the UK was
at the mercy of world economic forces and anxious that the UK should pay its
way in a harshly competitive postwar world.
The white paper's famous first sentence began: 'The government accepts as
one of their primary aims and responsibilities the maintenance of a high and
stable level of employment after the war.' Keynes thought this more
important than the whole of the rest of the paper.
But did the government accept such a commitment? It accepted responsibility
for maintaining 'total demand for goods and services at a high level'. But
this was coupled with the now-famous warning that 'policies to maintain
demand will not work in securing high employment unless employers and
workers exercise moderation in wage matters so that increased expenditure at
the onset of a depression goes to increase employment rather than pay and
prices'. But the white paper had few suggestions for ensuring moderation
other than exhortations of the kind resorted to by postwar governments.
Even when it came to maintaining total spending, the white paper had a less
than total commitment. The authors were, for instance, obsessed with the
external component of demand, which was not under British control. It is
also easy to read back too much into the white paper. Its authors did not
discuss clearly the choice between maintaining nominal and maintaining real
demand. But read in context with the warnings about pay and prices, it is
natural to interpret it in terms of maintaining demand in money terms, that
is nominal demand. Demand management in real terms and 'funny money' control
of public expenditure intruded as the official forecasters and statisticians
began to cope with creeping postwar inflation.
The aim of controlling aggregate expenditure needs to be reinstated. There
is nothing in this aim which a common-sense monetarist should reject. After
all, why does he believe in monetary targets? It is because he asserts that
there is a stable relationship between the money supply, M, and total
spending measured by MV (money x velocity) - which implies that he values a
stable growth in the latter.
Unfortunately the recent move to define macroeconomic policy entirely in
terms of an inflation target is a step backwards. This is explained well by
James Meade in his new pamphlet, Full Employment without Inflation (Social
Market Foundation, Pounds 6). Suppose output were to drop in one year by 10
per cent, while inflation was just over 1 per cent. There would be no breach
of the government's stated objective of keeping inflation in the 1 to 4 per
cent band and no obligation to take countervailing action. Such action would
 -at least on present official doctrine - have to await evidence of actual
deflation. An objective for total expenditure would lead to earlier
offsetting action.
Maintaining adequate, but not excessive, monetary demand has two main
functions. One is, as the last example shows, to prevent a downward
spiralling slump; the other is to prevent a serious inflationary take-off by
putting a lid on growth of total spending. Thus one big switch in thinking,
compared to the white paper, is that demand management is today used to
contain inflation, in place of the jaw-boning or industry-union talks the
1944 document envisaged.
The term 'structural' - or, better, 'hard core' - can legitimately be used
for that part of unemployment which cannot be permanently reduced by
maintenance of demand. It is this element which has been rising from one
business cycle to the next, and which is especially bad in Europe. The
proximate explanation for this hard core is that pay and related costs make
workers unprofitable to employ.
With the clear failure of demand deficiency to account for the bulk of the
rise in European unemployment since the early 1970s, attention has naturally
turned to this aspect. If the price of any particular service is raised,
less will be bought - both because purchasers can afford less and because
they have an incentive to substitute something else.
The emphasis of economists such as Patrick Minford of Liverpool University
has been, however, not on monopoly labour pricing, as such, but on the level
of benefit when out of work. These economists make the benefit ratio - that
is, the ratio of benefits to average pay - the fulcrum of their whole
explanation. The benefit level is supposed to provide the floor or reserve
wage below which it does not pay to take a registered job.
The pricing-out-of-work and benefit-level explanations come together in the
assertion that, without the dole, pay rates would drop, as people would have
to price themselves into work to survive. I prefer the pricing-out
formulation because it leaves space for institutional, psychological and
even moral forces, which - quite apart from the dole  - stop pay from
shifting to market clearing levels.
If governments rightly hesitate to attack the benefit floor, the one weapon
with which they are left is sufficient flexibility in wages and other labour
costs to price people into work. This is not a policy in the direct
instrumental sense; but it involves taking every opportunity to break down
labour market barriers of which union pay-setting is only one example. It is
more or less consistent with the British government's approach to European
labour markets, as opposed to proponents of the Social Chapter.
Accepting the pricing-out-of-work explanation does not entail the advocacy
of starvation wages. If market clearing pay rates are regarded as
intolerably low, at least three courses are open. The first - the counsel of
despair - is to accept high unemployment as an alternative. The second -
counsel of perfection - is to try to raise the market value of workers'
services by the nostra of education and training so that customary pay rates
are no longer a threat to employment. The third is supplementary payments to
lowly paid families.
The real weakness of the pricing-out-of-work thesis, as often expounded, is
its timelessness - a weakness rarely spotted by the critics. Why should
there be so much more pricing-out-of-work in some periods than in others?
Or, to put it in macroeconomic terms, why should the rate of unemployment
consistent with non-accelerating inflation (the 'Nairu') have apparently
been so low in the 1950s and 1960s and then risen so much in the later 1970s
and in the 1980s?
There are at least two reasons why unemployment could have remained so low
in the early post-war decades. First there was the persistence of 'money
illusion' - the surviving prewar belief that a pound was a pound and a
dollar a dollar. Insufficient allowance was made for inflation in pay and
price behaviour; and so it was possible to run national economies with much
tighter labour markets than before or afterwards without triggering
accelerating inflation.
The second, and perhaps more interesting, reason is that postwar growth was
a fairly straightforward process involving other countries catching up with
best-practice, American techniques. Modest traditional pay relativities
between industries, and between skilled and unskilled workers, were
sufficient to balance the labour market.
The inflationary outbreak of the 1970s shattered remnants of money illusion
for generations to come. A slacker labour market was now needed to prevent
pay and prices chasing each other upwards. The relative demand for different
types of labour was still for a time stable enough for central European and
Scandinavian countries with strong traditions of social solidarity to hold
real wages in check at modest levels of unemployment.
Thus demand management - whatever label was attached to it - could be
switched to the struggle against inflation without large job losses. As the
1980s proceeded, however, the conditions required for these centralised
agreements to work began to disappear. Traditional relativities between
different industries and skills, or between areas of declining old-fashioned
manufacturing industry and high-technology growth areas (for example,
between north and south Germany), were no longer sufficient to clear labour
markets. Meanwhile the rigidities imposed to obtain union consent for
national economic policies became in some Continental countries an
increasing drag on performance.
The pressures that have come to the surface in Europe in unemployment and
non-employment have expressed themselves in the US in pay stagnation and
downward absolute movements among the lowest 20 or 30 per cent of wage
earners. No wonder Meade suggested that, to create 2m more jobs in Britain,
average real wages would not merely have to be 'restrained' but actually to
fall.
How, then, can the rest of us top up the wages of the lower paid so that
they can price themselves into work? The high marginal cut-off rates which
create the poverty trap stem from the speed at which benefits taper off as
incomes rise. If the system aims for the greatest generosity at lowest cost,
the withdrawal rate is likely to be extremely high. On the other hand, if
benefits are tapered off very gradually, poverty trap effects are reduced;
but either the cost is prohibitively expensive or the benefits are far too
low.
The best chance of advance is to act where the social security system
unnecessarily discourages workers from accepting low-paid jobs or employers
from offering them.
Any government could quite inexpensively take a first step and extend the
top-up for low income earners, known as family credit, to single people and
childless households. This move would cost it about Pounds 350m a year in
1994 - trivial by the standards of modern public finance.
It would also help if the withdrawal rate for income support for adults of
working age could be reduced below 100 per cent and brought in line with the
70 per cent taper used for other income-related benefits. Specifically, it
would encourage people to take spasmodic, casual or part-time jobs that did
not qualify them for family credit, and to do so on a legal basis.
Changes could also be made so that assessment for income-related benefit
resembled tax assessment rather than a medieval inquisition.
This discussion has moved from monetary policy via labour market details to
the arcane area of social security. The range indicates a little of the
ground a new employment white paper would have to cover. I would feel more
comfortable if we could replace all this with one big idea. But modest ideas
with a chance of being right are better than big ideas which are wrong.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Leading Article: A Europe of many layers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Purists might query whether Mr John Major is well-advised to discuss the
future of Europe in language reminiscent of that of a Formula One racing
commentator. Yet the UK prime minister's speech on Tuesday night, espousing
a 'multi-track, multi-speed' Europe, was in many ways a statement of the
obvious. The Maastricht treaty endorses the concept of European integration
proceeding at varying paces. By gaining exemptions from the Maastricht
arrangements over social policy and monetary union, the UK has already
enshrined the principle in European law.
Since the 1992-93 collapse of the narrow-margin ERM, patterns of EU monetary
co-operation, for instance, have become still more heterogeneous. Over home
affairs, as well as defence and foreign policy, different EU groupings are
carrying out inter-governmental co-operation in different ways. As the EU
grows, perhaps to 16 countries next year and more than 20 by early next
century, the tendency towards greater diversity is likely to strengthen.
At a time of rampant electioneering, it was perhaps not surprising that Mr
Major's self-evident remarks should have been seized on as a novel statement
of government policy. Almost inevitably the prime minister's remarks
attracted catcalls from the opposition that he is irredeemably abandoning
the UK to the 'slow lane' of Europe.
Mr Major's problems are partly of his own making, but they also reveal how
Britain is ensnared by contradictory fears about the development of Europe.
The chief difficulty with the prime minister's rhetoric is that he is trying
to send different messages to separate audiences. As a result, both messages
and audiences become confused.
Overt move
Talk about opting out of layers of European integration may assuage
Eurosceptics' concern that Britain's interests could be undermined by
policies foisted on it from the Continent. Yet such comments disconcert
those who are worried that an overt move towards political and monetary
union by a group of countries led by France and Germany could cause Britain
serious economic damage. Equally, Mr Major's trumpeting of a 'multi-speed'
Europe conflicts with his insistence during the last three years that
Britain maintains a well-regarded place at the topmost tables of European
decision-making. Even in the contorted world of Europolitics, theories of
black hole physics do not apply. Mr Major cannot both be 'at the heart of
Europe' and simultaneously walk away from it.
Independent policies
At a broader level, Mr Major's statements over Europe mirror ambivalence in
many EU capitals over the continent's future. By underscoring the advantages
of Britain's retention of more independent social and monetary policies, Mr
Major wants to lend weight to those in other EU countries who doubt the
wisdom of a federal Europe.
These doubts certainly exist, and they have grown since 1991. As
demonstrated by the opinion poll in yesterday's Financial Times carried out
across the 12 EU members, the German electorate, in particular, has become
increasingly opposed to closer integration as laid down by Maastricht.
Recent French government proposals for intensified co-operation by a
Franco-German 'core' appear, at least in part, to reflect worries in Paris
about a slippage in Germany's Maastricht commitment, above all over monetary
union. Some of these German doubts are, it seems clear, also felt at the
highest level in Paris. It is worth recalling that, before he became prime
minister, Mr Edouard Balladur publicly voiced scepticism about attempts to
'bind' Germany to western Europe through devices such as Maastricht.
In view of the elections in Germany and France over the next 12 months, the
clouds which hang over the direction of European policies are unlikely to
lift until the EU is much closer to the Maastricht review conference in
1996. In the meantime, the EU will be well served if a consensus gains
ground that, in many spheres, the degree of integration should be closely
tailored to individual members' political preferences and economic
capacities. Whatever his motives, Mr Major has made a sound point.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not just great - but 'The Master'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor J R POLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your correspondent Laura Thompson needs to do some serious reading. She
says ('Brian Lara - the dream machine', May 30) that Jack Hobbs was 'another
great cricketer, but not in the racehorse class' - meaning (apparently) not
in the highest class. Hobbs, the first cricketer to be knighted, was
certainly the only cricketer to share with Henry James the accolade of 'The
Master'.
I would submit that he was the greatest batsman, and probably the best cover
point, between the age of W G Grace and that of Don Bradman - a very long
innings, which took in the profound alteration in the way the game was
played after the first world war.
Hobbs mastered the mystery of the googly, which I believe Grace considered
an 'unfair' delivery. He scored 197 first-class centuries, incredibly
hitting 100 of them when more than 40 years of age, which Bradman could not
have done. He and Herbert Sutcliffe once batted all day on a sticky
Melbourne wicket, a project in which Bradman would not even have been
interested.
Hobbs was not only the greatest but also the best-loved player of his era.
If he did not often amass the very high scores which became more common in
the Bradman era, it was at least partly because he tended, soon after
getting his 100, to present his wicket to the bowler he had flogged the most
(or so I've heard).
He was supremely elegant and someone (Cardus? Swanton?) once remarked that
he never played an ungrammatical stroke.
Incidentally, Brian Lara has not come out of the blue. Everyone in Kingston,
Jamaica, was talking about him when the Australians were last there. They
were impatient for Greenidge to retire - to which Greenidge replied by
hitting 215 or so in the fifth test.

FT  02 JUN 94 / The FT Interview: Spoiler in the Euro contest - Ruud
Lubbers, Dutch prome minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ruud Lubbers ought to be feeling very sore. This week, the Dutch prime
minister saw his bid to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the
European Commission blocked by a Franco-German steamroller in favour of Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of neighbouring Belgium. Once the
favourite, Mr Lubbers finds himself scrambling to salvage his candidacy.
The Franco-German preference for Mr Dehaene is a clear snub; but Mr Lubbers
appeared unruffled yesterday morning as he sipped black coffee in his office
in the centre of the Hague. 'The choice that has to be made now is not only
a choice to be made by Bonn and Paris, . . . it is, of course, up to all
other countries (of the European Union).'
His appeal to a broader constituency remains his strongest card; but it
poses an explicit challenge to the Franco-German axis which has set the
direction of the Union for the past 30 years. Unless he or Mr Dehaene
withdraws, there could be an unseemly row at the European summit in Corfu on
June 24-25, when EU leaders are set to decide in secret on the successor to
Mr Delors.
For Mr Lubbers, this is a painful prospect. A consensus-seeker schooled in
the art of coalition-building in Dutch politics, he has spent 12 years
brokering compromises inside the EU with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
French President Francois Mitterrand - on issues ranging from the
mind-numbing detail of the EU budget to German unification and the
Maastricht treaty, which he pulled off at the end of the 1991 Dutch
presidency.
Yet the Lubbers candidacy now transcends personalities. It is about the
place of the Netherlands inside the Union, and the dilemma of smaller states
struggling to preserve their influence ahead of the prospective entry of
four new members from Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway.
The Dutch dilemma is poignant because the Netherlands has never won its fair
share of Euro-spoils, despite being an EU founder member. Unlike Belgium or
Luxembourg, it has failed to secure Euro-institutions such as the European
Parliament, the European Commission or the European Court of Justice, which
are money-spinners for the local economy. Only last year, the Dutch bid to
put the European Monetary Institute in Amsterdam was dashed by Mr Kohl's
insistence on locating the forerunner of the European central bank in
Frankfurt.
The Lubbers candidacy was supposed to redress the balance. Here was a
prestigious post which Mr Delors has changed beyond recognition since he
first arrived in Brussels almost 10 years ago. Thanks to Mr Delors, the
president of the Commission is not just a top-flight bureaucrat, he is the
public face of the Union. With his Christian Democrat background, and
12-year membership of the club of EU leaders, Mr Lubbers looked like a
shoe-in. So what went wrong?
Mr Lubbers concedes he may have alienated the French and the Germans earlier
this year by refusing to commit himself to entering the race. He was worried
about distracting public attention from last month's Dutch general election
at a time when Mr Elco Brinkman, his hand-picked successor, was struggling
to take over his mantle. He had also pledged to Queen Beatrix to serve out
his term as prime minister, which precluded a public campaign for the
Brussels post of the kind waged by Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade
negotiator. Sir Leon and Mr Peter Sutherland, former head of Gatt, are
long-shot contenders.
In retrospect, Mr Lubbers's reticence looks like miscalculation. The French
seized on Mr Dehaene, a French-speaker on the left of the Christian Democrat
party, who had impressed during last year's Belgian presidency of the EU. Mr
Kohl, who favoured initially Mr Wilfried Martens, a former Belgian premier,
fell into line.
Mr Martens did not command the support of his own government, so 'Kohl
feared that he was empty-handed', said Mr Lubbers, adding mischievously that
the rotund Mr Dehaene had the goesting (appetite) for the top job.
That may not be the whole story. Mr Lubbers and Mr Kohl have never been
close. Nor did the German chancellor appreciate the Dutchman's call for
clarity about the German-Polish border during German unification,
challenging Mr Kohl's preference for leaving the question open in order to
placate the German right ahead of the 1990 general election. So is he too
independent-minded for Mr Kohl? The Dutch prime minister paused: 'Perhaps.'
There is no question that Mr Lubbers has his own views on the future of
Europe. He is keen on a common European defence evolving under the umbrella
of the Nato alliance, and is frustrated with the UK government for dragging
its feet. He also supports European monetary union, mainly because the Dutch
are certain to be in the vanguard along with the Germans.
Yet he is sympathetic to British warnings about the risks of integration
moving too far ahead of European public opinion. Even in his own country, he
feels that enthusiasm for Europe is diminishing. Hence the need for Europe's
leaders to restore a sense of mission. He offered three slogans:
Efficiency. Mr Lubbers, who comes from a line of Rotterdam industrialists,
wants tighter controls on the Ecu70bn annual EU budget and a bigger role for
the Court of Auditors, the spending watchdog. 'People must have the feeling
that resources are well spent.'
Democracy. He wants more transparency in decision-making. He favours a
bigger role for the European Parliament in shaping legislation, more public
debates with the Commission, and more involvement by national parliaments in
areas of inter-governmental co-operation under the second and third pillars
of the Maastricht treaty, such as foreign policy, security and justice
matters.
Credibility. He is worried about the EU stretching its ambitions. He
cautions against a 'Big Bang' conference to review Maastricht in 1996 which
could introduce more qualified majority voting in an expanded Union. He
welcomes the 'inevitable' EU membership of the central European countries
such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic; but he warns against
arousing unrealistic expectations about the timing of entry.
Yet Mr Lubbers wants the EU to work. Without criticising the call this week
by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, for a multi-speed Europe, he said the
principle of opting out should apply only to the second and third pillars.
On Emu, he conceded that some countries might move faster than others, 'but
there must be a limited time difference. We should not accept too easily all
sorts of exceptions and differences in speeds.'
On the other hand, Mr Lubbers has little sympathy for French calls for a
club of 'founder members' led by France, Germany, the Benelux and Italy - an
idea floated again this week by Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's minister for
European affairs.
'I find this fascinating. Why? Because he suggests that the old Six should
give a new example of what to do. But he (Lamassoure) writes the article on
the very same day as two of them, France and Germany, come out of the
preparations for the next (European) Council not as Six but as Two. Italy
and the Netherlands are included in his architecture, but are excluded from
consensus-seeking.'
There is a firmness in tone which suggests that Mr Lubbers is loath to let a
Franco-German diktat push him out of the race. So is he ready to take his
candidacy 'down to the wire' at Corfu? 'Yes,' came the unequivocal response.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Focal point for energy efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord MOORE and others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As independent directors, we should like to correct two of the points
made in your editorial, 'The cost of saving energy' (May 25), on the
objectives and organisation of the Energy Saving Trust.
You state that the trust is intended to subsidise household improvements
such as low-energy light bulbs, efficient boilers and loft and wall
insulation. While the trust does plan schemes that involve these measures,
our objective is to nurture and stimulate embryonic markets to
sustainability so that resultant products and services can replace their
more inefficient counterparts. The success of our gas condensing boiler
scheme illustrates this principle, with nearly 10,000 applications for a
Pounds 200 rebate on the cost of installing this type of boiler received
during the scheme's one year pilot. Resulting competition and volume
production have already led to a 10 per cent reduction in the average price
of such boilers, with several new producers and suppliers entering the
market. As with all of our schemes, the level of rebate provided will be
reduced progressively as the price differential decreases over time.
You also comment that 'the trust lacks the administration to disburse Pounds
300m a year in parcels of several hundred pounds, let alone to identify
which households should benefit'. As we explain in our strategic plan, the
trust does not intend directly to manage any schemes itself. Instead, it
will determine the most effective method of delivering each scheme and then
select the appropriate delivery mechanism. Some will operate at a national
level, others will be implemented regionally within a national framework,
while some will be best run independently and locally. Project
implementation will be carried out by the most appropriate external body,
either through a contractual agreement with the trust or under the trust's
monitoring and evaluation procedures.
The trust wishes to be a focal point for energy efficiency work in the UK
but has no wish to duplicate expertise already developed over many years.
Instead, our intention is to remain a small organisation, dedicated to
catalysing new ideas into practical schemes.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: A limit to options excess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We would support David Rhoads's warnings (Letters, May 27) of
legislative action, based on US experience, if aspects of executive pay are
seen to be excessive. The pensions 'cap' is a recent UK example and some
elements of option awards must be in the sights of future ministers and
their advisers.
The accusations of excess lie not in exercising options but immediately
selling the entire holding, and it is this aspect of scheme design that is
principally exercising remuneration committees and investors.
If on exercise of an option worth more than 30 per cent of current salary an
executive could only sell enough shares to allow him/her to reinvest in
purchasing the remainder of the option entitlement for a further period of,
say, three years, the danger of the 'inspired' sales of option shares would
be reduced.
The trouble with 1984 executive option legislation was its uneasy balance
between the concepts of long-term performance awards and shareholding
democracy as many more holders have used options as a one-way bet on a
bundle of cash rather than becoming real shareholders.
Option rights restricted to the reinvestment of cash in some retained shares
would restore the concept of shareholding executives without any knock-on
effect on revenue or other related legislation.

LEAN AND MEAN: The Changing Landscape of Corporate Power in the Age of
Flexibility
By Bennett Harrison
Basic Books, New York, Dollars 25
For the past 15 years, conventional wisdom has been that small is both
bountiful and beautiful in business. With large companies - from IBM to
Kodak, General Motors to Westinghouse - finding it ever harder to adjust to
an era of radical change, their days are numbered, the argument runs.
Instead, small companies have become the prime driver of job creation,
technological innovation and economic growth. For every Microsoft, Benetton
or Body Shop, surging from small to large with remarkable speed, there are
thousands of agile minnows which will never grow so big, but which are the
economy's powerhouse.
Nonsense, says Bennett Harrison, a Pittsburgh professor of political economy
who, as the author of recent books on American 'deindustrialisation' and
'working poverty', is no stranger to controversy.
Instead, he argues that the prime motor of economic growth is becoming
flexible, worldwide 'networks of production'. These are dominated by large
companies but contain dependent minnows with a 'dark side': unskilled,
low-paid and unprotected workforces.
Even in vibrant local regions and districts such as those in northern Italy
and Silicon Valley, the idealised picture of clusters of interdependent,
innovative small companies sparking each other's growth is incorrect, says
Harrison. Such districts are coming increasingly under the influence of
large companies, from Benetton to Japan's Fujitsu. He complains that their
global networks are wreaking havoc with traditional government policies for
regulating big business.
To back his case against what he calls 'the myth of small firms', Harrison
has certainly done his homework: a fifth of his 300-page book consists of
references to research by others in economics, social science, technology
and business strategy. He has, it seems, examined almost every side of every
argument about the subject. Almost, but not quite.
His evidence on the overstated role of small companies is important, but
less forceful than it looks at first sight. This is partly because his
definition of 'small' is inconsistent: sometimes he confines it to
organisations of less than 20 employees, sometimes of under 100 and
occasionally higher still. Most of the research studies he collates and
compares have also already been published, notably the work of a team which
includes Professor James Medoff, an influential Harvard economist.
In simple terms - though the statistics are far from simple, hence the
continuing controversy - Harrison argues that there has been no upward trend
whatever over the past quarter century in small companies' share of
employment in Japan and western Germany, the world's two most successful
large economies. In the US, a modestly growing relative share of smaller
units of production is discernible - not all of them owned by smaller
companies, however - but only for manufacturing; in services, the average
size of unit has grown.
Only in the UK, Harrison argues, is there uniform and unambiguous evidence
that small is becoming increasingly bountiful, both for individual plants
and for whole companies. But, as he says, that may be more a function of the
failure of large manufacturers than a gauge of the real vibrancy of small
enterprises.
Against the belief that small companies are more innovative than large ones,
Harrison cites studies which suggest that this is definitely not true of
process innovation (in production, information technology and so on) and is
questionable in product innovation.
Harrison's corrective to the 'small is beautiful' doctrine is especially
timely in American political terms. Debate about the justification for a new
industrial policy, and the shape it should take, has been under way ever
since President Bill Clinton took office.
But that debate has encouraged Harrison to take a polarised position on
several counts. First, most of the book is about manufacturing; there is too
little discussion of the implications of the rapid recent American (and
British) shift to services. Nor does he examine properly whether the
accelerated pace of information technology and large company subcontracting
favours only big service providers, or also specialised enterprises on a
smaller scale.
Second, in his haste to refocus attention from small companies on to large
ones, he falls into the common trap of almost ignoring those in the middle.
The real story of Italian and especially German industrial success has not
been very small companies, but specialised medium-sized ones. In a world of
global networks, small may not be as powerful as was once thought, but
medium size may remain so in certain products and services.
Third, in spite of his evident and interesting expert knowledge of the real
workings of Italy's (government-supported) 'industrial districts', some of
his other perceptions about Europe are superficial. To cite the recent spate
of cross-border takeovers and alliances as a sign of future strength in
European big business is to ignore not just the weakness of some of those
large companies, but also the evidence that most such takeovers fail.
On the other hand, Harrison provides plenty of meat for business people and
politicians to chew on in the juxtaposition of his two main themes: the
changing shape of concentrated corporate power, from centralised to
dispersed; and the political, economic and social dilemmas which this
creates for both national and state governments.
Oddly, in spite of all his concern about the socially 'dark side' of global
network production, he offers few specific policy recommendations, other
than better enforcement of existing labour laws, and the provision of
greater technical assistance to small and medium-sized companies.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: India's policy right for monetary
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S K RAO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Wolf's report on India ('India resists IMF pressure over
currency', May 26) illustrates the type of dilemma which liberalising
economies face in the management of exchange rate policy.
India's exchange reserves accumulated to present levels mainly on account of
portfolio flows, which can easily flow out again should the foreign
investors reassess the relative attraction of India as a market. Adjusting
exchange rates to the size of reserves could thus run the risk of
introducing a degree of exchange rate volatility which could undermine
investor confidence. Surely, what the government of India is doing is right:
to try to sterilise foreign exchange reserves to ensure that monetary growth
is stable.
India's fiscal deficit had been high partly because of reduced revenues from
customs duties which was in turn due to reduced tariffs combined with low
level of imports and investment. The trick is to find ways of promoting
investment. Under the present conditions, by throwing open infrastructure
projects (communications, power, etc) to private sector investment in a much
more vigorous fashion, it might be possible to induce a revival of private
sector investment, including foreign. Investment in infrastructure is
import-intensive and the present reserves should provide the cushion needed
for it.
Improving incentives for investment, rather than adjusting exchange rates,
will be the key for improving growth, fiscal balance and reserve management.

According to today's edition of The Business, bullying is not limited to
school playgrounds but is commonplace in industry and commerce. One 'stress
expert' says that if enough employees are bullied it can put a company out
of business. It seems that one senior manager at Ford was so demoralised by
his new bosses that he left, brought a case of constructive dismissal, and
won a large settlement (7.30 BBC2). This week's episode in Jack Rosenthal's
drama about removal men, Moving Story, lasts 60 minutes which must surely
mean an improvement on last week's 90-minute episode. As we have come to
expect from Rosenthal, the quality is largely in the characters and the
opening story was over-stretched (9.00 ITV). The outrage from some medical
people at the portrait of hospital life in Cardiac Arrest must stem either
from blindness or from the same rage that affected Caliban upon looking in
the mirror. In the last episode of the opening series (9.35 BBC1) life and
death decisions are being taken on the hoof, as ever, and some of the staff
are behaving badly.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Arts: Turkey feathers to tickle our fantasies - Cinema

<TEXT>
THE SECRET RAPTURE (15)Howard Davies
NO ESCAPE (15) Martin Campbell
DANGEROUS GAME (18)Abel Ferrara
INTERSECTION (15) Mark Rydell
There is a funny joke in The Secret Rapture about the difference between
erotic and perverted sex. In the first, gurgles raconteur Joanne
Whalley-Kilmer to a trio of tired business colleagues in a bar, you use a
feather. In the second you use the whole chicken. Hilarity all around. Then
seconds later Miss W-K is lunging across the table with a steak knife,
trying to stab First Businessman.
It is that kind of film. Gestures and apocalypses come from nowhere. David
Hare's stage play was an odd, feathery thing. Addressing matters such as
grace, faith and the quality of life, it made attractive tickling motions in
the direction of our consciences. The film, by contrast, is a turkey, a
whole turkey and a plucked turkey. And since this turkeyisation process has
happened to Hare before - when Plenty moved from play to film, and when
Paris By Night and Strapless trailed clouds of staginess on to the screen -
we should ask: What is going wrong?
The Secret Rapture has one of those plots, full of designer metaphor, that
one accepts while sitting in the hothouse of a theatre. An old bookseller
has died, leaving his two daughters to cope with the dear old farmhouse and
the deadly young widow: Catherine (Miss W-K), a sort of Hell's Angel on
heels; younger daughter Isobel (Juliet Stevenson), good and kind, runs a
small graphic design shop; older daughter Marion (Penelope Wilton), more
venal, is first caught trying to reclaim a ring from dead Dad's bedside.
But there is one thing that plays can get away with and films cannot.
Circumstantial vagueness. We do not expect the stage to rotate 45 degrees
towards us, exposing the designs on top of Isobel's work-tables. But in a
movie we ask, 'What are these people designing?', apart from the single
lurid bookjacket being worked over by Isobel's partner-boyfriend (Neil
Pearson).
So when well-heeled Marion buys into the firm and tries to expand it with
harpy Catherine's help, we are meant to cry 'Tsk] Tsk] Do not sell out,
Isobel'; but instead we feel, 'What a good idea.' Perhaps the firm will now
take on a graspable identity.
More vagueness: Penelope Wilton's Marion, who clarion-announced herself as a
Tory minister in the play, here seems vocationally less specific. And her
husband, a lay preacher on stage full of chortlesome pieties, is played by
Alan Howard in the movie as an odd, mute bird with a crick in his neck and
few lines of dialogue.
Director Howard Davies pushes bits of style at Hare's screenplay as if
hoping that they will peck it into life. A moment of emotion produces a
tilted angle. A love scene stripes two bodies with Venetian-blind shadows.
But when a bird is dead, as Monty Python proved, no amount of shock
treatment can help. Plucked of its wit and thrust into the 'real' world, the
moral schematic of Hare's play seems trite and sanctimonious. Hold on to
that cottage industry. Hug that parental farmhouse (shades, nay swathes, of
Howards End). And cherish the mentally distressed, who might be
well-intentioned (Catherine), while shunning the mercantile (Marion), who
cannot ever be.
Nothing is more dopily conservative than some writers with left-wing
sympathies. People often ask why British films cannot get their act
together.
The reason is that modern British cinema, like so much modern British life,
is one long apology pro sua vita. 'We have never had it so bad.' And
(corollary) 'we shall never have it so good again', unless, quoth Hare, we
put a moratorium on all that might expand people's lives, ambitions and
imaginations and thereby threaten tight little, green little England.
Now a much-needed change of scene. 'The nearest aspirin is 2,000 miles
away,' says the doctor (Ian McNiece) on the subtropical island in No Escape.
We have all known holiday spots like this, but 'Absolom' is an atoll of a
different aspect. Even though the jokey convicts' leader (Stuart Wilson)
says 'Welcome to vacation paradise' to the newly arrived hero (Ray Liotta) -
and Liotta, picking up the mood, replies 'Hope you take plastic' - this is a
futuristic penal colony (year 2022) where torture, riot and sudden death are
rife.
Can Liotta, sent here after threatening a previous warden with an electric
cattle-prod, escape - or at least find a more pleasant part of the island?
He does the latter, falling down a mile-high cliff into a river from which
the Good Convicts, led by white-haired father figure Lance Henriksen, rescue
him. But will Wilson pursue and avenge?
The film is a re-tread of Papillon with camp dialogue, wild scenery and
costumes that look as if they were designed by Mad Max's aunt. Present is a
platoon of British actors, led by Wilson and McNiece, playing the nasties
and causing us to ask: What is it with Hollywood and the British? Can
America not get one of its own kind to curl a lip, quiver a nostril and
deliver a well-egged epigram? Perhaps not. Wilson's jokes steal the movie.
Abel Ferrara's Dangerous Game used to be called Snake Eyes. But like last
week's Hostile Hostages (US title The Ref) it has been re-baptised for
Britain by the banal minds who do these things. No title, though, could do
justice to this transportingly batty film about film-making from the
writer-director of Driller Killer and Bad Lieutenant. An earnest Madonna and
a more earnest James Russo act out a tale of marital hell before the cameras
of fictive filmer Harvey Keitel.
Whose are the snake eyes? Perhaps Madonna's; but it is mostly too dark to
tell on this soundstage within a soundstage. Or maybe they are Keitel's, who
has long, writhing Medusa locks to match. The film replays the contest
between vice and virtue that we saw in Lieutenant: only with Madonna as the
wife who is getting religion and Russo as the man burning out on sex and
drugs.
No one seems more obsessional, though, than the man behind the camera,
OD-ing on celluloid and Stanislavski-babble. Like any genius director Keitel
wants more. 'Smell her, Frank, smell her'; 'Dig down into hell, Frank';
'Piss on the floor'. The audience, on the other hand, wants less. But it has
an eerie feeling that this is what life is like on a Ferrara set, and we
might as well have the ugly truth while it is offered.
Intersection also comes from the world's psychodrama storage-room. Richard
Gere takes the Michel Piccoli role in this Hollywood defrosting of the 1970
French film Les Choses De La Vie. Mark Rydell (The Rose) replaces Claude
Sautet in the director's chair, blowing warm air all over the tale of a man
whose life is torn between two women and whose mind replays that life, in
flashbacks, just as his car is about to be torn between two trucks.
Gere's past career as a Vancouver-based architect flashes before him. His
affair with redheaded Lolita Davidovich flashes before him. And the blonde,
curvaceous Sharon Stone flashes before him - but this is not Basic Instinct.
Stone, playing Mrs Gere, gets to expose nothing lower than a quivering chin
and a pair of Joan Crawford cheekbones. The film is minor but enjoyable.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Arts: Acclaimed King Lear cuts the deepest - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trailing a wake of acclaim from last year at Stratford-upon-Avon, Adrian
Noble's Royal Shakespeare Company production has reached London, still with
Robert Stephens as the King.
The acclaim was deserved. If a 'complete' representation of King Lear is a
will-o'-the-wisp ideal, this one cuts deeper than most, and more
consistently. No other that I have seen has laid the chill metaphysical
bleakness of the play so bare, nor made so strong a case for recognising
that as its central theme.
What do you want from a King Lear? If it is tender, heart-rending moments,
Noble is brusque with those. On his view of the play, they would be
sentimental cheats. Instead, all the lusty intrigues are set in a coolly
distant (but beady-eyed) focus. The human twitchings and cavortings serve
only to confirm Lear's ultimate discovery: that scarcely anything in this
indifferent world matters much, nor suggests anything else for our
consolation.
As a mere poetical message, that might ring dully; but Noble sees to it that
all the dramatic action is superbly clear and vivid ' Lear has a complicated
story ' and leads inexorably towards the cruel final vision. Anthony Ward's
designs reduce the earthy details to bare symbols, but his churning
astronomical backdrops stress the inhuman grandeur of a 'real', space-eye
setting. The experience is worth it, despite some calculated losses along
the way.
Nothing becomes Stephens' Lear like going mad. From there he expands into
profound, shattered insights ' hugely indulged by the production, and quite
rightly. Earlier he has to play his King to daughterly stereotypes: Abigail
McKern's Cordelia (dressed as a goody-two-shoes with pigtail and chaste
tunic), Jenny Quayle's Regan (a sexy, overly bright-eyed hostess) and Janet
Dale's anxious little Goneril, who looks like something between Goldie Hawn
and the ex-Islington leader Margaret Hodge.
At the start, their daughterly effusions ' pretty set-speeches, every one
(even Cordelia's) ' are urged on by sympathetic chuckles from Lear's
courtiers. It is shocking and irrational, then, that the King should reject
Cordelia's plainer homage so violently, without warning; but such things do
happen, and the play goes on to record much nastier twists among its
personnel. Little by little the sharpest vicissitudes fade into temperate
blurs, because the overwhelming pointlessness of life swallows them up
without naming favourites.
Along the way the RSC players supply vital flashes: David Bradley's Douglas
Hurd-like Gloucester (prissy, decent and politic), David Calder's staunch
old Kent, Ian Hughes' archly androgynous Fool, Mark Lockyer's repellently
oily Oswald. Simon Russell Beale's saintly Edgar is perhaps elevated a touch
too far. John Normington keeps his Albany down to a level of intense
decency, and Owen Teale plays the bastard brother Edmund with expansive
relish, while Simon Dormandy taps an authentic, even psychopathic vein for
his horrifying Cornwall. One way and another, the icy, colossal scale of the
play makes itself felt as I have never met it before.
Barbican Theatre, in repertory until August 30.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Arts: Playing Away fails to score - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remember Damn Yankees? An American musical of the 1950s that enjoyed a Drury
Lane run, it retold the Faust legend against the background of professional
football.
Howard Brenton's libretto for Benedict Mason's opera Playing Away combines
the Faust myth with football; not hard to do when most successful players
look like mafiosi. The musical's most diverting character was a temptress
called Lola. Consciously or not, Brenton echoes this with another sultry
Lola, the footballer-hero's wife. Alas, she has nothing so entertaining to
sing as What Lola wants, as immortalised by Gwen Verdon.
The direction by David Pountney, which won a prize for Opera North at the
world premiere at the Munich Biennale a fortnight ago, can be seen at the
Grand Theatre, Leeds, this week and then in Hull, Nottingham and Manchester.
As a production it has all the theatrical audacity and exuberance of
Pountney at his best. He turns an opera chorus into a mob of soccer rowdies
charging into Munich (very self-referential, this piece) with the topical
cry of 'My team is fed on British beef]' He can, with Quinny Sacks'
choreography, depict the relationship between star player and
anthropomorphic ball (soprano Nicola Sharkey in a piebald body-stocking) as
a tenderly manipulative ballroom dance. A bierkeller scene evokes those
Germanicisms so wickedly caricatured in ENO's Konigskinder. Like Huntley
Muir's award-winning sets and costumes, the production deserved its prize.
The work itself is more problematic. Brenton's libretto is too wordy for
opera, especially with the company's less than perfect diction. After the
acid test of seeing the piece without reference to cast or synopsis, I was
startled to see I had missed a singing dachshund, not to mention the
universal issues of morality, power-play and the unsuitability of women in
the players' baths. The production's swish and style fails to disguise the
episodic, undeveloping nature of the first half, or the delay in getting to
grips with the Mephistophelean element until well into the second.
Mason's score is a cheerful kaleidoscope of allusions, quotations and
parodies where the listener, however fleetingly, snatches fragments of
everything from Humperdinck and Wagner to Bernstein and 'The Stripper'. Even
Terry Bond, the golden-boy of the pitch, suggests vulnerability with a
stammer that recalls Billy Budd. Philip Sheffield makes the most of the one
adequately-characterised role, oddly resembling Tony Blair, who doubtless
also has various diabolical pacts to consider.
As a spectacle the work is fun, with its vivid if obvious depiction of
tabloid hacks (who end up briskly copulating) and its excitingly
choreographed soccer match.
But for the most part the characters remain tokens, fleshed out neither with
words nor music. Richard Suart as the manager could turn to juggling,
soft-shoe shuffles or Gilbertian patter at the drop of a trilby; splendid
stuff, but better than the work deserves.

Grant Baird, the former chief economist of the Royal Bank of Scotland who
for the past three years has run Scotland Europa, which represents Scottish
organisations and businesses in Brussels, is returning to Edinburgh.
He is to become executive director of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the
private sector body which promotes the financial community.
Baird takes up his post in September, when James Scott, a former senior
Scottish Office official who has directed SFE since 1991, steps down. SFE
was founded in 1986 to bolster the Scottish financial community when London
was blowing its trumpet in the run-up to Big Bang. Its 220 members include
all the major banks, life assurance companies and fund managers north of the
border, as well as providers of professional services.

FT  02 JUN 94 / People: Holder moves up at General Accident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barrie Holder, 48, General Accident's finance director, has been appointed a
deputy chief executive. This increases speculation that he might take over
as chief executive of Scotland's largest insurer when Nelson Robertson, 60,
retires.
Holder, a Yorkshire-born accountant, joined GA in 1967. He spent a year in
New Zealand in 1989 sorting out GA's expensive acquisition of New Zealand
Insurance. He is the group's finance director and has now added
responsibility for the group's fast-growing life operations to his
portfolio.
Australian Bob Scott, 52, who has been responsible for reorganising the
group's sluggish UK business, has also been appointed a deputy chief
executive. His responsibilities have been extended to include the
international division. Although Scott only joined GA following its 1987
takeover of NZI, his rapid promotion suggests that he has impressed the
group's traditionally conservative directors.
Meanwhile, New Zealander Russell Evans, 55, another NZI veteran who is now
in charge of GA's corporate planning, has been appointed a general manager.
GA Life's general manager, Bill Jack, a 49-year-old Glaswegian, has been
appointed general manager (life) of the parent company.

FT  02 JUN 94 / People: Ford puts Gillitzer in the hot seat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, basking in the success of Michael Schumacher and his Benetton Ford in
grand prix, and enjoying something of a renaissance in European touring car
racing and rallying, has created a new top motorsport post. It is aimed at
giving long-term strategic direction to one of the car industry's most
valuable marketing tools.
Perhaps surprisingly, the chosen candidate is not a dyed-in-the-wool career
motorsport figure but a 56-year-old former product planner and design and
development engineer, in the form of Australian Peter Gillitzer.
He has had just three years' of motor-racing experience, as manager of
Ford's motorsport programme in Australia, where he had previously been
responsible for bringing a Mazda-based two seater, the Capri, to market.
Gillitzer's task will be to evaluate and advise where and in what categories
Ford should be competing in order to maximise the promotional benefits of
competition.
Gillitzer, who will be reporting directly to Ford of Europe vice-president
of marketing Ingvar Sviggum, did not have a great deal to celebrate when he
formally started the job yesterday - less than 24 hours earlier Ford had
only managed to come fifth in the Acropolis rally.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Technology: Good ideas stay out of the drain - A programme
which aims to close the gap between inspiration and profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the endless debate about British industrial performance and its gradual
decline relative to other countries, there is rarely any complaint about a
shortage of ideas. The problem lies not so much in inventiveness as in the
ability to make money out of new products and technologies.
'We're actually a small and very inventive country,' says Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, rector of Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine,
part of London University. 'It could be argued that we're almost too
inventive for our own good.'
Whether the fault lies in lack of money, a cultural and educational bias
against industry or an unwillingness by enough companies to take risks,
there are numerous examples of UK ideas that have been successfully
exploited abroad.
To help close the gap between inspiration and eventual profits, Imperial
College has embarked on a venture which it believes is unique among British
universities.
Called IC Parc, it is a partnership between Imperial's own research staff
and resources and companies such as British Airways, British
Telecommunications and ICL (the UK-based computer subsidiary of Japan's
Fujitsu). Its purpose is to find solutions for the complex computer needs of
its clients stretching into the next century. Barry Richards, director of IC
Parc and professor of computing science at the college, says it was set up
'to remove the problem of a good idea which doesn't go forward'.
IC Parc works on medium-term problems - such as complex aircraft scheduling
for BA, data delivery for the videoconferencing and other visual broadcast
services planned by BT, and telepublishing (with text stored digitally) -
which companies understand but need extra help to solve. 'IC Parc is seen as
addressing the task of ensuring that ideas don't go down the drain or across
the Atlantic,' he adds. It focuses on the development of advanced software
in areas of vital importance for future applications of information
technology: planning, scheduling and decision support.
Launched last month and arising out of Imperial's computer forum linking
academia and industry, it stresses the establishment of strong relationships
with the partner companies, which it calls technology clients.
Catherine Griffiths, a research fellow at IC Parc, says the forum showed
'companies had special needs that were not being addressed'. Their problems
were of a complexity that could not be simply solved by consultants.
Solutions have to be developed in such a way that they can be integrated
easily into companies' differing organisations.
'Some companies are very clear about their problems,' says Richards. 'In
other cases, they say 'we know broadly what we want to achieve in the medium
term but we're not clear how to do that'. It's one thing to conceive what
technology might be useful and another to make something out of that
technology and work out how to apply it. You have to know the company very
well and assess the likely impact.'
BA, for example, knows it will be scheduling aircraft in the future, says
Griffiths. 'They want to know how to do it better; they want to build on the
need that they have.' Bill Teather, BA's head of information management, is
enthusiastic about IC Parc's potential benefit for the airline and other
companies.
'For a university to organise itself so it can present a business-oriented
front to business - as a planning rather than a computer department - makes
a tremendous difference for the senior managers in the airline by helping
them understand what is on offer.'
For BA, IC Parc offers the opportunity to schedule aircraft in an even more
complex way than at present. 'We have enormous assets in our aircraft,' says
Teather. 'A small percentage rise in aircraft utilisation can save money and
help us deliver customer service better.'
If aircraft have to be rescheduled because of bad weather, for example, the
new software systems being developed at IC Parc could enable BA to do this
more efficiently by taking into account a greater range of factors
(including other flight schedules and passenger connections) than at
present.
'This offers potentially the next step change in how to tackle planning
problems,' he says. 'It should allow us to do what we do now more generally
 -to do it on a bigger scale.' Teather hopes such software solutions can
also be applied to other scheduling tasks such as the deployment of
maintenance staff in airports.
'There are complicated scheduling problems for which IC Parc is in a
position to provide general solutions as opposed to specific home-grown ones
which can be expensive and need lots of changes to meet different
situations,' explains Teather.
The question of scalability is a big problem in innovation, not just in the
IT field. What works in a limited environment may not translate easily to
the wider practical world.
Sir Ronald recalls from his days as chief scientific adviser with the
Ministry of Defence that some of the biggest problems arose with software.
Systems which worked beautifully in small-scale demonstrations could throw
up new problems when developed on a much bigger scale. 'You're building
systems that are too big for individuals to get their minds round,' he says.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Technology: An adjunct to success - Christopher Brown-Humes
concludes a series on research by looking at the links between industry and
academia in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
president of Sweden's high-flying pharmaceuticals group Astra, last week
launched a wide-ranging assault on the state of the country's research
industry. There were too few qualified researchers in Sweden, he said. The
education system was insufficiently geared to industry. Astra was
increasingly having to locate research capability abroad.
Mogren, one of the country's most respected business leaders, should know
what he is talking about. Not only is Astra the country's biggest company
judged by market capitalisation, but it has done as much as any Swedish
company to foster links between industry and academia.
Is the picture fair? Sweden spends 2.9 per cent of its annual GDP on R&amp;D, a
level which puts it towards the top of the world league. It also has a
well-developed framework for contacts between industry and universities. Is
it simply that the country is not getting value for money?
One must first consider the distorted structure of Swedish industry. The big
multinationals, where the country's industrial strength is concentrated,
have built up good contacts with universities. They are led by Astra and
Pharmacia in pharmaceuticals, Ericsson in telecommunications, ABB in
engineering and the vehicle groups Volvo and Saab. But Sweden does not have
enough medium-sized companies and it is at this level (and the small company
level) that contacts are much less well developed.
Camille Modeer, a director of the Federation of Swedish Industries, says:
'The problem in Sweden is not lack of ideas. The problem is lack of
possibilities to develop them.' She attributes the lack of entrepreneurial
activity to a cultural and political environment which has favoured
development of the welfare state and eschewed risk-taking for the last half
century.
Turning the situation round will not be easy. For Modeer, a key priority is
getting more people with PhDs into industry and particularly into small and
medium-sized companies. Modeer also says Sweden must make more use of its
research. Academics have not always been commercial enough in their
approach, stopping 'when they have had an article printed in some
distinguished scientific journal'.
It is not that Sweden is short of mechanisms for promoting collaborative
research, nor does it lack private-sector funding. More than 60 per cent of
R&amp;D expenditure is financed privately, with the government accounting for 35
per cent. It also has the advantage of being a small country where people
tend to know everyone else in their field.
A system of 'adjunct professorships' is one way the cross-fertilisation
works. An adjunct professor will typically spend 80 per cent of their time
with a company and 20 per cent at a university.
But adjunct professors are just one strand in a web of industry and academic
ties embracing science parks, industrial research institutes, industrial
liaison offices and strategic research foundations. The research foundations
are relative newcomers: endowed with SKr10bn (Pounds 850m) after the
break-up of the old wage earner funds, their task is to create centres and
fields of research excellence over the next 15 years.
Astra is particularly sensitive to the Swedish research climate because it
has placed strong emphasis on contacts with universities and medical
schools. The basis for the company's rapid development was its acquisition
of the rights to the compound Xylocaine, a pain-killer developed by two
researchers at Stockholm University.
Claes Wilhelmsson, Astra's head of R&amp;D, says a free flow of ideas is vital
for keeping the company in the front line of medical knowledge. The group
has 30 adjunct professorships and stresses physical proximity to academic
centres not just in Sweden but abroad. It already has four overseas centres
 -in Montreal, London, Bangalore and Brisbane - and plans to expand to six.
At the University of Montreal, Astra is looking to tap the institution's
specific expertise in the field of pain research and it talks of having a
unit of up to 100 researchers there eventually.
Wilhelmsson says that only by having a large number of small units working
in different areas will Astra get access to the broadest possible range of
new ideas for treatments. Besides, he argues, small decentralised units are
more innovative and creative than big ones encumbered by bureaucracy.
But he accepts there are drawbacks to the approach. One is duplication of
cost. The other is the risk of commercial secrets leaking out.
Ericsson also stresses academic contacts, although Bengt Gallmo at the
group's university liaison office cannot link one specific product directly
to the collaboration. 'We wouldn't get a complete product from a university
system. What we would get is a solution to a particular problem,' he says.
In Sweden, Ericsson has developed close ties with the Chalmers University of
Technology in Gothenburg and Lund University. Abroad, it has set up
laboratories near universities in Germany, the Netherlands, and North
Carolina.
The contacts with Lund are a good example of the way collaboration has
worked to the advantage of both parties. A few years ago, Ericsson decided
analogue electronics were being neglected and established an adjunct
professorship in the field at Lund. The move helped attract PhD students to
the university. The professor took on a full-time role at Lund and was hired
back by Ericsson as a consultant. The relationship continues today.
Gallmo says Ericsson is big enough to build up its own relations with
universities. But he thinks links between Swedish industry and research
centres are 'generally rather weak', particularly at the level of small and
medium-sized companies.

James Dawnay, a former head of Mercury Asset Management's unit trust
operations, is starting to put his stamp on the unit trust operations of
Martin Currie, the Scottish fund manager that he joined a couple of years
ago.
Dawnay, 47, has taken over as chairman of Martin Currie Unit Trusts,
replacing Michael Kennedy, 58, the chairman and chief executive of the
privately-owned Martin Currie group. Kennedy remains on the unit trust
company board but is starting to hand over some of his responsibilities as
he approaches retirement.
Sandy Dudgeon, 37, amateur jockey and former deputy managing director of
Adam &amp; Co, the Edinburgh private bank, has been brought in to replace Alan
Maidment, 58, who retires as managing director of Martin Currie's unit trust
business in September. George Tsergas, 48, who joined Martin Currie last
year after nine years with the Fidelity fund management group, has been
appointed sales director.
Since Dawnay arrived at Martin Currie, which has Pounds 4bn under
management, he has been involved in building up the group's overseas
institutional business. He now intends to devote more time to its unit trust
business which has doubled in size over the past couple of years, to Pounds
430m. Dawnay says it is still too small and hopes to double its size again
in three years.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Number fever leaves
Pepsi drinkers cold - Why 349 was so unlucky for the drinks company in the
Philippines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albert Yeban lives in hope. Yeban, who works in the canteen at a Manila golf
club, has nine Pepsi-Cola bottle tops with '349' printed on the underside.
That number was announced as a winner in a Pepsi promotion in the
Philippines two years ago, and Yeban reckons his bottles tops are worth a
total of 4.4m pesos (Pounds 108,000) in cash prizes. He has joined a group
of thousands of other 349-claimants and is hoping that an American lawyer
will be found to win the money for him in a court case against PepsiCo in
the US.
PepsiCo wishes it had never heard of 349. In one of the more ill-fated
announcements in marketing history, the number was declared a winner on May
25 1992, at the height of a highly successful 'under the crown' promotion
called Number Fever.
Printed on each bottle top was a three-digit number, a sum of prize money to
be won if the number turned out to be a winner, and a security code.
Such was the campaign's success in its first three months that it had been
extended for a further five weeks. Unfortunately for Pepsi, and for
thousands of Filipinos who thought they had become peso millionaires
overnight, the number 349, chosen by a computer as a winner in the second
stage, turned out to be a common non-winning number from the first stage.
There were no fewer than 800,000 bottle tops imprinted with 349, of which
half carried 1m peso prizes. Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines Inc (PCPPI), 19
per cent owned by PepsiCo, could not possibly pay; the sum would amount to
more than Dollars 15bn, dwarfing the Pounds 48m lost by Maytag, parent of
Hoover of the UK, in its disastrous 'free flights' offer to boost sales of
vacuum cleaners.
Amid angry demonstrations in which several people were injured and Pepsi
trucks were vandalised, Pepsi officials explained that there had been a
'computer glitch' and insisted that only 349 numbers with the correct
security codes (in other words those from the new series) would be honoured
as winners.
PCPPI decided to pay each 'old' 349 crown holder 500 pesos as a goodwill
gesture, an offer which cost the company Dollars 10m, in addition to the
Dollars 4m of prize money and advertising spent on the whole campaign.
But many Filipinos, including Yeban, refused to accept the offer, joining
pressure groups such as 'United 349' and '349 Consumers Organisation' that
have sought payment in full and tried to keep the issue alive in the
Philippine courts and in the media.
Claimants also believe that wealthy PepsiCo in the US is a better target
than its relatively insignificant affiliate PCPPI. One group has sought help
from Robert Swift, a US lawyer who helped to win a class suit (a case
brought by a class of people who share a grievance) in Honolulu on behalf of
10,000 victims of the regime of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos; the jury
awarded Dollars 1.2bn from the Marcos estate to the victims, although the
money has yet to be paid.
Vicente del Fierro, a former advertising executive who heads another group
called 'Coalition 349' from a house in the Manila suburbs, says he
represents 3,000 of the 349ers. 'It's about third world countries being
exploited by multinationals,' he declares, saying he is on a 'crusade for
justice' over the company's 'deception' and 'malice'.
Del Fierro charges the 349ers an annual fee and says he plans to file a
class suit in the US against PepsiCo, although Jeffrey Glen, the New York
lawyer with whom he is in contact, says that his company Berwin Leighton has
done only 'a little preliminary work' and that no decision has been taken on
whether to pursue the matter in the US.
In the Philippines, which inherited a habit of litigiousness from the US,
its former colonial power, more than 15,000 cases have been filed against
PCPPI, but almost all have been dismissed. In one case earlier this year, a
provincial court ordered the company to pay 1.1m pesos to a 21-year-old
claimant, but the judgment is being challenged.
PepsiCo - as keen to distance itself from the 349 affair as claimants are to
implicate it - says Number Fever was 'a local promotion'. There haven't been
any suits filed in the US, according to Ken Ross, PepsiCo's vice-president
for public relations. 'It's not the proper venue.'
During Number Fever, Pepsi increased its share of the soft drinks market in
the Philippines from 19 per cent to 25 per cent, luring customers from the
dominant Coca-Cola brands and smaller local manufacturers. After the 349
fiasco, however, Pepsi's share plunged to 16 per cent.
Now the company's market share is recovering, although Pepsi-Cola itself,
perhaps because it is identified by name with the 349 affair, has not done
as well as non-cola drinks such as 7-Up or Mirinda. Pepsi says sales in the
Philippines rose 40 per cent in the year to April, and market share is back
to about 20 per cent.
Filipinos say they are great ones for forgiving, whether it involves
political enemies or companies such as Pepsi. Asked about Pepsi, one Manila
stockbroker said: 'We even forgave Imelda (Marcos's notoriously extravagant
wife) and let her stand in the presidential election.'
PepsiCo, locked in combat with Coca-Cola for dominance in Asia's
fast-growing markets, is keen to lay the 349 controversy to rest. 'The vast
majority of consumers in the Philippines understand that this was an honest
mistake,' says Ross. 'A small but vocal minority of people have chosen to
pursue the matter. That's their right and the matter is in the courts.'

FT  02 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sample the soap, buy
the brand - Freebies through the door can exert a powerful influence on
consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Selling soap does have its glamorous side - at least that is what the
advertising agencies claim. The current television campaign which heralds
the UK launch of the soap powder Persil Power 'captures all the drama,
suspense and intrigue of a big epic movie', enthuses agency J Walter
Thompson.
Radio-controlled puppets, specially-composed music and a 60ft-by-100ft model
village, have all gone into the advertisement for the product which recently
found itself at the centre of a row between its creator, Unilever, and soap
war rivals Procter &amp; Gamble. Procter suggested that Persil Power's patented
'Accelerator' action would rot fabrics - a charge responded to with outrage
by Unilever.
But while the Titans clashed, and the TV 'epic' was completed and then
beamed to a waiting nation, a far more prosaic marketing exercise was also
beginning. Thousands of men and women were being recruited to deliver free
samples of Persil Power door-to-door so that consumers could actually try
the stuff.
In one of the largest sampling programmes ever attempted, it is estimated
that more than two-thirds of all UK households will receive trial packs of
the soap powder over the coming weeks. Sampling, says Ed Lyons, the
marketing manager in charge of the project, is central to the soap powder's
Pounds 25m launch campaign.
The challenge is 'to ensure that the highest levels of awareness and
interest are created and then converted into brand trial', he says. Sampling
gives consumers 'the all-important opportunity to experience the brand and
judge for themselves that the promise is delivered'.
There is evidence that, for consumers, sampling is rated above all other
forms of marketing communication, according to the Human Factor, a
consultancy which has conducted market research for the two leading sample
distribution companies, Circular Distributors and MRM Distributions.
Elaine Hunt, research director, says: 'Sampling is the only form of
unsolicited communication which is received without suspicion or annoyance.
Psychologically, sampling creates an unusual climate in these days of the
cynical consumer, who prides herself on seeing through all the wiles of the
advertiser.
'The sample appears more in the nature of a gift - something for nothing -
and the recipient seems to feel a more personal gratitude and pleasure than
is inspired by most other forms of media activity.'
Consumer enthusiasm is markedly stronger for genuinely 'free' samples,
rather than those which require the consumer to expend effort or cash.
The acceptability of a freebie is hardly surprising, but does sampling
actually work? Hunt says that both for new products and those that have been
around for some time, consumers cite sampling as the most powerful influence
on whether they purchase, 'easily outweighing advertising, money-off offers,
or couponing'.
Nick Wells, sales and marketing director of Circular Distributors, the
company which is carrying out the Persil Power door-to-door deliveries,
estimates that sampling has grown five-fold in the UK over the past decade,
with a total of about 250m samples delivered through the door last year.
While volumes have increased, the sophistication of sampling techniques has
also developed since the 1950s, when the first exercise, for Omo soap
powder, was carried out.
There are two basic methods of sampling: letterbox and personal call. The
first is suitable for items, which fit through the door and are non-toxic
(there are Advertising Standard Authority rules to protect against, for
example, children picking up and eating samples of household cleaning
products). The samples may go out on their own or be delivered with other
items, which makes the exercise cheaper. CD says it would charge about
Pounds 17 per 1,000 for the delivery of 30g samples if they were delivered
with other items, while 'solus' distribution would cost about Pounds 35.
Personal call sampling costs about 10 times more, says Wells. Delivery staff
ring at the door and ask the householder questions to establish whether they
have a use for the sample before handing it over. This helps cut down waste
by ensuring, for example, that dog food only goes to dog owners. But the
personal call also provides an opportunity for market research data to be
collected, coupons to be handed out or a database of customers interested in
future promotions to be assembled. MRM Distributions is even experimenting
with the direct input of data on the doorstep, using laptop computers.
Wells's tips for sampling success include: make sure, if it is a letterbox
delivery, that the sample is strong enough to withstand the family dog; make
the packaging look as much like the real thing as possible; and avoid
looking mean with samples which are too small to allow a proper trial.
Sampling would rarely be used in isolation, says Phil Annett, new products
marketing manager for Cereal Partners UK, the joint venture between Nestle
and General Mills. He is particularly interested in targeting children for
many of the company's new product launches, which have included the cereals
Golden Grahams and Lucky Charms. As well as door-to-door sampling, Cereal
Partners looks for distribution at toy shop checkouts and with doorstep milk
deliveries. 'If you can do it through a third party it adds endorsement,'
says Annett.
Sampling is unlikely to be effective on its own, says Annett. 'We believe it
should be used as part of a programme which includes advertising and
promotion. But it is the ultimate form of product communication - actually
to receive and taste the product. You can only do so much on television,' he
concludes.

FT  02 JUN 94 / Accountancy Column: Malignant virus plays havoc with numbers
 -The profession risks losing credibility in the wake of the
Lasmo-Enterprise battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A virulent numbers-eating killer bug is gnawing away at the body of British
accounting, in an epidemic that threatens the profession's credibility.
Experts believed they had starved out the mystery virus in a climate of
reform following the harsh years of recession. But a fresh outbreak of cases
in London in the last few days has raised fears that it is back with a
vengeance and may have developed immunity to regulatory antibiotics.
The latest manifestation came last week in a glossy 12-page defence document
from Lasmo, the oil exploration company, called 'Enterprise Oil: the
financial myth'. It attacks the accounting policies of Enterprise, its
rival, which has launched a hostile takeover bid.
The sub-title is more tantalising: a quote from Mr Graham Hearne, the
chairman and chief executive of Enterprise, stating 'Earnings . . . the
playthings of accountants'. A cynical observer of the battle between the two
companies and their advisers might be more tempted to re-phrase that as
'Accountants . . . the playthings of their clients'.
The Lasmo document accuses Enterprise of contravening UK accounting
standards in its acquisition of several oil and gas assets in the past few
years to inflate earnings. It also highlights a catalogue of what it
maintains are financial weaknesses in its rival, such as poor dividend cover
and high gearing.
As in so many other areas, the details of the accusations are rather less
important or interesting than what the attack says about those behind them.
KPMG Peat Marwick, which provided clean audit opinions on Enterprise's
accounts, indignantly defends itself and its client.
Ernst &amp; Young, Lasmo's auditors, and in particular a team of corporate
finance specialists at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, are behind the accounting attack.
While the wording has been carefully phrased by lawyers to suggest the
accusations are made by Lasmo's board, both firms have confirmed that they
stand by all the assertions in the document.
No doubt other firms would have been equally willing to help. 'If this is
the best that they can come up with, maybe I should go over and give them
some lessons,' says a top partner in a leading firm of accountants who
specialises in ripping apart accounts.
Finding a firm of any appreciable size to comment publicly on the
Lasmo-Enterprise bid is a different matter. Most have apparently had no
problem in developing 'client conflicts' as auditors or advisers to one side
or the other, which means professional ethics forbids them from speaking out
on the subject.
All this is good fun for financial journalists and other observers of
business, of course, who nostalgically recall the corporate battles of the
1980s. Senior executives are suddenly available for comment day and night,
while their advisers offer off-the-record 'objective' briefings and trade
insults about their rivals.
But it sits rather uneasily with an accountancy profession plaintively
claiming that its reputation has been unfairly tarnished by critics and
pleading to be trusted to act responsibly to exercise its own judgments
rather than be hidebound by formulaic financial reporting standards.
An unsavoury conclusion emerges from the Lasmo attack. Either Coop-ers et al
is right and Enterprise has breached accounting standards - in which case
KPMG should have qualified the accounts - or it has made a misguided
accusation. At least one firm has therefore produced an opinion which ought
to be seen as highly damaging to its integrity as a group of professionals
with independent judgment.
Even short of the issue of whether there has been an actual breach of
standards, the back-and-forth between the firms suggests that the opinions
provided by accountants are questionable and that the readers of accounts
should be more wary than ever of the information in annual reports. At the
extreme, that suggests we may as well dispense with the audit as a credible
statement altogether.
The minutiae of the Lasmo accusation are interesting, and certainly do not
reflect well on accounting in the late 1980s. Enterprise bought an interest
in the Beryl oil field properties in 1988 for Pounds 158m, but put it in its
own books at just Pounds 9m allowing it to keep depreciation minimal and
profits up.
Enterprise says it used the merger provision in SSAP 23, the standard on
acquisitions and mergers, which permits significant adjustments to the value
of the assets. It argues this was the most 'prudent' approach.
Some observers suggest that the presence of extensive footnotes in the
accounts indicates KPMG was nervous about the treatment and insisted on
significant disclosure to compensate. Lasmo, backed by Coopers, says it
believes the Pounds 149m adjustment in the books baldly breached the
standard - whether merger or acquisition accounting was used.
The small print certainly shows the use of a rather tortuous scheme in lieu
of paying cash for Beryl directly, which would have been treated as an
acquisition. Warburg, Enterprise's merchant bank, paid Pounds 158m for all
the shares in an off-the-shelf company registered in Jersey (with its
limited disclosure requirements) called Tonmar Trading. Tonmar used the
money to pay Pounds 158m in cash for Beryl.
Meanwhile, Warburg underwrote a placing of Pounds 158m of new Enterprise
shares, which it was given in exchange for handing over all the Tonmar
shares to Enterprise. Warburg received a percentage commission on the
placing, Enterprise acquired the Beryl assets through their transitory
owner, Tonmar, which was rewarded by being swiftly liquidated. The practice
is hardly the most conventional form of merger, though it appears to comply
with the letter of SSAP 23. It was one of many financial engineering schemes
practiced in the 1980s, and signed off unqualified by firms of auditors.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, says in a
general reference to merger accounting that it was widely abused in the
1980s until advisers found it was even easier to exploit other rules in the
standard on pre-acquisition provisions. He has now clamped down on both
issues in draft standards.
That might suggest that even if the criticism of Enterprise is valid and the
tactic was widespread, it is at least a thing of the past. But the salvoes
from advisers on both sides of the battle suggest accountants are as eager
as ever to lend professional credence to the beliefs of corporate executives
 -even when their views contradict.
Take the latest statement from the Financial Reporting Review Panel last
month. It 'welcomed' the decision by BET, the business services group, to
restate in its 1994 accounts details from its 1993 profits. It said the
original version did not fulfil the requirement of FRS 3, the new standard
on the profit and loss account designed among other things to all but
eliminate profit-massaging extraordinary items.
BET chose to highlight in boxes both its operating profit before exceptional
items, and the value of exceptional items. No such box flagged the
all-inclusive figure of pre-tax profit (or, in this case, after
exceptionals, the pre-tax loss). The chairman's and chief executive's
statement made much of the early adoption of FRS 3, but also placed much
emphasis on the figures before accounting 'adjustments'.
Like so many of the review panel's previous judgments against companies in
the last two years, the audit report was unqualified. And which firm of
accountants provided the view that the accounts were 'true and fair'? None
other than Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The killer bug lives on]

FT  02 JUN 94 / Women 'suffer race bias at work'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Jennifer Francis, a former 'black businesswoman of the year', was not
surprised by the findings of a report from the Equal Opportunities
Commission yesterday that women from ethnic minorities face widespread
discrimination in the workplace and when trying to find jobs.
The commission reported that while 6 per cent of white women were
unemployed, as many as 16 per cent of ethnic-minority women were unemployed
and one-in-three Bangladeshi women was registered as jobless.
Ms Francis, an associate director of a London public relations company and a
member of several public bodies, including the Radio Authority, said: 'The
report mirrors the working experience both of us and our mothers since their
emigration to the UK.'
Ms Francis, who founded a successful PR company in the 1980s, said: 'Part of
my motivation in working for myself has been the desire for independence -
and that includes not being vulnerable to problems (that) women, and
particularly black women, face in the workplace.'
She said that discriminatory attitudes were open, visible and deep-seated.
'For example, when I attend professional conferences the typical attitude of
a white male is that I am a secretary or a tea lady.'
The report, which drew on the last census, said that women from ethnic
minorities faced discrimination because of their sex and their race.
Consequently, ethnic minority women were more likely to work longer hours
than white women and to work in lower-paid and lower-status jobs.
The commission expressed concern about deteriorating job prospects in many
occupations. One of the most startling findings was that this higher rate of
