FT  29 JUN 94 / Markets Report: US dollar marks time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The truce between central banks and markets held again on foreign exchanges
yesterday, with the dollar trading in a fairly narrow range, writes Philip
Gawith.
The US currency closed firmer in London at DM1.5849, from DM1.5758 on
Monday, and at Y100.210 from Y99.865. It later slipped back in New York
trading, falling below Y100 and DM1.58. It ended the US session at Y99.935
and DM1.5785.
Trading remained fairly quiet, with market participants seemingly unwilling
to take firm positions, faced with the possibility of central bank
intervention and a raft of important events next week.
Although the dollar has been stable, analysts said market sentiment remained
negative with the risks still on the downside.
Elsewhere, sterling received an initial fillip from a bullish set of
Treasury economic forecasts before slipping back in late trading. It closed
at DM2.4513 from DM2.4498 and Dollars 1.5466 from Dollars 1.5547.
The dollar came off its highs for the day after various economic reports
caused a drop in the US Treasury bond market. The conference board reported
that US consumer confidence rose to 92 in June after a revised 88.9 in May,
near to a four-year high. May single family home sales climbed by 4.2 per
cent, after a revised drop of 3.4 per cent in April, while import prices
rose by 1.1 per cent, the biggest monthly gain since October 1990.
These figures fanned fears of inflation, causing weakness in the bond
market, and the dollar repeated the pattern of recent months by falling in
sympathy.
Prior to the economic data, dealers said the dollar had been supported by
rumours of central bank intervention, which failed to materialise.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO in London, said it was
only Bank of Japan intervention that was keeping the dollar reasonably
stable against the yen. Many in the market believe that the yen will
strengthen further from current levels.
Swiss Bank Corporation, for example, in its latest currency comment, argues
that 'speculative purchases of yen are about to rise sharply, which makes a
concerted defence of the US dollar most irrational at current levels, and
unlikely'.
Three main factors underpin this view: uncertain Japanese politics, the low
chance of progress on trade talks, and non-Japanese investors reducing their
aggressive short positions in the yen.
The flip side of the more stable dollar has been some evidence of unwinding
of D-Mark positions. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS
in London, said there were 'signs that people were questioning the value of
extending long D-Mark positions at these levels'.
'Risk-reward suggests that you ought to be looking to lock in some short
D-Mark positions for the summer, especially if you expect something might
come out of the G7 meeting.'
The D-Mark continued to give up ground against some of the high-yielding
currencies. It finished at SKr4.802 from SKr4.812 against the Swedish krona,
and at Pta82.42 from Pta82.49 against the Spanish peseta. The Portuguese
escudo closed unchanged at Es102.9 per D-Mark after finance minister Mr
Eduardo Catroga said the currency was correctly valued at its current level.
The Treasury forecast UK growth at 2.75 per cent in 1994, up from its
earlier expectation of 2.5 per cent. It also forecast a 1994/5 public sector
borrowing requirement of Pounds 36bn, down from the Pounds 38bn previously
predicted.
In addition, it revised down its forecast of underlying inflation in the
fourth quarter to 2.5 per cent from the 3.25 per cent prediction made last
November. The impact of these forecasts on sterling was muted by the fact
that they are broadly in line with the consensus.
Some banks have reported recently that orders placed by UK corporates
suggest expectations of a higher pound against the dollar are increasing,
but this is offset by perceptions that the downside risk against the D-Mark
is also rising.
The markets are expecting a further small 3 to 5 basis-point cut in the
German repo rate today after the Bundesbank announced another variable rate
auction.
One factor acting against a larger fall is the level of German call money,
which rose to 5.05/5.15 per cent, from 4.90/5.00 per cent on Monday.
Although the pace of easing has slowed recently, analysts believe that the
strength of the D-Mark allows further room for interest rates to decline.
This view is not fully discounted in the futures market with the December
Euromark contract discounting short term rates of about 5.12 per cent in
December, compared with 4.95 per cent currently. The broking house GNI
argues that fundamentals suggest a bullish view of Euromarks, but says the
bearish tone of bond markets will probably dampen any response.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 670m of
assistance after forecasting a Pounds 650m shortage. Overnight money traded
between 4 and 4 7/8 per cent.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Antimony price surge continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Antimony, a metal with a wide variety of uses, has more than doubled in
price in the past three months, from about Dollars 1,750 to nearly Dollars
4,000 a tonne last night.
Traders said there had been problems with supplies from China, by far the
biggest producer, for some time and the recent price surge was caused by US
dealers buying heavily on behalf of consumers.
When combined with other substances antimony is an extremely useful metal.
It expands when solidifying (a rare characteristic it shares with water) so
is a particularly valuable ingredient of alloys used for castings and type
metal as the expansion forces metal to fill small crevices of casting molds.
Even when added in very small quantities, antimony gives strength and
hardness to other metals, particularly lead, with which it forms alloys used
in plates of car storage batteries, in bullets and coverings for telephone
cables. Among the many applications for antimony compounds, the trioxide and
trichloride are used in flame-proofing fabrics and the trioxide in paints
and plastics both as a pigment and as a fire-retarding agent.
Traders said that consumers could not easily find substitutes for antimony
at short notice and that extra supplies of metal from sources outside China
were not likely to appear until producers were convinced that present high
prices would continue for some time.
Mr Richard Samuels of Lambert International said: 'There seems no reason for
the market to collapse and the price might go a bit higher judging by the
lack of offers and the large number of inquiries we have had'.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee consolidates gains as
metals and oil slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robusta coffee futures prices rose again in London yesterday after Monday's
40 per cent leap on news of severe frost damage to next year's Brazilian
crop.
Despite fears of a further frost next weekend, the lack of firm details of
the damage kept the rise to 5.5 per cent and the September contract failed
to regain Monday's intra-day high of Dollars 3,150 a tonne. It closed
Dollars 157 higher at Dollars 3,005.
New York remained at boiling point, however. In afternoon trading, the
second position arabica contract was at Monday's high of 170 cents a pound,
up 8.40 cents.
'It's going to take quite a while for people to find out the extent of the
damage,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at London brokers GNI. 'One
Brazilian source told me it was nigh on impossible to hire a private plane
because everyone is out flying over the coffee-growing areas.'
Early estimates of the damage suggest anything between 1m and 9m bags of
Brazilian output next year could be lost. But figures vary according to
whether the comparison is with this year's estimated crop of 24m bags, or
the output of up to 30m bags which had been predicted for next year.
Brazil, Colombia and Central America have temporarily suspended export
registrations and Brazil may hold a meeting with other producers in the
region next week to discuss coffee supply.
On the London Metal Exchange meanwhile, base metals prices dropped sharply
before some late bargain-hunting eased the downward pressure late in the
day. Even so, nickel for delivery in three months fell 3.5 per cent on the
day to Dollars 6,045 a tonne; zinc 2.8 per cent to Dollars 945.50; copper 2
per cent to Dollars 2,380.50; and aluminium 1.35 per cent to Dollars
1,457.50.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the downward moves were
sparked off by profit-taking by US funds and some traders.
'They have built up some big profits in the commodities markets in the past
few weeks,' he pointed out.
'This is not the end of the metals' bull run', he insisted.
The nickel market was affected by a surprise statement from Mr Sergei
Korneyev, sales manager of Norilsk Nickel in Russia, the biggest producer.
He told a Metal Bulletin conference in Moscow that output was holding up
reasonably well and exports could rise by 13 per cent in 1994 compared with
last year's 83,000 tonnes.
Crude oil prices weakened amid expectations that the weekly report from the
American Petroleum Institute would show a marked increase in US stocks. The
price of the benchmark Brent Blend slipped below Dollars 17 a barrel in late
London trading.
Supply bottlenecks in the US at a time of particularly high oil have
underpinned a rise in US crude prices in recent weeks; and that has
influenced the London markets.
But traders said the API report was likely to show that European and west
African producers had reacted to the wide spread between the price of West
Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, and Brent by sending a large number of
cargoes to the US.

Unusually heavy rainfall in southern Thailand has reduced June rubber output
by an estimated 50 per cent, according to senior officials of the state
Rubber Research Institute, reports Reuter from Bangkok.
In past years, rubber production in June was around 100,000 tonnes, but the
unusual weather pattern this year has cut that figure in half, creating
shortages and causing prices to surge.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Industrial users demand EU
sugar reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial users of sugar yesterday demanded fundamental reform of the
European Union's sugar regime, describing it as 'anachronistic'.
European consumers paid two to three times more for sugar than the world
price, costing them up to Ecu5.5bn extra a year, said the Committee of
Industrial Users of Sugar.
The committee, which represents companies purchasing and processing 70 per
cent of the sugar consumed in Europe, said the current regime, unchanged
since 1968, 'rewards producers on the basis of the least efficient, not the
most efficient'.
The European Commission is due to present proposals for reforming the sugar
sector by the autumn. Sugar, along with wine and fruit and vegetables, was
exempted from the far-reaching shake-up of the common agricultural policy in
1992. The pressure for reform has been increased by last December's Gatt
agreement, which requires cuts in subsidised EU exports of sugar of more
than 10 per cent.
The committee said European supply far exceeded demand, which meant
taxpayers had to foot the bill for export refunds on sales of surpluses to
the world market.
'In addition, there is the fact that rigid national production quotas, which
are inconsistent with the concept of a single market, block production
moving to the best suited areas in Europe,' it said.
The committee called for gradual cuts in sugar prices and for liberalisation
of the quota system, to enable quotas to be transferred across national
boundaries.
'We are calling for progressive, gradual reform, not overnight change, so
that all parties concerned can work together to achieve a more efficient
sugar regime,' said Mr Tom Harrison, committee president.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP study shows energy demand
still growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide demand for energy continues to rise outside the former Soviet
Union, with little evidence of any gains in energy efficiency, according to
the latest edition of British Petroleum's Statistical Review of World
Energy.
Total primary energy consumption outside the FSU grew by 2.1 per cent in
1993, the same as 1992, but below the 1983-93 trend rate of 2.5 per cent. Mr
Peter Davies, BP's chief economist, attributed the overall decline to the
effects of recession in Europe and Japan.
Energy consumption growth in North America of 2.3 per cent and 4.2 per cent
in the less developed countries was close to the long-term trend rate.
Declines in energy intensity, which measures the ratio of energy consumption
to real GDP growth, have been 'rather disappointing', Mr Davies said. 'LDCs
in particular find that development and consumer income growth inevitably
results in comparable rises in energy consumption.'
The 0.2 per cent overall rise in world consumption last year reflected the
collapse of demand in Russia and other former Soviet republics. Mr Davies
said the pace of contraction in the world's second largest energy market had
'. . . become truly unprecedented in peacetime'.
Primary energy consumption in the FSU fell by 9.7 per cent last year. Oil
bore the brunt of the reductions, and production delined for the seventh
consecutive year. Total FSU production has fallen 40 per cent, or 5m barrels
a day since its peak in 1987.
But net exports of Russian oil rose last year for the first time since 1989
as supplies were diverted from FSU to hard currency markets.
The growth of Russian and other non-Opec oil exports was one of the factors
behind recent oil price weakness. Mr Davies said last year's surge in
non-Opec output was 'exceptional'. Even so demand for Opec oil continued to
grow, albeit more slowly than in previous years.
World oil demand outside the FSU rose by 1.4 per cent last year. China's
booming economy boosted oil consumption growth to more than 11 per cent, and
the country became a net oil importer for the first time since the early
1970s. Mr Davies said China could be importing 1m barrels a day by 2000.
The report found that the balance between fuels was relatively stable.
Natural gas consumption outside the FSU grew by 4.6 per cent. Gas gained
market share in all regions.
UK consumption grew by 15.2 per cent in 1993, as new gas-fired power
stations began production. The UK is now the largest west European gas
market, and the world's fifth largest.
Coal consumption fell for the fourth consecutive year, with the declines
concentrated in the FSU and western Europe. Coal use grew in the US (4 per
cent) and China (2.7 per cent), the two biggest consuming countries.
Consumption of nuclear and hydroelectric power grew by 3 per cent and 3.9
per cent respectively.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian aluminium company plans
output expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's National Aluminium Company, which owns the country's largest
integrated aluminium complex, is expecting the federal government to clear
its proposal to expand bauxite (aluminium ore) mining capacity from 2.4m
tonnes to 3.6m tonnes and alumina (aluminium oxide) refining capacity from
800,000 tonnes to 1.35m tonnes at a cost of Rs10.56bn (Dollars 336m).
According to Mr SK Tamotia, the chairman and managing director, however,
Nalco has shelved its plan to build a greenfield, export-oriented alumina
refinery with an annual capacity of 900,000 tonnes.
In the meantime, Hydro Aluminium of Norway, which was to have partnered
Nalco in the alumina venture will be working with Indian Aluminium and Tata
Industries to set up a 1m-tonne export-oriented alumina project at a cost of
Rs22.50bn at Rayagada district of Orissa.
'The reason we backed out of the alumina project is that we are not sure
about its viability,' said Mr Tamotia. 'At the ruling world prices of
alumina, the cost of production will not be covered.'
The company plans to export 400,000 tonnes of alumina in this fiscal year,
compared with 372,000 tonnes in the year to March 31, 1994. 'Nalco is also
planning to expand the aluminium smelting capacity at Angul in Orissa from
218,000 tonnes to 330,000 tonnes,' Mr Tamotia said. 'The expansion is to be
effected by adding one more potline with 240 pots at the Angul smelter.
However, because of our present resource constraint we cannot take up the
project immediately.'
In the meantime, the cost of the smelter capacity expansion has been brought
down from Rs21bn to Rs10bn as Nalco will not be required to create
additional captive power capacity following the assurance of power supply by
the National Thermal Power Corporation.
'India, where the demand for aluminium is growing at an annual rate of about
5 per cent will need extra smelting capacity. Since the cost of setting up a
new smelter will be prohibitive, the existing aluminium producers will have
to expand capacity. Last year, India imported nearly 45,000 tonnes of
aluminium,' said Mr Tamotia.
On paper, India has smelting capacity of 610,000 tonnes. However, this
includes the 73,000-tonne smelter of Indian Aluminium at Belgaum in
Karnataka, which was de-energised in August 1992 because of 'its highly
uneconomic operation'. It is unlikely that the Belgaum smelter will ever
again be recommissioned.
India's eighth five year plan has projected an aluminium smelting capacity
of 772,000 tonnes by 1996-97. Industry officials are unanimous that the
target will not be achieved.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries retreat on signs of resilient
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday as signs of a resilient economy
competed with the sickly dollar for the top position on the market's list of
concerns.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond had given back 5/16
to 85 3/32 , about the same price as before the previous session's rally
began. The yield recrossed the pivotal 7.50 per cent barrier to trade at
7.511 per cent as the session drew to a close.
At the short end, the two-year note was  1/16 lower at 99 25/32 , to yield
6.118 per cent.
Early on, the US currency held fairly steady in the foreign exchange
markets.
However, the market found different reasons to be bearish. The morning
brought two pieces of news suggesting that this spring's series of rate
increases had not cooled off the economy sufficiently.
The first came from the Commerce Department, which announced that sales of
new homes in May had climbed 4.2 per cent, more than offsetting an April
decline and exceeding the forecasts of analysts.
Meanwhile, the Conference Board indicated that consumers were in the mood to
spend, fanning fears of inflation in the fixed-rate markets.
Its June index of consumer confidence came in at 92.0, against a May reading
of 88.9. Again, economists were expecting a much more modest gain.
The market reacted by driving down the price of bonds across the board.
Commodity prices, which have been a saving grace in recent sessions, showed
moderate gains, further souring sentiment.
To make matters even worse, activity in the currency markets became
difficult to ignore by midday.
The dollar again dropped below the Y100 and the DM1.58 levels, setting off a
second flurry of Treasury selling. Still, bonds managed to climb off their
session lows before the trading day was completed.
Most continental government bond markets edged slightly higher yesterday in
quiet, largely futures-driven trade. However, analysts said concerns about
US Treasuries, the US dollar and the timing of future US interest rate rises
continued to dog the markets.
The September German government bond contract on Liffe was up 0.24 points at
92.49 in late trading.
Attention today will be on the results of the Bundesbank's securities
repurchase tender following its announcement yesterday that it was setting a
tender for 14-day funds at variable bid rates.
Expectations are for a further cut in the repo rate by five basis points
from 5.00 to 4.95 per cent.
However, Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International said that
'official remarks at last week's Bundesbank council meeting were taken by
some as a sign that it may pause in its policy of regular cuts in the repo
rate. That would have a significant effect on bond markets.'
Lack of follow-through buying after Monday's strong rally and weakness in
the US market following the publication of the strong US economic data
pushed UK government bonds lower.
'Gilts outperformed other European markets on Monday, pushed up by one
substantial purchase in thin trade, and so came off more easily than the
rest of Europe today,' said Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at S. G. Warburg
Securities.
The UK Treasury's summer update of its UK economic forecasts was in line
with expectations, with an upward revision to the growth forecast and the
prediction for underlying inflation revised downwards.
However, there was some disappointment that the downward revision to the
projected public sector borrowing requirement, to Pounds 36bn from the
Pounds 38bn initially predicted in the November budget, was not larger.
The focus today for the gilts market will be the Bank of England's auction
of a further Pounds 2bn of floating-rate gilts, due 1999.
Analysts expect the sale to go well, with the issue being of particular
appeal to the financial sector and, since its coupon is tied to money market
rates, less subject to bond market volatility.
The auction will raise the total volume of outstanding gilt FRNs to Pounds
4.5bn. March's auction of FRNs was covered a high 2.28 times. The September
long gilt future on Liffe was down  17/32 points in late trading at 100 3/4
.
The Italian September BTP futures contract on Liffe was up 0.35 points at
104.35 in late trading.
However, 'worries about the Italian government's commitment to fiscal
rectitude continues to weigh on Italian bonds,' said Ms Katy Peters, senior
economist at Daiwa Europe.
The September notional French bond futures contract on Matif closed at
116.30, up 0.02 points on the day.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: MeesPierson sets up fund to
invest in German groups
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MeesPierson, the Dutch investment bank which is part of the ABN-Amro banking
group, is to launch a DM150m private equity fund which will invest mainly in
'mittelstand' or medium-sized German companies.
The fund is to be run by Mr Onno Hogerzeil and Mr Christopher Peisch, two
fund managers who joined the Dutch institution earlier this year after
running the European investment activities of a buy-out fund for Morgan
Stanley, the US investment bank.
It will invest in small to medium-size companies throughout northern Europe,
although it will concentrate on Germany. The fund will take majority stakes
in companies.
The two managers claim that Germany today offers parallels with the US in
the early 1980s, when the US economy went through significant corporate
restructuring in the aftermath of recession, providing 'many highly
profitable private equity investment opportunities'.
The opportunities are expected to arise as Germany's big industrial
conglomerates sell off non-core businesses. 'The recession has led to a
noticeable change in German companies' attitudes,' observed Mr Hogerzeil,
who said that large companies had abandoned their traditional reluctances to
dispose of subsidiaries.
'Mittelstand' companies are also undercapitalised in relation to their
larger competitors, and MeesPierson hopes that a buy-out fund will offer an
alternative to bank finance as companies seek fresh capital to finance new
investment. They claim there is a growing pool of German managers willing to
undertake buy-outs or buy-ins, still unfamiliar transactions in Germany.
According to Mr Volkert Klaucke, managing partner of MeesPierson in Germany,
the fund is two-thirds placed with institutions, predominantly Dutch pension
funds. The fund will aim for a gross annual yield of 30 per cent. Although
there are dozens of venture capital companies in Germany, there are only a
handful of funds which specialise in buy-ins and buy-outs.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Portugal set to launch DM2bn global FRN
issue today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours of a big floating-rate note offering from a European sovereign
borrower which have been in the eurobond market for more than a week proved
true yesterday when details emerged of a DM2bn offering of five-year FRNs
from Portugal.
The issue, which is being arranged by Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and UBS,
is likely to be priced to yield between 9 and 10 basis points over
three-month Libor. It is expected to be launched today.
Syndicate managers said the indicated pricing was fair but they raised some
concern about the size of the offering, in the light of the continued price
volatility in European government bond markets.
However, one manager pointed out that Depfa, the German mortgage bank,
raised DM1bn yesterday without too much difficulty through a domestic
offering of nine-year FRNs at Libor flat.
Some syndicate managers were surprised that Portugal had opted for a global
structure since they did not think there would be huge demand from the US
for FRNs denominated in the German currency.
However, they said the structure would increase the appeal of the FRNs to
central banks around the world.
By contrast, a syndicate manager at one of the joint leads said that the
pre-marketing of the deal had identified strong demand from New York-based
international bond funds who needed floating-rate non-dollar assets.
Portugal's offering will be the first sovereign FRN deal since the beginning
of May, when the Hellenic Republic raised DM1bn through an issue of
seven-year FRNs, with a call and a put option after five years. The
discounted margin on Greece's notes at the launch was 112 basis points over
six-month Libor but yesterday it stood at 122 basis points over Libor,
according to traders.
Among yesterday's deals, Halifax Building Society raised Dollars 150m
through an offering of three-year eurobonds. Lead manager Paribas said the
deal was targeted at retail investors in the Benelux region and in
Switzerland who were attracted by the 6 3/4 per cent coupon.
There were reports that some banks in the syndicate had trouble selling
their allocation, mainly because the Halifax did not have as strong a
following in continental Europe as other UK financial institutions, notably
Abbey National. However, the yield spread widened only slightly when the
bonds were freed to trade.
The proceeds of the deal are believed to have been swapped into
floating-rate sterling.
GECC also tapped the pool of Benelux retail investors with its CDollars 100m
offering of five-year eurobonds.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the bonds would coincide with the redemption
of around CDollars 600m worth of bonds in August.

<TEXT>
Prospects for Hong Kong's bond market are improving, but its current
structure cannot fully accommodate funding needs, AP-DJ reports from Hong
Kong.
In its monthly economic report, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
said Hong Kong alone will earmark HKDollars 350bn over the next 10 years on
infrastructure projects, while China will spend USDollars 25bn this year and
its needs are growing by 20 per cent a year.
Such demand requires funding on a massive scale and there are doubts that
the current structure of Asia's financial markets will be able to
accommodate all these needs, the report said.
The lack of long-term government paper as a benchmark has 'dogged the
development of a local bond market,' Hongkong Bank said.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Standard Chartered is called to
account - The bank's abuses may have wider repercussions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered had little option yesterday but to make tough noises
about 'effective management and control' of its investment banking
activities in Hong Kong. The catalogue of regulatory abuse described by the
Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, was
remarkable.
The appointment of Mr John McFarlane, an executive director of the bank, to
oversee the reorganisation of the bank's investment banking business in Hong
Kong, and the clear separation announced between the merchant bank and
securities house, is the beginning of a process, not the end of one.
Last year Standard Chartered Asia was the third largest (ranked by value)
merchant bank in Hong Kong in the lucrative business of initial public
offerings (IPO), and first by number. It has now been banned from this
activity until April next year.
Standard Chartered's profits from Hong Kong broking and merchant banking
were 3 per cent of pre-tax profits of Pounds 401m (USDollars 609.52m) in
1993, with IPOs accounting for about Pounds 1m. But the bank places
strategic importance on broking as Asian capital markets grow stronger and
more sophisticated.
About 20 senior executives and traders from Standard Chartered Securities,
the broker, and Standard Chartered Asia, the merchant bank, have left since
the SFC began its inquiries last October. This includes some of Hong Kong's
leading deal makers who will not be easy to replace.
The infringements from July 1991 until March 1993 include one case in which
the broker lent HKDollars 107m (USDollars 13.84m) to directors of Yanion, a
component manufacturer, to support its HKDollars 750m flotation. In another
case it allowed a company owned by one if its sales directors to
sub-underwrite 10 per cent of an IPO and provided credit lines to enable it
to support the company's share price after the flotation.
In other cases, it permitted its employees to trade against clients through
a practice known as 'rat trading'. This is where trades for customers are
booked through an employee's private accounts with other stock brokers when
the employee judges that he can make a profit.
In terms of the profit and loss account, the upset pales into insignificance
alongside the Bombay securities scandal, which led to a Pounds 269m bad debt
charge in 1992. But it renews long-standing questions about the bank's
ability to control operations in the 50 countries in which it operates.
Mr Malcom Williamson, chief executive, argued yesterday that it was not
comparable with Bombay. 'It would be easy for people to say this is another
India, but that is not really justifiable,' he said. The issue was 'a
reputational one, which we take very seriously,' rather than financial.
Standard Chartered's Hong Kong securities arm was something of a loose
cannon. The operation was formerly a broker called Ching Tung in which the
bank acquired a minority stake after the 1987 crash. It operated as a
largely autonomous subsidiary until full control was taken in the early
1990s.
Risk controls and technology had been upgraded after the integration. But Mr
Williamson said this came too late to prevent the IPO problems. 'The trouble
is that it is easy to get events out of kilter. A lot of this pre-dated our
decision to retain and develop the operation,' he said.
Nonetheless, he acknowledged the potential problems faced by Standard
Chartered in operating in places where regulation is being strengthened.
'Hong Kong was not a highly regulated market until recently, and when you
have an total upgrade of ethics, people can get caught out,' he said.
Indeed, the SFC's rebuke follows on from last September's upbraiding of
Peregrine Investments - Hong Kong's top IPO issuer - for similar abuse of
rules. It was found to have contributed to a restricted free-float in three
IPOs, and was made to pay HKDollars 3.5m to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
The Standard Chartered case, coming less than a year after Peregrine, will
have repercussions beyond the narrow compass of the way an individual
investment house recovers from regulatory censure. It was the judgment of
financial market observers that important parts of the stock exchange's plan
for its future development had been set back, perhaps indefinitely, by
yesterday's revelations.
In particular the exchange's desire to shift some of the regulatory burden
from itself to the merchant banks along the lines of the self-policing
practices apparent in New York - especially in relation to the vetting of
prospectuses - now appears doomed.
As the SFC has been pointing out over the past few months, there are
significant differences between New York and Hong Kong. Some of these
include the general litigious nature of US investors, their ability to mount
class actions against investment houses and the existence of compensation
funds in the US, which many houses maintain in the event of difficulty.
Another important difference is Hong Kong's 1997 transfer to China.
Self-regulation on the scale advocated by the stock exchange would not be
feasible in Hong Kong especially, as one observer delicately put it
yesterday, 'facing the influx of mainland Chinese business practices after
1997'.
The Standard Chartered case has also probably strengthened the SFC's resolve
not to change Hong Kong's prohibition against share price support activities
at initial offerings. These practices are common in the UK and US, and
international merchant banks have been lobbying the SFC in favour of change.
International investment houses have complained to the authorities that
their efforts to launch successfully some of the large mainland Chinese
corporate issues have been hampered by what they regard as 'out of date'
rules under which they have to operate.
It is unlikely that Standard Chartered has helped the case for change.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: SIA and Tata in venture to form
Indian airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore Airlines (SIA) is planning to launch a domestic airline in India
in a joint venture with Tata Industries, India's leading industrial group.
The two companies yesterday signed a preliminary agreement to form the
airline joint venture, and will carry out a feasibility study and seek the
necessary government approvals.
SIA said this process was expected to take up to six months and, barring
unforeseen circumstances, the new airline should be operational by the end
of next year.
SIA has earmarked India as well as China and Vietnam as significant growth
markets. The airline announced last week a Dollars 10.3bn order for new
Boeing and Airbus airliners to modernise and expand its fleet to meet future
growth.
Liberalisation of the Indian economy and continued strong demand for air
travel in the country was expected to stimulate growth in domestic travel
and tourism in India, both SIA and Tata said.
SIA also said its participation in the new venture was consistent with its
strategy of investing selectively in airlines and associated airport
services in rapidly growing economies of the Asian region.
The joint venture, if approved by the Indian authorities, will also mark the
return of Tata to the airline business. Tata pioneered the industry in India
with Tata Airlines before it was nationalised to become Air India.
SIA also announced yesterday that its Singapore Airport Terminal Services
(Sats) subsidiary was taking a 49 per cent stake in a Dollars 13m joint
venture in-flight kitchen company based at Karachi international airport in
Pakistan.
Sats recently invested in a similar in-flight kitchen venture in Beijing and
the project further reflects the Singapore carrier's expansion drive in
fast-growing Asian air travel markets.

move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The federal court in Sydney has blocked the sending-out of formal 'part A'
offer documents by Gantry, one of the two US bidders for Australia's Bridge
Oil.
Lawyers for Parker &amp; Parsley, the rival bidder, said the interim injunction
had been granted on grounds that the documents were flawed in the disclosure
of Gantry's intentions for Bridge once a takeover was completed.
But Gantry, which is the bid vehicle for Enron, the US gas company, and the
California Public Employees Retirement System, said that it would appeal the
decision, and was seeking an expedited hearing.
The injunction comes one day after P&amp;P raised its offer to 90 cents a share,
outbidding Gantry's 85 cents a share terms.

Goodman Fielder, the large but ailing Australian food group, is to increase
its share of the Dutch bread market to about one-third through an agreement
with Verenigde Bakkers, an association of independent bakers in the
Netherlands. Goodman's European baking business, Quality Bakers Europe,
currently holds around 25 per cent of the Dutch bread market.
The VBN bakeries will remain independent, but their products will use
Quality Bakers branding, and supply, billing and distribution will be
handled by the Goodman unit.
The move comes just one week after Mr Barry Weir, Goodman chief executive,
told shareholders the company should be able to achieve a 9-10 per cent
margin on sales, and set out a number of proposals to help the company to
this objective. In the latest half-year, sales margins were under 7 per
cent.

500m bid for Foodland

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ADollars 500m (USDollars 367.6m) bid by Rank Commercial of New Zealand
for Foodland Associated, the Western Australian grocery group, took a
dramatic turn yesterday when the Trade Practices Commission, Australia's
competition watchdog, went to court to prevent the bidder lodging or issuing
formal offer documents.
The commission, which had said earlier that it was examining the offer for
anti-competitive implications, said it was unhappy with the potential
acquisition of Foodland's Australian assets by Coles Myers, one of the
nation's largest retail groups.
If the offer by Rank - a private company owned by Mr Graeme Hart, a New
Zealand entrepreneur - is successful, the bidder intends to split up
Foodland's assets. It would sell the NZ assets on to Whitcoulls, a
stationery and book retailer, while Coles Myers would have an option to
acquire the Australian assets for around ADollars 250m.
Yesterday the commission said it 'had formed the view that the acquisition
of Foodland by Coles Myer would substantially lessen competition and
therefore constitute breach of the Trade Practices Act'.
It asked the court for an interim injunction to prevent the formal 'part A'
offer documents being either lodged or issued. The judge who was hearing the
case reserved judgment until today.
The concerns rest partly on the potential hold which Coles Myers could
obtain on the Western Australian grocery market, where Foodland has a 54 per
cent share of the wholesale trade.
Coles would also take over Foodland's half-share in Australian Liquor
Marketers, the country's largest liquor wholesaler, and its minority stake
in Independent Holdings, the grocery independent.
Vox, the ailing Perth-based retailer, is to sell its core retail division to
a subsidiary of Brierley Investments.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: GMA to take over Mount Lyell
leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold Mines of Australia (GMA), the Western Australian mining group currently
in the throes of a contested takeover bid for Dominion Mining, is to take
over the leases for the Mount Lyell copper mine in Tasmania when Renison
Goldfields closes down its operations there later this year.
Renison announced in March that the 101-year-old mine would close on
December 15.
In its time, Mount Lyell has been controversial, playing a significant role
in the development of Tasmania's environmental movement, but more recently
the authorities' emphasis has been on keeping the mine open for employment
reasons.
GMA is now expected to spend around ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.6m) evaluating
resources in the area. It believes a resource of 17.5m tonnes grading 1.5
per cent copper and 0.5 grammes per tonne of gold exists within the leases.
Broken Hill Proprietary is to sell up to 106m cubic feet of gas a day to
Metrogas, the Buenos Aires utility.
First sales will be made from the Sierra Chata field discovered last year on
the Chihuidos block.
BHP holds 35.9 per cent of the block, but has granted Central Puerto, a
Buenos Aires-based electricity generator, an option to buy up to a 10 per
cent working interest.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Corning shares jump as sales
soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Corning jumped by more than 6 per cent as the US manufacturing
group beat market expectations with strong sales growth in its second
quarter.
Corning lifted post-tax profits to Dollars 111.4m, or 54 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 89.8m, or 47 cents a share, in the same period in
1993.
Revenues in the three months to June 19 were Dollars 1.1bn, up 22 per cent
from a year before - though around half of the growth stemmed from the
acquisition last year of Damon, a medical testing company.
The rest was due to the stronger US economy, which had a positive impact on
all the company's main businesses, Mr James Houghton, chairman, said.
Corning also benefited from stronger earnings in associated companies,
primarily Dow Corning. This, and the elimination of losses with the disposal
last year of its interest in Vitro Corning, led to reported income of
Dollars 34m from associates, up from Dollars 27m a year before.
For the first half, Corning's net income rose to Dollars 169m, or 82 cents a
share, from Dollars 139m, or 73 cents, a year before. Its shares closed at
Dollars 33 1/8, up Dollars 1 7/8 on the day.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Mobil steps up restructure and
takes Dollars 315m charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mobil, the US energy group, continued recent cost-cutting efforts with an
announcement that it would shed one in five jobs in its chemicals business
and take after-tax charges of Dollars 315m in the current quarter.
The actions, though anticipated, came earlier than expected, and appeared to
indicate an acceleration of restructuring initiatives under way since before
Mr Lucio Noto took over as chairman in March.
Mobil said Dollars 95m of the charge related to its chemicals businesses.
The workforce would be reduced by 2,300 and some plastics fabrication
capacity would be closed down.
However, the steps do not include the closure of any ethylene or
polyethylene capacity, areas where Mobil has built up capacity rapidly since
the end of the 1980s but which have been hit hard by the cyclical downturn
in the chemicals industry.
Mobil's chemicals operations contributed Dollars 15m in the first three
months of the year, compared with Dollars 44m in the whole of 1993 - well
below the Dollars 558m recorded in 1989. The company said the restructuring
would 'improve earnings significantly'.
A further Dollars 185m of the charge stemmed from a write-down of some
natural gas properties in the US, and non-producing properties in Canada.
These properties were all acquired in the early 1980s, when the company
anticipated strong oil and natural gas prices.
A write-down of some US marketing assets accounted for the remaining Dollars
35m of the charge.
Restructuring and cost-cutting has already brought down Mobil's costs
substantially since the early 1990s.
Speaking at the annual meeting last month, Mr Noto said operating costs were
reduced by Dollars 325m last year, and Dollars 250m in 1992.
Exxon's domestic exploration and production unit, Exxon USA, said it will
cut production offices in three states and consolidate them into Houston,
AP-DJ reports from Irving, Texas. Exxon said it expected the moves to
eliminate about 430 positions.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: BellSouth in multimedia trial
plan for Atlanta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BellSouth, the regional telephone company serving the southeastern US,
yesterday announced plans for a trial of new interactive multimedia video
services to 12,000 homes in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, starting next
year.
BellSouth has lagged several other large regional US telephone companies in
setting up multimedia trials, but the plan it announced yesterday will have
one novel element: it will combine existing analog cable television services
with more advanced digital video services over a shared network.
The use of analog technology means that customers in the trial area can
choose to subscribe to the cable television service being offered by
BellSouth, rather than their existing cable operator, without having to
acquire the new set-top box required to receive the new interactive digital
services on offer.
Customers will be able to choose between a 60-channel cable television
service and possibly more than 300 digital channels offering services such
as games and movies.
'We believe our proposal represents the fastest, most economical and fairest
way to make these services a reality,' said Mr William Reddersen, a senior
BellSouth executive.
Telephone companies like BellSouth are currently forbidden by law from
providing cable programming within their own local service region. The
company therefore plans to lease the cable channels it is setting up to
Vanguard Cable, a subsidiary of a Texas-based cable company called Prime II
Management. BellSouth is in the process of acquiring a stake in another
Prime subsidiary.
BellSouth has selected Hewlett-Packard, the computer and instrumentation
group, to provide interactive video servers for the field trial. In January,
Pacific Telesis, the California phone company, announced that it had
selected HP's servers for commercial deployment in four California markets.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: General Mills hit by price
cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Mills, the US food manufacturer that escalated competition in the US
breakfast cereal market by slashing its prices from the beginning of May,
yesterday reported a 6 per cent fall in underlying earnings per share in its
fourth quarter ending May 29.
The company put the blame squarely on the price cuts, saying they had
reduced the quarter's earnings by 10 cents a share.
However, it said this was a short-term effect resulting from the need to
compensate retailers for the reduction in shelf prices of existing stocks.
Initial response from consumers and grocery customers to the cuts had been
positive, General Mills said, and earnings per share in the current year
were expected to show good progress. The shares put on Dollars  3/8 to close
at Dollars 55 1/4 .
Recent practice in the US cereals market has been to escalate prices and
then discount them back by offering consumers coupons, half-price deals and
other promotions. In April, General Mills announced it was departing from
this practice by cutting promotional spending by Dollars 175m a year and
passing some of the savings on to consumers through price cuts averaging 11
per cent.
Yesterday it said unit volume of its Big G cereals business was up 9 per
cent in the fourth quarter. Group sales were ahead from Dollars 2.01bn to
Dollars 2.14bn and net income rose from Dollars 67.5m to Dollars 105.5m.
Excluding unusual items in the previous year's fourth quarter, however,
earnings per share fell from 71 cents to 67 cents.
General Mills said the year as a whole had been disappointing because of
escalating promotional activity in the US cereals market.
Sales rose from Dollars 8.13bn to Dollars 8.52bn and net income from Dollars
506.1m to Dollars 556.8m. Excluding unusual items, earnings per share edged
up from Dollars 3.45 to Dollars 3.50.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Giddings &amp; Lewis sees shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Giddings &amp; Lewis, the US machine-tool manufacturer, expects 1994 earnings
per share to be some 20 per cent below Wall Street forecasts.
It blamed the shortfall partly on competitive industry pricing, resulting
from Europe's soft machine tool market.
The company said it expected second-quarter earnings per share to be flat or
slightly above the 20 cents earned in the first quarter, while for the full
year earnings were likely to be 20 per cent below the Dollars 1.35 to
Dollars 1.45 being forecast by analysts.
The company had earnings per share of 34 cents in the second quarter of last
year and Dollars 1.31 in 1993 as a whole.
Mr Joseph Coppola, chairman, said several contracts booked in prior periods
had proved more costly than anticipated.
In addition, competitive pressures meant 1994 gross margins, which the
company had anticipated to be around 24-25 per cent, should instead be in
the 22-23 per cent range - even though the group expected continued growth
in quarterly bookings compared with last year.
The soft market for machine tools in Europe had meant lower bookings there
and also affected worldwide pricing: competitors suffering sharp order
declines overseas were bidding aggressively for contracts in the US,
creating more intense pricing pressure.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Perfect marriage in software
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The richest corporate marriage in the personal computer industry took place
this week as Novell and WordPerfect announced the completion of their
merger.
The deal creates the third-largest software company in the world, behind
Microsoft and Computer Associates which, respectively, occupy the first two
spots.
The newly merged companies had combined annual revenues of Dollars 1.8bn for
1993. Novell will act as the senior partner and the umbrella company for all
existing and future Novell and WordPerfect operations.
The merger, completed on Monday, takes place alongside a parallel deal in
which Novell acquires ailing software maker Borland International's Quattro
Pro spreadsheet business and rights to sell 1m copies of Borland's Paradox
database.
'With Novell and WordPerfect technology, Novell intends to lead the
industry's evolution to network applications - applications that improve our
ability to access networked data, create easily shared information,
collaborate and communicate over the network whether from an at-home office,
on the road or within a global corporation,' says Mr Bob Frankenberg, Novell
president and chief executive officer.
As if to underline its commitment to WordPerfect's importance, Mr
Frankenberg and Mr Adrian Rietveld, former chief executive of WordPerfect
and now president of the new WordPerfect/Novell Applications Group,
yesterday announced the first new product from the 'greater Novell': a suite
of productivity applications known as Perfect Office.
It includes the WordPerfect for Windows word-processing software, the
Quattro Pro spreadsheet and the Paradox database - along with a set of
workgroup computing technologies that Rietveld says will 'change the rules'
about the way such applications are sold.
One of the key elements will be an 'electronic publishing' tool that will
allow all users on a network to 'publish' documents for sharing and allow
others to view documents that have been created with Perfect Office without
having to have the Perfect Office software loaded on their computers.
However, neither Mr Rietveld nor Mr Frankenberg sounded complacent about the
strong competition they face from market leader Microsoft.
Mr Frankenberg readily admits new versions of Microsoft's popular Windows
operating system software - code-named Chicago and Daytona - will offer
strong challenges to Novell. 'It certainly is a threat and I never
underestimate Microsoft's ability to threaten,' he says.
While Mr Frankenberg and Mr Rietveld have declared clear directions for what
Mr Frankenberg calls the 'greater Novell', the two operate in some rather
long shadows.
Mr Frankenberg only recently replaced Novell chairman Mr Ray Noorda in the
president and chief executive's post a few weeks before the March
announcement of the Novell/WordPerfect merger, while Mr Rietveld only took
over from WordPerfect co-founder Mr Alan Ashton as president of that company
in January.
Both former chief executives will still offer advice to the merged company
and Mr Noorda remains chairman, although Mr Frankenberg says that he has
been given the freedom to do things his own way.
The terms of the merger have not changed from the definitive agreement
signed by the companies in March. Novell has exchanged 59m shares of its
stock and options, valued at approximately Dollars 855m, for the outstanding
shares of WordPerfect common stock and stock options. On a fully-diluted
basis, the shares represent about 15 per cent of Novell's shares.
As part of the WordPerfect merger, Novell also completed its purchase of the
Quattro Pro spreadsheet business from Borland for about Dollars 145m.

Developers and institutional investors are circling Cadillac Fairview in the
hope of acquiring the financially-troubled Canadian developer's valuable
assets.
The latest is Cambridge Shopping Centres, another Canadian developer, which
said it had submitted a bid for 'substantially all' CF's assets. Cambridge
declined to provide further details of its proposal, which expires on July
8.
Other bidders are expected to emerge ahead of the June 30 deadline set by CF
for proposals from prospective equity investors.
CF, whose 73 properties include such flagship sites as Toronto's Eaton
Centre and the Pacific Place mall in Vancouver, is restructuring about
CDollars 3bn (USDollars 4bn) of debt. It has already sold some properties.
Mr Frank Mayer, analyst at BBN James Capel in Toronto, said there was 'a
very good chance' of the process culminating in CF's dismemberment.
He noted the company had equity partners in many of its properties with a
right of first refusal and other negotiating privileges. The partners
include Markborough Properties, controlled by the Thomson publishing family,
and Toronto-Dominion Bank, which is CF's partner in the TD Centre in
Toronto, one of Canada's biggest office and shopping complexes.
CF confirmed yesterday that it was considering several proposals 'from
substantial investor groups with the resources to make a significant equity
investment'.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro shake-up urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ontario Hydro, the biggest power utility in North America, urgently needs to
reassess its structure as a government-owned monopoly to cope with growing
competitive and financial pressures, according to a report commissioned by
the utility.
Although the report makes no firm recommendations, its authors, led by
Hydro's chief financial officer, clearly signal their preference for at
least a partial privatisation.
A group of financial advisers, including three US and Canadian investment
banks, concluded that 'the market appetite for an initial issue of Ontario
Hydro equity would be in the order of CDollars 5bn (USDollars 7bn)'. The
offering would include an international component.
However, a final decision on Hydro's future rests with the provincial
government. The left-of-centre New Democratic Party has resisted
privatisation but allowed the utility to proceed with a restructuring which
has already resulted in 7,000 job losses.
The shake-up has been spearheaded by Mr Maurice Strong, who took over as
chairman in late 1992 after a career in diplomacy, which included organising
the Rio summit on the environment.
The report concludes that 'the need for change is urgent and stakeholders
will have to make significant choices soon if the competitiveness of our
electric power industry is to be sustained and if Ontario Hydro's assets are
to retain their value'.
It notes that the Canadian power industry cannot afford to be out of step
with the increasingly competitive climate in the US, where deep discounts
are being offered to industrial customers. Furthermore, a capital infusion
is required to redress the lop-sided balance sheet, which carries CDollars
34bn of debt supported by less than CDollars 4bn of equity.
Unexpectedly slack demand for electricity in recent years has left Hydro
with substantial surplus capacity.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Del Monte Foods, one of the world's largest food processors, is to be
acquired by Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, the Mexican chairman of Del Monte Fresh
Produce, the tropical-fruit trading company, and a group of investors in a
transaction worth about Dollars 1bn.
Mr Cabal and his partners will pay Dollars 277m in cash for Del Monte Foods,
and re-finance about Dollars 700m of debt.
The transaction is set to be finalised by mid-September, with most of the
financing expected to be obtained from a syndicate of international banks.
Del Monte Fresh Produce and Del Monte Foods, owned by a group of investors
including Citibank and Merrill Lynch, used to be part of the Del Monte
company, which was broken up in to four parts and sold off in 1989 by RJR
Nabisco of the US.
Mr Cabal plans to re-merge the two companies, according to an official
familiar with his plans. He will begin working on synergies immediately,
such as in distribution and advertising.
Del Monte Foods is based in San Francisco, although it has operations in
Mexico, Central America and the Philippines. It processes vegetables,
fruits, tomatoes and snack foods, and last year had revenues of Dollars
1.6bn.
Del Monte Fresh Produce, which markets and sells tropical fruit and
vegetables, had revenues of more than Dollars 300m in the first quarter this
year.
A previous attempt by Mr Cabal to buy Del Monte Foods fell through earlier
this year.
Mr Cabal decided to buy Del Monte Foods both to obtain synergies from
merging it with Fresh Produce, and also to give him more control of the Del
Monte brand, according to a spokesman.
'Del Monte has a terrific brand,' said the spokesman 'and he intends to
build on it'.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: US-German deal to create
third-biggest reinsurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Re, the biggest US reinsurance company, has agreed to take indirect
control of Germany's Cologne Re, a move that would create the world's
third-biggest reinsurance grouping.
Cologne Re had premium income of DM4.5bn (Dollars 2.7bn) in 1992, the most
recent figures available, while General Re had premiums of Dollars 2.5bn in
1993. Together, the two would still be smaller than two other European-based
groups, Munich Re and Swiss Re.
General Re described its planned alignment with the German company as an
'association'. However, the deal, which has yet to be finalised, would give
the US company ultimate control.
The plan is for Colonia, the German insurance group, to transfer its 75 per
cent interest in Cologne Re to a new company, which would, in turn, be
majority-owned by General Re. In return, the US reinsurer would pay an
unspecified amount of cash and securities, part of which would be used to
boost Cologne Re's capital.
The proposed deal represents General Re's first big move out of its home
market, where it generates 90 per cent of its premium income. It would make
it one of the biggest companies in international reinsurance.
Rumours about a possible joint venture between Cologne Re and a foreign
company have circulated in Germany since early June. Mr Klaas Kleyboldt,
chief executive at Colonia, confirmed last week that talks were under way.
However, he stressed then that Colonia had no intention of selling its stake
in its reinsurance subsidiary.
The new alliance is consistent with the strategic restructuring of the
Colonia group, which was set in motion by Mr Kleyboldt after the German
group became a majority-owned subsidiary of the French Union des Assurances
de Paris (UAP). France's biggest insurance group took control of Colonia
last October with the aim of challenging Allianz, the Munich-based company,
as Europe's largest insurance group.

Deckel Maho, one of Germany's largest machine tool companies, is on the
verge of declaring itself bankrupt.
Mr Werner Schneider, appointed receiver to the Bavaria-based group after it
filed for protection against creditors in April, said that a formal
application for bankruptcy was the next legal step after it had proved
impossible to work out a solution with creditors to guarantee the group's
survival.
Mr Schneider said, however, that he was hopeful that it would be possible to
rescue the group - which owes banks DM530m (Dollars 325.1m) - through a sale

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Italy hails success of Ina
sell-off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Italian Treasury yesterday proclaimed the privatisation of Ina a
success, and closed the public offer of shares in the Italian insurer three
days ahead of schedule.
More than 400,000 Italian investors were said to have applied for shares.
The issue was more than fully subscribed by Monday night, defying recent
turbulence on Italian and world stock markets.
The Treasury, which is selling 51 per cent of its 100 per cent stake in Ina,
opened the sale on Monday at a price of L2,400 a share. The issue, which
includes an international offer, should raise more than L4,800bn (Dollars
3.1bn) to help cut Italian public debt.
Most Italian newspapers announced yesterday morning that the Ina shares were
'sold out'. This unsettled Ina's advisers, who were afraid that small
shareholders might not bother applying yesterday.
As the first big privatisation by the new government of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the outcome is being carefully watched by investors and
political pundits.
Any hint that it is less successful than preceding bank sell-offs could be
construed as government inability to maintain popular momentum for the much
larger sales expected within the next year. These include Stet, the
telecommunications holding company; Enel, the electricity generator; and
parts of Eni, the energy and chemicals group.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Austria goes cold on complete
sale of bank

<TEXT>
Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the socialist Austrian finance minister, appears to be
backing away from the government's intention to privatise fully
Creditanstalt, the country's second-largest bank.
Mr Lacina yesterday described as 'absurd and immoral' a proposal that would
see half of the government's 70 per cent voting stake sold in a secondary
offering.
The proposal came last month from a consortium of Austrian, Italian and
German interests led by the insurance group EA Generali and First Austrian
Bank.
The consortium has offered some Sch7.5bn (Dollars 676m) to buy half the
government's shares, provided the state agrees to its proposal to underwrite
a placement of the rest in the near future.
'It is as if a tenant of two rooms in a five-room flat wanted to forbid the
landlord from continuing to live in the remaining three rooms,' Mr Lacina
said. 'There is no five-room flat for rent,' he concluded.
The minister also poured cold water on the bid for Creditanstalt from CS
Holding of Switzerland.
CS, the financial group built around Credit Suisse, has said it sees the
purchase of a 20-25 per cent stake in Creditanstalt as merely a first step
towards obtaining outright control and, ideally, 100 per cent of the bank.
Mr Lacina said he had made clear to Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, that a
majority takeover by foreign interests was out of the question 'at the
present time'.
CS declined to comment on Mr Lacina's remarks.
Austrian bankers were startled by the imagery used by Mr Lacina yesterday,
which suggested he was reinstating the government's phony privatisation
policy of the late 1980s. During that period, minority shares in state
assets were often placed or floated, but the government always retained
control.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Opel head blames industry woes
for DM503m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Herman, chief executive of Adam Opel, blamed 'the worst year in the
automobile industry in a decade' for a loss of DM503m (Dollars 320.4m) at
General Motors' German subsidiary last year.
The loss, which followed a net profit of DM259m in 1992, was likely to be
followed by a 'dramatic improvement' during the current year, the chief
executive said.
Mr Herman declined to expand on this, saying there were a number of
uncertainties ahead. 'We don't know how quickly Germany can free itself from
recession,' he said.
Opel had returned to profitability in the first six months of the year, said
Mr Gail Gunderson, finance director. However, he warned that it was unlikely
to make a profit in the year as a whole.
Market share of new cars registered in Germany in the first five months of
1994 was down by 1 per cent to 15.6 per cent. Mr Herman blamed this on poor
availability of the new Omega model early in the year, and predicted that
market share would be back to 17 per cent by the year-end. The Omega alone
was expected to win a 3 per cent market share.
The depth of the downturn last year was reflected in a 21 per cent fall in
the number of Opel cars registered in Germany, from 671,000 to 530,000, a
decline which translated into a drop in market share from 17.1 to 16.6 per
cent. Turnover for the German operations was down from DM29.1bn to DM21bn
last year, a 21 per cent fall.
The results were hit by a DM360m loss on currency translation, and a charge
of DM370m to cover early retirement and other rationalisation measures.
There were further, unspecified costs associated with the change to
production of the new Omega and Corsa models.
The losses at Opel in Germany helped hold down profits at the Opel/Vauxhall
group in Europe, to just under DM1bn, Mr Herman said yesterday. General
Motors is the overall market leader in Europe with a 12.5 per cent share.
Mr Herman said that between January and May this year, Opel's market share
had risen in 11 European countries.
He declined to give details on the state of litigation in the case of Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former General Motors director who
joined rival Volkswagen last year. Mr Herman confirmed that the US Justice
Ministry had lodged a formal request for judicial help with its Bonn
counterpart. He also cast doubt on a report compiled by the KPMG accountancy
firm exonerating Mr Lopez from being in possession of confidential material
belonging to General Motors, as GM alleges.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Siemens sells pacemaker unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, the Munich-based electronics and electricals group, is selling its
US-based cardiac pacemaker manufacturing business for 'slightly over'
Dollars 500m. The buyer is St Jude Medical, a manufacturer of artificial
heart valves and blood pumps based in St Paul, Minnesota.
The pacemaker business generated Dollars 350m in turnover for Siemens last
year. Siemens said the sale was driven by strategic considerations, in view
of changes in the market for products implanted during heart surgery,
including artificial blood vessels, valves, heart muscle pumps and
artificial hearts.
Physicians and hospitals had previously bought individual products from
different companies, but there was now a trend towards 'single-sourcing',
Siemens said.
This trend was encouraging the development of companies providing the full
spectrum of products.
Siemens supplies a range of products to cardiologists, but its activities in
the field of cardiac systems for implantation are limited to pacemakers.
It said yesterday it had decided to sell the business - the second biggest
manufacturer of pacemakers in the world - rather than seek to expand across
the full range of implantation products.
Siemens is the world's largest manufacturer of medical systems, with total
sales of DM7.9bn (Dollars 5.03bn) in this area last year. It said the
pacemaker business was profitable, and that sales had risen consistently in
recent years.
A total of 1,300 employees will move to St Jude as a result of the sale.
The sale will take effect in the fourth quarter of Siemens' current
financial year, which ends on September 30.

FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Endesa lifts regional interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Endesa, the partly-privatised Spanish electrical utility, has increased its
stake in the southern power company, Sevillana de Electricidad, and agreed
to buy Sevillana assets valued at Pta56.06bn (Dollars 433m).
The moves, the result of several months of negotiation, represent the latest
stage in a far-reaching reorganisation of the Spanish electrical sector.
Endesa, in which the state still holds 65 per cent, is to buy a further 5.9
per cent interest in Sevillana from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, raising its stake
from 33.5 to 39.4 per cent.
It has left open the possibility of a further increase. The deal will reduce
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya's stake to 4.1 per cent.
Mr Feliciano Fuster, Endesa chairman, said the company would take a more
active role in managing Sevillana.
The asset sale, which includes Sevillana's half-share in Eneco, a
jointly-owned electricity company in Cordoba, will help Sevillana to offset
debts related to mothballed nuclear power facilities.
Under a draft law for the electricity industry presented earlier this month,
the government is to write off Pta730bn of debt accumulated since it put the
brakes on nuclear power plans 10 years ago and halted construction of five
power stations.
However, the government plan covers only Pta170bn of the Pta258bn figure on
Sevillana's books with respect to its investment in the unfinished
Valdecaballeros power station in south-western Spain, in which it has a 50
per cent share. This leaves some Pta88bn of unrecognised debt.
The latest sale will enable Sevillana to post capital gains of Pta35bn, as
well as Pta9bn of gains from asset swaps agreed at the end of last year.
Mr Fernando de Ybarra, Sevillana chairman, said the agreement with Endesa
provided a 'definitive solution' for the problems created by the nuclear
freeze.
The company would from now on have a healthy balance sheet, he said.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Restructure helps Allied Radio cut loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Radio, which operates the licences for Radio Mercury and Mercury
Extra in the south-east, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 901,000 to Pounds
364,000 in the six months to March 31.
Mr Brian Rowbotham, chairman, said the improvement followed the successful
capital restructuring, resolved at general meetings and now subject only to
formal approval of the Scottish court. An underwritten rights issue closed
in May with 46 per cent taken up.
An 11 per cent dip in turnover on continuing operations to Pounds 1.34m was
anticipated at the time of the restructuring which Mr Rowbotham said
reflected the new management's policy of restricting advertising minutage in
order to improve audience figures, while increasing spot yield rates to
advertisers.
This strategy had resulted, as budgeted, in revenue in the short term being
reduced until the full increase in rates began to take full effect, he
added.
The chairman said he was confident revenue would accelerate as higher yields
were obtained in a more buoyant market, and Allied's broad base of
advertisers responded to improved programming and promotion.
Losses per share before reconstruction were 0.8p (2.01p) or 0.3p after, on a
pro forma basis.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Strong export growth behind Halma's 20%
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong export performance continued to benefit Halma as the safety and
environmental technology group increased annual pre-tax profits by 20 per
cent to Pounds 25.1m.
Sales rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 135.3m in the year to April 2 with
overseas sales representing a record 55 per cent of the total - up from 48
per cent last time.
Mr David Barber, chairman, said: 'Within the period under review there was
little evidence of growth in our key European markets and, in the absence of
such assistance, the very satisfactory progress actually achieved by the
group stemmed substantially from our own efforts.'
Profit as a percentage of sales increased from 18 per cent to 18.5 per cent
and overall return on capital employed was maintained at 45 per cent.
Net cash increased from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 9.9m in spite of capital
expenditure of Pounds 6.8m and a further Pounds 5.8m spent on businesses
acquired for cash.
During the last 15 months, eight companies or businesses were acquired.
A number of smaller businesses were purchased and have now been integrated
within other group companies.
Halma said all of the acquired companies or businesses had continued to
trade very satisfactorily.
Mr Barber said the group's most successful activities continued to be in
fire and gas detection, water treatment and in electronic safety devices for
lift doors.
Despite the generally unhelpful trading conditions, 17 of the group's 48
operating companies were able to establish new profit records during the
period.
Mr Barber said: 'The group has weathered the last three years of economic
difficulty with relatively little adverse impact on its growth pattern.
'Since it now seems probable that the current year will offer a somewhat
better operating climate in a number of our key markets, I believe that
further successful progress can be confidently anticipated.'
Earnings per share increased by 14 per cent to 8.52p (7.45p).
A recommended final dividend of 1.44p gives a total of 2.373p (1.977p) for
the year, an increase of 20 per cent.
COMMENT
Halma continues to match and even exceed the high expectations caused by its
impressive track record to date, hence yesterday's share price increase from
204p to 210p. The group continues to grow both organically and by small
bolt-on acquisitions. The increase in cash may partly indicate a scarcity of
good enough acquisitions opportunities; Mr Barber will only buy businesses
that will not dilute the group's impressive return on capital. All this
quality comes at a price, and forecast earnings of nearly Pounds 30m put the
shares on a prospective multiple of 21 - a 50 per cent premium to the
market. The shares cannot be described as cheap at this level, but their
rating premium has fallen compared to other engineering stocks where
recovery has been factored in - but which might prove far less able to
exploit resumed growth.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hunters Armley rises 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment in production facilities helped Hunters Armley, the web offset
commercial printing company, push pre-tax profits up by 28 per cent in the
six months to March 31.
Sales improved 21 per cent to Pounds 19.8m
Operating profits rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 1.5m and after a net
interest charge of Pounds 251,000 (Pounds 172,000), pre-tax profits stood at
Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 973,000).
A 1-for-4 rights issue in May, which raised Pounds 9.4m, helped reduce
gearing which stood at 84 per cent, on net debt of Pounds 6.28m at the half
year.
Following capital expenditure of Pounds 1.16m in the first half, the company
plans to spend Pounds 5.6m over the next nine months, mainly on completing
the second phase of a printing facility in Bradford.
Mr David Bird, chairman, said the Bradford plant, which houses the latest in
web offset, sheetfed presses and finishing equipment, had contributed
significantly to improved sales and operating margins.
He added that the development of pre-press facilities had enabled the
company to improve product quality and win new customers. Further investment
in artwork and graphic reproduction was planned.
'The development of the production facilities means we are as well placed as
any other in the industry to take advantage of the pick up in the market,'
he said.
An interim dividend of 1.32p (1.25p) is declared on improved earnings per
share of 3.99p (3.15p).
Yesterday the shares closed up 7p at 170p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, one of the few quoted estate
agents and chartered surveyors specialising in commercial property, rose by
44 per cent, from Pounds 2.86m to Pounds 4.12m during the 12 months to April
30.
The company also announced that Mr Anthony Turnbull intends to step down as
chief executive at the beginning of next year. Mr Mark Struckett, currently
managing director of the company's London operations, becomes group managing
director.
Turnover rose 40 per cent to Pounds 57.6m (Pounds 41m). Earnings per share
rose to 6.17p (5.13p) and the final dividend is increased to 2p for a total
of 3.5p (3p).
The company, which last year merged with Bernard Thorpe, has expanded its
regional network as well as increasing international operations. Mr Richard
Lay, chairman, said that the results showed that the policies were starting
to bear fruit.
On the general state of the commercial property market, he said: 'We have
seen a reversal in the trends of previous years and a significant recovery
in the capital values of commercial investment property as yields have
fallen to reflect the reduction in short term interest rates.
'However, we have not yet seen any return to growth in rental values across
the country and until this does occur we shall not enjoy a sustainable
recovery in our markets.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Panther Resources to join market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Perloff is making another attempt to gain full control of
Etonbrook Properties and merge it with his Panther Securities.
The move was revealed at the same time as the announcement that Panther, a
property investment group, was coming to the market in a placing of 1.96m
shares at 90p to raise a net Pounds 1.39m. Every five shares will have one
warrant attached.
Panther will be acquiring Mr Perloff's 30.7 per cent holding in Etonbrook
for shares, taking its holding to 54.04 per cent of the ordinary shares, but
only 42.33 per cent of the voting capital.
It is intended to make an offer for the outstanding shares on the basis of
five Panther shares plus one warrant for every five Etonbrook. Etonbrook's
shares were unchanged at 106p yesterday.
Mr Perloff said the moves were intended to tidy up the situation giving
shareholders in Etonbrook the opportunity to be part of a larger company
which could pay dividends immediately.
He added that when he made the cash offer last year many people had not
accepted because they wanted to stay with the new board, made up of Panther
directors. The new offer would allow them to do so.
Following the flotation and acquisition, Panther will have pro-forma net
assets of Pounds 17m or 97p per share.
The placing values the company at Pounds 15.8m.
Mr Perloff and Mr Malcolm Bloch will hold a beneficial interest in 29.9 per
cent, while Portnard, which is controlled by three trusts the beneficiaries
of which include Mr Perloff and Mr Bloch, will hold 44.1 per cent.
Over the period from the end of 1979 to the end of 1993 net assets have
improved from Pounds 202,000 to Pounds 13.9m or 96p per share.
It has a portfolio of 62 commercial properties of which 80 per cent are in
the retail sector and 69 per cent in London and the south-east of England.
Shares are expected to begin trading in late July.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Clinton shares fall on profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Clinton Cards fell sharply yesterday after the specialist retailer
warned that profits were unlikely to exceed last year's Pounds 3m.
The group, which claims 7 per cent of the UK greetings card market, also
said that its seasonal loss for the first half to end-July would be
'significantly higher than last year's Pounds 1m.'
An interim deficit is normal, as the chain is dependent on Christmas
trading.
The shares lost 31p to close at 105p.
Sales in the core business of cards and wrapping paper had been flat, the
group said. However, sales of gift products and ancillary lines have been
significantly below last year. Mr Barry Hartog, finance director, put this
down to a lack of fresh products based on popular characters such as
Garfield and Mr Blobby.
Like for like sales have fallen by 4 per cent, although overall sales have
risen 3 per cent on the back of an increase in the number of outlets. The
group is now trading from 279 shops, compared with 273 last year, and
further branches are planned.
In March the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.02m on sales of
Pounds 75.9m, ex-VAT, up from Pounds 2.3m on sales of Pounds 68.2m. At the
time Mr Don Lewin, chairman, said that consumer confidence seemed to be
'rather fragile, fuelled perhaps by worries about personal tax increases'.

Sales for the first 20 weeks of the current year at Sears were up 5 per cent
on a like-for-like basis and 6 per cent overall against last year, Mr
Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, told the annual meeting.
Difficult trading conditions in children's wear and sports and leisure were
balanced by solid trading at British Shoe and Home Shopping and particularly
strong performances from Selfridges and women's wear.
The new concepts all continued to perform well.

<TEXT>
In a year of change, Wilton Group, the USM-quoted cinema and television
group, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.54m, against Pounds 7.45m.
The comparable figure was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 6.56m
relating to discontinued activities against a net charge of Pounds 284,000.
Net interest payable fell to Pounds 284,000 (Pounds 1.41m).
Turnover for 1993 was Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 30.5m) including Pounds 8.4m
(Pounds 29.6m) from discontinued activities. Losses per share came out at
0.16p (1.22p).
The discontinued activities mainly relate to the halving of the holding in
Glenchewton, the wholesaler, which is now treated as an associate.
It now has interests in the creation of a cinema chain in south-east Asia
and a Chinese language television channel. It is proposing to change its
name to Pacific Media.

from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 81.1m in the year ended March 31 1994.
Sir Mark's Pounds 224,000 increase accounted for almost one quarter of the

1m to Pounds 4.7m. However, Lord Rothschild, the other joint chairman, took

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Granada Group yesterday moved to unite the two television advertising sales
houses brought under one roof when the company acquired London Weekend
Television.
The Time Exchange - a joint venture with Scottish Television and Laser, the
old LWT company - will be replaced by a new operation to be known as Laser.
It will sell the airtime of Granada, LWT, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and Border
Television - a total of just under 25 per cent of all UK television
advertising, the maximum permitted.
Mr Mick Desmond, currently managing director of The Time Exchange will be
chief executive of the new company, which will begin operations on September
1.
Granada said yesterday it would be the biggest television advertising sales
house in the UK. Significant benefit is expected from the savings that will
flow from putting the two together and from Laser's extra clout in the
market.
Mr Ron Miller, chief executive of Laser Sales, will leave at the end of
July. He was offered, but declined, the chairmanship of the new sales house
saying he did not wish to take on such a workload at this stage in his
career. Mr Miller, who is 58, made some Pounds 9m from the LWT management
share scheme.
The Time Exchange will be eventually wound up and Scottish is already in
negotiations to join another sales house.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Lowndes Lambert advances 28% to
Pounds 13.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lowndes Lambert, the insurance broker, yesterday announced the acquisition
for Pounds 4.65m of WHH, a rival company based in Preston, Lancashire.
The announcement accompanied the group's results for the 12 months to March
31, showing a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.2m.
Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 31.7p (28p). A proposed final
dividend of 10p makes 15p (13.5p) for the year - an increase of 11 per cent.
The acquisition strengthens the group's position in the provincial UK
market, where it believes many medium-sized commercial companies are
becoming increasingly interested in the kind of risk management and
assessment services offered by Lowndes.
Lowndes said it had first made contact with WHH four months ago. The
company, which has offices in Leeds, Preston, Birmingham and Maidstone and
also owns Watts Watts, a Lloyd's broker, generated some Pounds 4m of income
in 1993.
The deal was financed through a vendor placing of 1.09m new ordinary shares
at 381 1/2 p, raising Pounds 4.15m, plus 132,370 shares to be retained by
vendors.
Lowndes reported that its brokerage income increased from Pounds 53.7m to

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: McInerney losses rise to IPounds 8.5m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Losses at McInerney Prop-erties, the Dublin-based housebuilder and property
group, increased from IPounds 2.65m to IPounds 8.51m (Pounds 8.4m) during
the 1993 year.
Poor trading conditions in its leisure property division and the loss on the
disposal of a Portuguese resort were blamed for the higher than expected
deficit. The disposal cost, including associated trading losses, was IPounds
2.71m.
Trading losses rose from IPounds 1.03m to IPounds 5.41m on turnover of
IPounds 31.6m (IPounds 32.9m), of which continuing operations accounted for
Pounds 27.9m (Pounds 28.2m). Losses per A share were 13.9p (6.2p); fully
diluted the deficit was 6.6p (2.7p).
The deficit on shareholders' funds rose from Pounds 715,000 to Pounds 8.29m
at the year end. The group said it retained the support of its bankers but
was seeking an equity injection or the formation of a strategic alliance.
Prospects were improving this year. The Irish housing market was enjoying
strong sales reservations, which should result in increased completions in
the second half of the year. Sales at Four Seasons Fairways, a Portuguese
leisure development, were above target.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Berkeley jumps to Pounds 39.5m - Company
dampens fears over a recent serious decline in UK housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears of a serious decline in the UK housing market since the spring have
been overstated according to Berkeley Group, the housebuilder which
yesterday announced pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 15.8m to
Pounds 39.5m during the 12 months to April 30.
Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, said: 'The alarm expressed about a
faltering market has been exaggerated as far as we are concerned.
'We had a very good May. Although sales were down 10 per cent in June
compared with the previous month, prices of new homes have moved ahead and
could increase by 2 or 3 per cent this year. Our markets, far from being
fragile, remain solid.'
The company, which specialises in building executive homes and is strongly
represented in central London and south-east England, doubled its size
during the recession after selling many of its development sites in 1989,
before land prices collapsed.
Mr Pidgley yesterday criticised rival housebuilders for again chasing up
land prices which, he estimated, had risen by an average of 50 per cent
across the country during the past 12 months.
'Sites in Surrey which were selling at an average of Pounds 400,000 an acre
last year are now costing more than Pounds 600,000. Around Warwick, sites
which were costing Pounds 220,000 are now selling at more than Pounds
400,000 an acre.
'I cannot see that house prices are going to rise sufficiently in the next
few years to justify these costs,' said Mr Pidgley.
Upward pressure on land prices has come from construction companies which
have raised large sums from rights issues during the past 12 months and are
looking to expand house building operations.
He was more sanguine about the current state of house sales. 'We have gone
from the boom of the late 1980s through the recession; this is more like a
normal market and people have forgotten what that is like. Sales typically
dip at this time of year. I would be more concerned if this was happening in
September and October when sales traditionally pick up.'
Group turnover last year rose from Pounds 182m to Pounds 228.1m. Trading
profits, almost entirely from housebuilding, increased by 81 per cent to
Pounds 28.6m (Pounds 15.8m). The number of homes sold rose from 1,226 to
1,404 with average prices increasing from Pounds 149,000 to Pounds 162,000.
Profits were further assisted by a Pounds 10.9m windfall gain from
Berkeley's share of profits from the sale of commercial properties, mostly
out of town retail developments and a large distribution centre.
Earnings per share, excluding property profits, rose 51 per cent from 16p to
24.1p. The final dividend is increased to 5.1p, making a total of 7p (6p).
COMMENT
The views of Berkeley's chief executive may say more about the superior
quality of his business than put to rest concerns about the current fragile
state of the housing market. To increase earnings per share so sharply in a
rights issue year is no mean feat. The company owns or controls 5,500
development plots so has no need to chase high land prices; net margins rose
from 9 per cent to 12.5 per cent last year and the balance sheet currently
boasts net cash of Pounds 11.5m. Pre-tax profits approaching Pounds 40m this
year and Pounds 46m in 1995-96 - excluding commercial property sales - would
put the shares on a prospective p/e, two years out, of under 10 which looks
a little cheap, given the quality of the company's businesses and its recent
record.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, has signed a deal with the
government of Belarus giving it exclusive negotiating rights for nine months
to become a strategic partner in the privatisation of the state
telecommunications company of the former Soviet republic.
If successful, the deal could lead to C&amp;W taking a large minority stake in
the state company, in return for upgrading Belarus's antiquated telecoms
network.
C&amp;W has significant interests in the Baltic region, including minority
stakes in the Latvian state telecommunications company and in Tele2, the
main competitor to the Swedish state telecommunications operator.

Sutcliffe Speakman continued its recovery in the second half and for the
full year to end-March swung from losses of Pounds 6.56m to profits of
Pounds 1.1m pre-tax.
All arrears of preference dividends will be paid on July 28 and ordinary
dividends are resumed via a proposed 0.5p payment.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.51p compared with previous losses of 19.02p.
Turnover of continuing activities improved from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds
22.6m. The Lancashire-based group is engaged in activated carbon technology
and environmental protection systems. There was a further Pounds 839,000
(Pounds 7.72m) from discontinued activities.
Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, said the progress made marks the end of a
transitional stage in the group's recovery. He will stand down as chairman
at the annual meeting in July and be succeeded by Mr Earnest Tyerman, a
non-executive member of the board since 1991.
Mr Buckley said the balance sheet at end-March showed a significant change
brought about by the rights issue and related refinancing agreements in July
1993.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Gardner Merchant makes Dollars 100m
acquisition in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gardner Merchant, the largest contract caterer in Europe, yesterday doubled
the size of its business in the US with a Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) deal to
buy part of Morrison Restaurants' contract food division.
The deal will make Gardner Merchant the fifth biggest contract caterer in
the US. But it will remain behind Compass Group, which in April paid Dollars
450m for Canteen Corporation, the US number three.
Gardner is acquiring the business and industry and education divisions of
Morrison's Hospitality Group, which each operate more than 200 contracts. Mr
Bob Cotton, director of corporate affairs, said that in 1993-94 the two
divisions had turnover of about Dollars 225m and operating profits in the
region of Dollars 10m.
The acquisition would take the group into 40 states, up from the present 18,
and the number of US employees would rise from 5,500 to 13,000. US turnover
would rise from Dollars 180m to Dollars 400m, accounting for 25 per cent of
total group turnover.
Gardner, which was bought by its management from Forte for Pounds 402m at
the end of 1992, will be financing the deal through increased bank debt,
which will rise to about Pounds 225m.
Last April the group reported annual profits before interest and tax of
Pounds 46.9m on sales of Pounds 1.02bn. Strong cashflow had enabled it to
cut senior debt from Pounds 200m to Pounds 163m.
Mr Cotton said the group had been in the US for 15 years, but it remained
concentrated in the business and industry markets in the north-east states.
The deal will expand its share of the business and industry markets into the
southern states, and at the same time take the company into the education
market across the US for the first time.
'We have found the economies of the southern states are growing faster than
the north-east,' said Mr Cotton. 'At the same time, margins are better in
the education sector, where you can cater for 20,000 to 25,000 on a campus.'
Morrison Restaurants, which is listed in New York, said it was selling the
contract catering businesses because it was a small force on a large playing
field, and was 'not likely to achieve dominance in the category'.
It was seeking to invest in high growth businesses where it could attain a
dominant market position.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Midlands Electricity at top endof City
forecasts with Pounds 195m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midlands Electricity yesterday reported pre-tax profits at the top end of
City forecasts for the 12 months ended March 31.
On turnover slightly lower at Pounds 1.42bn (Pounds 1.54bn) the pre-tax
figure rose from Pounds 167.1m to Pounds 195.4m.
The performance was helped by a 2.7 per cent increase in units distributed,
double the average national increase, and a reduction in the staff of its
regulated businesses by 424 people, or 7.5 per cent of the total.
The regulated distribution business turned in profits of Pounds 142m (Pounds
144.3m) after Pounds 20.8m of restructuring costs. The supply business
reported profits of Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 18.8m) after a Pounds 4.2m charge.
Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman, said he expected the review of the recs'
distribution to be tough and he could not forecast what dividends the
company could pay out in future years.
The company swung from net debt of Pounds 6m in March 1993 to net cash of
Pounds 167.3m at the latest year end. Unlike most other recs it owes no
money to the government.
Earnings per share rose to 65.2p (55.8p) and a final dividend of 15.55p
lifts the total by 16 per cent to 23.2p.
The company will seek shareholder approval at its annual meeting to buy back
up to 10 per cent of its own shares.
COMMENT
Shareholders might have been surprised at a Pounds 2m fall in distribution
profits to Pounds 142m but there is no need for alarm. Midlands is one of
the few companies which has chosen not to collect its full entitlement from
consumers under the price controls. That means there is a Pounds 10.8m
under-recovery in distribution, rising to perhaps double that by the end of
this year. If things get nasty with the regulator, Midlands could claw that
back. Similarly, the supply under-recovery is likely to be about Pounds 15m
by the year-end. The Pounds 195m headline profit is also depressed by the
decision to make a Pounds 25m provision for restructuring costs. In
addition, the company has Pounds 12.5m salted away to cope with potential
problems over pensions which may never be needed. The market is perhaps a
little nervous about Midlands' expansion abroad and about the effect of the
regulatory review on the sector. But the shares, up 23p to 575p yesterday,
are trading on a prospective yield of 5.8 per cent assuming a dividend of
26.4p this year, and look underpriced compared to other regional companies.

FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Boots plans European purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday revealed it was
planning a series of acquisitions on mainland Europe to bolster its
ambitions in the European over-the-counter non-prescription medicines
market.
Mr Barry Clare, managing director of Boots Healthcare International, the
group's OTC division, said Boots was looking to build its businesses in
France, Italy and Spain in the coming years, possibly through acquisition.
It also plans to acquire a business in Germany, where Boots has no presence.
'We've already quite an extensive European network - in fact we think we're
three years ahead of the opposition in our strategic thinking - but we've
still got some gaps to fill,' said Mr Clare.
Mr David Thompson, group finance director, said: 'OTC will be one of the
main engines of growth for Boots in the coming years.' He claimed that
typical margins in the OTC business were about 15 per cent.
Boots' OTC division has not achieved that - last year it generated profits
of only Pounds 6.6m on sales of Pounds 155.3m. However, Mr Thompson said
that was because the company was investing heavily in the division.
The company hopes to use its distribution and regulatory skills to create
pan-European brands, repeating the success of products such as Strepsils,
the cough and cold product.
By doing so, Boots hopes to compete effectively in the rapidly growing
European OTC market. 'The market is expanding fast both in the UK and on the
Continent and that rate of growth could accelerate.
The company estimates the OTC market was worth about Pounds 8.1bn in 1992
and could reach Pounds 12bn by the end of the decade.
The OTC market is being driven by cash-strapped governments. These are
encouraging the switch of prescription only products to OTC status. In
effect, the patient, rather than the healthcare system, pays for the
medicine.
The large number of drugs losing patent protection over the next few years
would mean there was a large number of candidates for such switches,
explained Mr Clare.
Although Boots was only number 12 in the European OTC market, the sector
remained highly fragmented with the top 12 groups accounting for only 25 per
cent of the market. There would be rapid consolidation, said Mr Clare.
Boots also hoped to obtain new products from pharmaceuticals companies whose
prescription drugs are soon scheduled to lose their patent protection.
'We are talking to two companies about products in our core product areas
(skincare, analgesics, cough/cold, eyecare). One approached us, and the
other we went to twice, before the group came back to us,' said Mr Clare. He
refused to say which companies or which therapeutic areas were involved.

FT  29 JUN 94 / BOC finance director moves to Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Clubb, BOC's finance director, yesterday resigned to become
non-executive chairman of Tiphook, the debt-laden transport leasing group.
The decision surprised analysts and institutional investors. 'After the
departure of chairman Pat Rich earlier this year, this is rather unsettling.
There have been a few too many changes,' said one analyst.
The industrial gases and healthcare group said Mr Clubb, 53, had resigned.
'There is no question that he has been pushed. He wanted a change of
life-style, away from executive to non-executive,' said Mr Christopher
Marsay, BOC's investor relations manager.
'There will still be plenty of continuity at BOC. Mr Clubb will still be
available to us as a consultant, and the heads of our three divisions remain
in place.'
Mr Clubb, who joined the company from British Satellite Broadcasting in
1991, will leave at the end of September. A successor had not been
appointed, and was likely to be found outside the company, said Mr Marsay.
Mr Rich resigned as chairman in April for reasons of ill health. He was
replaced - in a non-executive role - by BOC's former chairman, Mr Richard
Giordano, who had stepped down only two years earlier. Mr Giordano is also
non-executive chairman of British Gas.
Mr Alexander 'Pat' Dyer, 61, former executive with Air Products, the US
industrial gases group, took over the role of chief executive from Mr Rich
last year. Analysts speculated yesterday that Mr Dyer might have clashed
with Mr Clubb.
Mr Clubb will succeed Mr Rupert Hambro as chairman of Tiphook after the
company's annual general meeting, which is expected in September. Mr Hambro
will remain on the board as a non-executive director. Mr Hambro, who joined
Tiphook in 1990, took over as temporary as chairman in March, after Mr
Robert Montague, the group's controversial founder, stepped down but
remained chief executive.
Tiphook escaped liquidation in March by selling its biggest asset, its
container business, to Transamerica, the US financial services group, for an
initial Pounds 673m. Tiphook still has debts of about Pounds 500m.
Mr Hambro said: 'Ian Clubb's wide financial experience will add much, in
particular, to the strengthening of the group's financial disciplines.
'With the sale of the container business behind us, the company is now
making some headway. The management continues to concentrate on reducing
costs, maximising cash flows and winning new business.'
BOC shares closed down 10p at 683p. Tiphook's rose 2p to 51p.

FT  29 JUN 94 / GM reshuffles top management: Jack Smith to concentrate on
strategy - Wagoner strong contender for senior job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors yesterday announced a big reshuffle of top management. The
shake-up includes the promotion of Mr Richard Wagoner, its 41-year-old chief
financial officer, to run its troubled North American vehicle operations in
place of Mr Jack Smith, GM's chief executive, who will now concentrate on
group strategy.
The company also announced it was separating its automotive components
group, which supplies GM and other car manufacturers, from the North
American vehicle operations, so that the parts business could focus more on
global expansion. The unit will continue to be headed by 51-year-old Mr J.
T. Battenberg III, who has run it for the past two years. He said yesterday
the components business faced extremely tough global competition, but also
big opportunities in regions such as Latin America Asia/Pacific.
The shake-up is the biggest since the autumn of 1992 when the GM board,
alarmed at severe losses in North America, forced the resignation of the
then chairman and chief executive, Mr Robert Stempel, and replaced him as
chief executive with Mr Smith, who had been battling to turn around the US
operations.
Mr Smith's relinquishment of his North American responsibilities underlines
the improved financial performance of this core GM business, which is
expected to return to the black this year.
However, the unit is still a long way from generating strong results.
Obstacles include poor manufacturing productivity and a model line-up with
considerable weaknesses.
Mr Wagoner's elevation puts him among the leading contenders to succeed
56-year-old Mr Smith as group president and chief executive, but his chances
will depend on his success in North America over the next few years.
His background includes periods as GM's vice-president for finance in Europe
and running the group's Brazilian operations.
Another possible contender for leadership of the group, 45-year-old Mr Louis
Hughes, will continue in his current post as president of GM Europe and
executive vice-president in charge of international operations.
Yesterday's shake-up was prompted in part by the impending retirement of Mr
William Hoglund, 59, head of corporate affairs and a key adviser to Mr
Smith.
Mr Wagoner will be succeeded as chief financial officer by Mr Michael Losh,
48, currently in charge of North American vehicle sales and marketing. Mr
Harry Pearce, GM's 51-year-old general counsel, will hand over that job to
Mr Thomas Gottschalk, and take on additional executive responsibilities.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Swings, roundabouts and the World Index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the midst of the gloom about the plunging share prices of 1994 it is
important to bear in mind one easily overlooked fact: the FT-Actuaries World
Index has climbed by some 3 per cent in the first half of the year.
Admittedly, that gain is glamorised by being stated in terms of the dollar,
a weak currency this year, and the local currency version of the index has
indeed fallen - but only by 2 per cent. However you look at it (at worst, a
fall of 8 per cent in terms of the yen) it scarcely amounts to a serious
bear market.
For typical global portfolio managers, however, the picture is considerably
worse. In a reversal of the profitable 1993 pattern, the dominant markets
this time have been the two big ones, Tokyo and New York. The Japanese
market is well up, the American one only slightly down (by 4 per cent
according to the FT-Actuaries series, and only by 2 per cent on the basis of
the narrowly based Dow Jones Industrial Average).
These two big steady markets account respectively for 31 and 35 per cent of
the total world index capitalisation. But the other 34 per cent does not
look so good, with on average a fall of 13 per cent. Within that, fallen
stars such as Hong Kong and Malaysia are off by about a quarter this year
and many of the European markets are down by 10-15 per cent in local
currencies.
For global managers who were successfully chasing the hot markets last year
this is all very inconvenient. UK pension funds, for instance, which own
non-UK equities worth some Dollars 170bn, were running only half the index
weightings in the US and Japan at the end of last year, according to the WM
Company, the performance measurement consultants. They had double the index
weighting in continental Europe and triple the weighting in the then
fashionable, but subsequently dangerous, Pacific basin markets (excluding
Japan). The Pacific ex Japan index has fallen by 22 per cent this year,
expressed in terms of sterling.
In calendar 1993 the average UK pension fund's overseas equity portfolio
outperformed the World ex UK index by an extraordinary 14 percentage points.
But the strategy was extremely risky and it looks as though 5 points have
been given straight back again in underperformance so far this year. The
pendulum swings quickly these days.
However, fund managers have been scrambling to rebalance their positions.
According to end-March data, about 1 per cent of UK pension fund portfolios
had been shifted out of the Pacific basin into Japan by that time. But part
of that shift can be explained simply by the impact of relative price
movements on unchanged portfolios; and the heavy exposure to underperforming
Europe apparently remains entirely intact.
The turnaround highlights the dangers of a volatile global market in which
individual country indices are pushed and pulled by huge portfolio flows.
This year's Japanese strength, after all, has been fuelled by foreign
buying.
All the same, the overall resistance of the global stock market in 1994 so
far is quite impressive, given the universal weakness of the bond markets:
even in Japan 10-year government bond yields are up by 120 basis points this
year, and the rise in other countries has often been more than 200 basis
points.
In fact, Roger Nightingale, global strategist at W. I. Carr,is currently
arguing that the overall stability of equities is an indication that
fashionable theories about a global liquidity crunch or capital shortage are
misplaced: there is only the unwinding of last year's speculative excesses.
However, a time lag between the responses of bonds and equities to cyclical
changes is quite normal: in several major countries equities are being
supported by expectations of rising corporate earnings, offsetting the
impact of the rising level of real interest rates.
It remains very possible that the retreat towards safety that has dominated
international equity patterns this year will fail to continue to sustain the
two big national markets as the global economic cycle continues to swing
upwards.
Meanwhile, global managers will conclude that their tactical switching must
be much more active if they are to retain the transitory gains from their
aggressive strategies.

FT  29 JUN 94 / GRT joins rush to consolidate bus sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consolidation of the UK bus industry continues at high speed. GRT, the
Aberdeen-based bus group which came to the market last month, yesterday made
a recommended offer of Pounds 6.7m for Eastern Counties, the company which
serves the Norwich area.
GRT thus became the latest of the recently floated bus companies to snap up
a former part of the National Bus Company, which was privatised in 1987.
Only about 10 of the original 52 NBC operations which were sold off remain
independent.
The small but growing sector of quoted bus companies comprises former NBC
subsidiaries such as Badgerline, the Avon-based group which came to the
market last November, and former local authority operations such as GRT,
which was the subject of a buy-out in 1989.
Earlier this week Stagecoach, the Perth-based operator which came to the
market last year, made an agreed Pounds 27.5m share offer for Busways, the
main urban bus company in Tyne and Wear, which was bought by management and
employees in 1989 from the passenger transport authority.
Mr Moir Lockhead, chairman of GRT, said he was interested in making further
acquisitions, including some of the former NBC businesses and the 10 London
bus operations which are currently being bid for. 'Prices have been getting
a bit high, but Eastern Counties is profitable and will be
earnings-enhancing from day one,' he said.
Mr Peter Brundle, managing director of Eastern Counties, said: 'During the
past few years the bus industry nationwide has seen rapid consolidation and
the directors believe that only by being part of a larger group can the
interests of passengers, staff and the wider community be safeguarded.'
Mr Lockhead added that the existence of GRT's employee share ownership plan
had made the offer more attractive to Eastern Counties. About 200 of the
company's 850 employees have shares, with one cleaner owning a stake worth
more than Pounds 20,000.
GRT also reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.4m for the year to March 31 -
slightly ahead of the prospectus forecast - on sales of Pounds 39.9m. Pro
forma earnings per share were 13.9p, against 9.5p.
The company's shares, placed at 160p, yesterday gained 1p to close at 157p.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Midlands lines up overseas projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midlands Electricity said yesterday that negotiations for participation in
two overseas generation projects were at an advanced stage. It would not say
where the deals were, but it is thought to be looking at projects in China,
Pakistan and Turkey.
The statement accompanied news of a 17 per cent rise in annual pre-tax
profits to Pounds 195.4m and a 16 per cent increase in dividend to 23.2p, a
rise slightly more modest than Seeboard's 17.5 per cent, the largest so far
in the sector.
The prospective deals, in which the company would be an investor rather than
operator, represent a growing trend among regional power companies to
diversify abroad. Until recently regional power companies have been cautious
of investing outside the UK, partly because of the experience of water
companies which were privatised before them and in some cases encountered
severe difficulties with their overseas expansion.
However, in recent weeks Yorkshire Electric has spent more than Pounds 100m
on a stake in Stockholm Energi, and Norweb, serving the north-west of
England, has spent up to Dollars 40m buying into a Virginia, US,
co-generation company.
Mr Bryan Townsend, Midland chairman, said the overseas risks were minimal.
In each case the investment would be about Pounds 20m and because the deals
would be highly geared, the banks were taking the main proportion of the
risk. 'All we require is a modicum of unregulated income. Perhaps 15 per
cent of profit will be from generation by the end of the decade. If we tie
up these two deals, we would be interested in perhaps one more.'
Midlands' share price gained 23p to 575p yesterday as all the regional
electricity companies responded positively to hints that the forthcoming
pricing review by the industry regulator would be less severe than feared.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Third rail strike begins as Acas negotiations collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railway signal staff began their third 24-hour stoppage last night after
talks between Railtrack and RMT, the main rail union, collapsed.
However, British Rail said trains should be running at about 10 per cent of
their normal level today - the highest figure since the strikes began two
weeks ago.
'We have learnt from the last two strikes how we should be deploying our
resources better,' Railtrack said last night.
Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial relations director, said he was
very disappointed that no progress had been made after nearly 20 hours of
talks over two days at Acas, the conciliation service.
He disclosed that the company had made a new three-stage self-financing
productivity deal to union negotiators without adding to Railtrack's pay
bill.
This involves a 6 per cent unconsolidated increase in basic pay rates for
signalling staff from 1 July in return for flexible working practices and a
'buy-out' of cash wage payments for a Pounds 200 one-off lump sum payment.
The final deal would involve a long-term settlement of the signalling
staff's grievances. Mr Armstrong stressed no item in the package could be
applied in isolation and that all of them could only be triggered as part of
the whole deal.
In addition, signalling staff have been offered an annual pay rise of 2.5%.
'The RMT was not prepared to grasp the opportunities we offered them,' Mr
Armstrong said. There are no plans for a resumption of negotiations, but Mr
Armstrong said he hoped the RMT would reconsider its position. He added that
Railtrack would be informing signalling staff individually of its pay
proposals.
The RMT's chief negotiator, Mr Vernon Hince, said that 'no further progress'
had been made during the intensive talks. 'We are in the same position as we
were at the beginning,' he said.
He added that Railtrack had still failed to address the union's claim.
Railtrack's three-part pay offer, he said, would mean only a 3 per cent
improvement in earnings for signalling staff in the first instance, and that
could be agreed only if the union had accepted the entire package.
A further 24-hour stoppage is scheduled to take place next Wednesday, July
6. The union's annual conference, which is being held in Liverpool this
week, is expected to decide on whether to escalate the dispute.
More stoppages, however, can be expected after next Wednesday. The main
additions to the services that ran during last Wednesday's stoppage are a
special service running from Paddington through to Plymouth and trains
linking Manchester with Bolton, Preston and Manchester airport.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Germany moves towards ban on UK beef imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN, ALISON MAITLAND and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government yesterday took the first legislative steps towards
banning imports of British beef in a move which threatened a further
deterioration in Anglo-German relations.
Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, formally asked the Bundesrat,
the German upper house, to approve a six-month ban of British beef to
prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow
disease.
He was joined for the first time yesterday by Mr Jochen Borchert, the German
agriculture minister, whose support is vital for approval of a ban.
The German move follows the UK's veto last weekend of Germany's choice of Mr
Jean-Luc Deheane, Belgium's prime minister, as the next president of the
European Commission.
Downing Street said Germany's actions would be raised during tomorrow's
visit to London by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister. Mr John
Major, the prime minister, would also raise the matter with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl 'at some point'.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK agriculture minister, urged the European
Commission to make good its threat to take Germany to the European Court.
In a letter to Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner, she said: 'You
have left Germany in no doubt about the legal consequences of a unilateral
ban of this kind. I now expect you to take the necessary legal action
immediately.'
Mrs Shephard said she would be 'surprised' if the German action was
retaliation for Britain's veto of Mr Dehaene.
On BSE, she said the Germans were 'ignoring the community's scientific
evidence and the community's legal system'.
Officials in Bonn said press reports about BSE had so alarmed the German
public that beef sales had fallen 30 per cent since March and that both
farmers and retailers had been pressing for action.
The Bundesrat will vote on July 8 whether to approve a six-month import ban.
The fall in beef sales has also encouraged Mr Borchert to endorse the health
minister's initiative. 'The half-hearted proceedings of the European
Commission are incomprehensible,' he said. Mr Borchert had earlier been
reluctant to associate himself with Mr Seehofer's campaign, fearing it would
hamper the European beef trade and make him unpopular with his European
counterparts.
However, officials in Bonn said other agriculture ministers, notably the
French minister, were coming round to the idea of stronger measures against
BSE. One official said Britain could expect further trouble during the
forthcoming German presidency of the EU.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Benn says 'loophole' will let him block royal succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Benn, the Labour MP for Chesterfield, yesterday claimed to have
found a constitutional loophole that may put an end to Britain's
1,000-year-old hereditary monarchy.
His claim raises the republican flag at Westminster at a time of increasing
controversy over Prince Charles's fitness to inherit the throne.
It coincides with the transmission later today of an ITV documentary in
which the prince is said to admit adultery and to promote the
disestablishment of the Church of England.
The claim caused a storm among defenders of the monarchy.
Mr Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said Mr
Benn's statement was 'of such temerity that, in times past, he would have
been charged with treason'.
Mr Benn said 'years' of research had shown that the succession to the throne
could be blocked by a single objection by a member of the Privy Council, the
medieval eminent body that advises the sovereign.
Mr Benn, a privy councillor since 1964, said it was his 'solemn intention'
to prevent the publication of the proclamation announcing the accession of
the next monarch after the death or abdication of the Queen.
But constitutional experts said that Mr Benn's threat to block the
succession rests on the assertion that the proclamation would be invalid
without unanimous assent.
The traditional wording used in the proclamation asserts that the new
sovereign is proclaimed 'with one voice and consent of tongue and heart' of
the privy councillors and 'gentlemen of quality' present.
Mr Nigel Nicholls, clerk to the privy council, said it was not clear whether
a privy councillor's objection would block the publication of the
proclamation.
Even if it did, that would not affect the accession of the new monarch.

FT  29 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK housebuilders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest shreds of evidence confirm that the UK housing market has come
off the boil. Although mortgage lending by banks was higher in May than in
April, the rise reflects market share taken from building societies, whose
lending actually fell. Berkeley Group, the housebuilder which announced
full-year results yesterday, has seen a notable slowing of sales this month.
None of this points to another dangerous dip in house prices; selling prices
still look likely to rise by 2-3 per cent this year. But such a modest
increase will not allow housebuilders to pass through higher costs,
especially the rising price of land.
Since land prices have risen by about half from the trough last year, there
could be a nasty squeeze on builders' margins to come. The snag for
investors is knowing which of the quoted companies are likely to suffer
most. Almost all took part in the feeding frenzy which saw Pounds 400m
equity raised for investment in land. The only rule is that companies with
large land stocks have been under less pressure to chase prices higher.
The equity market has responded by marking down shares across the board.
Having underperformed the market by about 20 per cent since March, most
housebuilders now stand on price earnings multiples close to the market
average. But it is difficult to argue that housebuilders are especially
cheap. Canny companies should outperform their rivals as the distribution of
pain becomes clear, but the sector is unlikely to flourish so long as the
housing market remains lukewarm.

FT  29 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Arjo Wiggins
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Papermakers are smiling again. Prices and volumes for many paper grades are
rising nicely with a wave of stock replenishment being succeeded by a
pick-up in underlying demand. Eucalyptus pulp prices have risen by more than
50 per cent since the fourth quarter of 1993. The Swedish manufacturer,
MoDo, yesterday pushed prices higher on several grades. Given the huge
operational gearing in paper companies, such rises rapidly translate into
surging profits.
But just as life eases for paper manufacturers, their share prices are
starting to soften. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, for example, has underperformed
the FT-SE All-Share by 7 per cent over the past three months having
outperformed by 46 per cent over the previous year. The market had already
anticipated much of the good news. Besides, concerns are now focusing on
what type of paper cycle it will be this time.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton has worked to depress the cyclicality of its earnings
in the hope they will be rated more highly at the next peak. The group's
exposure to higher value added papers, its merchanting arm and geographical
spread all promise a higher quality of earnings. But as commodity producers
accumulate cash, they can be relied on to over-invest in new capacity. They
would perhaps do better to buy each other and thus consolidate an
unhealthily fragmented industry. Takeover talk would then be another reason
for pushing paper shares higher.

FT  29 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How quickly the markets have forgotten their fears that April's tax
increases would abort the UK economic recovery] Yesterday's Treasury
forecast paints a remarkably happy picture of the economy. Growth is higher
than expected, but not so high as to rekindle inflation and put upward
pressure on interest rates. The public sector borrowing requirement is
coming down, but not so fast that it will encourage calls for tax cuts. The
corporate financial surplus will lead companies to invest more next year,
but not so much that the balance of payments balloons.
Such projections would have been unthinkable in February or March. Yet the
irony is that a forecast of 2.75 per cent growth for this year may prove too
conservative, not least because of the modest contribution factored in from
stock-building. If that is the case, calm on the interest rate front may not
last. Pressures are beginning to mount from commodity prices and on wages.
It still looks likely that base rates will come under upward pressure during
the autumn. One wonders how that will affect corporate investment plans,
especially since it is only next year that the government expects capital
spending to come into its own. If this year is better than expected, 1995
could disappoint.

FT  29 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Standard's deviation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered seems to have enormous difficulty breaking with its past.
The bank protests that its latest troubles in Hong Kong go back to a time
before its management and risk control were strengthened, but there is
inevitably a sense that Standard is simply accident-prone. If the market
shrugged off the latest announcement, this may have been because it has not
involved a financial loss while much of the detail was already known. Coming
hard on the heels of the Bombay debacle, though, it raises questions about
inherent risks in developing country banking and, in that context, how
deeply involved a bank like Standard Chartered should be in local securities
markets.
Arguably Standard's business is one of high rewards accompanied by high
risks. Few other UK banks could produce a net return on ordinary
shareholders' funds to match the 21 per cent managed by Standard last year.
Yet few also run the risk of operating in the domestic markets of a broad
range of developing countries. The market will always have to take account
of that when rating the shares. Hence consensus forecasts put Standard on a
multiple of around eight times 1994 earnings, which is at a discount to the
sector.
Improved risk control could enhance the rating of Standard's shares, but the
market will take time to be convinced that the new management is effective
on that score. Standard could also staying away from securities and
concentrate on safer businesses like trade finance at which it excels. That,
however, would be a strategic sacrifice. Economic growth will increasingly
lead Asian companies to raise funds in the securities market rather than
through banks. If Standard withdrew from that business, it would be piling
up risks of a different sort for the future.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Observer: Iriplaceable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Running Iri, Italy's giant state holding company, has invariably proved a
thankless job. Maybe that's why Silvio Berlusconi's door has no anxious
queue of contenders outside it.
No one is hurrying to replace departing chairman Romano Prodi. Berlusconi
and his boys have yet to fix on a suitable candidate. Time is running out -
Prodi is leaving on Thursday, after Iri's annual meeting.
One front-runner still appears to be Ennio Presutti, the 63-year-old head of
Assolombardo, the Lombard business federation and Italy's most powerful
regional business lobby.
His credentials are impeccable. Though Roman-born, he is an honorary
Milanese through his work, and thus in sympathy with the predominant
'northern' strain in the government.
Presutti made his career with IBM in a host of senior executive posts in
Italy and Europe. He also has numerous board directorships in the private
sector. On paper, precisely the kind of managerial experience needed to wind
up a debt-ridden and outmoded institution such as Iri.
There's a catch. With a cv like his, Presutti appears rather too radical for
the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance ministers. After all, Iri was a
Mussolini invention and a central pillar of his corporatist state . . .

Unquestionably, Samuel Courtauld was Britain's greatest collector of
Impressionist painting, as anyone can judge by going along to see his
collection at London's Courtauld galleries. But was he a good investor?
He bought Van Gogh's self-portrait with bandaged ear for Pounds 10,000 in
1928, about Pounds 308,000 in today's terms. If auctioned today it would
surely fetch Pounds 30m. Renoir's La Loge cost Courtauld Pounds 24,000 in
1925 - perhaps Pounds 704,000 today. Under the hammer today it might fetch
Pounds 35m. As for Manet's Bar at the Folies-Bergere which set Courtauld
back Pounds 24,100 - Pounds 720,000 now - in 1926, it could set a new world
record, perhaps approaching Pounds 50m. And so on.
Not a bad record. Today's best-known British collector - Charles Saatchi -
goes more for stuffed sheep in fish-tanks. Still, by 2060 an animal - even
floating in formaldehyde - might be so rare that someone will pay handsomely
for it.

Indeed, Lord Lawson must be rather envious of his rival for the OECD job. It
sounds like more than half the OECD members now support Canada's Don
Johnston. Even if he falls at the last hurdle, the word is that he may well
pick up the consolation prize of being Canada's next high commissioner in
London.
The incumbent, Fredrik Eaton, a wealthy scion of the Eaton department store
empire, returns home in mid-July after three years in London.
If Lawson doesn't get the OECD job there is little else on offer, now that
he seems to have turned his back on merchant banking. Maybe the editorship

FT  29 JUN 94 / Observer: See Naples, feel grumpy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Such a pity that Silvio Berlusconi, Helmut Kohl, John Major, Francois
Mitterrand, Felipe Gonzalez et al rushed back home from Corfu.
Due in Naples next week for the G7 summit, they could have saved time - and
taxpayers' cash - by taking a comfortable yacht direct from Corfu. They
might even have patched up their differences over a gin and tonic en route.
Presumably tact, for once, intervened. After all, those left behind in Corfu
 -the smaller European Union fry - might have smarted at not being invited
aboard.
And the happy yachtsmen would also have perhaps offended some outsiders
joining the party at Naples: Jean Chretien, Bill Clinton and the prime
minister of Japan, whoever that might turn out to be.
Those three may be forgiven twinges of relief at the Corfu summit fiasco. At
least they will not arrive in Naples to find themselves surrounded by a
phalanx of European leaders in relaxed mutual harmony on everything -
including who should get the secretary-generalships of the OECD and the new
World Trade Organisation.
Those other jobs are now far from stitched up, as Italian television
inadvertently indicated on Monday evening, when it staged a mock summit. It
was chaired by a genial Renato Ruggiero, seasoned Eurocrat and former
Italian foreign trade minister. His good humour was no doubt inspired by
increased hopes of getting EU support for his WTO candidature, in return for
Berlusconi's flexibility on the EU presidency.
Another participant on the programme - former British chancellor Nigel
Lawson - was more than usually glum. Lawson must sense that John Major's
celebrated Corfu veto did him few favours. It has unquestionably scuppered
Lawson's hopes of getting EU backing in his quest for the OECD job.
Heads I win, tails you lose.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The prospects for tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Give us our tax cuts please, Mr Clarke. Two more years of pre-announced tax
increases may be in the pipeline, but this is already the cry of dispirited
Tories. The pre-election tax-cutting budget is a time-worn ritual. Lord Howe
in 1983 did it, Lord Lawson in 1987 did it, even recession-struck Mr Lamont
in 1992 did it. With up to three budgets before the last possible date for a
general election, Kenneth Clarke may find an excuse too. Yet, however
politically well-judged cuts might prove, they are unlikely to be
justifiable on economic grounds.
This is so even though the revised forecasts from the Treasury, published
yesterday, have a relatively good story to tell. Real gross domestic product
is forecast to increase by 2 3/4 per cent in 1994, compared with the 2 1/2
per cent forecast at the time of the budget last November. The public sector
borrowing requirement is expected to be Pounds 36bn in 1994-95 (5 1/4 per
cent of GDP), down from the earlier forecast of Pounds 38bn. This follows an
outcome of Pounds 46bn (7 1/4 per cent of GDP) in 1993-94, compared with the
earlier forecast of Pounds 50bn. Best of all, the retail price index is
forecast to rise by 2 1/2 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of
1994, as against the 3 1/4 per cent forecast last November.
This performance must be heartening to the forecasters. But how heartening
should it be for the politicians? It is better than another knock on the
head, but still no cure for what ails them.
Roughly right
This is most obviously seen in the case of the public sector borrowing
requirement. The forecasts for 1994-95 and 1995-96 are 5 1/4 per cent and 4
per cent of GDP, respectively, both only a quarter of a percentage point
lower than forecast in November. If the fiscal strategy was roughly right
then, it must also be roughly right now.
That is what Mr Clarke told his colleagues in opening this year's spending
round, when he confirmed the earlier targets for the 'control total'
(covering supposedly non-cyclical spending) of Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and
Pounds 272.3bn for 1996-97 respectively. One thing that does help the
chancellor is lower-than-expected inflation. Even so real growth of the
control total is forecast to be a mere 1.7 per cent between 1993-94 and
1995-96.
Another reason why the chancellor is slightly better off than expected is
lower unemployment, which reduces spending on cyclical social security, with
each 100,000 people off the register expected to save the government about
Pounds 350m. The November forecast was for unemployment in 1994-95 at 2.75m.
The outcome may add another Pounds 1bn to the chancellor's room for
manoeuvre.
Greater squeeze
On balance, however, these developments merely make it less unlikely that
the government will hit its spending targets. To do better would demand
either a still greater squeeze on public sector pay or greater radicalism
towards the public sector, something this government will not dare and, in
any case, should not attempt on an emergency basis.
This leaves two arguments for tax cuts before the election. One is that
economic growth should be faster. Here there is a case to answer. Coming off
a recession, an economy whose long-term trend rate of growth is around 2 1/4
per cent a year ought to be able to grow faster than 2 3/4 per cent.
The question is how much faster before inflationary bottlenecks emerge, the
problem being that an economy's potential output is an uncertain zone, not a
well-defined line. Moreover, while retail prices have been rising more
slowly than forecast, there are already signs of tightening in the labour
market. If the authorities want to keep inflation at around current levels,
let alone reduce it further, it would be wrong to assume growth can much
exceed 3 per cent.
With faster economic growth unlikely to make a huge fiscal difference over
the next three years, what is left for the government is prestidigitation.
PSBRs have been so huge in relation to the amount of tax normally 'given
away', or imposed in any given year, that there has to be room for a few
billion pounds in 'cuts'. But what would that mean? First the government
would impose a multi-year fiscal squeeze. Then it would introduce a partial
reversal in the last year of the parliament. How very British] This may be a
way to win an election. It is no way to run a country.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Stability in a storm-tossed world: Hans Tietmeyer,
Bundesbank president, tells FT writers how a steady course can be pursued
flexibly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT, CHRISTOPHER PARKES and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waves of global financial turmoil and economic stress have rocked the
Bundesbank boat relentlessly since Mr Hans Tietmeyer became president nine
months ago. But his faith in the German central bank's traditional
long-distance navigational techniques - a steady hand on the rudder and a
reliable compass - remains undented. His eye remains fixed on horizons,
however distant, where stability rules.
The internationalisation of money markets has inevitably drawn Germany into
rough water. Having swung from being a net capital exporter to an importer,
the country was now 'more integrated, more part of the worldwide bond market
than before', Mr Tietmeyer told the FT yesterday.
'We are now seeing a growing professionalism . . . all the normal investors
who used to do their business on their own behalf are now to a great extent
being replaced by professional investors who base their decisions on their
own judgments . . . and are much more oriented to the short-term.'
Despite the Bundesbank's well-known distaste for short-termism in any form,
Mr Tietmeyer remains phlegmatic. 'We cannot live outside this world. This is
a new situation we have to live with,' he said. Naturally, central bankers
could not control the course of capital markets. 'But what is important is
that monetary policy should not give the markets specific incentives to
become highly volatile. That means it should maintain a steady course.'
First, monetary policy targets should be clearly defined and explained.
Policy should then be steered without disruptive changes. It should aim to
be predictable . . . but not, of course, in the short-term.
'If a central bank policy were to depend on the short-term expectations of
the market, then in the first instance it would be predictable, and in the
second it would become a prisoner of market expectations, unable to go its
own way,' Mr Tietmeyer warned.
He defined a target for the US currency, focus of the latest money markets
turmoil: 'Everybody has an interest in a strong and stable dollar,' he
stated. And he saw no justification in the fundamentals for the current
weakness. In his eyes the recent crunch stemmed from over-reaction to
over-stated fears of inflation.
Bond markets have also fallen victim to over-correction of earlier trends.
'To some extent I feel a correction was appropriate,' Mr Tietmeyer admitted.
'It started with the US decision to increase short-term interest rates and
to move from a stimulative to a more neutral stance in monetary policy.' But
he still did not believe that perceptions of longer-term prospects for
inflation provided a viable basis for subsequent events.
As for central bankers' powers over such events, he repeated his well-known
scepticism about the effectiveness of supporting embattled currencies.
'Exchange markets cannot be controlled fully by intervention,' he said.
Mr Tietmeyer was unwilling to indicate how central banks might divine the
right time to step in, but there was certainly no secret formula. 'No, it's
a feeling,' he said. Nor did the Bundesbank have any new means of countering
turbulence: 'In the end I am pretty sure the markets will realise the
benefit of a steady policy,' he added.
He was even modestly confident that markets would soon learn to appreciate
the benefits of the bank's favoured but much-maligned stability indicator:
targeted money supply growth based on the broad M3 measure. There were
already some signs that monetary capital formation - the removal of funds
from short-term investments included in the M3 formulation into long-term
instruments outside the measure's scope - was improving.
'If we had a normal degree of capital formation we would be much closer to
our (M3 growth) target,' Mr Tietmeyer claimed.
Recent aberrations in M3's performance were already being reviewed in
preparation for the bank council's mid-year progress report due at its
regular fortnightly meeting on July 21.
'I cannot predict the outcome. The central council is not controlled by one
or two people. It is like a small parliament, I would say. But if I
understand the discussion among members, there is clearly a general feeling
that we should stick to monetary targeting,' Mr Tietmeyer said.
The council needed to assess the special factors bloating money supply
growth and assess the chances of their disappearance, and the extent to
which elements such as strong credit growth for housing suggested a build-up
of inflationary potential.
As for interest rates, Mr Tietmeyer again stressed the need for a steady
course. Fundamental change now, while the M3 situation remained unclear,
would not be appropriate. Interest rate policy has to be aimed at further
reducing inflation and avoiding the creation of new inflationary
expectations. That would be bad for the impending wage round and bad for
bonds, he added. M3 was an important guide, but its importance lay in its
value as a medium and long-term indicator. Recent distortions, Mr Tietmeyer
maintained, were to be blamed on specific, temporary effects. The bank had
never followed a rigid M3 policy, and he himself had always pursued an
'enlightened' line.
'Everyone who has known me for a long time knows I have very strong
convictions and a strong general line. But around that general line I am a
little bit flexible,' he added.
Some of this flexibility has emerged recently in a more favourable tone in
the bank's views on the German government's efforts to respond to its
relentless urgings towards public spending restraint. But Mr Tietmeyer was
yesterday as strict as ever on the need to shrink the deficit but avoid tax
increases.
'It can only be done by holding down spending on the consumption side. That
includes wages and social spending,' he said. The challenge now was to
proceed for the rest of the decade from the first steps already taken by the
federal, regional and local governments.
Clearly concerned that expectations - 'the most important element in the
whole question of recovery' - should remain in balance with reality, Mr
Tietmeyer acknowledged that the economy was in the first stages of recovery.
Industry had restructured and was regaining its competitiveness.
But the process of restructuring had to continue if an accumulation of
'wrong developments' was to be untangled. Up until the early 1990s, Germany
had an undervalued currency. 'This gave people the impression they were
competitive when they were not,' he said. The public debate on social costs
was just beginnning. Two years ago there was no question: everyone thought
everything could go on (expanding) indefinitely.
While Mr Tietmeyer felt unified Germany was now starting to build the
foundations for durable growth and stability, he made plain that he felt the
Maastricht treaty was still only a blueprint.
It was a positive factor, but monetary union needed firm foundations, both
economic and political, he said. Economic conditions were one aspect. 'In my
view there must also be political conditions. That means a clear will to
move in political solidarity . . . because monetary union is a risk-sharing
union,' he said.
'In a monetary union we have to take all the risks and consequences of
failures and mistakes; share all the advantages and disadvantages.' It was
not a purely technical matter.
Mr Tietmeyer, although aware of the dangers of being accused of political
meddling, has persistently aired his concern that the technicalities of
union were being allowed to overshadow the political necessities. He
repeated that he could not see for 'the foreseeable future' a situation
where all member and candidate countries could simultaneously meet all the
conditions of the treaty for monetary union.
There were cultural and institutional hindrances, too. He was 'not happy'
that independence for all EU central banks had not been made a condition for
the start of stage two of the proposed union this year. 'Independent central
banking has to be learnt,' he said, and the merits and disadvantages
appreciated in both the political and public sphere.
'In France there is an interesting example to be watched,' he noted. As for
Britain, he gleefully quoted the concluding remarks from a recent lecture by
Mr Stanley Fischer, recently named as deputy managing director of the
International Monetary Fund: 'On her 300th birthday it is time for the Old
Lady to be allowed to take on the responsibilities of independence.'
Preparation for union and the necessary European Central Bank required more
than technical progress. It could not be done from one day to another. For
success a tradition had to be established and developed to some extent.
'In the long run, monetary union cannot and will not survive without being
embedded in a broad political, common environment,' he said.
Mr Tietmeyer, the man who might be the last president of a German
Bundesbank, stressed he wanted it to work. But he could not hide his fears.
'If we create a monetary union and this proves to be a failure, this will be
a very, very sad result for Europe,' he said.
'A breakdown of such a union would be more dangerous than not to have it in
the first place.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / A tick on the old clock: Vanessa Houlder explains why every
second counts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insomniacs will find tomorrow night even longer than usual. The night will
be extended by an extra second, to correct the earth's erratic timekeeping.
The extra second will be inserted at midnight, Greenwich Mean Time; but in
the UK, this means at 1am on Friday, because British Summer Time is one hour
ahead. An extra second will be broadcast in the national time signal, which
is transmitted by Rugby Radio Station, and the BBC may broadcast seven
'pips' in its time signal instead of six.
This leap second, as it is called, highlights some unexpected complexities
in the practical aspects of keeping time. For technicians, as well as
philosophers, the nature of time is a curiously elusive concept.
The difficulty does not lie in the accuracy of clocks. In 1955, when atomic
clocks were introduced, it became possible to keep time with hitherto
unknown precision. These clocks, which work by monitoring the frequency at
which an atom of the chemical element Caesium vibrates, are accurate to one
second in 1m years.
Rather, the problem arises with the traditional way of measuring time,
namely the length of a day. The length of the day depends on the speed at
which the earth rotates, which - despite appearances - is not constant.
Like a spinning top which gradually loses its momentum, the earth is slowing
down. As a result, it is occasionally necessary to add an extra second to
clocks, to keep them in step with the length of the day.
'It is a compromise,' says Ms Martine Feissel, director of Central Bureau of
the International Earth Rotation Service, a Paris-based organisation created
in 1988. 'On the one hand, there is high precision international atomic
time. At the same time we do not want to be too far from the earth's
rotation.'
The service is the world's authority on when clocks should introduce a leap
second. From its 30 radio stations all over the world, it makes minute
measurements of quasars - objects in the sky so remote that they can be
assumed to be fixed - from which it can calculate the earth's movements and
hence the moment at which it is appropriate to realign clocks.
The service decides whether to add a leap second six months in advance of
its introduction, which is generally in June or December - although there is
provision for the leap second to be introduced in March or September.
Ms Feissel cautiously predicts that the next leap second is likely to be at
the end of June next year. If so, it will be the 20th leap second to be
introduced since 1972. Before then, measurements of time were less precise.
At first sight, the addition of 19 leap seconds in 22 years suggests that
the earth is slowing down remarkably quickly. In fact, even if the speed of
the earth's rotation were to stabilise, the earth rotation service would
still be forced to declare the occasional leap second.
The reason lies with the definition of the atomic second, which is the
equivalent of 9.19bn vibrations in a Caesium atom. When the second was
redefined in terms of atomic vibrations in the 1960s, scientists decided to
base it on the length of a day in 1900, which is an important reference
point for astronomers. That means the occasional leap second is needed just
to make up for the slowdown in the earth's rotation which has already
occurred since 1900.
In principle, negative leap seconds, in which the seconds are left out
rather than inserted, could be needed as well as leap seconds. Although the
long-term trend is for the earth to rotate more slowly, there are periods
when it speeds up, for complex reasons concerning winds, tides and the
movement of the earth's molten core.
Is the time, money and effort spent on synchronising clocks with the earth's
movements well spent? On the face of it, the worst that would happen if they
were allowed to get out of kilter, is that the sun, moon and stars would
rise and set a few seconds earlier than previously. After all, for most
people, an extra second here or there is a matter of supreme indifference.
But for a small group of people, Thursday's realignment of clocks is vital.
For some scientists and navigators, clocks must remain in close
synchronisation with the rotation of the earth. Anyone using
astro-navigation on the high seas would find that a one-second mistake could
result in an error of a quarter of a mile in a ship's position. And that
could prove fatal.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Glimmer of hope for Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, Ukraine's presidential elections are following a
depressingly familiar pattern. In the past year, the country has experienced
higher levels of inflation than any in the former eastern bloc and a sharp
fall in production. But the vast majority of voters in the first round of
the elections on Sunday still chose two candidates from the former communist
old guard.
The front runners, who will face each other in a run-off ballot next month,
are President Leonid Kravchuk, a former party ideology secretary, and Mr
Leonid Kuchma, the one-time missile factory director who served as prime
minister for most of last year. Neither has demonstrated that he understands
what building a modern economy requires. Mr Kravchuk, who has led Ukraine
since independence in 1991, has preferred to focus on the political struggle
to consolidate Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of perceived Russian
threats. Mr Kuchma's dalliance with reform was brief, and ended in something
close to hyperinflation.
Uninspiring as the economic record of the two contenders is, however, all is
not yet lost. Indeed, there is now a chance that whoever is elected will be
forced by the depth of Ukraine's economic crisis to follow in the steps of
Russia's prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin. Like Mr Kuchma, the Russian
leader learnt about economics as a Soviet factory manager. But when left in
undisputed charge of the Russian economy he had no alternative but to
persevere with a tough macroeconomic strategy and tight monetary and fiscal
controls.
Scathingly critical
Ukrainians are neither blind nor apathetic: nearly 70 per cent turned out at
the polls and voters were often scathingly critical of their government even
as they cast their ballots. One reason Ukrainians may have chosen to entrust
their government to a member of the old guard is that they are finding that
the state is not as all-powerful as it was. Like grass pushing through
concrete, a private economy is emerging despite the best efforts of the
government to keep it under ground.
According to official data, which do not fully reflect the growing shadow
economy, the private sector accounted for 30 per cent of GNP in the first
quarter of this year. Many people have simply opted out of the official
economy. The average salary is about Dollars 10 a month and in many
enterprises and institutions has not been paid at all for the past two or
three months. Even the IMF describes the credit squeeze as draconian. It is
leading to the effective privatisation of many public services as officials
who are formally civil servants demand private payment for their services.
Despite this, relying on garden plots and private commerce, most Ukrainians
are better fed and dressed than ever.
Promising aspect
The ability of Ukrainians to survive despite their bad government does not
absolve the next president of responsibility. The promising aspect of this
election is that both candidates appear at last to be implicitly
acknowledging this fact, in two ways.
First, Ukraine's dispute with Russia - too often used by politicians as an
alibi for their failure to deal with the economic crisis - may be becoming
less relevant. Even Mr Kuchma, whom some have painted as Russia's candidate,
has emphasised his commitment to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty. Both
candidates, and the electorate, appear to have realised that, on its own,
independence is no guarantee of economic prosperity, and that reunion with
Russia, even if it were possible or desired by the voters, would also be no
panacea.
Second, both presidential candidates are now at least promising a government
which stops thwarting the initiative of its people. The immediate challenge
for the victor will be to provide macroeconomic discipline and initiate the
structural reforms needed to underpin a market economy. That means
demonstrating the will to contain inflation by resisting the temptation to
issue fresh credits to loss-making factories and other state institutions.
Whichever candidate is elected should be aware that a constituency for
market reform now exists. A more prosperous and confident electorate at the
next elections will punish any leader who fails to understand this.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Postman Pat and his E-mail cat: Post offices do have a
commercial future - if they adapt to new technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1873 the US postmaster-general predicted that Alexander Graham Bell's
telephone would supplant written mail. In fact, the western world's postal
services are busier than ever. But can they continue to withstand the march
of competition and technology?
The question is of special interest to investors across Europe, who are
likely to be offered shares in a succession of postal privatisations over
the next decade. The Dutch mail operator was privatised last month. The UK's
Post Office is clamouring to follow - a government consultation paper on its
future may be published later this week.
Eager to convince a sceptical public, Britain's Post Office argues that its
future is safe only if it is privatised. It cites competition to deliver
business mail from, among others, the Dutch operator, and new forms of
communications such as fax machines. 'No letter is safe from the
technological postman,' claims Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive. 'At the
moment the technology is ahead of the market. But when the market catches
up, we will be highly vulnerable unless we can invest.'
The case for privatisation is alluring. The Post Office says it has only
about 14 per cent of the UK 'communications' market, including mail,
telecommunications, and electronic media. Across the world, the telecoms
operators are rapidly being exposed to competition: until recently yoked
together with postal operators across Europe, they are now forging
multi-billion international alliances geared to the corporate market and
talking about still larger investments in fibre-optic 'superhighways'. With
nine-tenths of all UK mail paid for by the corporate or public sectors, the
Post Office's argument goes, the future could be grim unless it is allowed
to behave in a similarly aggressive and entrepreneurial fashion.
In reality the Post Office is almost certainly overstating its case. It
assumes, first, that commercial freedom requires privatisation and, second,
that a failure to develop new lines of business will inevitably undermine
its existing service.
Neither is necessarily the case. In practice, argues Mr Adrian King, a
postal expert at Omega Partners, a London-based consultancy, three broad
challenges face post offices across Europe - liberalisation, competition and
new technology. But in each area the threat is less straightforward than it
might initially seem. Liberalisation of services in the European Union is
proceeding far more slowly in postal services than in telecoms. The EU has
yet to produce firm plans but draft proposals circulating in Brussels
suggest that the post offices will be able to protect their letter
monopolies on the grounds that they are needed to ensure a universal
service.
Competition, particularly in liberalised markets such as parcels, will
certainly intensify. But the total cake will grow; the arrival of the
technological postman will probably create more, not less, footslogging for
his human counterpart. Transactions made by E-mail and fax beget orders and
statements; home shopping begets home parcel deliveries. The Post Office's
main asset, a home-to-home delivery service, is not about to become
obsolete. While every other utility has shed jobs in the past 20 years, the
Post Office's workforce has risen from 170,000 to 190,000 in response to
demand for its services.
As further competition is allowed, some advertising mail may be delivered to
homes by rivals to the Post Office - including companies already active in
the parcels and express delivery sectors. But apart from premium
business-to-home services, rivals will be interested mostly in low-priority,
low-value advertising business which does not require elaborate sorting
facilities or daily deliveries.
Meanwhile, direct mail is greatly expanding the market for business-to-home
communication. For example, Heinz, the food company, has switched a large
part of its marketing budget to direct mail. New technology offers several
ways of bypassing the post box - notably fax, E-mail, electronic data
exchange and 'hybrid mail' (letters that are collected, sorted and printed
electronically and then delivered by hand). However it is simplistic to
suppose post offices are under immediate threat or ill-equiped to respond.
Only parts of the mail market appear susceptible to early competition.
According to Mr King, the standard European pattern is for 10 per cent of a
postal service's traffic to be household-to-household, 60 per cent
business-to-household, and 30 per cent business-to-business.
The use of physical mail is unlikely to diminish markedly in the first
category. In the third, the technological postman is more threatening as
E-mail, fax and other electronic links are hard to match with physical
delivery services.
But in the second category - business to home - technology offers post
offices an opportunity to expand business by pioneering the use of hybrid
mail. The challenge is to expand total traffic and for post offices to gain
a far larger slice of its value by becoming one-stop providers of electronic
printing and home delivery services. That could extend to providing data
bases, billing software and payments systems using post offices' own giro
cash transfer facilities and counters.
'The task of post offices is to move up the value chain,' says Mr King. 'It
is not so much competition from other deliverers, but gaining a larger slice
of the value of postal and electronic communications which challenges them.'
The case of Sweden Post, arguably Europe's most advanced operator in new
technologies, is instructive. Although wholly state-owned, it has a free
rein to take commercial decisions on alliances and investment strategy, and
no longer has a monopoly over letter deliveries. It is one of Europe's few
profitable post offices (the UK's is another), and has a subsidiary, called
PostNet, dedicated to developing electronic communications.
'The prospect of competition on the mail side forced us to take electronic
media seriously,' says Mr Bengt Norin, an executive director of Sweden Post
hired from a US software company to build up Sweden Post's electronic side.
The competition in the letters business has come mainly from City Mail, an
independent company, which offers a delivery service, about twice-weekly, in
Stockholm and other cities including Goteborg and Malmo. In spite of
Sweden's large rural hinterland, Sweden Post believes it can continue to
offer a universal service by retaining a large share of the high-value
delivery business in cities. The government will review the position in
three years; if Sweden Post argues at that stage that it cannot continue
nationwide letter deliveries, levies on rival operators could be imposed to
subsidise the service.
By then Sweden Post expects electronic communications to be a substantial
part of its business: last year, of the 2.5bn first and second class letters
handled by Sweden Post, 200m were hybrid mail. It also transmitted several
million electronic messages via E-mail or data exchange systems.
Sweden Post's principal hybrid service is 'ePost', which enables companies
to despatch, electronically, statements and other printed mail to six
centres across the country, where the material is printed and put into the
ordinary mail. A 'PC ePost' service, just launched, allows smaller customers
to send hybrid mail from desktop computers.
In the E-mail business the main competitor is Telia, the state telecoms
operator. Mr Norin denies Telia is the 'natural' player in the electronic
market. 'We don't own the roads because we drive on them: anyway, they are
going to have their hands full with new cable and voice services over the
next decade.'
Telia, of course, does not see it that way. The electronic highways of
Europe are set to become battlefields between telecoms operators - and the
more entrepreneurial post offices.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Perverse pensions proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GUY THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As noted in your reports, 'Pensions: the white paper' (June 24), the
government's proposals to abolish guaranteed minimum pensions will bear most
heavily on early leavers from pension schemes. As a group they can be
expected to suffer a significant reduction in the rate of revaluation
applied to their deferred pensions. For at least two reasons, it is perverse
that this group should be chosen to be the main losers in the current round
of reforms.
First, the 'early leaver problem' - the poor level of revaluation applied to
early leavers' deferred pensions - was the focus of a previous pensions
controversy a decade prior to the Maxwell affair. Thus, a problem partially
addressed in the mid-1980s is to be exacerbated a decade later.
Second, it is widely recognised that employment patterns are becoming more
fragmented, with an increasing preponderance of short-term employment over
'jobs for life'. In the course of a career, most employees can now expect to
be early leavers from several pension schemes, each providing a modest
deferred pension which will be progressively eroded in real terms relative
to earnings inflation. Thus, changes in the labour market, coupled with the
white paper's proposals, will mean that the early leaver problem will become
both more widespread and more severe.
It is strange that a package of reforms with the stated intention of
restoring confidence in occupational pension schemes should accentuate their
prime disadvantage relative to personal pensions, and thus serve to
accelerate the ascendancy of the latter. But perhaps this is the ulterior
purpose which the government has in mind?

FT  29 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Challenge of focusing R&amp;D spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GEORGE POSTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Costly Research' (June 20), indulges in
generalisations that merit scrutiny, lest your conclusion, that R&amp;D spend is
unimportant, is accepted too readily.
R&amp;D-intensive companies, such as those in the pharmaceutical sector, will
agree with your final point that the way in which R&amp;D spend is allocated is
of the greatest importance. That is why, in the context of national
com-petitiveness, SmithKline Beecham is supporting the current Technology
Foresight exercise sponsored by the Office of Science and Technology. The
value of R&amp;D spending can only be maximised when we can use the strengths of
the national science base (industry and academia) to blend technological
feasibility with market appropriateness. The Foresight exercise represents
the most comprehensive effort in three decades to inventory strengths and
weaknesses of the UK science base, to seek consensus on priorities for
science and technology investment in the academic and industrial sectors,
and to optimise linkages for technology transfer between them.
Quantification of the return on R&amp;D investment is a challenge for private
and public sectors. It would be useful to see progress on indices of
in-vestment versus return to avoid unjustified assertions about the value of
R&amp;D. It is encouraging to learn of Department of Trade and Industry efforts
to construct an innovation index to measure both outcomes and expenditure.
I acknowledge that the competitiveness of some segments of UK industry may
have declined to such an extent that further investment, not just in R&amp;D but
also via other forms of government support, may be unwarranted. The
challenge of focusing R&amp;D spend appropriately is as important in improving
commercial profitability as it is for pursuit of national goals such as
wealth and health creation. I am encouraged that the UK government is
beginning to appreciate the significance of these issues, not just in the
science and technology office, but more generally, as witnessed by the
recent competitiveness white paper. These government initiatives to support
innovation and sustain excellence in the science base should be encouraged.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complexities of gas market
competition not to be underestimated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN BLACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Ted Trafford and others (Letters, June 24) suggested that
introduction of competition into the domestic gas market will result in
winners only. However, solutions to many of the complex problems raised in
the Department of Trade and Industry/Ofgas consultation paper have yet to be
found.
British Gas is certainly not against competition - provided the playing
field is level. Competitors already hold 46 per cent of the non-domestic
market. However, introducing competition to 18m domestic homes is a mammoth
task and the complexity should not be underestimated. The Monopolies and
Mergers Commission report warned against the rapid introduction of
competition and the DTI/Ofgas consultation document confirmed that there
would be price variations for different customers.
Legislation will inevitably be complicated. Customers need to be guaranteed
safety and security of supply. Arrangements also need to be put in place to
protect the more vulnerable members of society, including the elderly,
disabled and those with difficulties in paying their bills. Further
investment in infrastructure is vital to maintain the pipeline system and to
meet customers' future demands. We have connected more than 2m homes to the
system in the last seven years and our total investment has exceeded Pounds
7bn.
British Gas has delivered good value and good service at home, and this
expertise applied overseas has enabled us to become the leading
international gas company, directly benefiting the UK economy.
The challenges of introducing competition into the domestic sector are
extremely complex. We will be working to make it a success.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Ground rules wanted: The big powers want global order, but
do not know how to enforce it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'mock G7 summit' staged by Italian television on Monday - in which the
seven countries were represented not by their actual leaders but by senior
figures who had been intimately involved in previous summits (including
Helmut Schmidt who dreamed up the G7 idea with Valery Giscard d'Estaing when
they were in power in Germany and France in the 1970s) - was realistic to
the point of tedium. Each country made a general statement of its views,
first on the world economy and then (after the introduction of a Russian
journalist, Alexei Khazov, to represent Yeltsin) on the world political
situation.
The second half of the programme had a bit more edge to it: several western
'leaders', while welcoming Russia to the fold, wanted to be reassured that
Moscow would abide by the rules of the international game. Khazov replied
with assurances as sweeping, and carrying as much conviction, as those the
real summit next week will no doubt get from Yeltsin.
Schmidt was worried that the west might be drifting into confrontation with
the world of Islam, and offered to circulate a draft statement on the need
for peace between cultures and civilisations for inclusion in the
communique. And Jean Francois-Poncet, once Giscard's foreign minister,
entered a passionate plea for the UN to meet the 'challenges to humanity'
posed by dramas such as those of the Iraqi Kurds, Bosnia and Rwanda. No one
mentioned Yemen.
'Can we stand idle, indifferent, when hundreds of thousands of human beings
are being slaughtered?' he asked. 'Is benign neglect acceptable in such
circumstances? My country says 'no'. It has sent 2,500 soldiers to Rwanda -
not to defend any national interest but out of a sense of responsibility
towards Africa - and has asked other countries to join. The response has
been one of utter reluctance. Does this mean that after Somalia we are no
longer willing to act when outright massacres happen in various parts of the
world?'
This challenge clearly did succeed in pricking his colleagues' conscience.
It led to quite a sharp exchange after the cameras were switched off, when
Michael Blumenthal, who was US treasury secretary under President Jimmy
Carter, described France's interest in Rwanda as 'nostalgic'. Admitting that
this word had 'scratched my skin', Francois-Poncet retorted, 'we can't
intervene where there is oil and not where there is not' - which in turn
provoked Blumenthal to complain of 'distortion' and to protest that the US
defines its national interest 'more broadly than any other nation'. Yet both
agreed that to leave the matter to be decided by individual governments'
assessment of their national interests, broad or narrow, was unsatisfactory.
What was needed was an agreed 'international regime' for deciding these
matters.
Four other speakers out of the eight - including Lord Lawson for Britain and
Kim Campbell, whose brief tenure as Canadian prime minister included last
year's G7 summit - named agreement to work out such a 'regime' or 'set of
ground rules' as one of the things they would most like to see emerge from
the real summit. But Hisashi Owada, who has been the Japanese 'sherpa' for
many G7 summits, expressed some scepticism. Much as he wished to see such a
regime, he doubted if the G7 was the right body to propose it.
It is hardly a coincidence that Owada is currently serving as his country's
ambassador to the UN. As such, he is more sensitive than most western
politicians and senior officials to the intense suspicion with which the G7
is regarded by many third world governments. The assumptions which the US
and France make about each other's motives for intervening in different
parts of the world - that behind moral or humanitarian rhetoric lurks
colonial nostalgia or greed for oil - are taken as self-evident in the third
world, not only about those two countries but about rich and powerful
industrial states in general. Any set of rules for intervention drawn up by
the G7 would be denounced in the General Assembly, and probably vetoed by
China in the Security Council, as nothing more than a code by which great
powers would endow themselves with a collective right to use force against
small nations.
There is already a regime, or 'set of ground rules', governing the use of
force for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is called
the UN Charter, and it assigns special responsibilities to the five
permanent members of the Security Council, four of which attend the G7
summit (now, for political purposes, the G8 with the inclusion of Russia).
In practice they have been selective about exercising those
responsibilities, tending increasingly to invoke national interest as a
reason for risking the lives of their soldiers in one place rather than
another. Nothing in the Charter authorises such selectivity, and France is
right to denounce it. But Blumenthal was no doubt also right to say that
France would have been less likely to intervene in a country with which it
had fewer ties, such as Paraguay.
There would be a case for amending the UN Charter to allow more explicitly
for international intervention in a state's internal affairs in cases of
genocide or other extreme humanitarian emergency. But in the present
atmosphere it is unlikely that the necessary two-thirds majority in the
General Assembly for such an amendment could be obtained. Until it can, the
Security Council will no doubt continue to decide, when it believes the
situation in any country is so bad as to merit intervention, that that
situation constitutes a 'threat to international peace and security'.

Placido Domingo has been appointed as the new artistic director of
Washington Opera. Announcing the decision at a press conference yesterday,
he said he planned to continue singing and conducting in the major opera
houses of the world but at the same time maintain 'full control of all
musical and artistic matters,' in Washington. He also plans to perform in
one Washington production each year.
In 14 years under the outgoing director Martin Feinstein, Washington Opera
has grown from an interesting provincial company with a Dollars 2m annual
budget to one of international stature with an Dollars 11.5m, selling more
than 100,000 tickets each year. Mobil Corporation has agreed to sponsor the
opera house for the next three years.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Arts: A new 'Ring' at the Chatelet - Richard Fairman reviews
the first half of the Paris cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not the whole Ring, as yet: Wagner-lovers in Paris will have to wait until
the autumn to see the first complete cycles of this new production. The
timing does, however, mean that Paris has done its best to pip Bayreuth to
the post, as the Wagner festival is within a few weeks of unveiling its own
new Ring - an event which only comes round once or twice a decade.
For international opera-goers there is almost a surfeit of new productions
of the Ring this year (the Royal Opera in London is about to launch another
in the autumn) but if the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris has its eye on the
opposition, it is likely that it is looking closer to home. The Chatelet and
the Opera de Paris Bastille, Mitterrand's huge opera palace for the people,
are keen rivals and the Bastille has yet to accept the challenge of a Ring.
If anybody doubts that competition can be good for the arts, the operatic
situation in Paris at the moment offers the proof. Determined not to be
outdone by its rival's greater size, income and prestige, the Chatelet aims
to make up ground by putting together an adventurous programme. Like the
Bastille, it is able to offer international casts and its only ongoing
weakness is the lack of a house orchestra of the front rank. For some of its
major productions it has the Philharmonia Orchestra in residence from
London, but not unfortunately for this one.
Doubtless Jeffrey Tate had rehearsed the Orchestre National de France
diligently to get such a convincing Wagnerian sound, but the run of cracked
brass notes and general ungainliness of the playing do not speak well of the
orchestra's current form. Tate himself likes solid Wagner, built on
unshakable foundations, but found more elan than usual to build each act to
climaxes of unexpected passion. The Parisian audience rewarded him with an
enthusiastic ovation.
For his part the producer and designer, Pierre Strosser, decided not to come
on for a curtain-call, which was probably wise. So far, only Das Rheingold
and Die Walkure have been seen, but it seems unlikely that he has any
surprises in store for the other two operas. Certainly, his bare stage of a
set - everything dark and grey, barely a flicker of colour in sight - looks
here to stay, while all the Ring's invitations for scenic spectacle are
steadfastly ignored.
Just as he refuses to show on stage the waters of the Rhine, a Valhalla
castle or a rainbow for the gods, so Strosser is determined to avoid the
obvious in his handling of the singers. Whether it is Alberich slipping and
sliding on the rocks, Siegmund collapsing with exhaustion or the Valkyries
congregating with wild energy, he refuses to have anybody imitate the music;
for most of the time the singers just stand lifelessly and sing.
There are some virtues in this approach, but only negative ones. It is a
relief to see a Ring without caricatures, so that in Das Rheingold both
Franz-Josef Kapellmann's Alberich and Peter Keller's Mime came across as men
of feelings, not just grotesque misfits (it was distasteful, though, to use
real dwarves for the Nibelungs). It also makes life easier not to have to
wrestle with a producer's heavy-handed reading of Wagner's political
subtext, although Strosser does dress up his gods as a well-to-do Victorian
family, who do not want to pay for their new house when the proletariat
builders (the giants) turn up with the bill.
In general, Das Rheingold lacked impact, despite Peter Straka's
intelligently-played Loge getting a grip on the drama whenever he could.
Kirsten Dolberg as Erda was left to wander on from the back of the stage
virtually unnoticed, dressed like a Sunday-school teacher arriving to read
the lesson. Nadine Denize's experienced Fricka and Elisabeth Meyer-Topsoe as
Freia made a limited impression among the gods. The Froh was inaudible and
the Fasolt feeble.
After so much inactivity, it was no surprise the next night at Die Walkure
to find nothing happening visually when the door of Hunding's hut flies open
to let in the spring. Instead, in blew a whirlwind called Karen Huffstodt,
whose Sieglinde sang and acted with such fevered intensity that she nearly
blasted everybody else off the stage. I was glad she was there, though her
pairing with Jyrki Niskanen's office clerk of a Siegmund did not look like a
marriage made in heaven.
For its Wotan, the Chatelet has Robert Hale, so far a strong and able
choice, with the right amount of power for this theatre. The Brunnhilde,
Sabine Hass, lacks heroic strength in the middle of her voice, but it is
splendid to hear both a Wotan and a Brunnhilde who sing without any wobble
or unpleasant forcing. Among the rest of the Walkure cast there was a
menacing, heavily Eastern-accented Hunding from Sergey Kopchak and an
international band of Valkyries, including the British duo of Penelope
Walker and Yvonne Howard. Siegfried and Gotterdammerung follow in October,
with two complete Ring cycles around the beginning of November.

du Theatre du Chatelet

FT  29 JUN 94 / Arts: Streets ahead of EastEnders - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh Raquel, Raquel] If only you knew] Even as you complacently warn sexy
Tanya against carrying on with married men ('They always go back to their
wives') your very own Des is sneaking off for a bit on the side. And who
with? Why Tanya, of course] You may know all about her affair with Alex
Christie, but you little realise what we - the viewers - know: that your
'friend' Tanya is herself a two-timing little hussy] This trick, of letting
the audience in on a secret still concealed from one of the key characters,
used to be described by teachers of Eng. Lit. as 'dramatic irony'.
Shakespeare, we were told, was a dab hand at it, and what is good enough for
him is good enough for Coronation Street. It is one of several ways in which
ITV's 34-year-old northern soap is superior to its johnnie-come-lately
southern cousin, EastEnders.
Coronation Street has remained Britain's favourite programme for years, but
EastEnders is not far behind. The most recent BARB figures for the week
ending June 12 show the three episodes of Coronation Street at Nos. 1, 2,
and 3 in the ratings with 16.23m, 14.96m and 14.72m. EastEnders took 4th and
5th slots in the Top 10 with 13.77m and 12.79m. The figures vary with the
seasons, Coronation Street ranging from 14 to 20 million with EastEnders
usually a couple of million behind.
And what do these millions - many of them the same people, watching both
soaps presumably - get in their twice or thrice weekly fix? In some ways the
two are remarkably similar. Each is defined by a small urban area:
Coronation Street in Weatherfield and Albert Square in Walford. Both are
working class districts. In each a pub and a cafe are the most important
meeting places and the consumption of liquid occupies startlingly large
amounts of script time. Coronation Street has several shops as secondary
locations and EastEnders several market stalls. Nobody in EastEnders ever
watches television, listens to the radio or reads a paper. In Coronation
Street such things do occur but only once in a blue moon.
In both series more time is devoted to the characters analysing and
discussing their feelings and relationships than to anything else. It seems
that this is the sort of activity that many women would like men to join in
more often, but which many men, in real life at any rate, find pretty
tedious. Grant, the bullet-headed bully of a landlord in Albert Square's
Queen Vic, was seen to join a morose male customer at his table last week
and say 'So, joo wanna tell me abaht it?' for all the world like a trained
psychotherapist. Unlike The Bill with its police procedure or Casualty with
its medical crises, neither series contains a natural supply of dramatic
themes beyond the daily lives of its characters, this absence being, in my
view, the most important defining characteristic of a true soap opera.
But the differences are more significant. While Coronation Street remains
solidly white (among the scores of characters appearing during the past four
weeks just two looked non white: Felicity from the hairdresser's and a
croupier - a non speaking role - in the gambling club where Steve was
leading his brother and Curly astray) EastEnders is studiously multi-racial.
Coronation Street is funny, sometimes very funny, as in last week's
desperate attempts by Jack Duckworth to stop his wife Vera seeing the
accounts in the tabloid press of his exploits as a window cleaner ('Ee, that
Dulcie Foggett . . .'). Eventually, of course, she spotted the story on her
chip paper and flung her chips at Jack's head. EastEnders, on the other
hand, is almost invariably serious, and when it does attempt a bit of funny
business, as with Arthur's efforts last week to smuggle back the dress he
had given to Pauline, or the request for a 'cupid' gorillagram which
resulted in a 'stupid' gorillagram, it tends to be embarrassingly clumsy.
Most important of all, there is about EastEnders an elusive yet powerful
sense of worthiness; a feeling that the BBC is intent upon teaching us
something. It is not as blatant as the old Archers propaganda on such
subjects as foot and mouth disease or posting early for Christmas, but it
would come as no surprise to learn that, beyond the script writers,
EastEnders had an advisory committee of social workers feeding in research
notes on one-parent families, multi-racialism and urban stress. The cast are
used as blackboards on which to chalk up character traits like exam notes:
'Asian, macho, insensitive' or 'Fat, hypochondriac, spendthrift', and much
of the time most of them are extremely unpleasant to one another. Indeed,
even after several weeks of dedicated viewing it is impossible to find
anyone very much to like in EastEnders.
In Coronation Street it is hard to find anyone to dislike. From Bet Gilroy
with her ludicrous hairdo to Percy Sugden with his pre-war code of morals,
from silly-clever father-to-be Ken Barlow (who has stayed with the series
since Episode 1 in 1960) to scatty Mavis, they are fully formed characters.
Some are as unlikely as those in Dickens, but there are no blackboards here,
these are vividly real human beings. Far from the script writers projecting
sets of social formulae onto them, the characters in Coronation Street have
such well defined personalities that new writers might well feel story lines
were being dictated to them.
Coronation Street sets out first and foremost to entertain, and its
confidence in its ability to do this is so strong that it can toy with, and
then toss away, such subjects as chaos theory and the semiotics of
artificial stone cladding - both featured in the past four weeks, and in
those very words, what is more, each producing a hearty laugh. Had such
subjects crept into EastEnders you can be sure it would have felt like an
Open University programme produced by Blue Peter.
The odd thing is that, contrary to the confident assertions of my addicted
acquaintances - 'Watch for a couple of weeks and you'll be hooked too' - at
the end of four weeks assiduous viewing even Coronation Street has still
failed to trap me. I mean, yes, I suppose I would quite like to know whether
Charlie goes back to Bet. And if Denise agrees to marry Ken - giving them
six marriages between them. And whether that irritating prat Steve returns
to the bosom of his family. And of course whether Tanya manages to keep her
hooks in Des now that Alex has left his wife. But I can take it or leave it.
Honest . . .

FT  29 JUN 94 / Arts: The Browning Version - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Greenwich Theatre on Monday the audience took Terence Rattigan's
best-known play as a sour comedy, decidedly less heart-wrenching than its
reputation. It is debatable whether Philip Franks' smooth production
diminished it, or merely cut it down to its true size.
As you surely remember, The Browning Version is about a miserable couple,
poor Crocker-Harris - a desiccated classics master at a public school - and
his wife, the thoroughly monstrous Millie. In a well-made single act
(followed at Greenwich by a cabaret instead of Rattigan's purpose-built
Harlequinade) 'the Crock', facing a pensionless early retirement, is
inordinately moved when his pupil Taplow makes him a farewell gift of
Browning's verse-translation of the Agamemnon. In one way and another, that
precipitates everything else: the wreck of the marriage, the wreck of
Millie's affair with a reluctant young science master, the cauterising of
the Crock's last shreds of feeling.
Frightfully English, all this; and the old stiff-upper-lip premises are
slightly blurred at Greenwich. Tim Matthews has a passable public-school
accent as young Taplow, but his manners suggest Adrian Mole; likewise the
clean-cut, decent science master is warmly played by James Larkin, but in
the vein of Peter Davison's non-hero in the redbrick A Very Peculiar
Practice - really too 'slack' for Rattigan's period. We needed more sense of
a rigid institutional cramp, of an airless social order where any unguarded
admission of feeling must be an infra dig embarrassment.
The Crocker-Harrises, Clive Merrison and Diana Hardcastle, have - unusually]
 -something in common: their frank theatricality. Merrison's 'Crock', finely
detailed and believable, savours his convoluted, pedantic lines with a
relish that belies Rattigan's intended dead soul. Nobody as resiliently,
narcissistically verbal as that is going to wring our withers much. Miss
Hardcastle plays Millie in two or three bright but inconsistent modes; her
arch, eye-rolling school temptress, her melodramatic fury upon rejection,
and her cruelly plain truth-telling - which has to deliver the final
kidney-punch - never quite add up to one character.
Rattigan's dramatic mechanism is far too well-oiled and 'natural' to betray
any clanks or creaks, but much of the writing falls dully on the ear. Though
I have not seen or read the play these many years, I found myself completing
the actors' lines in advance, correctly, again and again. There are orotund
cliches even when the chips are meant to be down and cold hearts bared.
Across from me there was a gaggle of fifth- or sixth-formers, who laughed a
lot and seemed to find the school-ritual manners utterly alien; a review by
them would have been much more interesting than this one.

Today we are promised a unique insight into the lives of two men. The more
tempting is BBC2's programme about artist KB Kitaj whose largest exhibition
opened this month at the Tate. He has never before agreed to be filmed, so
Kitaj - In The Picture is unusual (11.15). Programmes about the other man,
Prince Charles, are not unusual. The idea that his difficulty is merely one
of 'image', that all he needs is a more efficient PR effort to match his
wife's, a second generation Dimbleby to act as 'gold microphone in waiting'
(Malcolm Muggeridge's memorable phrase for Richard Dimbleby) and that all
will then be well, is surely wrong. On the contrary, it is less publicity
that will preserve the mystery and magic of monarchy. In today's 2 1/2 -hour
promo for the Windsors plc on ITV, Charles: The Private Man, The Public Role
(8.00), the prince might have avoided this being seen as yet another 'charm
offensive' had he had the courage to come clean about his relationships with
Diana Spencer and Camilla Parker Bowles. But industry talk suggests that,
although raised, the issue is fudged.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: A fruitful alternative - St
Lucia needs tourism but hopes to escape the ravages seen in other resorts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER

<TEXT>
In his bright new hillside office above the St Lucian capital of Castries,
Richard Peterkin regrets that his Caribbean island did so little to prepare
for life without bananas.
'We knew what was coming,' says Peterkin, a partner in the local offices of
management consultants Price Waterhouse, referring to St Lucia's shrinking
banana market in Europe.
'The unfortunate thing is that in these islands there are not a lot of
alternatives to bananas,' he adds.
A lush, sunny island, blessed with sandy beaches, does have one alternative,
of course: tourism. Whatever their misgivings, most people on the island
accept that tourism will have to support the livelihoods of a growing number
of its 150,000 people.
For decades, St Lucia's bananas, along with those of other former British
and French colonies, have had privileged access to much of the European
Union, which has applied quotas and tariffs on bananas from Latin America.
However, the drive for freer world trade has led to St Lucia's privileges
being gradually reduced.
As its agricultural sector shrinks, the island, a relative newcomer to
tourism, is striving desperately to avoid some of the environmental and
social ravages that have followed the development of the industry elsewhere.
The growth of tourism on the island, which gained independence from Britain
in 1979, has been accompanied by debates echoed in holiday destinations
around the world.
Should the island build large resort hotels, with their own restaurants and
leisure facilities? Or should it encourage smaller hotels, so that tourists
buy their food in local shops and restaurants? How can it ensure that the
benefits of tourism spread to the wider population rather than being
restricted to a few, usually foreign, hotel owners? Above all, how can St
Lucia persuade the 375,000 visitors to the island each year that it has a
history and culture worth learning about?
'There is more to this country than just lying on a beach and drinking rum
punch all day,' says Stephen McNamara, one of the island's leading lawyers
and chairman of the St Lucia Tourist Board.
Despite its small population, St Lucia has produced two Nobel Prize winners:
Sir Arthur Lewis, for economics, and the poet Derek Walcott, for literature.
There is some resentment in St Lucia over the attitude of tourists from
wealthier countries who often regard the island as little more than an
alluring escape from harsher climates and a more frenetic pace of life.
In 1948, long before tourism became the international industry it is today,
Walcott worried about his island:
'Found only
In tourist booklets, behind ardent
binoculars;
Found in the blue reflection of eyes
That have known cities and think
us here happy.
St Lucia has made several attempts to present itself to the tourist market
as a country with much more to offer than sun and sea.
It recently hosted an international jazz festival, its third.
McNamara says the tourist board is looking at ways of developing St Lucia as
a destination for fishing tournaments.
The most vigorous debate on the island, however, concerns not what tourists
should do when they get there but where they should stay during their
holiday.
Cletus Springer, permanent secretary at the tourism ministry, says that
two-thirds of the island's 3,100 hotel rooms are in inclusive resorts -
those in which the visitors pay for their meals in advance.
Restaurateurs on the island have complained that the growth of all-inclusive
hotels has deprived them of business. Other critics say the hotels are
denying St Lucians access to the publicly owned beaches and that they buy
most of their supplies abroad.
The reputation of the hotels for being unsympathetic to the island's
population has been exacerbated by allegations of maltreatment from a local
barrister and a musician.
The complaints from the restaurateurs have led to the establishment of a
government task force, chaired by McNamara, which reported earlier this
year. It found that all-inclusive hotels have the advantage of achieving
higher occupancy levels and room rates than their conventional counterparts.
The task force says, however, that local farmers should view all-inclusive
hotels as a market for food and vegetables. This would enable farmers to
move away from their dependence on bananas.
The island has launched a scheme called Adopt-a-Farmer. Under the scheme,
hotels offer a guaranteed price to a local farmer for specified quantities
of fruit and vegetables, provided they are of sufficiently good quality.
The scheme is still in its infancy, with six farmers so far participating.
But there is some scepticism about its prospects. One local businessman
says: 'They've been trying to do this sort of thing for donkey's years. You
can buy these things much more cheaply in Miami. That's a fact of life.'
The government is attempting to boost business in other areas. Current
legislation provides import and other tax exemptions for hotels, allowing
them to bring in many of their supplies free of duty.
A new law is being prepared to extend these privileges to restaurants,
owners of water sport facilities and other tourism-related businesses.
But, above all, the government says it is determined to keep the development
of tourism under control. Springer says St Lucia does not want to have more
than 5,000 hotel rooms available on the island, a figure it expects to reach
by the end of the decade.
But with unemployment on the island running at 20 per cent, many doubt
whether the government will keep hotel developers out after the 5,000 rooms
have been built.
Keith Martel, general manager of Windjammer Landing, a local hotel and
resort, says: 'At the end of the day, money talks. If there is a proposal
for another all-inclusive resort there will be an absolute hue and cry on
the island. But I can't see the government turning it down.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Freedom to own and to pollute
 -The effects of Albania's new economic activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albania's nascent environmental movement managed the impossible earlier this
month. It obtained police permission to block traffic and distribute
leaflets in the capital's main square - thus marking Tirana's first
environmental demonstration.
Further demonstrations have been vetoed by police, but Perla, the
environmental organisation behind the event, remains proud. It managed to
highlight its three main concerns for the capital: worsening traffic, loss
of parkland, and the need for environmental law enforcement.
All three are a function of the former communist country's liberalisation
and transition to a market economy, begun in 1991 when the first multi-party
elections took place.
People can now own cars, land, cattle and businesses, and watch foreign
television. It is the uncontrolled nature of the new economic activity that
threatens to exacerbate Albania's already serious environmental problems.
Since 1991, 150,000 private cars have entered Albania. They are usually old,
often unsafe. Private kiosks, selling everything from beer to bananas, pop
up overnight on precious parkland. More than 300 have appeared in green
spaces in Tirana - their daily rubbish dumped on the remaining parkland.
Even satellite dishes are an environmental hazard. An estimated 25,000 have
appeared in the past three years - their constant use helping to overload
the country's inadequate power system. People then cut trees illegally for
heating and cooking.
Albania is a mountainous country, devoted largely to agriculture.
Uncontrolled land use and grazing have caused soil erosion, worsening
deforestation and silting up rivers. Industries such as manufacturing and
mining have dumped - and continue to dump - toxic and hazardous waste on to
land, into rivers and along the Adriatic coastline. Near the port of Durres,
40km from Tirana, a 10cm layer of caustic soda covers 10 acres of land. At
Tepelena, in the south, there are large pools of petrol - some on fire -
leaked from oil and gas extraction.
But perhaps the most pressing issue, affecting all of the country's 3.3m
people, is water and sanitation. Few people have constant - let alone clean
 -water in their homes, because the distribution system is so dilapidated.
Tirana's water pipes have an estimated 35,000 holes in them, wasting about
40 per cent of the water supply - and in places blending drinking water and
sewage. There is no sewage treatment in Albania.
Mention the environment and the common response is that there are more
serious problems - poverty, housing, unemployment. Nevertheless, 12
environmental organisations have been established since 1991. International
organisations are also helping: the World Bank and the United Nations
Development Programme are contributing to a national water strategy; the
Worldwide Fund For Nature is considering projects for endangered species;
and VOCA, the American volunteers organisation, is researching ways of
reclaiming wetlands.
Last year, Albania's parliament passed legislation aimed at preventing and
reducing pollution, conserving species and habitats, and regulating natural
resource use.
Environmental impact assessments are required for designated projects and
activities, and a comprehensive National Environmental Action Plan drafted
last summer has called for investment worth about Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.2m)
over three years.
It is a tall order. Albania has no environment ministries, just a 10-man
Committee of Environmental Preservation and Protection, under the ministry
of health, with an annual budget of Dollars 160,000.
Who will control the much-needed foreign investment as Albania develops?
Arben Pustina, of CEPP's Forestry Directorate, says: 'We would like all
foreign investors in Albania to build as they would in their own countries.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Labels to cut back logging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia, one of the world's biggest forestry producers, is to introduce an
eco-labelling system for wood products. The move comes in response to
criticism from environmentalists about the scale of illegal logging in the
country.
The scheme, to begin on an experimental basis this year and to become fully
operational in 1997, will label all wood products with information about
where the wood originated and how it was processed.
Although the Indonesian government will be involved in the scheme,
Djamaludin Surjohadikusomo, the forestry minister, says he hopes it
eventually will be independent of government. It will be headed by Emil
Salim, the former environment minister, and non-governmental organisations
will be invited to participate.
'The forestry industry needs a sustainable supply,' says Djamaludin, a
former forester. 'Without it, the industry will commit suicide.'
The government may provide some initial funding, but Djamaludin says he
would like to see the scheme financed by the industry or international
agencies.
The initiative has been welcomed by leading environmental groups. 'The
eco-labelling debate is a way of bringing a lot out into the open,' says
Suraya Afiff of Walhi, the local branch of Friends of the Earth.
Walhi has estimated that illegal logging amounts to as much as 30-40 per
cent of the 30 cu m of timber which are officially logged each year.
Djamaludin puts it much lower - at 4-6m cu m.
Mohammad Hasan, who controls ITCI, one of the country's largest timber
companies, and also heads Apkindo, the powerful plywood trade group, says
fairness requires that countries producing non-tropical timber should also
have eco-labelling schemes.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Management: Auditor takes on TV's darlings - Charles Allen,
Granada chief, has big plans for LWT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I really liked Cracker. I thought it was very powerful,' says Charles
Allen, Granada Television's chief executive. The 37-year-old Scot from
Lanark who began work as a trainee accountant at British Steel is not
talking as a viewer but as someone who read the original script. He also
turned up to see Robbie Coltrane film the off-beat police series in a leaky
shed in Manchester.
Allen's artistic judgment is not what he's paid for - though for what it's
worth Cracker and Prime Suspect were the only ITV award winners at this
year's British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards ceremony.
His preparedness to understand the product and the process, though - as
someone who had no previous experience in television - is an important
feature of a management approach which has paid off handsomely at Granada
and which is likely to help shape that company's integration of London
Weekend Television.
'I probably read about two or three scripts a week,' says the man whose
appointment in September caused alarm and despondency among some programme
makers.
'In Granada I look at the whole development slate (of new programmes). It's
much more about involvement than saying to programme executives: 'don't make
this, or make that'. They obviously know much better than I do what works,'
he says.
Allen has been reading himself into running LWT since Granada's takeover in
March and the subsequent departure of LWT chairman Sir Christopher Bland and
chief executive Greg Dyke.
In another move last week, Nick Elliott, managing director of LWT
Productions, the company's programme-making arm, decided after 22 years to
seek security in BBC Television as head of drama serials.
The latest step in the integration of the two companies came yesterday with
the announcement that Granada's advertising sales house, Time Exchange, and
LWT's Laser would be merging.
But the big plan for the future of a united Granada-LWT television group -
who does what and who will survive - will be unveiled in the next four of
five weeks.
Allen's ability to double profits in three years, a target he sets himself
when taking over responsibility for a business and which he achieved when
running the contract catering business of Compass, the Granada leisure
division and Granada Television, bodes well for the recently acquired
company. He is nevertheless cautious about the scope for increasing profits
at LWT - he admits it is already a well-run company.
Allen concedes that even for someone who relishes change, the television
sector is quite a challenge.
'To find an industry (television) that was changing completely at the same
time as you were looking for a company to change completely, that was the
big difference,' says Allen, whose career since 1983 has followed that of
his mentor Gerry Robinson, chief executive of the Granada group.
Allen spells out six rules for improving company profitability:
Only employ top management even if it costs a lot of money;
Keep management teams small to simplify communications;
Get really upset when you are not getting quality;
Make sure all staff sell services or programmes aggressively;
Insist on a full price and prompt payment if you are confident of the
services you are selling;
Don't waste money doing it.
When he started applying the rules to Granada, he found that despite its
reputation for tight management the contrary was the case. More than Pounds
1m was saved, for instance, by new single-supplier agreements. Granada had
at one time five separate video tape suppliers - and spent Pounds 500,000 a
year on taxis.
The number of people working on a programme has also been tackled by
changing the ratio of staff to contractors. As a result, around 250 people
previously on staff are now freelance.
Allen's efforts at Granada have paid off. It is the only ITV company to earn
more revenue from its programme sales to the ITV network centre, which
commissions and schedules programmes, than it pays for its share of the
national ITV network.
While running Granada Television, Allen has insisted on closer links between
programme makers and the commercial staff selling advertising.
Together they have dreamed up new regional programmes aimed at young males
in response to competition from Channel 4.
Allen says that change at Granada has produced positive results mainly
because he stuck to his original plan and never forgot it.
'The key is putting systems in place and coming back tenaciously every
single month,' he says.
Equally deliberately, Allen keeps Fridays free to catch up. That is when his
staff really need to watch out.
Some will get scrawly handwritten notes saying he's liked something they've
done.
But in an industry where everything tends to be 'wonderful darling', Allen
balances the congratulatory notes with telephone calls expressing extreme
disappointment.
Allen says he has spotted another script that is up to the Cracker standard.
It is called Band of Gold.
'I think it will be quite a strong and important piece. That's the one I
will be banking on next year,' he says.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Management: Bedless but not bedlam - The UK's hospital
league tables are published today. Alan Pike on coming to terms with the
internal market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Support the Save Guy's Campaign.' Roadside hoardings urging public
resistance to government plans for the future of the famous London teaching
hospital, irregularly painted in an amateur hand, have become a familiar
sight around south London.
Inside Guy's, senior managers of the National Health Service's biggest trust
are preparing plans to merge with nearby St Thomas' hospital, bring a
university complex to the Guy's site and develop Britain's most advanced
bedless hospital. It is one of the most fascinating managerial tasks in the
NHS. Yet the managers' grip on the public imagination is well behind that of
the anonymous sign writer.
Organisers of campaigns against hospital closures hold all the emotional
cards. Managers' plans for restructuring services have little hope of
competing for interest against slogans like 'Save Guy's - Save Lives'. But
in this difficult and unsettling atmosphere Tim Matthews, chief executive of
Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Trust, has begun the task of bringing the two hospitals
together and securing their long-term financial viability in the NHS
internal market.
When Matthews - formerly chief executive of St Thomas' - was selected to run
the combined trust last year, he was told by the government to prepare
proposals to merge the two south Thames hospitals. His board produced a plan
to retain the best buildings on each site, sharing services between them.
The government - influenced by calls from consultants at the hospitals for a
single site - rejected this and decided, subject to formal consultation
later this year, to house all in-patient services at St Thomas', with Guy's
used for out-patient and educational activities. Some of those same
consultants are now backing the Save Guy's campaign: when they argued for a
single site, they apparently took it for granted that it would be Guy's.
'The trust board offered a politically easier option but the government
decided to go a stage further,' says Matthews. 'Now the responsibility of
the senior management is to work for the decision and engender confidence in
it, even though some people will remain unconvinced.'
One of the most significant changes in the NHS during the 1990s has been the
growing involvement of doctors in management. Although Matthews acknowledges
that individual consultants' 'badge loyalty' to Guy's or St Thomas' will
survive for many years, he has already established a clinical management
structure spanning the two institutions.
'All the advice from management consultants was to go steady on introducing
a new structure. But we found that everybody wanted to get on with it, so we
did,' he says.
The trust now has 43 clinical directors - one for each of its medical and
surgical activities - based randomly at Guy's or St Thomas' but with
responsibility for services at both hospitals. They report to eight group
directorates, led by senior doctors supported by business teams of
operations managers, accountants and personnel officers. All eight group
directors sit on the trust's executive board - giving medical staff a
majority at this level of the decision-making process.
Responsibility for budgets rests with the clinical teams, although under the
eye of a strong central finance department. 'One of the great changes of
recent years is that we now have access to good quality information,' says
Matthews. 'It was a tradition in the NHS that if anyone told you that you
were over budget, the first thing you did was question the accuracy of their
information. Today we can have confidence in it.'
Financial controls - and financial savings - will be crucial to the future
of the Pounds 240m-turnover Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Trust. It is, like other
London hospitals, currently surviving in the NHS internal market on
temporary subsidies - in Guy's &amp; St Thomas' case Pounds 18m in 1993-94. To
balance his books and, Matthews believes, enable the trust to maintain 90
per cent of the two hospitals' present volume of activity, costs must be
reduced by 20 per cent over five years. 'This is a level of saving most big
organisations expect to achieve, particularly at a time of structural
change. Reorganisation should give us scope for sufficient efficiency
improvements.'
Cuts will include 30 per cent reductions in staffing costs over the
five-year period. Turnover in the London NHS remained high even during the
recession, and Matthews expects natural wastage to play a big part in
slimming the 6,500 workforce. Some 550 posts will go this year with only 150
redundancies.
The decision to locate all in-patient services at St Thomas' will present
the trust with a Pounds 60m-Pounds 65m bill for capital development. But
Matthews believes his share of the costs can be recouped from revenue
savings within two or three years.
If anyone is listening above the noise of the Save Guy's campaign, Matthews
stresses that the hospital is not going to close. Much of Philip Harris
House, a new technology treatment, teaching and research centre just
completed at Guy's, will, he says, be used as originally planned - notably
for day treatment activities. Philip Harris House, he says, will enable the
trust to 'test to the limit what can be done in a bedless hospital'.
Critics will not be convinced easily; neither will charitable benefactors
who pledged money for Philip Harris House which they are threatening to
withdraw unless the building is used as originally intended. These include
Sir Philip Harris, the former Harris Queensway chief executive after whom
the development is named.
This is only one way Philip Harris House has already proved something of an
embarrassment to the NHS. Originally discussed as a Pounds 30m development
which had reached Pounds 70m by the planning stage, the final outcome will
exceed Pounds 150m. Matthews is determined that, now his board has
responsibility for its own finances, controls on future developments will be
much tighter than in the old-style NHS.

FT  29 JUN 94 / People: And Shakesby buzzes off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shiraz Malik-Noor, who re-emerged as King bee at royal jelly maker Regina
after a long and acrimonious EGM in April, has strengthened his grip on the
company. The board has appointed him executive chairman. His associate Guy
Neely, a chartered accountant and former financial director of Glaxo
Holdings, has stepped down as non-executive chairman to become financial
director.
Anthony Shakesby, the former financial director who managed to hold on to
his job at the EGM, has at last buzzed off, resigning 'to pursue other
interests'.
Shakesby and former chairman Paul Geoghegan fiercely resisted Malik-Noor's
return to the company in which he is the largest shareholder. Malik-Noor had
been hived off in a coup last March.
The USM-quoted group, which has numbered Lady Thatcher, Dame Barbara
Cartland, Cliff Richard and Millwall Footballers among its customers, has
negative shareholders' funds.

FT  29 JUN 94 / People: John Kerwin packs it in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Kerwin, 47, is quitting as sales director of Dalepak, the frozen foods
group, after falling out with chief executive Chris Ivory. Kerwin, who has
been with the company for 14 years, has resigned from the board and will be
leaving the company once the terms have been settled.
Dalepak, based in North Yorkshire, has been going through a difficult
period. It is a big supplier to Britain's major supermarket chains and its
profits have been squeezed by the rise in the cost of its imported raw
materials and an inability to pass on these increases to customers. The
company gave three profit warnings last year and cut its dividend at the
halfway stage when it reported a 13 per cent fall in sales of its main
frozen foods business.
Peter Holley, Dalepak's finance director, said yesterday that Kerwin's
departure followed a disagreement over the way the company should organise
its sales effort. Ivory, the chief executive, wanted to get more involved
with the big customers like Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Kwik-Save. The two
executives 'did not see eye to eye' on the matter and Kerwin will be leaving
the company by mutual agreement.
He will not be replaced and Dalepak's sales teams will now report to Ivory.
Holley stressed that there was 'absolutely no connection' between Kerwin's
departure and Dalepak's full year figures which will be released on July 26.

FT  29 JUN 94 / People: John Page moves from the grass roots to advise
Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Page, the next head of agricultural services at Barclays Bank, believes
British farmers can best survive the rigours of the CAP reform by knowing
precisely what market they are producing for.
Page, 53, who takes over in September, comes from the agrochemicals side of
the industry. He has been director of the British Agrochemicals Association
since 1989, which has meant regular contact with the agriculture ministry
and the departments of environment and trade and industry.
The 24-strong agricultural services department of Barclays focuses on the
financial and policy outlook for agriculture, advising branches on
agricultural lending and farmers on business management.
'It's going to be a very exciting time for British agriculture, with new
crops and new opportunities,' says Page. 'I think farming should move away
from the concentration on commodities towards growing specialist crops on
contract, with the purpose for which they are grown very much in mind from
planting onwards. That will reduce the dependence on (financial) support
that some sectors have now.'
Page does not work the soil himself. But his grandfather was an Essex farmer
and Page worked on a farm for two years while studying for a national
diploma from the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.
From there he joined a seed, fertiliser and agrochemicals distributor as a
sales representative before moving to ICI Agrochemicals as technical
development and marketing manager. He then became general manager of Atlas
Interlates, a company which develops and markets agro-chemicals.
At Barclays he replaces Paul Ingram, who is retiring.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Recruitment: Brain power and the drive for enterprise - The
way we approach our work may be governed by which part of the mind controls
our thinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are thinking about a completely new job or taking a fresh look at
your career prospects, some might suggest you should have your head
examined. Not phrenology, the pseudo science of reading your bumps, but an
assessment of which part of the brain dominates your thinking.
A group of information and technology managers and directors from large
British employers, including Barclays, Tesco, the BBC and the Department of
Employment did just that last week at a one-day leadership course organised
by CSC Index, the management consultancy.
The course was set up in response to a belief, outlined recently by Peter
Breen, managing partner of Heidrick &amp; Struggles, the headhunting company,
that information technology directors of chief executive officer calibre are
beginning to emerge in the UK.
Each of the course members had completed assessments beforehand, which
measured their thinking styles. The measures were based on definitions
outlined by Ned Herrmann, a sometime physicist, sculptor and later general
manager in the US who developed the split-brain theories that emerged in the
1970s.
While many scientists working in the field were distinguishing between the
different qualities of the left and right sides of the brain, Herrmann
combined them with perceived qualities in the upper (cerebral) and lower
(limbic) brain. Thus he defined four discernible styles of thinking.
The popularity of team-working in many companies has attracted renewed
attention to his ideas as organisations attempt to create the most effective
teams, comprising people with differing but ideally complimentary approaches
to the way they tackle their work.
What do we mean by left-brained and right-brained thinking? Susaan Straus, a
Herrmann disciple and former vice-president of CSC Index, before forming her
own company, Performance Resources, explains that the left and right
hemispheres produce different patterns of thinking and one side tends to
dominate.
The left side uses sequential processing: it looks at detail, splits the
world into identifiable bits and pieces, has the power of syntax and uses
logic and the grammatical stringing together of words. The right uses
simultaneous processing, deals with the whole thing, can remember complex
images, thinks in pictures and also open-endedly.
Straus illustrates the differences with this story of two fathers, Bob
(left-brained) and Harry (right-brained) who decide to buy their sons
tricycles for their birthdays. Bob tours cycle dealers, scours catalogues,
compares prices and checks consumer reports. A mail order model seems
cheapest and best so he orders it well in advance. Harry makes a mental note
that he liked the blue bike he saw somewhere.
When the package arrives, Bob puts it to one side in a space he has prepared
and only gets it out two days before his boy's birthday. On the same evening
Harry is asking himself: 'Did I order it, and, if I did, where did I put
it?'
Bob clears a space on the garage floor, gets a bag for the rubbish, takes
out his Swiss Army pen-knife, scores the plastic wrapper and carefully
removes the instructions. He reads them, top to bottom. Each of the
components are counted out and placed in neat piles on the floor. Within
half an hour, the tricycle is assembled and ready for use.
Harry doesn't have a pen-knife. He clenches his fist and punches a hole
through the package, tearing off the plastic wrapper and cardboard and
emptying the contents over the lounge floor. A few pieces have fallen under
the sofa with the instructions.
Harry's search is short lived. He has found a little bell, just like the one
he had on his own bike as a youngster. He likes the way it rings and finds
that it's easy to fit onto the handle bars. Discovering the instructions, he
consults the picture of the completed tricycle and adopts the traditional
right-brained assembly method: if it doesn't fit, force it. In half an hour
he, too, has a fully assembled tricycle . . . alongside a small pile of
'spares'.
We probably all have a bit of Bob and Harry in us when we approach our work.
What Straus was doing with her IT group was to discover the extent to which
either style might dominate our thinking.
Splitting the brain further in the Herrmann model, those whose thinking is
dominated by the upper left brain tend to be logicians most concerned with
the question 'What?' Lower left-brained people are implementers or
organisers who address the question 'How?' Lower right-sided thinkers deal
with the question 'Why?' and are perhaps best defined as collaborators.
Upper-right sided thinkers are the visionaries who ask 'What if?'
The team-combination of such individuals can be found in fiction if not in
fact. The star ship Enterprise in Star Trek, the television series creation
of Gene Roddenberry, is led by Captain Kirk, the upper right-sided visionary
who relies heavily on Spock, his upper left-sided second in command. Scotty,
the lower left-sided chief engineer, keeps the space craft going and McCoy
is the lower right-sided, understanding doctor who finds himself at odds
with Spock.
Herrmann found certain thinking profiles dominating in different kinds of
jobs. Entrepreneurs were exceptionally upper-right minded. So were strategic
planners but with an added inclination to the upper left brain. Sales
managers had strong pulls to the upper right and lower left. Administrators
were strongly lower left minded, engineering managers strongly upper left.
Research and development managers had almost equal tendencies towards the
upper right and left sides. Chief executives had some of the most even
thinking patterns, slightly stronger towards the upper right, slightly
weaker to the lower left.
Listing the business qualities evident in these different thinking modes,
Herrmann suggests that the upper left-sided leader is good at gathering
facts, arguing rationally, logical problem solving, understanding technical
elements and considering financial aspects. A common criticism might be that
he or she is 'too critical and cold'. Lower left-sided managers are good at
finding flaws, approaching problems practically, demonstrating consistency,
stability, working on time and paying attention to detail. They might be
dismissed as 'boring or unimaginative'.
Lower right-sided managers can recognise interpersonal difficulties,
understand how others feel, can integrate, teach and engender enthusiasm.
Critics might call them a 'soft touch'. Upper right-sided people can read
signs of coming change, recognise new possibilities, inspire and problem
solve intuitively, can see the big picture. Detractors might think they have
their heads in the clouds.
Straus picked two groups of people seemingly at random, from the course
participants and asked them to go to separate rooms and draw up a brief
report listing what sort of work they liked best and common characteristics.
In fact the groups had been chosen for their right and left-sided tendencies
from their assessment scores.
Predictably the left-sided group returned punctually, while the right-sided
group was late. Not only did the various attributes fit expectations, so did
the way they were presented. The left-sided people produced a neat, numbered
list. The right-sided had jumbled lists on two sheets of paper with
crossings out.
The difficult part for organisations seeking to harness these different
thinking styles is to create their own 'Enterprise'. Straus says: 'The best
quality decisions or solutions will come from perspectives that draw on all
four thinking styles to produce the whole brain solution.' The mistake of
some managers, she says, is to write people off because they think
differently. 'The challenge is to cover all the bases.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / Spending by credit card up sharply in all sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further signs of the strength of high-street spending emerged yesterday
after the Credit Card Research Group reported that expenditure on credit and
debit cards rose sharply in all sectors last month.
The group, which conducts research on behalf of the industry, said that
total spending on cards in the three months to May was Pounds 14.05bn, 17
per cent higher than in the same period a year ago.
Spending on credit and debit cards in May itself was Pounds 5.07bn. This was
slightly better than in April, and markedly up on the level in March.
In contrast to other pick-ups earlier this year, the rise in credit-card
spending was now spread across all high-street sectors, the group said.
Food and drink accounted for the largest part of the total credit-card and
debit-card spending, with Pounds 1.037bn spent in this category last month.
Measured on a quarterly basis, food and drink expenditure was Pounds 2.93bn,
22 per cent up on a year ago.
Credit-card and debit-card spending in department stores and on mail order
was 14 per cent higher, while clothing was 16 per cent up compared with the
same quarter last year.
The group welcomed the figures as evidence that the tax rises had not yet
dented consumer spending. However, it added that the growth may also have
reflected consumers' growing use of credit cards in place of cash or
cheques.

FT  29 JUN 94 / It's official: Budget increases will not tax recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's now official. In the Treasury's view, the tax increases of last year's
two Budgets will not stall Britain's economic recovery.
The Treasury's summer economic forecast, published yesterday, revised up the
prediction of economic growth this year to 2 3/4 per cent from 2 1/2 per
cent at the November Budget. It also projects growth of 2 3/4 per cent next
year in the government's first official forecast for next year.
At the same time, underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices
index excluding mortgage interest payments, is projected to be 2 1/2 per
cent in the final quarter of this year, substantially lower than the 3 1/4
per cent forecast in the Budget. At the end of next year, the Treasury
expects underlying inflation of 2 3/4 per cent, still within the
government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range but above the lower half
of the band in which the government has pledged to have inflation by the end
of this parliament.
The prices charged by manufacturers at the factory gate are also likely to
be moving up by the end of next year. Although the Treasury expects producer
output price inflation to fall to 1 1/2 per cent by the end of this year
from 2 per cent in May and 3 per cent in autumn last year, it expects a rise
to a 'temporary peak' of 2 1/2 per cent by the end of next year, reflecting
more expensive raw materials, higher unit wage costs and pressure by
companies to increase margins.
The Treasury has been able to build its more upbeat assessment of Britain's
prospects on improvements in the world economic outlook. US growth in
particular picked up more sharply than expected in the second half of last
year and appears to have kept up momentum in the first half of this year.
While a question mark still hangs over Japan, there are 'more convincing
signs of recovery' on the European continent. Growth in the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations as a whole is now forecast to be 2 1/2 per cent
this year -  1/2 percentage point above the Budget forecast - rising to 2
3/4 per cent next year.
Recent monthly indicators 'suggest that the economy continues to have plenty
of upward momentum' with retail sales 'on a strong upward trend' and
business surveys pointing to 'continued healthy expansion of manufacturing
output in the months ahead'.
Although the forecast says growth of consumer spending may slow a little in
the short term as a result of tax increases, this is not expected to be
reflected in gross domestic product.
The forecast notes that car registrations have weakened in recent months
while recovery in the housing market has stalled. But it does not seem too
concerned by these developments.
Instead, the Treasury expects the personal savings sector ratio, which fell
last year to 11 1/2 per cent from 12 1/4 per cent in 1992, will fall further
this year to less than 10 per cent. This, and a quickening of disposable
income growth to 2 1/2 per cent next year from 1 per cent in 1994, should
enable consumers' expenditure to increase by 3 per cent both in this year
and next.
The forecast expresses measured optimism about the corporate sector and
investment. Profitability, which started to recover in 1992, is expected to
strengthen further this year. Although business investment has yet to show
signs of improving after last year's 1 1/2 per cent fall, the Treasury sees
increases of 3 1/2 per cent this year and 7 per cent next year.
Investment in private dwellings and land, which rose just  1/2 per cent last
year, is forecast to increase 4 per cent this year and 4 1/2 per cent next
year.
The UK's current account balance of payments, which showed a Pounds 11bn
deficit last year, is forecast to continue in the red but not to
deteriorate. The Pounds 9 1/2 bn shortfall forecast for this year is
unchanged from the projection in the November Budget. A further current
account deficit of Pounds 9 1/2 bn has been forecast for next year.
The Treasury expects the visible trade deficit, which was Pounds 13 1/2 bn
last year, to be unchanged this year and to narrow to Pounds 12bn next year.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Court criticises conduct of councils review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The High Court yesterday sharply criticised the conduct of the local
government review in England, but refused to overrule recommendations that
three county councils - Avon, Cleveland and Somerset - should be abolished.
It said the three councils' complaints about proposals made by the Local
Government Commission, which is charged with drawing up new council
structures, should be left to politicians, not the courts.
The ruling intensified confusion over the review. Cleveland said it was
considering an appeal, while Cambridgeshire, which was recommended for
abolition earlier this month, announced that it would also seek judicial
review.
Lord Justice Staughton said: 'Charges of irrationality were not made out.'
But he criticised leaflets - distributed by the commission as part of its
consultation exercise - which included estimates for annual savings created
by reorganisation, but made no mention of the transitional costs involved.
He said: 'We have serious reservations about the propriety of leaflets in
that form. There was mention in the argument of picking out the plums and
leaving the duff, and of conduct which in the case of a second-hand car
salesman would lead to an appearance at the Old Bailey.'
Sir John Banham, the chairman of the commission, said the literature for all
the 11 counties for which proposals were announced this month would include
transitional costs. He said Cambridgeshire was 'throwing good money after
bad', and that the county's decision to seek judicial review represented
'the triumph of hope over experience'.
He said: 'It costs Pounds 100,000 a time to seek judicial review, and this
from counties which tell us they are strapped for cash. I can't believe this
will be good for the standing of local government.'
But Mr Robin Wendt, secretary of the Labour-controlled Association of County
Councils, said that 'important issues' had been left unresolved, and that
more legal challenges by both county and district councils lay ahead.
The judgment was welcomed by the cross-party Association of District
Councils, which backs abolishing county councils and replacing them with
all-purpose unitary authorities based on merged districts. Ms Margaret
Singh, who chairs the association, described judicial review as
'inappropriate and a waste of public money when there are other avenues
available'.
The ruling clears the way for Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, to
submit formal plans for abolishing Avon and Somerset to parliament, but his
department said that no decision was imminent.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local-government spokesman, said the 'vacillation
and indecision' of ministers had thrown the whole process into confusion.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Tory MPs call for VAT review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory backbenchers said the chancellor should take advantage of the increased
room for manoeuvre which the revised forecast had given him to consider tax
cuts in his Budget in November.
There was strong support in particular for scrapping the proposed increase
to 17.5 per cent in the rate of value added tax imposed on domestic fuel.
Some MPs also urged Mr Kenneth Clarke to reduce the tax burden on
pensioners.
Mr David Shaw, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, called
for a 'slight' Pounds 1bn-Pounds 3bn easing of the tax burden and urged Mr
Clarke to consider both pegging VAT on fuel at 8 per cent and raising
personal allowances.
Other Conservatives were more cautious. Mr Charles Hendry, MP for High Peak,
said his top priority was making it clear the government was 'taking no
risks' on the economy. One senior right-winger said there was no scope for
tax cuts at all.
For Labour, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said that in spite of Mr
Clarke's 'complacency', millions of people were seeing their living
standards fall even before the Pounds 7bn of tax rises that were still to
come.
'Despite all today's boasting, Mr Clarke cannot even promise to halt next
April's doubling of VAT on fuel,' he said.
The forecasts make the Treasury look rather more optimistic than the City
about the underlying inflation outlook in the fourth quarter of 1995. The
City is expecting 3.2 per cent; the Treasury 2.75 per cent.
Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,
a member of the Treasury's so-called panel of 'wise men' who advise the
chancellor, said: 'Some of the things which have slowed down inflation are
not likely to continue.'
Similarly, former 'wise man' Mr Andrew Sentance of the London Business
School said Treasury inflation forecasts 'have tended to be an expression of
what they would like to see, as well as what they expect to happen'. In his
view, the Treasury has underestimated the extent to which the tightening in
the labour market and increases in indirect taxes will affect earnings and
thus prices.
Mr Bill Martin of UBS, who has consistently warned that the recovery will
swiftly lead to inflation and a balance of payments crisis, pointed to the
Treasury's poor record in forecasting events such as the late-1980s Lawson
boom or the early 1990s recession. And Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge
University said: 'This forecast doesn't give any grounds at all for a tax
cut.' Consumption is already on the high side, he argues, and a
demand-inflating tax cut would put further pressure on the balance of
payments.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Unsettled picture on mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Figures released yesterday by the British Bankers Association gave a mixed
picture of the state of the mortgage market, and failed to resolve doubts
about the strength of the recovery in the housing market.
The association reported a 10 per cent increase to Pounds 1.58bn in new
gross mortgage lending undertaken by leading British banks last month,
compared with Pounds 1.43bn in April.
The statistics also showed a rise in the number of new mortgages approved by
banks from 26,989 to 30,000, and a rise in their total value from Pounds
1.38bn to Pounds 1.58bn.
But the amount of gross lending in May was scarcely higher than the Pounds
1.56bn equivalent in the same month last year, and there were more approvals
in May 1993, amounting to 33,690. Similarly the value of loans approved in
May last year - at Pounds 1.63bn - was higher than those approved last
month.
Mr David Dooks, assistant director of statistics at the association,
contrasted the rise in new gross lending undertaken by banks last month with
the sharp drop from Pounds 974m to Pounds 806m in the new net lending
carried out by societies.
He said banks seemed to be regaining some of the share of the mortgage
market that they had ceded to building societies. Banks performed strongly
against societies last year but fell back somewhat in the early months of
this year as societies became more aggressive.
The leading British banks include eight of the 20 largest mortgage lenders
in the UK.
Lord Inchyra, association director-general, said that the latest statistics
appeared to suggest that the lower figures in April were an anomaly -
perhaps caused by the shorter working month rather than a reaction to tax
increases. The banks' figures gave 'a slightly rosier view of the mortgage
market than the recent building society figures,' he added.
Mortgage lenders say that the unsettled picture presented by the monthly
figures comes partly from the rush to take advantage of the very low
fixed-rate mortgages temporarily on offer earlier this year, which affected
the flow of business. While there are still some within the sector who are
confident about the recovery, many lenders seem to be less optimistic now
than they were three months ago.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Charity shop profits drop 10%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at charity shops fell 10 per cent in the last year, a survey of
their finances said yesterday. The typical shop generated income each week
of Pounds 868 to produce a surplus over costs of Pounds 237 this year,
compared with income of Pounds 963 and a surplus of Pounds 262 last year,
the magazine NGO Finance said.
Nearly 90 per cent of income came from donated goods with the remainder from
bought-in goods and cash donations. The proportion of income from bought-in
goods fell 29 per cent over the last 12 months.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Relocation 'not hit' by tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no evidence that employers are cutting relocation as a result of
tax changes, the Confederation of British Industry and accountancy firm
Ernst &amp; Young said yesterday.
Relocation expenses and benefits are now subject to a cap of Pounds 8,000,
there are strict new time limits, and the Inland Revenue lays down strict
reporting requirements.
The CBI survey said that employers who spend between Pounds 20,000 and
Pounds 25,000 per person on relocation within the UK are finding new ways of
containing costs.
However, nearly half the 577 respondents either have no system or an
inadequate system for tracking and reporting relocation expenses.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Royal Ordnance contract extended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has extended part of a big ammunition contract awarded to
Royal Ordnance last year in a deal worth about Pounds 40m to the British
Aerospace subsidiary.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, announced last night that
the government had agreed to extend the small arms element of the Pounds
200m contract for a further two years to cover 1998-99 and 1999-2000.
He said the decision should help to maintain jobs at the factory at Radway
Green in Cheshire, which employs nearly 600 people.
The company won the original five-year contract to supply ammunition ranging
from small arms to tank shells last October against stiff competition. BAe
is considering collaboration between Giat, the French state-owned arms
manufacturer, and Royal Ordnance.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Housing policy changes 'essential'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in housing policy are essential to support the labour market
flexibility needed to improve the UK's competitiveness, the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation says today, John Willman writes.
The social research organisation says in a report that home ownership, the
government's preferred form of tenure, is unsuitable for people whose income
fluctuates or who must make frequent job moves.
Flexible employment practices are bringing more frequent job changes, less
security of employment, greater mobility and increasing fluctuations in
household income, the report says. Home-ownership imposes extra costs on
those required to move.
It is easier for those with fluctuating incomes to rent, rather than buy,
the report says, since people on low incomes qualify for housing benefit.
The report warns that a further drive to increase home ownership could
destabilise the housing market and damage the economy.
More must be done to create a balanced housing market. It recommends
continuing to phase mortgage interest tax relief, grants to private
landlords to encourage renting and more help for those in mortgage arrears.
The report warns that negative equity, mortgage arrears and repossessions
remain persistent problems, especially in the south of England.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Treasury makes big cut in gilts funding needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced a substantial Pounds 5bn downward
revision in the volume of gilt-edged securities that it will need to sell in
this financial year even though it is cutting only slightly its forecast for
the public sector borrowing requirement.
In its summer economic forecast, the Treasury envisages a PSBR of Pounds
36.1bn, equivalent to 5 1/4 per cent of gross domestic product, for the year
to the end of March 1995 compared with Pounds 38bn forecast in the November
1993 Budget.
But sales of gilts will have to total only about Pounds 32bn in 1994-95 to
meet the objective of fully funding the deficit compared with an estimate in
March this year of gilt sales of Pounds 37bn. Of the Pounds 32bn, the Bank
of England has already sold gilts worth Pounds 4.55bn since the beginning of
April.
To arrive at the Pounds 32bn, the Treasury said it has carried over a
cumulative overfund of the 1993-94 deficit that it estimates at Pounds 2 1/4
bn. Against this, some Pounds 8 1/2 bn of gilts are expected to mature in
1994-95. With foreign currency reserves assumed to stay unchanged on
balance, the overall funding requirement for the current financial year is
forecast at about Pounds 42bn compared with Pounds 47bn three months ago.
National Savings are expected to contribute about Pounds 3 1/2 bn towards
funding the deficit while a further Pounds 6.8bn of gilt-edged securities
sold to banks and building societies in 1992-93 will be counted towards
funding before the end of this financial year.
The government expects a further improvement in the UK's public finances in
1995-96. The PSBR for the coming financial year is now forecast at Pounds
27.9bn compared with the Pounds 30bn forecast in the November Budget. If the
1995-96 target is met, the PSBR will have fallen to 4 per cent of GDP from 7
1/4 per cent in 1993-94, when the deficit totalled Pounds 46bn.
The Pounds 2bn improvement now expected in the 1994-95 PSBR mainly reflects
a Pounds 1.9bn increase in revenues expected this year. The principal change
is an expected Pounds 1 1/4 bn increase in corporation tax receipts compared
with the Budget forecast, which largely reflects better than expected
profits in 1993.
The Treasury said yesterday that its forecasts for income tax and value
added tax are also higher than in the Budget, but these are offset partly by
downward revisions to the forecast receipts from petroleum revenue tax,
excise duties, business rates and capital gains tax.
Although unemployment has fallen more sharply than expected in last
November's Budget, the government expects only a modest Pounds  1/4 bn
decline in cyclical social security payments in the current financial year
compared with earlier forecasts. Improved privatisation proceeds are
expected to play an important role in reducing the PSBR for 1995-96. The
government now expects that sales of electricity company debt and equity
will boost privatisation income to Pounds 2 1/2 bn in the coming financial
year from Pounds 1bn predicted in the November Budget.
The government's PSBR projections could be overturned by any changes to
existing tax and spending plans in the Budget on November 29 this year.
At present, however, the Treasury envisages that tax as a share of GDP will
increase sharply to 37 per cent by the end of 1995-96 from about 34 per cent
in 1993-94.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Industry warned on foreign rivals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A research centre to help industries close performance gaps with foreign
companies was launched yesterday by Cardiff Business School.
Professor Daniel Jones, director, warned that most UK companies must at
least double productivity and sharply improve quality if they are to survive
against competition, particularly from from south-east Asia.
The centre and partners Andersen Consulting have embarked on a benchmarking
exercise between 75 UK and Japanese companies following a similar exercise
which compared the UK and Japanese motor components industries. That found
Japanese companies on average to be twice as productive as UK counterparts,
and 100 times better on quality.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Six London radio licences attract 41 bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Radio Authority yesterday received 41 applications for six London radio
licences including 12 applications to provide an adult contemporary music
service - aimed at an audience aged between 25 and 50.
The groups fighting for the right to fill what they see as the big remaining
gap in the London commercial radio market - playing music such as Elton
John, Fleetwood Mac and Simply Red - include: Chrysalis, the music and
entertainment group; televiTrans World Communications, the radio group;
Metro, the Newcastle commercial radio station that is trying to break into
the London market; Emap, the magazine and radio group; and Energy London, a
consortium led by the French commercial radio group NRJ.
Mr Richard Eyre, managing director of Capital Radio, which yesterday
reapplied for its two London licences, warned that launching an adult
contemporary service would tend to cannibalise Capital's audience and
advertising revenues without offering the maximum possible diversity.
The Radio Authority is required to seek applicants who offer the maximum
possible choice for the 6.2m to 7.3m adults expected to be covered by the
new licences.
In addition to the two licences that are expected to be retained by Capital,
two new FM and two new AM licences are on offer.
Mr Richard Branson, who runs Virgin 1215, the national AM commercial
station, and who previously failed to win a better quality FM national
licence, is trying again in London. Virgin Radio has applied for an FM
licence to broadcast 'existing Virgin 1215 rock-orientated music output with
speech content specific to London'.
Apart from adult contemporary and other popular music there are applications
for classic and album rock, alternative, and soft music services, as well as
for two arts services.
Art FM is promising a mixture of entertainment and arts coverage with
non-pop music while Festival Radio is offering independent music, comedy,
arts, interviews and listings.
A number of formats that failed to win a licence last time are trying again.
These include London's Business radio, London Christian Radio and Viva -
speech and music in a magazine format aimed at women listeners.
There are also two competing sports services, a range of ethnic and
international broadcasting aimed at Arabic-speaking and Pakistani listeners
plus Radio France Internationale and a service for parents of pre-school
children.
The intense interest in the new licences is a further sign of the growing
attractiveness of commercial radio.
Last year revenue in the sector grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 178.5m. This
was because of the higher profile generated by the new national stations and
the better selling of radio advertising, which added up to a record 3.4 per
cent of all advertising. Some analysts now believe a 5 per cent share for
radio is possible.
The Radio Authority will decide which of the 41 applicants will get licences
by this autumn.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Outhwaite gives expert evidence in Gooda case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Outhwaite, the Lloyd's underwriter, agreed in the High Court
yesterday that he could not vouch for the competence of underwriters on
three Gooda Walker syndicates.
Mr Outhwaite was giving evidence as an expert witness for the Gooda Walker
agency which is being sued for negligence by 3,095 Lloyd's Names.
He agreed that, when he submitted reports to the court before the hearing
began, he had considered that Mr Anthony Willard, an underwriter on
syndicate 299, and Mr Stanley Andrews, an underwriter for syndicate 298, had
acted reasonably competently.
His one reservation had been the scale of liabilities to which Mr Andrews
had allowed syndicate 298 to be exposed. These, he had said in his report,
were 'in excess of what I believe to be reasonable'.
However, under cross-examination by Mr Geoffrey Vos, QC for the Names, he
later agreed that he could not form a view of Mr Andrews' competence.
Questioned on his present view of Mr Willard's competence as an underwriter,
Mr Outhwaite replied: 'I am not expressing any opinion on that particular
topic.'
He was also unable to express any view about the competence of Mr Derek
Walker, the former Gooda Walker managing agency chairman and underwriter on
syndicate 290, he told the court.
Mr Outhwaite was later asked whether it should be a basic principle of sound
underwriting practice that a balance should be kept between the income from
premiums and the risks to which syndicates were exposed.
He agreed that a syndicate should not be placed at risk of collapsing in the
event of a single substantial claim. However, he insisted that the concept
of 'balance' was almost meaningless in the context of high-risk syndicates.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Tighter rules on university status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday tightened the criteria
that higher education institutions must meet to achieve university status.
He told the Higher Education Quality Council, the self-regulating body, that
institutions would need to have taught degree courses to at least three
year-groups - taking five years in total for three-year courses - before
they could award degrees in their own right. They would then need a track
record of not less than three years of 'successfully maintaining degree
standards'.
Only about five or six higher education colleges are interested in becoming
universities.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Changes to legal training proposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fundamental changes in education and training for solicitors and barristers
in England and Wales have been put forward by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory
Committee on Legal Education and Conduct.
The committee yesterday published a consultation paper on the initial stages
of legal education covering law degrees and conversion courses for non-law
graduates.
It proposes that a prescribed common element to law degrees should be
retained but the emphasis should move away from subjects to be studied, such
as contract, tort and crime, to a small number of broad aims, such as
understanding the fundamental principles and concepts of English and EC law
and an understanding of law's social, economic, political, historic, ethical
and cultural context.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Sketch by Manet sold for Pounds 4.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Un Bar Aux Folies Bergere', not Manet's famous painting in the Courtauld
Institute, London, but his preliminary sketch, which shows a young barmaid
as obviously up for sale as her merchandise, sold for Pounds 4.4m at
Sotheby's last night, Antony Thorncroft writes.
It was one of two highlights that ensured the success of the auction of
Impressionist and Modern pictures and suggested that the recession might
finally be coming to an end in this crucial, high-priced sector of the arts
market. The Manet, which had been in a private Dutch collection since the
1920s, had been forecast to sell for Pounds 3m.
The other important lot, one of the 10 versions of poplars painted by Monet
in 1891, did even better, selling for Pounds 4.84m. This compares well with
the price paid for the last picture of poplars from the series which
appeared at auction in New York during the boom of the late 1980s and sold
for a similar sum.
The auction totalled Pounds 19.83m and was a very reasonable 78 per cent
sold by value.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Copier leasing industry warned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Photocopier leasing companies criticised in March by the Office of Fair
Trading for unscrupulous selling practices have been given three months to
clean up the industry or risk losing their consumer credit licences, Robert
Rice writes.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday said the
industry had until the end of September to meet higher standards of
transparency in leasing contracts.
He told the Institute of Trading Standards Administration conference in
Brighton that he believed in freedom of contract within wide limits. But
onerous contract terms such as long-term leases for machines with short
lives, or lease and service-inclusive cost-per-copy contracts, with an
obligation to pay for a minimum volume of usage, should be drawn to
customers' attention.
Sir Bryan said: 'Engaging in misrepresentation or deceitful selling
practices, or failing to observe high standards of transparency about all
the main terms and conditions of a contract, are likely to be inconsistent
with fitness to hold a consumer credit licence.'
He has said that he will carry out a further review of the industry at the
beginning of next year.

FT  29 JUN 94 / McDonald's fights 'poisoning' claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The McDonald's fast food chain yesterday asked the High Court in London to
halt a campaign by environmentalists accusing it of poisoning customers,
exploiting Third World countries and employing cheap labour.
A leaflet distributed four years ago contained a 'wholesale attack on almost
every aspect of McDonald's business', said Mr Richard Rampton QC.
It was 'completely false in every material respect', he told Mr Justice Bell
at the start of a libel action expected to run for up to four months.
Yet London-based environmental campaigners Mr Dave Morris and Ms Helen Steel
had published, as recently as the day before, material repeating the
allegations.
McDonald's, said Mr Rampton, was seeking to protect its reputation for
'uniform excellence' in the quality of its products, the well-being of its
customers, the welfare of employees and respect for communities and the
environment.
Mr Rampton was explaining why the world's biggest food service organisation,
with 14,000 restaurants in 70 countries, was pressing ahead with its action.
Mr Morris, 39, and Ms Steel, 28, who say their allegations are justified,
are unwaged and conducting their own defence because they cannot afford
lawyers. Legal aid is not available in libel actions. They are members of
the London Greenpeace group, which has no connection with Greenpeace
International.
McDonald's has no prospect of recovering more than nominal damages or its
legal costs, which could run to more than Pounds 1m. Mr Rampton made clear
that the main purpose of the action was to secure an injunction banning them
from repeating their allegations.
Mr Rampton said the allegations in the 'malicious' leaflet - entitled
'What's Wrong with McDonald's? Everything They Don't Want You to Know' - had
begun to appear with alarming frequency in the 'respectable media', both
nationally and locally.
The case is being heard without a jury because the courts have ruled that
the issues require careful and prolonged examination of complex scientific
evidence culminating in a reasoned judgment.
Mr Rampton said the dispute was not about freedom of speech because the
freedom laws did not extend to the dissemination of falsehoods about other
people.
'There may well be people who don't like McDonald's food, either because it
is made from meat or because they don't like the taste, and they may wish to
give expression to their views, sometimes in strong terms,' he said.
'McDonald's may not like it, but would not try to stop honest criticism.
What they will always seek to prevent is the dissemination of false factual
information about the company, its business and its products.'
The hearing continues today when the defendants will outline their case.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Dairy trade concerned at Milk Marque price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dairy trade yesterday expressed concern at an increase in prices being
asked by Milk Marque, the dairy farmers' co-operative that will succeed the
Milk Marketing Board when the industry is liberalised in November.
Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque chief executive, announced that the group would
initially seek an average price of 25p per litre from dairy companies, 3.8
per cent higher than the board's average for 1993-94. 'The eventual prices
that Milk Marque will sell at will largely be determined by customers'
bidding behaviour,' he said. 'We are asking how much milk they would like to
buy from us at the prices we are quoting.'
Dairy companies pointed out the percentage rise was much higher for butter
and cheese manufacturers, compared with present prices. Mr John Price,
director-general of the Dairy Trade Federation, said: 'They are very
significant increases on current prices, which are based on the market. This
is exactly why we expressed concern about Milk Marque's monopoly position in
the first place.'
Milk Marque's initial sale prices range from 23.4p a litre to 26.3p a litre.
The lowest price is 11 per cent higher than the 21.1p that butter
manufacturers are paying for their milk, and nearly 9 per cent above the
price paid by Cheddar cheese makers.
Among the leading processors is Dairy Crest, the Milk Marketing Board
subsidiary which is to be floated on the stock market. Milk Marque said: 'We
don't treat Dairy Crest any differently from any other company.'
Mr Dare has argued that butter and cheese companies will be able to pay more
in the free market because they will be able to operate at a higher capacity
once they can secure the supplies they need.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Court backs ban on sex line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A telephone watchdog yesterday won a High Court case allowing it to ban an
overseas-based telephone sex-chat line.
The ruling, which allows Icstis, the watchdog for premium-rate telephone
lines, to ban a sex-chat line that advertises in the UK press but is based
in Guyana, is seen as an important test case on the powers of the watchdog
to regulate foreign-based premium-rate services.
An attempt by Icstis earlier this month to ban the line was stopped by a
court injunction after Icstis had recommended to British Telecommunications
that it bar access to the lines.
The line, One to One, claimed that its service was not covered by the
watchdog's code of practice. It advertised in the Daily Sport newspaper in
contravention of an Icstis ban on the advertising of sex-chat lines in
publications other than top-shelf magazines.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the Vice-Chancellor, ruled in the High Court that One
to One had no real prospect of succeeding in its claim. Sir Donald also
lifted the injunction on Icstis seeking to bar One to One's access to BT
lines.
Under new rules about to be introduced, callers to pornographic phone lines
will need a personal identification number to listen in. Adult phone lines
are produced and managed by independent operators using lines leased from
BT.
Premium-rate charges for UK calls are 49p a minute at peak time and 39p
off-peak, of which about two-thirds goes to the operator.
BT said that its market research showed that more than 90 per cent of
customers supported an opt-in for adult services. It already offers
customers the option of barring premium-rate calls on their phones.
Before the restrictions were introduced, about 700,000 calls a week were
made to recorded and live adult telephone lines.
The total premium-rate industry was estimated to be worth about Pounds 250m
in 1992, with 6m calls made a week.

FT  29 JUN 94 / DoT land purchases attacked: National Audit Office says
Pounds 1.1bn spending for roads was mostly unnecessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Transport has spent more than Pounds 1.1bn since 1986 on
acquiring land and property to build roads, most of which are unlikely to be
needed, says a report to be published today by the National Audit Office.
The public expenditure watchdog says delays in finalising the route of trunk
roads and motorways force the department to buy far more property than is
eventually needed.
It also criticises the department for wasteful management of its growing
estate. Property records are incomplete, rent arrears are more than double
the target level, vacancy levels are too high and sales of surplus property
take too long, the NAO says.
The government's road-building plans mean the transport department has been
acquiring and managing increasing amounts of property. Property-owners
blighted by plans for new roads and road widening can ask the department to
buy their property. But the NAO found that about 60 per cent of properties
bought under these provisions were not required when the final route for
road schemes was decided. In one scheme for widening junctions on the M20
motorway, 78 per cent of the property bought was not needed.
The main reason for the unnecessary purchases is delay in finalising
preferred routes, says the NAO. In the cases examined for the report it had
taken an average of 10 years to decide a preferred route after announcing a
scheme. Two schemes took 20 years or more.
Some Pounds 220m was spent buying property in 1992-93, and just Pounds 10m
released by selling unwanted parts of the estate. Annual spending on
acquiring land had increased by 200 per cent in three years.
The cost to the department of managing its estate was Pounds 4.3m in
1992-93, bringing in rental income of Pounds 7.5m. The management of much of
the property is contracted out to seven housing associations, a residential
property agent and seven commercial and agricultural agents.
Rent arrears of Pounds 2m had accumulated by March 1993, more than Pounds
500,000 of which was judged by the agents to be irrecoverable.
The level of arrears, 21 per cent of collectable rents, was more than double
the department's target. More could be done to collect the arrears, the NAO
says. An additional Pounds 300,000 a year could be brought in by charging
market rents, the NAO estimates. And further action is needed to reduce
vacancy levels, running at a quarter of the estate.
The NAO also found that almost a third of the land no longer needed for
roads had been held for more than the three-year target set by the
department for disposal - in many cases for avoidable reasons.

Property Purchased for Road Construction. HMSO. Pounds 8.15.

FT  29 JUN 94 / British Coal loss hides sharp rise in productivity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday reported a Pounds 238m loss for 1993-4, but showed
sharp improvements in productivity and operating costs in the run-up to
privatisation later this year.
Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman, said the corporation had achieved in one year
what might reasonably have been expected to take three years to accomplish.
The Selby mines complex in Yorkshire was producing coal at costs which would
enable it to be delivered to Aire Valley power stations at world competitive
prices.
Overall colliery productivity had increased by 38 per cent to an average of
8.76 tonnes a manshift (excluding shifts worked by contractors' employees)
during the year and operating costs had been reduced by 14 per cent in real
terms.
This had helped British Coal generate an operating profit of Pounds 186m in
the year to March 26.
Although this was sharply down on the Pounds 588m of 1992-93, it was
achieved on sharply lower volumes and a 20 per cent reduction in contract
prices paid by generators in England and Wales. Turnover was down from
Pounds 3.88bn to Pounds 2.66bn.
Opencast mines were the corporation's most profitable arm, contributing
Pounds 80m towards total operating profits. Deep mines made Pounds 66m and
subsidiary companies, including Coal Products, produced Pounds 39m, more
than doubling last year's Pounds 16m total.
However, exceptional items, including the costs of closures and
restructuring for privatisation totalled Pounds 305m (Pounds 996m last year)
while net interest charges amounted to Pounds 119m.
Keeping collieries open on a care and maintenance basis while negotiations
with private companies continued has cost more than Pounds 70m.
British Coal spent Pounds 10m last year preparing the industry for
privatisation. The corporation also wrote off Pounds 65m in materials at
closed collieries.
Mr Clarke said availability of government subsidy had not resulted in
significant additional sales. British Coal would not reveal the amount of
subsidy it had received but the total is thought to be below Pounds 500,000.
Mr Clarke said British Coal had won what it believed was all but a small
percentage of the available sales to the UK's three largest generators. Mr
Clarke said the most painful task of the year had been closing collieries to
bring supply and demand into a more sustainable balance after the drop in
generator contracts from 65m tonnes in 1992-3 to 40m last year and a further
fall to 30m this year.
'The price has been high . . . but for our continuing collieries to have the
chance of a sustainable future, it was a price which had to be paid.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / Opencast payout boost is defeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compensation paid to owners of land used for opencast mining must reflect
the fact that the coal belongs to the nation, the government insisted in the
Commons last night.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, successfully called on MPs to overturn a
Lords amendment to the bill privatising the coal industry which sought to
provide more generous compensation. He said the value of the coal should not
be transferred to the landowner, either directly or indirectly.
The Lords' amendment was defeated by a government majority of 68 (291-223).
Labour MPs backed the Lords' amendment, with Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow
energy minister, arguing that it would have the effect of making it easier
for deep-mined coal to compete with that from opencast sites.
The spread of opencast mining was attacked from both sides of the House and
the government was urged not to permit companies to gain access to sites
through compulsory rights orders.
An announcement by the environment department removing a reference to the
'national interest' in planning guidance - to ensure that it would no longer
be seen as amounting to a presump-tion in favour of mining development -
failed to satisfy the critics.
Mr Eggar said a government amendment introduced as a replacement for the
provisions inserted by the Lords made clear that the assessment of market
value in determining compensation must be based on the fact that the nation
owned the coal.

Unison, the public services and utilities union, yesterday said it was

Unison is seeking to apply the recent European Courts of Justice ruling

Unison said the action was the first time a union had attempted to apply

FT  29 JUN 94 / Reactor-grade plutonium was used in bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Reactor grade' plutonium - produced in commercial reactors - can be used to
build nuclear bombs, according to information released by the US energy
department.
The department revealed in a 200-page statement declassified on Monday that
plutonium from a UK reactor was used in 1962 for detonating a nuclear bomb
at the US underground test site in the Nevada desert.
Greenpeace, the environmental group, has said that British Nuclear Fuels'
Thorp plant at Sellafield in Cumbria could lead to the spread of nuclear
weapons capability. The plant, which started operating earlier this year,
extracts plutonium from used reactor fuel, and plans to send it to overseas
nuclear power companies, particularly in Japan and Germany.
The UK government has argued that plutonium from civil reactors does not
pose a security threat because constructing a bomb from the fuel is
extremely difficult. However, the Department of Trade and Industry said
yesterday: 'This test proves that it (using plutonium from reactors to make
bombs) is possible. But our understanding is that the difficulties involved
in practice were such that no one would really dream of trying it.'
The plutonium used in the US test was derived from military work carried out
by the UK Atomic Energy Authority at the Calder Hall reactor at Sellafield,
the DTI said.
BNF said yesterday: 'We have always said you need considerable skill to make
bombs from reactor-grade plutonium, not that it is theoretically
impossible.'
Ms Janet Bloomfield, who chairs the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said:
'This shows that all those who gave categoric assurances that Thorp's
plutonium cannot be used for nuclear weapons, and accused CND of
scaremongering, were lying.' And the Washington-based lobby group, Nuclear
Control Institute, called on Britain to 'halt . . . needless production of
weapon-usable plutonium'.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Literal Democrat case to start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats will tomorrow launch a High Court challenge to
overturn the result of the European parliamentary election in Devon and East
Plymouth.
The party, which narrowly lost the seat to the Conservatives, claims voters
were misled by the appearance on the ballot paper of a Literal Democrat
candidate.
Mr Richard Huggett, the retired headteacher who stood as the Literal
Democrat candidate, polled 10,203 votes in spite of not campaigning or
putting out any campaign literature.
The seat was won by the Conservative candidate Mr Giles Chichester, who
polled 74,953 votes, only 700 more than Mr Adrian Sanders, the Liberal
Democrat candidate.
The Liberal Democrats attempted to stop Mr Huggett from standing before the
election by seeking a judicial review of the returning officer's decision to
accept his nomination.
The petition to be lodged with the election court tomorrow will ask for the
election result to be declared void and for the poll to be re-run.
The election court of two High Court judges is expected to sit in London to
hear legal issues but may decide to sit in Exeter to hear evidence from the
electorate.
The Liberal Democrats intend to present sworn affidavits from 'several
hundred' voters who say they were misled into voting Literal Democrat
instead of Liberal Democrat.
Also at issue will be the number of spoilt ballot papers which resulted from
the confusion over names.
The hearing of the case is not expected until August.
This will be the first time that the issue of confusing names on the ballot
has been tested by the courts. No action was taken after a man changed his
name to Roy Jenkins to run against Lord - then Roy - Jenkins in the Hillhead
by-election in 1982.
However, the courts have shown a willingness to intervene where there is
evidence of voter confusion.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Employers told to win backing on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers who do not intend to allow employees to appoint representatives to
pension-scheme boards of trustees will have to prove that the employees have
agreed to forgo their rights, a government discussion paper proposed
yesterday.
The Department of Social Security has released a discussion document
following last week's white paper on pension reform. It spells out how
proposals allowing members to appoint up to a third of their scheme trustees
will work in practice.
The document says that employers will have to consult both employees and
pensioners on opting out of the member-trustee requirement. Employers will
then have to hold a referendum to show that members have genuinely agreed to
forgo their rights.
Many large schemes already have member trustees although some are appointed
by management. Some trustees may also be appointed by unions.
The government said it did not wish its new law to upset existing
arrangements which had proved satisfactory to both scheme members and
employers.
Schemes which opt out of the member-trustee requirement should be allowed to
do so for no more than six years at a time before being asked to review the
arrangement.
Under the proposals existing trustees should be responsible for determining
appropriate procedures for the nomination and selection of member-nominated
trustees, although employees should have the right to challenge those
procedures.
Also, no employer should be allowed to remove a member-appointed trustee,
even if that employee is sacked or leaves voluntarily. Member-trustees may
only be removed by a unanimous vote of the remaining trustees or by the new
pensions regulator, the proposals suggest.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Tory MPs rebuked on Lloyd's secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cross-party committee on MPs' interests yesterday issued a strong rebuke
to 11 Conservative MPs, including former prime minister Sir Edward Heath,
for failing to declare full details of their involvement in the Lloyd's
insurance market.
In a 23-page report it also recommended removing the requirement for MPs to
register their Lloyd's syndicate numbers for any current year and their
membership of any syndicates with open years.
The recommendation prompted Mr Peter Hain, the leftwing Labour MP, to claim
that the committee had 'caved in to backstairs manoeuvres by Lloyd's and
Tory MPs'. He called for the 11 'refuseniks' to be suspended.
The committee said that the behaviour of the 11 MPs who had not supplied
their Lloyd's syndicate numbers 'sets a bad precedent and is to be
deprecated'.
It recommended that MPs be required to disclose the categories of insurance
business they were underwriting. Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, committee
chairman, said there was a balance between individual privacy and the
public's right to know about pecuniary interests that might influence an
MP's parliamentary activities.
'We could just let the thing rot as it is and create a feeling of hostility
and unwillingness to comply,' he said.
The MPs named in the report are: Mr David Ashby (Leicestershire North West),
Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme), Mr
Michael Colvin (Romsey and Waterside), Sir Edward Heath (Old Bexley and
Sidcup), Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk North), Mr Roger Knapman (Stroud), Mr
Anthony Steen (South Hams), Mr David Tredinnick (Bosworth), Sir Gerard
Vaughan (Reading East), and Sir Jerry Wiggin (Weston-super-Mare).

FT  29 JUN 94 / Institute chief tells accountants to be more open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountancy firms should provide greater details of their own financial
strength, the new president of the UK's largest chartered accountancy body
said yesterday.
Speaking shortly after his inauguration as president of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Mr Roger Lawson told the
Financial Times that the firms should be more open.
'It is entirely appropriate that there should be greater transparency for
buyers of services so they can be satisfied of the financial strength or
otherwise of the people with whom they are doing business,' he said.
'People really should be in a position to have greater confidence in the
direction (of the firms) and not that they are just trading on brand names,'
he said, in a reference to the powerful image of the largest accountancy
firms.
His plea comes at a time when KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second largest
firm, is considering moves towards incorporation.
Mr Lawson argued that there may ultimately be a move towards an independent
review of the finances or at least the insurance assets claimed by firms in
the light of a growing number of lawsuits against them.
'It might be better if a mechanism could be found for a third party in whom
everyone had confidence to examine the figures,' he said, adding that there
would need to be safeguards to ensure that competitor information was not
passed between the firms.
Mr Lawson's remarks partly reflect his experience as an accountant in
business, unlike most of his predecessors, who were in public practice. He
works for 3i, the venture capital company.
The accountancy firms - as partnerships rather than companies - are
currently under no obligation to reveal details of their financial
performance or strength.
They are highly secretive organisations. While often urging greater
disclosure from their corporate clients they have always resisted providing
such information themselves.
Senior partners of the firms have rejected such arguments, claiming that
people would not understand the figures for profits allocated to each
partner, which include pension costs and dividends as well as salary.
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the institute, said
that greater disclosure was the responsibility of the firms and that the
institute would only intervene if such a change was proved to be in 'the
public interest'.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Labour more confident of Smith seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's confidence was growing yesterday that it would hold Monklands East,
John Smith's former seat near Glasgow, in tomorrow's by-election.
This is in spite of an aggressive campaign by the Scottish National party to
overturn a 15,712 majority and widespread discontent with Labour-run
Monklands District Council, which yesterday led to Mrs Helen Liddell, the
Labour candidate, indirectly challenging Mr Tom Clarke, Labour MP for
neighbouring Monklands West.
Labour's reviving confidence that it will scrape home in the seat is based
partly on an ICM opinion poll published on Monday night which put its
support at 50 per cent, against 43 per cent for the SNP.
This is Labour's largest lead in an opinion poll in the constituency. A poll
taken last week gave Labour a lead of 1.9 percentage points, but a third
gave the SNP a 3.3 point lead. Political observers consider the ICM poll,
conducted among 614 people between June 22 and June 25 for The Scotsman
newspaper and Scottish Television, the most thorough.
The poll also found that 74 per cent of those asked (and 60 per cent of
Labour supporters) believed that people in neighbouring Coatbridge received
a better deal from Monklands District Council than those in Airdrie, the
heart of the constituency. Some 52 per cent believed that their religious
background made a difference to the treatment they received from the
council.
Airdrie, a largely Protestant town, believes that predominantly Catholic
Coatbridge benefits more from the Labour council because most Labour
councillors are Catholic.
Mrs Liddell initially dismissed such allegations as 'tittle-tattle',
although the evidence has been public since 1992. But last week she obtained
confirmation from the council that between 1982 and 1992 Coatbridge received
Pounds 18.8m on 'strategic' capital projects, while Airdrie received
nothing. It was unacceptable, she said.
On Monday Mr Clarke, Labour's overseas development spokesman and a former
provost of Monklands, rejected Mrs Liddell's claims and dismissed criticism
of the council from Tory MPs as largely McCarthyite smears and mythology.
But yesterday Mrs Liddell said she would fight for the people of Monklands
East 'regardless of who I have to fight with. I don't care if I even have to
take on a neighbouring north Lanarkshire MP,' adding prudently 'like the
shadow secretary of state for Scotland,' Mr George Robertson, MP for
Hamilton, who was sitting beside her.
Discontent with the council is the main issue raised on the doorstep
according to canvassers for all parties. It will bring in a lot of support
for Mrs Kay Ullrich, the SNP candidate.
The poll put the Tory candidate, Mrs Susan Bell, on 5 per cent and the
Liberal Democrat, Mr Stephen Gallagher, on 2 per cent.
A victory for the SNP, which won only 18 per cent of the vote in 1992
against Mr Smith's 61 per cent, would be devastating for Labour.

FT  29 JUN 94 / School meals 'not healthy enough'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
School governors should do more to improve pupils' diets - which still
contain too much fat and sugar and too little fibre, health campaigners said
yesterday.
The School Meals Campaign said many governors now negotiated individual
contracts for catering, placing them in a good position to improve unhealthy
diets.
The campaign's chairman, Mr Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames
Valley University, said: 'As school meals contracts come up for renewal,
governors should make sure that nutritional standards are written into them.
With local management of schools and grant-maintained schools, governors
have unprecedented powers and responsibilities.'
In its school meals charter, the campaign stresses that affordable meals
should be available to all children at nationally agreed standards of
nutrition. Schools should consult with parents, provide a range of food
taking account of health, religious and ethnic preferences and try to ensure
school meals 'are a positive and enjoyable experience'.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Trade News: China urged to clarify trade rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday called on
Beijing to clarify its new foreign trade law, emphasising that little time
was left to complete negotiations on an agreement which would enable China
to rejoin the body at the start of next year.
Officials in Geneva said the provisions of the law, which was published last
month and sets out basic rules on trade and investment, were expected to
feature prominently in this week's four-day talks on China's application for
Gatt membership.
Alhough several delegations welcomed the law, most said they wanted detailed
clarification of how it would operate to ensure that it was fully consistent
with the obligations of Gatt membership.
The US and some other governments have criticised parts of the law as
obscure and have expressed concern that it could unduly restrict trade in
services and discriminate unfairly against foreign companies doing business
in China.
The European Union said yesterday that, if there were to be a calendar for
China to rejoin Gatt early next year, a formal timetable would have to be
discussed. But, it added, China would first have to improve trade offers
made in bilateral negotiations, notably on agriculture and services.
The EU delegation said it could not negotiate in August because most
officials in Brussels would be on holiday then. But the US quickly pointed
out that its government continued to function throughout the summer.
Mr Gu Yongjiang, China's vice-minister of foreign trade, called for an
acceleration of negotiations and said he hoped enough progress could be made
in talks this week for a formal accession protocol to be drawn up soon. 'The
patience of the general public of China for Gatt re-entry is ..facing a
serious test,' he said.
He said his government had submitted to the Gatt secretariat a list of its
non-tariff barriers to trade. It was ready to negotiate a reduction in some
of these and to modify its offers on agriculture and services in response to
Gatt members' demands.
However, he indicated that China, as a developing country, would seek a
transition period to comply with some Gatt obligations after it became a
member and would need time to implement some of its commitments.
He promised that China would spell out before entry those commitments it
could not fulfil immediately. He also said China's foreign trade law would
not affect its Gatt obligations.

The Malaysian Resources Corporation, complying with a government ban on
contracts for British companies, yesterday named Canada's Hydro Quebec
International to replace Britain's National Grid as its partner in a power
venture,
Corporation officials said they would own 55 per cent of the project to
install 500KV power lines for the utility Tenaga Nasional. Permodalan
Nasional, the national equity corporation, would own the remaining 45 per
cent. National Grid becomes the second British company to suffer after EPE
Power, an electrical equipment supplier, said this month it was dropping
Rolls-Royce Industrial Power as a joint venture partner.
Although the ban only covers government contracts, it has been interpreted
to include companies, such as Tenaga, in which the government holds a
majority stake.

The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand will invite bids to build
and operate 3,800MW of power generation capacity in September, hoping to
attract investment of up to Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn), writes William
Barnes in Bangkok.
The bids will be split into a 1,000MW project to start between 1996 and 2000
and smaller projects to start between 2000 and 2001. EGAT will thereafter
accept annual bids for a further 1,700MW of power generation capacity a year
between 2003 and 2006. The independent operators will have to sell
electricity to EGAT for distribution.

Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, is
expanding its presence in Russia through two new joint ventures in power
transmission and distribution equipment, writes Andrew Baxter in London.
The Zurich-based company has signed an agreement with Moscow-based
Electrozavod to form a new company, ABB Electrozavod, to make transformers
and other related products. It is majority owned by ABB and will employ
about 700 people.
ABB said the venture would make best use of its strength as a world market
leader in power transformers and of Electrozavod's position in Russia and
elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Separately, ABB has formed ABB Electroengineering with the All-Russian
Electrotechnical Institute (VEI) to provide the Russian electrical networks
with locally engineered sub-stations. ABB will own 60 per cent of the new
company, which will be located in Moscow.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Big guns take aim on prairies - US anger
at surging Canadian wheat exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Formal talks between the US and Canada over Canadian wheat exports have
ended inconclusively with no sign of an agreement, although a timetable for
renewed negotiations remained under discussion.
Charging Ottawa with unfair trade, the US has threatened tariffs on surging
Canadian wheat sales from August. Canada, in turn, has vowed to retaliate
against a range of US farm goods. The two sides face a Friday deadline to
iron out their differences over wheat.
The long-simmering dispute over Canadian wheat has been given more urgency
by the political pull of prairie state farmers and has grown into an
international trade dispute.
Although agricultural trade comprises only Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) of
the total Dollars 210bn in annual trade between the US and Canada, and wheat
trade comprises only a fraction of that, the Clinton administration has
decided to aim its big guns at the issue.
Washington is seeking to limit Canadian wheat imports by half while gaining
access to Canada's highly restricted poultry and dairy sectors. Although
Canada has agreed to end rail subsidies and modify some marketing practices
as a result of the complaint, the US has continued to put on the pressure.
At the heart of the dispute, but rarely talked about, are dislocations in US
grower and export subsidy programmes that have left US grain processors
short of high quality wheat, creating a vacuum filled by imports. Exchange
rates have also encouraged wheat to flow south.
The immediate dispute revolves around a tiny portion of the 2.5bn-bushel US
wheat crop, the durum wheat grown mainly in North Dakota. Durum is the raw
material for semolina flour, the main ingredient in pasta. US durum
production plunged to 69m bushels last year, from 122m in 1991.
Farmers abandoned durum for other crops and bad weather further reduced the
harvest. Production was inadequate to meet the 77m bushel domestic demand
last year, much less the 50m bushels of exports encouraged by the main US
export subsidy programme, known as EEP.
The effect was a sharp rise in the domestic prices, a drop in world prices,
and a compensating 10m-bushel increase in durum imports to the US. The durum
price increase delighted US growers and outraged pasta processors who were
already battling against low-priced pasta imports.
In at least one case, the durum sold at cut-rate prices overseas appears to
have come back to the US as cheap pasta. The US sold Turkey about 43,000
tonnes of durum wheat last year, subsidising the sales at an average rate of
Dollars 33 per tonne, or about 20 per cent below world prices. Turkey is the
second largest exporter of pasta to the US, and the National Pasta
Association says Turkish pasta is marketed in the US at prices 20 to 50 per
cent below those of domestic brands.
Mr Luke Marano, chairman of the NPA and president of Philadelphia Macaroni
Company, is determined to end EEP-subsidised sales of US durum if the US
shuts off Canadian supplies. He says the wheat talks neglect the realities
of world trade.
'If they knock out Canadian wheat, domestic durum prices would go sky-high,
while the Canadian wheat would just be sold to Italy and Algeria, and become
cheap pasta imports. It would be hard for us to stay in business.'
Canadian negotiators point out that much of the wheat exported to the US
comes back to Canada as Dollars 77m in annual pasta purchases from the US.
Veteran durum traders shrug off the controversy, saying it doesn't warrant
such a high profile. 'Durum is a small crop, and prices have always been
volatile. This year the crop should be larger and the quality better, so the
incentive to import from Canada is already diminishing,' one said.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Indonesia cuts import duties but other
barriers remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indonesian government has announced reductions in import duties on a
wide range of goods, but economists say the measures do not go far enough.
Import duties were cut on 739 goods, non-tariff barriers were lifted on 27
commodities, and import surcharges on 108 import items were also removed.
However, many non-tariff barriers remain, notably in the agricultural
sector. Deregulation of this sector is seen as a barometer of the
government's commitment to wider economic deregulation.
'This was less than people were expecting,' said a Jakarta-based economist.
Although the package removes import duties on politically sensitive
commodities such as wheat, sugar and soya beans, non-tariff barriers for
these products remain.
However, economists praised the government's efforts in reducing tariffs on
industrial imports, ranging from textiles to agricultural machines, which
are likely to make downstream operations more efficient and help boost
non-oil exports.
The Indonesian government said the trade deregulation package was 'designed
to anticipate the development of world trade post-Uruguay Round.' But there
was disappointment because the government did not unveil a trade
deregulation schedule. The government has been gradually reducing duties and
tariffs since 1986, but investors and economists were expecting a timetable
for future deregulation.
Investors were more enthusiastic about changes introduced to
export-processing zones. The package allows manufacturers to lend machinery
and equipment to assembly plants outside the bonded zones. In effect, this
lets manufacturers hire sub-contractors, a move prohibited under previous
regulations.
The trade deregulation package follows a sweeping deregulation of foreign
investment this month. The Indonesian government is trying to develop a more
diverse non-oil export sector as its oil exports have been declining.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Japan launches deregulation plan: Proposals aim to increase
competition and cut business costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's caretaker administration announced a 279-point deregulation plan for
the economy yesterday. It will be presented at next week's summit of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations as evidence that the country is
continuing to open its markets.
The plan, for adoption by a new cabinet, aims to increase competition and
reduce business costs in housing, telecommunications, imports and
distribution, and financial markets. It is the third and most concrete
package in a deregulation drive started last year by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
then prime minister. Provisions include:
Recognising foreign inspection data on a range of imports including cars,
pharmaceuticals and construction materials rather than insisting on
expensive tests in Japan.
Relaxing zoning restrictions for new buildings.
Making it easier for private-sector telephone services to connect to the
public system.
Permitting the creation of certain derivative financial products.
The measures include no mention of tax reform, an issue that has been
blocked by the political impasse after the collapse this month of the
minority government led by Mr Tsumotu Hata.
Japanese business welcomed the fresh step towards liberalising the economy,
but the country's leading trade partners can be expected to be disappointed
by the stalemate on tax reform. Tentative government plans for a cut in
income taxes are seen as vital to supporting Japan's fragile recovery, even
at the cost of the proposed subsequent rise in consumption tax.
The Social Democratic party, the second-largest opposition group, reopened
talks with Mr Hata's coalition yesterday after lack of progress in talks
with the main opposition Liberal Democrats.
It was unclear when or if they could reach a conclusion. A theoretical
deadline is midnight today, the end of the present session of parliament,
which must select the new prime minister. However, it looked last night as
if the session would have to be extended.
None of the three main main blocs in Japanese politics - the Hata coalition,
the SDP and the LDP - has enough parliamentary seats to dictate terms for
forming a new government. Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, pleaded with Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, to make up his mind which side to join.
SDP policies - such as support for North Korea, its insistence that Japan's
security treaty with the US is unconstitutional, its opposition to a rise in
consumption tax, and caution over deregulation - clash with those of the LDP
and the coalition. Yet neither the LDP nor the coalition, in their present
form, can command a parliamentary majority without the SDP. Mr Murayama and
at least half the SDP's members of parliament believe they would lose voters
and their chances of returning to government if the party abandoned its
traditional policies.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Package targets four economic sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government's third deregulation package of the past year is
more concrete in content than its predecessors, but woollier in its timing.
No action can be taken on the 279 regulations it schedules for review or
abolition until the package is approved by the cabinet. That depends on the
speed with which a new government can be conjured from the present political
wrangling between Japan's three main political blocs. Mr Eijiro Hata,
minister of international trade and industry, predicted, however, the next
cabinet would adopt the package without changes.
So the plan is a statement of good intentions. It lacks details of an
extension of the present one-year income tax cut, put on hold since last
weekend's collapse of the government. 'That is now up to discussions between
parties,' said a government official. As such, the package is likely to earn
the highest praise from the US, which eagerly awaits evidence of progress in
stimulating domestic demand and reducing Japan's trade surplus.
But once a new government is in place, officials believe 193 regulations
will be on the scrap-heap by the end of this year and 36 next year, with the
timing of the rest uncertain.
Yesterday's deregulation plan covers four main sectors: housing and land,
telecommunications, access for imports, and the financial markets.
On housing, the most important changes are the acceptance of foreign tests
for imported building materials and a relaxation of the restrictive planning
zones which are a factor in Japan's cramped urban living conditions. Thanks
to zoning laws, an estimated 5 per cent of privately owned land in Tokyo is
officially supposed to be for agricultural use.
The government has stopped short of easing rules on entry into the
telecommunications service market, a disappointment to potential newcomers
who had encouraged speculation that the door would be thrown open. However,
the plan does promise to clarify approval criteria for new
telecommunications services.
It intends to ease government price controls on some kinds of
telecommunications services and make it easier for private sector telephone
services to connect with the public system, a liberalisation step urged by
foreign companies.
On imports, the plan proposes that foreign safety tests should be more
widely accepted on cars, car parts, food, drugs and medical devices coming
into Japan. Currently they have to obtain tests from often expensive and
overworked Japanese laboratories to qualify for import licences. Japanese
technical standards should also be adjusted to international levels in these
areas, says the plan. It also calls for more liberal application of the
large-scale retail law, which controls the opening of new shops.
The package is part of a five-year campaign to purge more than 10,000
official rules and permits which restrain some 40 per cent of the economy.
Despite efforts by previous governments to reduce the tangle of red tape,
the number of regulations grew for seven years running until 1993.
This reflects opposition from some ministries reluctant to see their powers
eroded, and protected business sectors, like small distribution companies
and corner shops, which are loath to face competition.
Government officials now believe the pile has started to shrink, as the
political drive for deregulation has started to gain momentum. It is a
feature of a gradual liberalisation of the Japanese economy, helped by
international competition and the growth of free market thought among the
country's biggest businesses.
The first two packages of the current deregulation drive, in September and
February, condemned 881 rules to abolition. Of that total, 595 - or two
thirds - have actually been scrapped. Another 111, requiring legislation,
are stuck in a lengthening queue of parliamentary bills, held up by the
series of political crises over the past year. More deregulation packages
are planned.
The Keidanren, which has switched over the past few years to an enthusiastic
advocate of deregulation, from its previous conservative defence of vested
interests, appeared impressed by the latest step.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, added:
'It certainly covers the right areas, but the pace of change will depend on
the political will of the next government.' As Mr Hosokawa's deregulation
packages show, the hard bit is putting good intentions into practice.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Summit deal a matter of 'face': The background to agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRADLEY MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After decades of intermittent talks that all failed, leaders of North and
South Korea yesterday agreed to their first summit meeting since both sides
fought to a standstill, at a cost of 3.5m lives, in the 1950-53 Korean war.
They agreed to meet between July 25 and 27 in Pyongyang, the North Korean
capital.
They could not agree, however, on the South's proposal for a return
engagement in Seoul after the first meeting.
Although the atmosphere at the working-level session was cordial, the depth
of mutual suspicion and fragility of the agreement could be seen in a North
Korean demand that the summit be cancelled in case of a 'provocative' act by
either side between now and July 25.
The North has used the excuse of alleged provocations to derail previous
dealings with the south. This time, cynics might be forgiven for suspecting
the North wants an easy out in case things do not go its way in high-level
talks with the US, set to begin on July 8 in Geneva and continue for a
fortnight or so.
Pyongyang for years had made clear its preference for bypassing Seoul, which
it derided as a mere 'puppet' regime, to deal with Washington directly.
Washington as consistently had maintained Seoul must not be left out.
The issue of the summit's venue is one that involves 'face', a consideration
important among Koreans. North Korean President Kim Il-sung, 82, has been in
power for nearly 49 years. South Korea deferred to his seniority in agreeing
to hold the first meeting in his capital.
The question is whether Kim Il-sung would then deign to visit the home turf
of South Korean President Kim Young-sam. The issue is sensitive for Kim
Il-sung since North Korea's 'Great Leader' has indoctrinated his own,
isolated subjects with a view of South Koreans that is outdated, to say the
least.
In Pyongyang's propaganda, southerners are portrayed as poverty-stricken,
oppressed by military dictators and in need of the peninsula's reunification
so they can live under the Great Leader's benevolent socialist rule.
Thus Kim Il-sung and his handlers may foresee a public relations nightmare
over his first appearance in prosperous, car-clogged Seoul.
Such knotty problems of dignity must be addressed before the two leaders can
get around to deciding whether to carry out a previous pledge to create a
nuclear-free Korea.
The South must make a careful assessment of whether it has sufficient
conventional military deterrent to agree to relinquish the protective US
nuclear 'umbrella' in response to Kim Il-sung's request to former US
President Jimmy Carter for a US pledge not to launch a nuclear first strike.
It appears the South is confronted with multi-track development of various
North Korean weapons of mass destruction. In the runup to the US-North
Korean talks and the inter-Korean summit set to follow it, officials in
Seoul will be engaged in some difficult calculations. Could they be paying
pay too big a price for a look at the possibly unimpressive cards in
Pyongyang's nuclear hand?
To some, this issue has been brought home by a report from a North Korean
army sergeant who defected to the South. Lee Chong-guk said he had been at a
meeting last August at which a prominent colonel boasted North Korea had
enough chemical and biological weapons to kill the entire 40m population of
South Korea.
Col Hwang Chang-pyong advocated just such a Final Solution to the Korean
division, arguing South Koreans were too imbued with anti-communism to come
to terms with the northern regime, Mr Lee said in an interview. No wonder
Seoul's gas-mask suppliers are sold out.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The presidents of North and South Korea are to meet next month for the first
time since the Korean peninsula was divided after liberation from Japanese
colonial rule at the end of the second world war.
Agreement to hold the summit in Pyongyang from July 25 to 27 was reached
yesterday during a tense eight-hour meeting of officials at Panmunjom in the
demilitarised zone between the two countries. Presidents Kim Young-sam and
Kim Il-sung monitored the negotiations on television from Seoul and
Pyongyang.
The possibility of a summit was opened up earlier this month during the
visit to Seoul and Pyongyang of former US president Jimmy Carter.
The breakthroughs which followed the Carter visit - US and North Korean
officials are also to hold talks in Geneva from July 8 - have put into
abeyance US-led efforts to impose United Nations sanctions on North Korea in
retaliation for its refusal to permit full international inspections of its
nuclear facilities.
Mr Carter received a package of proposals from Mr Kim Il-sung for resolving
the dispute, including his acceptance of a proposal from the South Korean
president for a summit.
After the announcement of the summit between north and south, a Seoul
government spokesman said: 'This is a historic agreement. It will go a long
way towards resolving pending issues . . . and easing tensions on the
peninsula. The precious fruit we reaped today will serve as a foundation for
. . . ending the history of national division and moving towards peaceful
reunification.'
Mr Lee Hong-koo, the south's chief delegate, said: 'Both presidents have
moved to make a political decision to ease tension on the Korean peninsula
at a time when the peninsula remains an exception. The rest of the world is
trying to seek co-operation rather than confrontation.'
For the North, Radio Pyongyang said the two sides would seek an atmosphere
'favourable to reconciliation, unity, trust and understanding'.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Patten faces a close HK vote

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The vote today in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) on Governor Chris
Patten's democracy legislation looks likely to be close and both the
governor and his opponents will be lobbying undecided members right up to
the end.
The success or failure of Mr Patten's attempt to broaden the franchise for
LegCo's 1995 elections will turn on the votes of one or two of the 60
legislators. 'Whatever the outcome it is not going to be good,' said one of
the governor's opponents.
The principal threat to Mr Patten's legislation comes from amendments
proposed by the Liberal party, a 15-member conservative grouping of mainly
appointed politicians, which wants to limit the franchise to Hong Kong's
traditional plutocracy. They have attracted independent members of LegCo who
point to strong support among the colony's business community.
Where Mr Patten wants to enfranchise Hong Kong's 2.3m working population,
the Liberals want to restrict the vote to 122,000 businessmen. And where Mr
Patten wants an electoral college itself composed of 346 popularly-elected
officials, the Liberals favour those elected by a restricted vote.
The Liberals and their supporters believe a bill amended along these lines
has a better chance of surviving under Chinese rule than does Mr Patten's.
This is in spite of China's threat to annul the result of the 1995 elections
when it resumes sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. 'There is no other viable
choice,' says Mr Howard Young, the Liberal who will move the party's
amendments today.
Mr Patten's advisers tell him that support for his legislation has improved
from 26 votes to nearly a majority. 'Our assessment is that we have enough
votes to win,' said one official.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Japanese job market weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's unemployment rate remained at 2.8 per cent last month, but the
labour market weakened significantly as companies tightened up on costs.
There were only 64 jobs on offer for every 100 applicants in April, down
from 66 in the previous two months and the lowest ratio for just over seven
years. Companies are freezing the intake of new recruits and cutting back on
part-time workers, in an effort to avoid heavy redundancies.
Despite the signs of economic recovery, sectors like cars, electronics and
banking still have surplus staff and capacity. The labour market is likely
to continue to flag.
The lifeless job market is a feature in the prolonged weakness of consumer
spending, shown by a 4 per cent annual decline in sales at leading
department stores and supermarkets last month, the 24th consecutive monthly
drop. However, signs of an upturn in consumer sentiment are present in a
boom in discount sales and imported consumer goods.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Rao begins mission to Moscow: Indian PM hopes to restore
relations set back by Soviet collapse

<TEXT>
India's prime minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, begins a four-day visit to Russia
today which he hopes will lead to improved trade and diplomatic relations
between the two countries. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 dealt a
severe blow to the inter-dependence that had lasted 40 years.
Mr Rao and his team of four top ministers and key bureaucrats - the most
senior to accompany an Indian premier in recent years - hope the visit will
begin a new chapter in Indo-Russian relations, where pragmatism and mutual
interest would replace the special, often unequal, relationship the two
countries shared as allies against the US in the cold war era.
'The fact that the prime minister chose to visit Washington (in May) before
Moscow, signals a definite change in our foreign policy,' said an official
in Mr Rao's office.
India wants to resolve fully the three-year dispute over its Rs380bn (Pounds
7.8bn) debt to the former Soviet Union, a serious obstacle to trade
relations.
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India in January last year led to a
partial settlement after prolonged disagreement about the rate of repayment
following the rouble's dramatic crash.
On the eve of Mr Rao's departure, New Delhi has responded favourably to a
Russian proposal that it be allowed to set up joint ventures with the rupee
funds of Rs30bn that India repays each year to clear its rouble debt.
The Russians have been unhappy with the present arrangement, under which
rupee funds can be used by Russia only for the purchase of goods and
services from India.
'The decision to accept the Russian proposal reflects that we are as anxious
as the Russians that the large corpus of rupee funds be utilised,' said a
foreign office spokesman. 'Neither India nor Russia benefits if the funds
lie idle.'
Strengthening co-operation over military technology is high on the agenda of
both countries. India has been dependent on the former Soviet Union for most
of its defence equipment, and was one of the largest beneficiaries of the
former Kremlin policy of supplying arms to the Soviet bloc and to developing
countries which had little means of paying for them.
Until 1991, India enjoyed a special trade arrangement with Moscow which
allowed military equipment to be procured on soft credit and against a rupee
payment (the rupee is not yet a convertible currency).
Though the new relationship is no longer as beneficial to India, the country
needs a constant supply of spares and arms, including sensitive
high-technology weapons it cannot secure from the west, such as engines for
missiles. Russia, on the other hand, would like to retain its single-largest
customer for military equipment.
The two sides are to sign more than 10 agreements, demonstrating a shared
understanding on issues ranging from common strategic perceptions to the
standardisation of weights and measures. Two political agreements will be
signed. One broadly lays out the new framework of relations between the two
countries in the post-cold war world; the other reiterates common
geopolitical perceptions.
Officials say it is unlikely there will be any emphasis on the issue of
nuclear non-proliferation. Russia is as keen as the US that India adhere to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
A senior bureaucrat in the foreign office said: 'Russia does not see eye to
eye with us on many issues, including non-proliferation, and India's entry
as a permanent member of the Security Council in a restructured UN. But we
are trying to work out a mutually beneficial new relationship, instead of
being bogged down by our many differences.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / China spectre stalks HK vote: Simon Holberton previews
debate on governor's franchise bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The vote today in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) on Governor Chris
Patten's democracy legislation looks likely to be close and both the
governor and his opponents will be lobbying undecided members right up to
the end.
The success or failure of Mr Patten's attempt to broaden the franchise for
LegCo's 1995 elections will turn on the votes of one or two of the 60
legislators. 'Whatever the outcome it is not going to be good,' said one of
the governor's opponents.
The principal threat to Mr Patten's legislation comes from amendments
proposed by the Liberal party, a 15-member conservative grouping of mainly
appointed politicians, which wants to limit the franchise to Hong Kong's
traditional plutocracy. They have attracted independent members of LegCo who
point to strong support among the colony's business community.
Where Mr Patten wants to enfranchise Hong Kong's 2.3m working population,
the Liberals want to restrict the vote to 122,000 businessmen. And where Mr
Patten wants an electoral college itself composed of 346 popularly-elected
officials, the Liberals favour those elected by a restricted vote.
The Liberals and their supporters believe that a bill amended along these
lines has a better chance of surviving under Chinese rule than does Mr
Patten's. This is in spite of China's threat to annul the result of the 1995
elections when it resumes sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. 'There is no
other viable choice,' says Mr Howard Young, the Liberal who will move the
party's amendments today.
For the governor's part, Mr Patten's advisers tell him that support for his
legislation has improved from 26 votes to nearly a majority. 'Our assessment
is that we have enough votes to win,' said one official.
Mr Patten - who was described yesterday by an official as looking
'baggy-eyed and grim-faced' - has been criticised by some pro-democracy
politicians for not trying hard enough to persuade wavering legislators. His
aides deny this, pointing to a check list of meetings he has had with
undecided LegCo members over the past weeks.
'We are lobbying hard for this bill,' said one aide. 'We are not agnostic
about this process.'
The outcome of the vote could be decided by a handful of Beijing's
supporters in LegCo. In a week when China appears prepared to settle a
long-running dispute with Britain about defence lands in Hong Kong and the
financing of the colony's new airport, Beijing may just want to show Mr
Patten who is boss.
China's importance to today's deliberations arises because there is no
system of pairing in LegCo. When votes are close, those who abstain have an
important impact on the outcome. Beijing, which has three faithful
supporters, usually abstains on constitutional matters.
The current arithmetic is that if China's supporters do abstain, Mr Patten
will win the vote. If they decided to support the Liberals' amendments then
the vote could be tied or Mr Patten may lose.
Articles in the pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao newspapers yesterday
stressed that no matter what LegCo decided today, fresh elections would be
held in 1997.
Yet, according to Mr Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, voting for the Liberals'
amendments was 'the only possible option - if the Liberals are defeated then
most probably Mr Patten's bill will go through intact.'
China's indirect participation in the vote would make it much more difficult
for it to sustain opposition to what LegCo decides. Hitherto China has
treated LegCo as an instrument of an illegitimate colonial regime - a mere
advisory body, at best.

FT  29 JUN 94 / French mount guard on Rwanda survivors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CYANGUGU, RWANDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Colonel Didier Thibault believes that France's humanitarian expedition to
Rwanda has been an unqualified success.
Unfortunately, most of the people who needed the protection of Col Thibault
and the Eleventh Parachute Regiment of Toulouse are already dead.
Of the 55,000 Tutsis who lived in the district of Cyangugu, in western
Rwanda, only 11,000 are believed to have survived the ethnic slaughter
unleashed by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash on
April 6.
Between 2,000 and 3,000 Tutsis swam or rowed across to the island of Idjwi,
on the Zairean side of Lake Kivu. The remaining 8,000 are under the
protection of French troops at a refugee camp near the town of Cyangugu.
In six days, almost 1,000 French troops have established a presence along
the eastern shores of Lake Kivu, in the heart of government-controlled
territory. 'Calm is returning to this district. Tension has diminished. The
priests, the town mayors, and the population tell me so,' says the colonel.
Since the arrival of the French, there are fewer roadblocks in this area of
western Rwanda, and those which remain are adorned with French flags. Col
Thibault does not have orders to disarm the militias of the majority Hutu
tribe who man the roadblocks, but he has told them that their killing spree
must stop. He has requested local radio stations to stop broadcasting
inflammatory propaganda against the Tutsi minority.
At every village, he explains that France has come to protect civilians who
may be in danger.
Col Thibault says his troops have found few Tutsis on their patrols
throughout the district. Yesterday, the French evacuated 37 nuns, 23 of whom
are Tutsi, from the town of Kibuye, where virtually the entire Tutsi
community was massacred.
The euphoria which greeted the arrival of the French is felt exclusively by
the Hutu community, to which the government and the Rwandan army belong.
Col Thibault admits that his presence in government-held territory, and work
alongside the Rwandan army and paramilitary police, may compromise the
neutrality France professes to have.
In some parts of western Rwanda, French forces are patrolling less than 15km
away from where the government is fighting the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the
Tutsi guerrilla force. If the rebels press their advance, the French might
find themselves in the line of fire. They have a mandate to use force if
they come under attack.
The Tutsis herded into the refugee camp of Nyarushishi, and watched over by
Hutu gendarmes as well as the French, remain hostages in a hostile
environment.
'The militias would kill the last Tutsi survivors were it not for the
arrival of the French,' says a Tutsi priest, allowed to remain at Cyangugu's
cathedral when Hutu militias chose to spare his life. 'I cannot leave these
premises,' he says. 'I would be stopped at the first roadblock and asked for
my papers which identify me as a Tutsi, and I would be killed. We are like
prisoners here.'
He cannot envisage a day when Hutu and Tutsi will live together in Rwanda
again.
'What happened here was a systematic and calculated massacre of the Tutsi
community. The French have arrived too late. For us, it is finished.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / California may require quake cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance companies operating in California are bracing themselves for
legislation which would force them to offer earthquake cover.
After a meeting on Monday of Governor Pete Wilson and representatives of 18
insurance companies, a spokesman for Mr Wilson said 'some type of action,
probably legislative action' was likely.
The meeting was called after moves by insurers to retreat from exposing
themselves to further earthquake risks. The insurance industry puts its
losses from the January earthquake in southern California now at Dollars
5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn), far higher than the industry's initial estimate of
Dollars 2.5bn and the second-biggest US natural catastrophe in insurance
terms after Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992.
Farmers, a subsidiary of the UK's BAT Industries, had decided temporarily to
stop writing homeowners' insurance in the state. The company expects losses
of more than Dollars 1bn from the earthquake. At present, insurers are
required by law in California to offer optional earthquake insurance to
anyone who buys one of their homeowner policies.
Discussions at the meeting focussed on the experience of Florida, which
faced a similar insurance crisis after the devastation caused by Hurricane
Andrew. That catastrophe cost the insurance industry more than Dollars 15bn,
prompting insurers to abandon offering hurricane insurance in the state.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Telecoms curbs may be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US House of Representatives yesterday passed two bills that could ease
curbs on Bell local phone companies and open competition in cable TV,
telecoms equipment manufacturing and long-distance telephone services.
The Senate has so far done little to move the bills forward but
congressional aides said the overwhelming House vote made it more likely the
Senate would vote - by October - on the legislation, which some see as the
most extensive changes to US telecoms in 60 years.
The bills would rewrite not only the 1934 Communications Act, but also the
1984 court decree which broke the American Telephone and Telegraph monopoly
into a single long-distance company, AT&amp;T, and seven regional telephone
companies known as Baby Bells.
The Bell companies provide more than three quarters of US local phone lines,
and are prohibited under the 1984 decree, designed to prevent them abusing
their dominant market position, from offering most other telecoms services
outside their home area.
Under the bills passed yesterday, the Bell companies would be immediately
allowed to offer 'incidental services' such as voice mail across the
boundaries of their local exchanges, and to ask state regulators for
permission to offer long-distance telephone services within that state.
They could be allowed to expand progressively over the next five years into
other long-distance markets.

FT  29 JUN 94 / US stirs plutonium dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Reactor grade' plutonium - produced in commercial reactors - can be used to
build nuclear bombs, according to information released by the US Department
of Energy.
The US government has revealed in a 200-page statement declassified on
Monday that it detonated a nuclear bomb at its underground test site in the
Nevada desert in 1962 using 'reactor-grade' plutonium from a UK reactor.
The UK government has argued that plutonium from civil reactors does not
pose a security threat because constructing a bomb from the fuel is
extremely difficult.
The UK's Department of Trade and Industry, which is responsible for British
Nuclear Fuels, said yesterday: 'This test proves that it (using plutonium
from reactors to make bombs) is possible. But our understanding is that the
difficulties involved in practice were such that no one would really dream
of trying it.'
The plutonium used in the US test was derived from military work carried out
by the UK Atomic Energy Authority at the Calder Hall reactor at Sellafield,
the DTI said.
BNF said yesterday: 'We have always said you need considerable skill to make
bombs from reactor-grade plutonium, not that it is theoretically
impossible'. But the Washington-based lobby group Nuclear Control Institute
called on Britain to 'halt. . . needless production of weapon-usable
plutonium'.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Foreign policy remains Clinton's weak point: White House
reshuffle addresses only a fraction of the questions raised about that area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has made every effort to avoid presenting his White
House reshuffle as an attempt to correct an operation that has gone wrong,
but if any segment of his administration can be said to need correction, it
is the foreign policy team.
The decision this week to move Mr David Gergen, the master of former
President Ronald Reagan's communications strategy who was recruited to
advise the White House last year, into a foreign policy role only addresses
a fraction of the questions that have been raised about the Clinton foreign
policy operation.
And although Mr William Perry has replaced Mr Les Aspin at the Pentagon, Mr
Strobe Talbott has taken over as number two at the state department and Mr
Richard Holbrooke is about to return from the embassy in Bonn to handle
European affairs, rumours of a further overhaul of the foreign policy team
abound.
Neither Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, nor Mr Anthony Lake,
the White House national security adviser, has been given much chance by the
Washington gossip chain of lasting beyond the end of the year, with former
Vice President Walter Mondale and even General Colin Powell rumoured as
possible replacements.
Mr Leon Panetta, the new White House chief of staff, was less than ringing
in his endorsement of the foreign policy team.
'I think at the present time obviously we are going with the players that
are there,' he said in a television interview, though he added that 'the
president does not feel that the foreign policy area has gone astray'.
One failing, according to critics, has been the inadequate articulation of a
foreign policy vision. Mr Lake's concept of the enlargement of democracy has
not satisfied all appetites.
Administration officials point out, with reason, that their predecessors had
an easier task, living within the doctrine of containment of the Soviet
Union. In the post-cold war era, the security dimension is less of an
overriding priority, and other interests, such as trade and human rights,
jostle for attention.
Mr Gergen excels at explaining why a policy makes sense, and as a senior
adviser to both Mr Christopher and Mr Clinton he could bring greater clarity
in this area.
'He will make a major contribution as we formulate policies here at the
department and he will bring to our discussions at the White House a
well-honed sense of how this administration can better communicate its
foreign policy goals to the American people,' Mr Christopher said in
enthusiastically welcoming Mr Gergen aboard.
Yet it is clear that Mr Gergen's assignment is not the final answer to Mr
Clinton's foreign policy woes. This, after all, is the problem that was
supposed to be corrected by the promotion last year of Mr Talbott, an
articulate former journalist, and by Vice President Al Gore taking on a
larger role in speaking for the administration on foreign policy issues.
Left unanswered is the question of whether the Clinton administration, and
Mr Clinton himself, has the capacity to decide on a policy in the
international arena and to stick to it.
Mr Gergen himself, who never wanted to remain in a prominent role in this
Democratic administration in the run-up to November's congressional
elections, expects to go back to the private sector - possibly to a
university - by the end of the year.
Some unkind souls suggested yesterday that he had only wanted to add this
foreign policy credential to his curriculum vitae in order to increase the
already impressive fees he can command on the lecture circuit once he leaves
the administration.

FT  29 JUN 94 / US consumer confidence at 4-year peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rebound in consumer confidence this month and a rise in sales of new homes
in May were seen yesterday as confirming the underlying strength of the US
economic recovery.
On Wall Street, the unexpected buoyancy of the indicators prompted falls in
bond prices in early trading - on the grounds that signs of economic
strength would increase the chance of an early increase in short-term
interest rates.
The Conference Board said its closely followed index of consumer confidence
rose to 92 this month from a revised 88.9 last month. The level of
confidence in the second quarter was the highest for four years.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the board, said confidence was at a level that
historically 'has been associated with a reassuringly lively economy'.
Consumers, however, were still concerned about the availability of jobs.
Confidence, however, varies significantly by region. It is buoyant in
central, southern and mountain states but still quite subdued on the east
and west coasts.
Sales of new single-family homes rose 4 per cent from April to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 738,000, 16 per cent above the level in the same
month last year.
The figures follow recent reports - on retail sales and industrial
production - that appeared to signal a deceleration in the underlying pace
of economic growth from an unsustainable annual rate of about 5 per cent in
the second half of last year. If growth does slow to an annual rate of 3 per
cent or less in the second half, the domestic pressure on the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates will be reduced.
Fed governors and regional presidents meet in Washington on July 5 and 6 to
set monetary policy. Some analysts expect the Fed to signal another increase
in short-term rates to support the weak dollar. Others believe the Fed will
continue to focus on the domestic outlook for inflation and growth and wait
until employment figures for June are released on July 8 before making a
decision on rates.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Feisty Rivlin would press hard for fiscal discipline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In nominating Ms Alice Rivlin as budget director on Monday, President Bill
Clinton has chosen a feisty, straight-talking economist who will press hard
for responsible fiscal policies.
The nomination was yesterday welcomed by Washington insiders as just reward
for a long record of competence in budgetary matters.
Ms Rivlin gained the respect of legislators in both political parties during
her long tenure as founding director of the non-partisan Congressional
Budget Office from 1975 to 1983.
She also exerted considerable influence on policy through books and articles
written over several decades while a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, a centrist Washington think-tank.
Some observers, however, were surprised that Mr Clinton should have chosen
somebody with whom he lacks a personal rapport as budget director, one of
the most powerful jobs in an administration. The Office of Management and
Budget director is responsible for the annual federal budget and exercises
broad oversight over the main spending programmes.
'She will speak her mind even when it's not what the White House wants to
hear,' said Mr Bruce MacLaury, president of the Brookings Institution.
Ms Rivlin has other advantages. She is keener on deficit reduction than
anybody else in the administration and her appointment is a way of
signalling to financial markets the continuing importance placed on budget
retrenchment. Bond prices rose following the announcements on Monday,
although this probably reflected hope that Mr Leon Panetta's appointment as
chief of staff would introduce some much needed discipline to the White
House.
Mr Clinton was also able to reaffirm his commitment to promoting women and
minorities and thus to making his administration 'look like America.' If, as
expected, Ms Rivlin sails through Senate confirmation hearings, she will
become the first female budget director in US history. The Clinton
administration will be the first to have two women in top economic policy
positions, with Laura D'Andrea Tyson already chairing the Council of
Economic Advisers.
Ms Rivlin's most important task initially will be to try to prevent
healthcare reforms increasing the budget deficit. But her ability to
influence the more general course of fiscal policy will be limited. The main
fiscal decisions for Mr Clinton's first term were taken in the 1993 budget:
further deficit-cutting measures of any significance are improbable despite
pleas for further action from bodies such as the International Monetary
Fund.
Ms Rivlin brings less political expertise to the job than Mr Panetta, a
long-serving congressman from California. She may make good this deficiency
by selecting a Capitol Hill insider as deputy.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Jack's jolly green giants squeak home -
Patrick Harverson in New York watches the curtain come down on the Group of
Death

<TEXT>
Ireland advanced into the second round of the World Cup yesterday after
earning a scoreless draw against Norway in an engrossing match at Giants
Stadium in New Jersey.
The Irish fully deserved to progress, their passion and sense of purpose
more than making up for lack of goals.
With a win and a draw, and four points, Ireland finished second in Group E
behind Mexico, who secured the top spot after drawing with Italy 1-1 in
Washington. Now, the Irish move back to Orlando, where they will play the
winner of Group F - probably Belgium - next Monday.
An exultant cigar-chomping Jack Charlton, Ireland's manager, asked if his
team looked forward to returning to Florida's heat and humidity, said
Belgium or the Netherlands 'are having as many problems with the heat as we
are.'
Norway, meanwhile, headed for home, unlucky to go out of the World Cup after
winning four points from three games. Against a confident Ireland, however,
they finished a clear second-best.
As for the Ireland-Italy game on June 17, the stadium was a cauldron of
noise draped in the tricolour of green, white and orange. The 76,000 crowd
was overwhelmingly Irish, with only the occasional red shirt and Viking
helmet, and the rare chime of clanking cow bells, to suggest that Norway had
brought some supporters along, too.
The weather remained Ireland's worst enemy as the game kicked off, but at
'only' 80'F it must have felt to the Irish players like a cool day in
Killarney, compared to the energy-sapping sauna of Orlando, where Ireland
played Mexico last week.
Ireland started with determination, skill and patience. Norway responded to
early Irish thrusts by bringing all but striker Sorloth back into their own
half. The Irish midfield of Keane, Townsend and Sheridan played short,
deliberate passes in front of the Norwegian back four, but rarely found an
opening.
Aldridge, the Tranmere centre-forward who played alone up front, struggled
throughout against the towering Norwegian centre-half Bratseth.
Yet Ireland so thoroughly dominated the first half that the Norwegians did
not get a shot at goal. The Irish centre-halves, Babb and McGrath - he of
the countless knee operations - patrolled the centre of defence with
now-familiar poise and muscular aplomb.
After half-time, Norway emerged with more purpose, and an extra player in
attack. Bonner, the Irish goalkeeper, was forced to make his first save of
the game after 49 minutes from Leonhardsen's well-directed but under-powered
drive. Ireland responded with several sweeping attacks on the flanks, one of
which led to a header from Aldridge which spun wide of the Norwegian post.
After 57 minutes, Aldridge was replaced with the pacier David Kelly, who
immediately enlivened things with a speedy chase down the left wing. Soon
after, Charlton moved to bolster his side further by adding the Liverpool
veteran Whelan, who came on for the ailing Townsend. Whelan's first touch
nearly proved fatal, his mis-cue in front of the Irish goal allowing Sorloth
an opportunity which he booted over the bar from a couple of yards.
In spite of his shaky start, Whelan's arrival breathed fresh life into tired
Irish lungs. The team's best move of the game came with just 10 minutes to
go: a cross from McAteer - who tormented the Norwegian full-backs all
afternoon - was nodded back by David Kelly but Keane, racing in from
mid-field, blasted the ball high over Thorstvedt in the Norwegian goal. A
minute later, another swift Irish break from defence ended in Sheridan
lofting a delicate chip over the bar.
As news of Mexico's equaliser came in, Irish reporters in the press box
began feverishly working out the implications of both games ending in a
draw. The news was good - Ireland would finish second - but it also meant
that any score in the last few minutes in New York would put the other team
out of the World Cup. The Group of Death was living up to its name.
With barely a minute to go, Norway earned a free kick wide on the right, but
their skyscraper forwards failed to capitalise on the cross. Ireland
responded with vigour, forcing several half-chances in the dying moments.
When the referee ended the game, the sound of the throaty Gaelic roar that
greeted the final whistle made it clear that Big Jack's green-and-white army
were heading into the second round.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Wage rise threatens Brazil prices move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's government plans to increase minimum wages by nearly 8 per cent
from September, in a move that could undermine efforts to beat inflation
through the Real currency, due to be launched on Friday.
In an effort to cut inflation from around 50 per cent a month, Brazil
intends to link the Real at parity with the US dollar and limit the amount
of the new currency to be issued.
The finance ministry and central bank had also been seeking a delay in
increasing the minimum wage, to give these anti-inflationary measures time
to take hold.
However, President Itamar Franco has now agreed to an increase in the
minimum monthly wage from Dollars 65 (Pounds 42) to Dollars 70, ahead of a
'full review' later this year.
The government has suggested that calls for an increase in the minimum wage
to Dollars 100 have been defeated. But the president's agreement to the
increase will add to pressure from Brazil's military, who are pushing hard
for a big pay rise this year. The September hike in minimum wages is likely
to lead to further demand from lower-paid workers, and therefore higher
prices, at a time when monthly inflation was expected to have stabilised at
low single figures.
The rise will also affect Brazil's social security system, which uses the
minimum wage as a benchmark for benefits and pensions.
It is likely to raise the annual cost of total benefits by at least Dollars
500m and take the government's budget into deficit. A balanced budget and
strict money supply rules are the key to underpinning the Real and
preventing yet another inflationary cycle.
Meanwhile, economists said frost in southern Brazil since the weekend would
have a limited effect on domestic food prices.
Brazil has halted all new coffee exports indefinitely and cancelled
contracts agreed upon since the weekend after the worst frost in more than a
decade damaged 15 to 30 per cent of next year's coffee crop.
Although vegetable prices have already started to rise, they are likely to
be balanced by falling meat prices as farmers sell cattle rather than see
their quality decline on frost-affected pasture.
However, due to other price increases in advance of the launch of the Real,
overall inflation is now expected to top 50 per cent for June, technically
taking Brazil into hyper-inflation.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Mexican fiesta as forza deserts the Azzurri
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The forza was never really with Italy on a glorious summer's day in
Washington, but the Azzurri mustered just enough of it to manage a 1-1 draw
with Mexico in their final Group E game of the World Cup's first round and
advance, edgily, into the second, Jurek Martin writes.
There was no confining Mexican joy. As the final whistle blew, players,
bench and the predominantly Hispanic crowd erupted in ecstasy, secure in the
knowledge that, regardless of the outcome of Ireland-Norway, under way
simultaneously, their team, with three goals against Italy's two and the
same number of points, was certain to fight another day.
Both goals arrived in an 11-minute span early in the second half. Three
minutes after the break Albertini found Massaro running free down the middle
with a simple, direct pass. Massaro, a half-time substitute for Casiraghi,
had the legs on the defence and only Jorge Campos to beat.
To describe the Mexican goalkeeper as flashy is the understatement of the
century. His uniform yesterday, according to carefully observed fashion
notes, was a fetching mixture of scarlet, canary yellow and lime green, with
blue and black edgings and lightning flashes. Undazzled, Massaro buried the
ball under his body.
The Mexican response, in the 58th minute, was opportunistic. The Italian
defence failed to clear the ball from its right corner. It broke free, on a
deflection, across the penalty area, Signori gambled on an interception and
missed, and Bernal placed a precise right-foot shot low beyond Marchegiani's
diving right hand.
And that was pretty much it for a match which never satisfied expectations.
There was the odd flicker: a bicycle kick by Casiraghi after 25 minutes that
went straight at Campos and a fine save by Marchegiani, who tipped over a
long-range cracker from Garcia Aspe.
If the second half was busier than the first, both defences maintained
control and both attacks lacked imagination.
Italy's Roberto Baggio, refreshed after sitting out the last three-quarters
of the Norway game, worked ferociously hard, but the Mexicans put Ambris on
him to the right, Bernal to the left and generally had someone spare when he
ventured down the middle.
Massaro ran hard after the break and there could be no complaints about the
work-loads of Albertini and Maldini. But Berti seemed more interested in
falling down and claiming fouls than in creating openings or threatening
goals, while Signori's attacking flair was more deployed in defence, for
reasons that appeared to lack logic.
For their part, aside from some long-range speculation, the Mexicans' idea
of attack was mostly to get the ball out to the tall and talented Alves on
the left flank. But, in easily the best individual duel of the match,
Benarrivo took care of him superbly and cleanly, only once - late in the
game - letting Alves slip through, only for the opportunity to be wasted
when no support was up for the cross.
Luis Garcia, who scored twice against Ireland, was invisible and the
venerable Hugo Sanchez never saw action. Mexico's strength was their
well-organised mid-field: Garcia Aspe, Bernal and Ambris can knock it around
a bit and do not get flustered.
But, on the basis of their performances yesterday, neither Italy nor Mexico
can have high hopes of surviving much further, their adoring supporters
notwithstanding.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Brazil and Sweden through - Salenko sets goal
record
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Romario scored a stunning, solo equalising goal at the Silverdome in Detroit
to ensure Brazil finished top of Group B last night after a 1-1 draw with
second-place Sweden.
Kennet Andersson's 24th-minute goal was the first the Brazilians had
conceded in the tournament but both teams comfortably qualified for the
second round.
In the other Group B game, Oleg Salenko scored a record five goals as Russia
crushed Cameroon 6-1 in San Francisco to give them a chance of going through
as a third-place finisher.
Salenko struck in the 16th, 41st, 45th, 73rd and 75th minutes - all five
goals with his right foot - making him the first player to score five goals
in one game at the World Cup finals. The previous best, shared by nine
players, was four goals: most recently by Spain's Emilio Butragueno against
Denmark in the 1986 finals.
Dmitri Radchenko added Russia's sixth in the 82nd minute.
Even a goal by 42-year-old Roger Milla with his first touch as a second-half
substitute was not enough to inspire Cameroon's Lions, who finished bottom
on one point and were eliminated.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Big Apple sports fans turn to soccer and suds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly two weeks into the tournament, Manhattan's sports bars may be
catching World Cup fever at last, reports Patrick Harverson.
After a slow start, when the New York Knicks' challenge for the national
basketball championship kept the World Cup off screens at almost every
sports bar in town, many establishments have decided to brave the ire of
baseball aficianados and allow soccer fans to watch their heroes while
supping a few beers.
A straw poll of five top NY sports bars this week found that all were
showing World Cup games, often to packed and enthusiastic houses. 'It's been
very good for business, especially the mid-afternoon games when we're
usually quiet,' said Paula Baldwin, a manager at Mickey Mantle's, the city's
best-known sports bar.
Downtown, near the financial district, the Sporting Club says it has been
busier than usual thanks to the World Cup, especially when Ireland or Italy
were playing. Games involving the US team are a big draw at the Polo Grounds
on the upper east side, where manager Tony Spallone says discounted beer
prices for soccer fans have won many new customers.
But there have been problems at the nearby Entourage sports bar,
particularly when the soccer has clashed with local baseball games.
Baseball, as a matter of bar policy, always wins out, although not without
complaint from the World Cup watchers. 'You never win with sports fans,'
says the Entourage's manager, resignedly.
There have also been complaints at Lee Mazzilli's Sports Bar and Cafe. Here,
however, there has been a revolution of sorts. Peter Kramer, the bar's
manager, says: 'We had the Yankee game on our 52in screen, but people
complained. They wanted to watch the soccer - so we turned it over.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Local columns reflect a world event - Patrick
Harverson in New York on generous US press coverage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clearly, newspapers in the US do not believe in opinion polls. How else to
explain devoting so much space to the World Cup despite the Harris poll
which found that 71 per cent of Americans did not know that the tournament
was being held in the US, and that 62 per cent did not know that the World
Cup sport was soccer?
It would be understandable if US newspapers provided only modest coverage of
the World Cup - deep in the sports section - and stuck to what readers want
most: baseball, basketball, golf, and more baseball.
Yet newspapers in the country's biggest cities have displayed uncommon
interest in a game that usually warrants no more than a line or two a week
on the sports pages.
The New York Times, for example, has been carrying two or three pages of
scores, reports and features every day: impressive, considering that the
city's basketball and ice hockey teams were both competing for their
respective league titles this month.
The Big Apple's three tabloids - Post, News, Newsday - are also feasting at
the World Cup trough, while elsewhere, papers such as the Los Angeles Times,
Washington Post, Boston Globe and US Today have kept readers fully informed.
The fact that the majority of their readers probably know little about
soccer has not deterred papers from covering the World Cup in detail. Jeff
Miller, an assistant sports editor at the Dallas Morning Herald, which has
been devoting up to two pages a day to the World Cup, says: 'This is the
biggest thing in the world and we are trying to treat it like that, even if
it does not register as such with our readers.'
Other papers say their coverage of the World Cup is not aimed only at
regular readers.
The Orlando Sentinel is publishing a special World Cup section every day
during the first round of games.
Aside from the regular run of news and features, the country's newspapers
have also allowed their top sports columnists - the pit-bulls of American
journalism - to sink their teeth into the World Cup. In spite of an
instinctive dislike of soccer, some appear to have been won over by the
sport's charms.
Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post admitted last week that he normally
regards soccer 'as somewhat less appealing than a case of hives,' yet
confessed that he fell in love with the World Cup after attending the
Holland-Saudi Arabia game.
Admittedly, his ardour was primarily stirred by the fact that soccer games
are short in duration compared to the marathons of American sports. He
wrote: 'I love the World Cup because of its running time, and there are no
commercial timeouts, and no injury timeouts, and no full timeouts, and no
20-second timeouts . . . It's over in two hours. So if you say: 'Honey, it's
a 7:30 start; I'll be home by 9:45,' then by God, you will.'
Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe went further, declaring after seeing
Argentina defeat Greece: 'I take it all back. Futbol is my life.'
This kind of coverage is delighting the World Cup's organisers, who feared
that the notoriously anti-soccer US press might use the tournament as an
excuse to churn out the same old story about soccer being a boring,
low-scoring game played, as one sportswriter memorably put it, by 'commie
pansies'.
It was Hank Steinbrecher, head of the US soccer federation, who said just
before the tournament started: 'I know soccer isn't the most popular sport
in the US, but soccer-bashing might be the most popular sport among the
media.'
But bashing has been kept to a minimum, and for good reason. For newspapers,
the arrival of the world's most important sporting event in their backyard
is news in a way that transcends sport.
In a country always worried that it will be viewed as parochial, any event
with the word 'world' in its title catches the eye, and editors have not
been shy about informing their readers of the important role their cities
are playing. 'The eyes of the world will be on Boston/Orlando/Detroit this
morning . . .' was probably the most commonly used introduction to press
coverage in the opening week.
In addition, many of the nine cities hosting the games are home to large
European and Latin American immigrant communities. As a result, papers in
places such as Los Angeles, New York and Chicago dared not alienate their
home-grown soccer-obsessed constituencies by underplaying the World Cup's
significance .
But the event has not worked its magic everywhere. Newspapers in the cities
not hosting the games have found it a less compelling story.
Among weekly magazines, coverage is patchy. Sports Illustrated has led the
way, although its pages remain dominated by baseball and the recent climax
of the basketball season.
Among general interest publications, Newsweek has taken the most bullish
line on the World Cup. Two weeks ago it published a special issue, followed
that up with a cover story a week later, and then ran five colourful pages
on the first 10 days of games. Its chief rival, Time, has taken a very
different tack, all but ignoring the tournament's first week-and-a-half of
play.
True, Time did wake up to the World Cup after the US team stunned the
football world with a 2-1 victory over favoured Colombia, yet it still ran
only a modest one-page report.
For sports fans, the tournament is now playing on a less crowded stage.
The basketball season ended last week, and with baseball moving towards its
mid-season break under the cloud of a possible players' strike, World Cup
soccer has an opportunity, if the US press affords it the space, to leave a
lasting imprint on the nation's sports consciousness.

FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Germany sends home Effenberg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany have sent home midfielder Stefan Effenberg from the World Cup finals
after he made an obscene gesture to the crowd during the world champions'
3-2 win against South Korea on Monday.
Effenberg did not train with the team and soccer federation press chief
Wolfgang Niersbach simply said: 'He is no longer part of the squad.'
Effenberg is the second German player to be sent home from a World Cup.
Goalkeeper Uli Stein was sent back from the 1986 finals after he criticised
coach Franz Beckenbauer.

Colombia's president-elect Ernesto Samper has appointed his first five
cabinet ministers, all of them Liberal party men active in his election
campaign.
Mr Guillermo Perry, an economist and former minister of mines and energy,
has been named as finance minister. He has been closely associated with the
management of Colombia's economy over the last 15 years and has also headed
Fedesarrollo, an independent economic think-tank.
Colombian exporters have welcomed Mr Perry's commitments to a slowing of the
revaluation of the peso and to the promotion of exports.
The new justice minister, Mr Nestor Martnez, has promised a thorough
evaluation of the controversial surrender policy for drug-traffickers. He is
a lawyer and economist, working at the International Development Bank.
The other three cabinet appointments are those of Mr Fernando Botero at
defence, Mr Rodrigo Pardo, a former ambassador to Venezuela and a specialist
in trade and integration issues, at the foreign ministry, and Mr Horacio
Serpa, a former attorney-general, as interior minister.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Caracas attacked over drastic powers
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera's administration was criticised
yesterday for assuming wide new powers in an attempt to tackle a gathering
financial crisis.
The new measures, not yet fully defined, represent the strongest set of
interventionist policies in Venezuela since the late 1980s, when the
administration of President Carlos Andres Perez launched a series of
market-oriented reforms.
The measures include controls on foreign exchange transactions and on many
prices of basic consumer goods and services, the suspension of certain basic
civil and economic liberties, special 'bonus' payments to workers to help
cover transportation and food costs, and stiffer supervision of financial
institutions.
The government also threatened to take harsh action, including fines and
jail, against businesses found to be hoarding merchandise or violating price
controls.
The Caldera administration has been in a financial crisis since it took
office in February, after the collapse of the second-largest Venezuelan
bank, Banco Latino.
'These measures are the result of not wanting to face reality. They are
focussing on effects instead of causes,' said Mr Jorge Redmond, president of
Conindustria, Venezuela's largest association of private industrial
companies.
In New York, analysts at Bear Stearns argued that the controls were not
welcome but 'may not be wholly negative, provided they are temporary tools'.
They could help to stabilise the Venezuelan bolivar, which has been nearly
halved in value this year and which the analysts described as 'oversold'.
Exchange controls began yesterday with a suspension of foreign exchange
transactions at financial institutions for five working days. The rules
covering exchange controls will be defined in a joint resolution, yet to be
announced, by the finance ministry and the central bank.
The new price controls, to be defined in detail by the industry ministry,
cover scores of products: basic food items such as rice, bread, sugar, eggs;
other items such as soap, medicine, toothpaste, car parts, clothing, shoes;
services such as electric power, gas, water, telephones, medical attention,
funerals and dry cleaning.
The third main element among the new measures was the suspension of some
rights guaranteed by the Venezuelan constitution. These include three civil
rights: free movement in and outside the national territory, the
inviolability of the home and protection against unauthorised arrest and
detention, and economic liberties, which cover the right to engage in any
legal economic activity, the right to own property, and the control of
expropriation by the state.
Suspending these freedoms gives the government powers to deal with social
disturbances and allows it greater freedom to apprehend speculators,
hoarders, rumour-mongers and corrupt individuals whom officials have blamed
for many economic troubles.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Albanian diaspora boosts economy: The desperate boat people
of a few years ago are now the country's saviours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fidel Castro called those who fled his dictatorship 'worms', and was deeply
embarrassed when they returned to Cuba as mariposas - well dressed
capitalist butterflies laden with gifts for their families. A similar
transformation is under way for the desperate boat people who in 1990 and
1991 fled Albania on board ancient ships or across mountain paths after the
collapse of the hated regime established by Enver Hoxha, the communist
dictator.
Many are still living miserably and working illegally at humble jobs in
Greece, Italy and further afield. But remittances sent back home at great
personal sacrifice from the more than 300,000 who fled what was once
Europe's most isolated country have become Albania's largest source of
foreign exchange, underpinning an extraordinary 11 per cent growth in gross
domestic product last year after an officially calculated 35 per cent
accumulated decline since 1989.
Remittances rose from virtually zero in 1991 to Dollars 150m (Pounds 99m) in
1992 and more than doubled to Dollars 335m last year. This was three times
the value of exports, at Dollars 112m, and 10 per cent higher than
short-term foreign aid, which declined to Dollars 303m from its 1992 peak of
Dollars 374m. The experience of earlier south European migrations to the
richer parts of Europe indicates that such flows are likely to diminish as
emigres either settle down in their new homes or return. But in the meantime
the physical exodus of a tenth of the population of 3.2m, and much higher
percentage of the economically active, has played a crucial role both in
reducing unemployment and in kick-starting a vibrant free market of small
traders and pavement cafes and financing the importation of more than 40,000
mainly second-hand cars, vans and trucks over the past two years.
Many of the vehicles are of dubious provenance. And much of the luxury foods
and consumer goods are smuggled by fast boat from Italy or from Greece,
avoiding taxes and stimulating crime and corruption. But for most Albanians
the important thing is that the last two years have brought the first taste
of a banana or decent coffee as well as a cornucopia of other western
consumer goods from TV satellite dishes to Coca-Cola.
The wild west atmosphere is calming down as the government introduces
customs duties and new personal taxes - and recruits a small army of tax
officials and financial police to enforce the will of a Democratic party-led
government elected in March 1992.
President Sali Berisha, a former heart specialist who has become the
increasingly powerful head of state, is regarded by western embassies in
Tirana as a leader capable of persuading Albanians to concentrate on
rebuilding their state and economy rather than dreaming of reunification
with some 3m ethnic Albanians who live in neighbouring former Yugoslav
regions of Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia.
With more than Dollars 1.5bn pumped into the country over the last three
years, Albania is by far the biggest recipient of western aid and soft loans
per capita in post-communist Europe. A three-year, Dollars 720m public
investment programme for 1994-96 depends largely on the flow continuing at
the current rate of about Dollars 300m a year over this period.
The aim is to make up for five decades of infrastructural neglect and build
a new economic base after the virtual destruction of the old industrial
economy which was based on obsolete Soviet and Chinese technology.
The start of the investment programme essentially marks the beginning of the
second stage of Albania's economic reconstruction. It builds on the
successful economic stabilisation policies of 1991-93 during which prices
were liberalised, subsidies virtually eliminated and inflation reduced from
more than 230 per cent in January 1993 to an expected 20-22 per cent average
for 1994.
At the same time the collective farms were abolished and land was
redistributed in small 3.5-acre plots to the 65 per cent of the population
who live and work in the rural areas. The combination of closing loss-making
plants, freeing trade and dissolving the collectives ensured that the surge
in incomes from remittances and higher farm output sparked off a big
increase in the domestic food supply as well as an import-led consumer boom.
Independent economists say the main challenge facing the government, and
especially the revamped central bank and Finance Ministry, is to resist the
temptation to tax the emerging private sector too harshly. The alternative,
they say, is to focus on encouraging the fledgling banks to improve their
lending capacity.
This would help the thousands of Albanians who have already made small
fortunes in trade to move into construction, food processing and other
industrial production, or tourism, which many see as one of the keys to
Albania's re-emergence as a balanced industrial, agricultural and
service-based economy.

The French National Assembly yesterday voted to lift the parliamentary

with an inquiry into commercial and tax fraud. MPs approved by 465-10 and
462-10 two separate judicial requests to allow Mr Tapie to be investigated
over accusations connected with his private yacht. The opposition Socialists
abstained and walked out to jeers from the right. The assembly had
previously lifted Mr Tapie's immunity last year in connection with another
probe. Mr Tapie, an MP for the Left Radicals Movement, denied any wrongdoing
and told the assembly he was victim of a political plot.

Portugal must introduce competition into sheltered areas of its economy to
ensure inflation moves down towards average European Union levels, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said. It urged an
overhaul of the regulatory framework and more vigorous privatisation
initiatives to improve the competitiveness of public electricity, water,
transport and telecommunications as well as housing and insurance. Portugal
would emerge from recession this year with economic growth of 1.2 per cent,
rising to 2.3 per cent next year. Higher exports and consumption supported
by lower interest rates would fuel growth. The OECD report coincided with
the swearing-in of a new governor of the Bank of Portugal, Mr Antoio de
Sousa. Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, said the government and the
central bank were both firmly committed to maintaining exchange-rate
stability.

Macedonia failed yesterday to win enough aid to meet its mounting foreign

undisclosed sum to help finance imports, Mr Michael Wiehen, a World Bank
director who chaired the first meeting of the newly formed aid-to-Macedonia
consortium, said the donors' overall offer was 'quite inadequate in terms of
what, in cash terms, Macedonia needs to regularise its relations with its
creditors'. Mr Ljube Trpeski, Macedonia's minister for international
financial affairs, said that of his country's total Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds
720m) debt, Dollars 194m was owed to the Paris Club of official creditors
and Dollars 514m to commercial banks. Mr Wiehen said Macedonia would need to
pay Paris Club creditors Dollars 50m and institutions such as the European
Investment Bank Dollars 45m, even to get a rescheduling deal from them.

The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) made a last-minute decision to

service, clearing the way for the country's largest privatisation. The SPD
decision guarantees a two-thirds majority for the government in a vote today
in the Bundestag to change Article 73 of the constitution which says that
postal and telecommunications services are the exclusive responsibility of
the state. Following the vote the present company which employs 670,000
people will be turned into three state-owned joint stock companies on
January 1, 1995: Deutsche Telekom, Postdienst, the postal service, and
Postbank, the banking arm. Telekom has said it wants to float 30 per cent of
its equity on the stock market in 1996 to raise badly needed capital.

adult Bulgarians to privatisation vouchers representing assets with a book
value of Lev25,000 (about Pounds 300) on payment of Lev500. The vouchers can
be exchanged for shares in around 500 state-owned enterprises, with assets
totalling Lev110.8bn. Private investment funds will be created to manage and
invest the vouchers on behalf of the public. Officials from the newly
founded Centre for Mass Privatisation are drafting a separate law to govern
investment funds. Meanwhile, Bulgaria is due to sign a debt reduction

The European Commission is to make recommendations by the end of October on
whether value added tax should be levied on goods and services sold in the
EU at the rate prevailing in the country of origin, Ms Christiane Scrivener,
the commissioner for customs and indirect taxation, said yesterday. Ms
Scrivener reaffirmed the Commission's commitment in principle to a shift to
the 'origin system' of levying VAT. Speaking at a conference discussing the
existing transitional VAT arrangements, she said that agreement to the
change - which must be ratified by the council of ministers - would require
that the new system would simplify obligations to business and ensure that
there was no additional risk of fraud. The EU is theoretically committed to
introducing the origin-based system to replace the existing transitional
system of VAT harmonisation across Europe by the start of 1997.

Greece will continue to suffer from slow growth and high budget deficits
this year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said
in its half-yearly report. GDP would grow by only 1 per cent this year and
1.6 per cent in 1995. The government's target for the 1994 budget deficit
would be hard to attain because government revenue growth would be slow
despite tax legislation introduced in April. 'The (realised deficit) is
likely to exceed the budget target unless measures recently taken to improve
tax compliance prove unusually successful,' the OECD said.

FT  29 JUN 94 / German warning on the dollar

<TEXT>
The US government should stop making contradictory comments about the role
of the dollar as these are causing instability on financial markets,
according to one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's former top financial advisers.
Mr Horst Kohler, a former senior official in the Finance Ministry who now
heads the powerful Association of German Savings Banks, said next month's G7
summit in Naples should give a clear signal to improve stability on the
international currency markets.
He said that comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary,
favouring a strong dollar, were at odds with statements by Mr Ron Brown,
commerce secretary, who prefers a weak dollar to correct the trade deficit
with Japan.
'If the exchange rates become an instrument to regulate competition then
that is a bad development for world trade,' Mr Kohler told journalists.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Ex-communists try to capitalise: Germany's PDS draws hope
from its showing in the Saxony-Anhalt election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the successor to the former east
German communist party, is taking no chances.
Hours after it had won 20 of the 99 seats in Saxony-Anhalt's parliament, Mr
Gregor Gysi, the party's most prominent personality, was on the campaign
trail.
He and his 130,000 members are determined to capitalise on last Sunday's
success.
The question is whether the votes the PDS won in the state elections can be
carried over on to the federal level when elections are held in October.
To get into the Bundestag, the PDS needs to obtain 5 per cent of the federal
vote, or else win three constituencies outright.
Mr Lothar Bisky, the leader of the PDS, reckons that the party will win
three mandates in east Berlin and could even clinch a seat in Rostock, in
the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and in Halle in Saxony-Anhalt.
'At the present rate, we could get 6 per cent of the vote,' he said earlier
this week. Translated into seats, it would amount to 40 in the Bundestag.
Despite attempts by west German politicians - with the exception of
President Richard von Weizsacker - to repeatedly accuse the PDS of being a
communist party in disguise east Germans continue to support the party.
The main reason is that the PDS is seen by east Germans as their party which
understands the traumatic affects unification has had on eastern Germany.
'East Germans do not think of going back to the old days. They do not think
of us as a communist party. The point is they know us. We are one of them.
The Wessis (west Germans) cannot accept this,' added Mr Bisky.
Another reason is that the PDS, for the moment, is seen as the left party
for the east Germans, unlike the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). Not only
has the SPD been unable to set up a strong grass-roots organisation in the
east; its policies seem indistinguishable from those of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's governing Christian Democrats (CDU).
Mr Rudolf Scharping, head of the SPD, is all too aware of the weaknesses in
eastern Germany where it governs just one of the five states. That is why,
rather than immediately form a CDU-SPD grand coalition in Saxony-Anhalt, the
SPD, with just 36 seats, one less than the CDU, is considering a minority
government with the Greens, who have five seats.
'In such a case, an SPD-Green coalition would have to depend on the PDS for
support,' said Mr Bisky, adding that this would legitimise the PDS as a
genuine opposition left party.
The SPD, however, is calculating on the basis that disaffected voters would
in October drift back to the SPD and the Greens if they believed a Red-Green
coalition was possible at the federal level.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Ferruzzi family goes to court: Private action against
Mediobanca claims documents were falsified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Ferruzzi family has filed a private action against Medio-banca, the
Milan merchant bank, for allegedly falsifying documents related to the June
1993 rescue of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison empire.
The action marks one further stage in an increasingly bitter battle between
the Ferruzzi family and Mediobanca, which headed the pool of banks that
mounted the Ferruzzi-Montedison rescue.
It runs in parallel with investigations being conducted by Ravenna
magistrates into events surrounding the collapse of the group that have
already involved Mediobanca and four other Italian banks.
The suit is in the name of Arturo Ferruzzi, the eldest son of the group's
founder, and his two sisters, Franca and Alessandra, but not Idina, the wife
of the late Raul Gardini, the one-time head of the empire.
It alleges that Mediobanca was party to the backdating of documents
interpreting the June 4 rescue agreement.
Agreement on the inter-pretation was finalised between the family members at
various times from July 20 to July 29. The suit claims the agreement was
back-dated to June 29. The dates are important because, during June,
approval was given for the increase in capital of Fondiaria, the
Florence-based insurance company - an increase that removed it from Ferruzzi
control, previously exercised through Gaic, a finance group.
Until now the Ferruzzi family has contented itself with attacking Mediobanca
for allegedly knowing about unpublished losses of L430bn (Pounds 177m) and
taking advantage of the group's L30,000bn (Pounds 12.4bn) debts to
'expropriate' the best assets. Ravenna magi-strates are also investigating
all these allegations.
Last Friday they advised Mr Roberto Dunatov, the head of the Bologna office
of accountants Price Waterhouse, that he was under investigation for
allegedly falsifying the Ferruzzi accounts. The magistrates alleged that Mr
Dunatov was aware of irregularities in the group's accounts including the
parallel system of accounts operated out of Switzerland on behalf of
Ferruzzi by Mr Pino Berlini.
There already two claims totalling L1650bn against Price for damages in
relation to the Ferruzzi-Montedison accounts brought by the present
administrators.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Unilever's chief attacks EU policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Michael Perry, joint chairman of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer
products group, last night accused European Union leaders of showing
'astonishing lack of focus' in tackling the region's flagging economic
growth and competitiveness.
Many governments were 'hell-bent on creating and preserving rigidities',
instead of helping their economies adapt to the challenge of fast-growing
Asian competition, he said. 'I don't believe governments have begun to
address the issues.'
His criticisms of EU policy failures - in a speech to the Royal Institute of
International Affairs in London and in an interview - are among the toughest
recently by a top European industrialist.
They were part of a generally bleak assessment of Europe's economic
performance, which underlined the threat to its prosperity from Asian
rivals. He dismissed as 'alarmingly irresponsible' suggestions that Europe
could return to full employment this decade.
Sir Michael said governments should 'stop continually shifting burdens on to
employers in order to avoid what should properly be hard political choices
about public spending priorities'.
The EU was imposing too many costly and unnecessary regulations on business
which, he said, were exemplified by its recent Works Council Directive.
'What amazes me is that anyone should think it is going to make the
slightest contribution to solving the central economic question of today -
making Europe more competitive,' he said.
European companies must embrace change by improving innovation and quality,
cutting costs and entering new markets, he said. Their most urgent task was
to persuade employees of the need for more flexible working practices.
The EU needed to stimulate efficiency by implementing the Uruguay Round
trade deal and pressing ahead with its single market.
However, Sir Michael feared growing resistance to industrial restructuring.
'One is concerned that governments are less willing to accept the full
consequences of driving costs out of the economy than when the single market
was set up,' he said.
Governments should seek a partnership with business to improve education,
re-skilling and infrastructure, and not engage in 'pseudo-activity by
attempting to second-guess industrial decisions'.
He said the UK political climate was more positive than in some continental
countries: 'We in Britain reckon our government is listening to business
needs more closely than in other parts of Europe.'
However, Europe's unemployment would probably not fall below 6 per cent for
the rest of the decade, even if annual growth averaged 3.5 per cent. 'That
is why I find the glib talk about 'full employment' . . . in some political
circles alarmingly irresponsible,' Sir Michael said.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Ciller to seek tax deal with industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, meets industrialists in Ankara
today in an attempt to keep her austerity programme on track, as companies
call for tax cuts to offset the impact of shrinking demand and a
depreciating lira.
A deal seems likely which would see the government forgo some tax revenues,
while industry would restrain or even reduce prices.
Such an arrangement could make efforts to meet the fiscal reduction
envisaged in the April 5 austerity package more difficult. However, with the
country due to sign a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund
in early July, Mrs Ciller is clearly keen to ensure the headline inflation
figure continues to fall.
The issue is vital at a time when the government is urging wage restraint in
the current collective bargaining with public sector workers.
Annual inflation rose to 117 per cent in May, from 107 per cent in April in
the wake of what the government promised was one-off rises in official
commodity prices. However, monthly figures fell from 24 per cent in April to
10 per cent last month and the government aims to cut monthly price rises to
less than 3 per cent for the rest of the year.
Mrs Ciller has already given ground on tax breaks for the car industry,
perhaps the worst affected industry. This week, the government agreed to
reduce the car tax from 12 to 6 per cent, and waive the 23 per cent value
added tax for dealers in second-hand cars to try to boost demand. The car
sector has laid off 20 per cent of its total workforce and sales have fallen
80 per cent, according to the motor manufacturers' association.
The government is also negotiating with foreign petrol retailers who raised
prices on May 31 to offset refinery losses following the lira devaluation
and the rise in world oil prices.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Chancellor confident of sustained recovery: Early tax cuts
ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday held out the prospect of
continuing economic recovery, with low inflation, falling unemployment and
rising prosperity for several years ahead.
Unveiling the government's latest economic forecast, which predicts slightly
stronger growth and lower inflation this year and next, the chancellor said
Britain faced 'quite the best combination of circumstances, pointing to
sustained growth and low inflation', that he could remember 'for a very,
very long time'.
He told a news conference that Britain still had 'quite a bit of spare
capacity' and could therefore stand a few years of growth above trend.
The chancellor was careful, however, to damp any expectations of early tax
cuts.
Yesterday's Treasury forecast included lower-than-expected reductions in the
public sector deficits envisaged by the government for the current financial
year and 1995-96. In addition, Mr Clarke insisted that his priority was to
deliver economic recovery and that he would only cut taxes when the public
finances were under control.
The half-yearly forecast was published yesterday rather than in March
following discontinuation of the traditional spring revenue-raising Budget.
It upgraded the government's prediction for economic growth this year to
2.75 per cent from 2.5 per cent at the time of Mr Clarke's first Budget in
November. Presenting the first official view of 1995, the Treasury forecast
that growth would continue at 2.75 per cent next year.
At the same time, the government trimmed its forecast of underlying
inflation, as measured by the retail prices index excluding mortgage
interest payments, to 2.5 per cent at the end of this year from 3.25 per
cent previously, and forecast inflation of 2.75 per cent by the end of 1995.
The Treasury's growth forecasts were slightly more cautious than the 2.8 per
cent growth for 1994 and 1995 suggested by the most recent consensus of
independent forecasters. But the government was more optimistic about
inflation than private sector economists. The City consensus is for
underlying inflation to average 2.7 per cent at the end of this year and 3.2
per cent in the fourth quarter of next year.
The City also found itself at odds with the government's cautious downward
revisions of Pounds 2bn in its forecasts for the public sector borrowing
requirement in the current financial year and 1995-96. Gilts ended lower,
with the September long gilt future losing about a third of a point, after
the Treasury forecast a 1994-95 PSBR of Pounds 36bn against Pounds 38bn
previously and trimmed its projection of the 1995-96 PSBR by Pounds 2bn to
Pounds 28bn.
Mr Clarke said the forecasts were a policy guide and that he had 'no
intention of being dominated by them . . . I do not believe we should look
at them as if every figure is bound to be accurate and a spot forecast of
where we will be in 12 months' time'.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, accused Mr Clarke of being
complacent about both the short-term and long-term future of the UK.
The FT-SE 100 Index reacted positively to the Treasury forecasts but
finished the day just 9.1 points up at 2,909.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Hong Kong market ban on Standard Chartered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, was yesterday banned
from taking part in Hong Kong stock market flotations until April after
being found guilty of funding illegal share-support schemes.
The ban, imposed by the Securities and Futures Commission, which oversees
Hong Kong's financial markets, follows renewed efforts by regulators to curb
financial malprac-tice.
More than 20 executives and traders employed by Standard's Chartered's
investment banking arms have resigned after an inquiry by the commission
which found the bank guilty of breaking exchange rules in the cases of six
public offerings.
Analysts said the incident renewed questions about Standard Chartered's
ability to control operations. It had to make a Pounds 269m bad debt
provision in 1992 to cover losses arising from a securities trading scandal
in Bombay.
The commission said Standard Chartered Securities, the bank's stockbroking
arm, had funded improper share-support schemes for six listed companies
between July 1991 and March 1993. The offences included one case in which it
lent money to the directors of a company to buy shares in the company's
flotation. In others, it allowed employees to trade against clients through
private accounts with other brokers.
As well as imposing a temporary ban on the brokerage, the commission
censured Standard Chartered Asia, its sister merchant bank, for acquiescing
in the misconduct. The merchant bank had advised some of the new issues.
Standard Chartered will now have to operate the broker and merchant bank
separately, re-imposing a traditional separation between the two.
The commission plans to decide whether the bank's former employees are fit
and proper persons to work in the securities industry. Some resigned at the
bank's insistence before regulators became involved.
Mr Malcolm Williamson, Standard Chartered's chief executive, said the bank
regretted the incident and was strengthening controls.

European monetary union could not survive without a deep political

Financial Times today, he gives his views on monetary union, the role of
central banks and the future size of the European Union. 'I cannot think in
the longer term that we can live in a Europe where we close the doors to a
country like the Czech Republic,' he says. 'On the other hand, I cannot see
in the foreseeable future a situation where all the Maastricht Treaty
conditions . . . for monetary union will be met by all countries.'

FT  29 JUN 94 / Clarke launches fightback against Tory Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke will launch a counter-offensive today against the Tory
party's Euro-sceptics with a strong re-affirmation of the government's
fundamental commitment to the European Union.
Throwing his formidable political authority behind his party's beleaguered
pro-Europeans, the chancellor will insist that disputes over the European
Commission presidency and over beef trade will not undermine a basic
identity of interest between Britain's Conservatives and Germany's Christian
Democrats.
His intervention will come in a speech to the Christian Democrat Konrad
Adenauer foundation in Bonn - the audience chosen by Mr John Major more than
three years ago to proclaim his determination to keep Britain at the 'heart
of Europe'. Mr Clarke will repeat the phrase.
Mr Clarke, one of the most powerful figures in the cabinet and the leading
potential successor to Mr Major, is expected to enrage the Euro-sceptics by
underlining his personal support for the eventual goal of economic and
monetary union.
Dismissing the notion that Britain will refuse to contemplate a single
currency, he will urge EU governments to recreate the conditions for stable
exchange rates by meeting the Maastricht Treaty's economic convergence
criteria.
Putting himself directly at odds with the minimalist vision of Europe
offered earlier this week by Mr Michael Portillo, his Thatcherite deputy at
the Treasury, the chancellor will reaffirm strong support for that Treaty.
Few people, Mr Clarke will add, could seriously question that Britain's
future lies in Europe.
His speech marks a determined move against efforts by the Euro-sceptics to
capitalise on the recent breaches between Britain and its European partners.
The sceptics want to lock Mr Major permanently into a more overtly
nationalistic stance.
The speech is likely to be followed within the next few days with a
similarly positive view of Britain's place in Europe from Mr Douglas Hurd,
the foreign secretary.
Mr Clarke will emphasises that Britain must retain the right to disagree
with its partners. He will tell his audience that other European governments
must be sensitive to political realities in Britain.
In a robust as well as unmistakably pro-European speech, he will defend
strongly Mr Major's decision to veto Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as the next
president of the European Commission.
He will emphasise that Britain's agenda of an enlarged, liberal and
deregulated Europe should be shared by the German Christian Democrats and by
other right-of-centre parties throughout the European Union.
But both the substance and tone of the speech will be seen at Westminster as
a deliberate attempt to reverse the recent tide flowing in favour of the
Eurosceptics.

FT  29 JUN 94 / Bentsen speaks out in favour of a stronger dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, last night signalled a potentially
important shift in the Clinton administration's currency policy by declaring
publicly that he wanted a stronger dollar and that the exchange rate would
not be used as a tool of trade policy.
However in Tokyo early today the dollar showed continued weakness, touching
a post-war low of Y99.4 before the Bank of Japan intervened. Earlier the US
currency had hovered around the Y100 mark in late trading in New York where
it started the day at Y100.6.
Speaking in New York last night, Mr Bentsen said: 'We believe a stronger
dollar is better for our economy and better for the world's economy.'
He added: 'The dollar is not a tool of our trade policy.' This appeared an
attempt to convince financial markets that the administration did not regard
yen appreciation against the dollar as an appropriate way of putting
pressure on Japan to open its markets to imports.
The strongest position previously taken by Mr Bentsen was in early May, when
he said the US saw 'no advantage in an undervalued currency'.
Mr Bentsen's strongly worded statement followed similar remarks by a 'senior
Treasury official' on Friday after the apparent failure of intervention to
support the dollar. Last week, however, Mr Bentsen's public statements were
bland.
The decision to speak out reflects the administration's continuing concern
about dollar weakness, which it regards as bad for growth in Europe and
Japan as well as in the US, where the threat to growth arises mainly from
falling bond and share prices.
Mr Bentsen, however, gave no indication of the tactics he favoured for
propping up the dollar. Many economists expect another round of concerted
central bank intervention but views are mixed on whether the Federal Reserve
will lift short-term interest rates at its policy meeting on July 5 and 6.
Michael Lindemann adds from Bonn: Earlier, a former senior German official
urged the US government to stop making contradictory comments about the role
of the dollar as these were causing instability in financial markets. Mr
Horst Kohler, a former finance ministry official who now heads the powerful
Association of German Savings Banks, said that recent comments by Mr
Bentsen, favouring a strong dollar had been at odds with statements by Mr
Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, who preferred a weak dollar to correct
the trade deficit with Japan.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Beijing optimistic over new talks on
rejoining Gatt - Guy de Jonquieres and Tony Walker on doubts whether China
can be re-admitted in time to help found the WTO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiators from China and members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade meet in Geneva today for what promises to mark the start of a critical
stage in the seven-year-old talks on Beijing's application to rejoin the
organisation.
The four-day meeting is the first since US President Bill Clinton ended
uncertainty about China's position in the world trade system this month by
renewing Most Favoured Nation treatment of its exports to the US and
'de-linking' trade and human rights.
Mr Clinton's decision has lifted a cloud over the Geneva talks. Mr Long
Yongtu, China's Gatt negotiator, who has visited Washington and Brussels in
advance of this week's meeting, said he was satisfied with his meetings in
both places.
He said contacts with US negotiators were 'the most positive and fruitful'
for two years - an assessment shared by US officials. They applauded China
for its recent commitment to preparing itself for membership of Gatt, from
which it withdrew in 1950.
The hope now is that the way has been cleared for faster progress in
resolving outstanding issues. 'There is movement and a will on all sides to
press ahead with serious work,' said one official in Geneva.
But though all the main Gatt countries say they want to admit China, some
question whether it will be possible this year, in time to meet Beijing's
goal of becoming a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, which is
due to succeed Gatt.
That would require broad agreement by late autumn on formal accession terms.
However, officials closely involved in the talks stress that formidable
obstacles have still to be overcome. 'I think it is going to be very
difficult for the Chinese to make it in time,' said a European official.
There are also differences between Washington and Brussels over how far Gatt
should go to accommodate China's difficulties in meeting its rules
immediately.
The US wants Beijing to accept all Gatt obligations on entry, and to
eliminate in particular about 400 specified non-tariff barriers. The
European Union is taking a more flexible line, though it has reserved the
right to impose selective safeguards on certain imports until China is fully
integrated into the Gatt system.
Mr Long said his government was seeking a 'package deal' in the negotiations
and indicated it would press for transitional arrangements which would allow
it to conform with Gatt rules over time.
He acknowledged that a gap remained on the transition issue. 'This is
something we have to work on,' he said. 'Without agreement on transitional
arrangements China may not get into Gatt for 5-10 years, and we assume this
is not the wish of the US.
'The bulk of American and European demands are in line with China's economic
reforms. There is no basic disagreement on China becoming a full-fledged
market economy. The question is how quickly China should do it.
'China's economic reforms were a gradual process, and we can't for the sake
of getting into Gatt disrupt that gradual process. I don't think this would
be in the interests of western countries,' he said.
Mr Long called 'ridiculous' US arguments that if China were granted a
transition period, it would have no incentive to assume its obligations
after it entered Gatt. 'China is not adopting its reforms simply for the
sake of joining Gatt,' he said.
In an effort to clarify the outstanding issues, Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the
Swiss economy minister who is chairing the Geneva meeting, has circulated a
'non-paper' which aims to bring together the views of all the main
participants, including the US, the EU and Japan.
In a covering letter, Mr Girard says the document - which is not intended as
a draft protocol for China's eventual accession - is not prescriptive, but
should be regarded as the basis for discussion.
However, some officials close to the talks described Mr Girard's approach as
'maximalist' and said it appeared to set tougher conditions for China's
accession than some Gatt members considered appropriate.
As well as the removal of non-tariff barriers, negotiators in Geneva say the
most obstinate questions still to be resolved are:
Lack of transparency in China's trade regulations and 'hidden' quotas on
various categories of imports.
Dismantling of China's tariffs, for which a timetable must be negotiated and
set out alongside the planned accession protocol.
The uniform application of Gatt obligations, in a country where regulations
and the speed of liberalisation vary widely between regions.
Extension of national treatment to foreign companies and, in particular,
access to China's market for foreign providers of services such as banking
and insurance.
Intellectual property rights, an issue on which China has been criticised
because of widespread piracy of western entertainment software.
A safeguards clause against sudden surges of Chinese exports, especially
textiles.
Negotiators in Geneva were cautious yesterday about the prospects for
breakthroughs on these issues this week, while Chinese officials have
acknowledged that there will have to be tough bargaining against a tight
timetable.
Beijing is preparing for another session in late July and will send a large
team back to Geneva to negotiate through September, if necessary. 'As long
as the participants have the political will, we can finish the negotiations
in time,' said Mr Long.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Axa plans to invest Dollars 200m
in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Axa, the French insurance group, said yesterday that it plans to invest
about Dollars 200m within the next five to seven years to expand its
presence in the Japanese market, following provisional approval to set up a
life assurance subsidiary in the country.
Axa said that it hoped to receive definitive approval to set up the
subsidiary at the beginning of next year and plans to start marketing its
products from next April. It said it hopes to set up 12 regional offices
after its initial entry into the Japanese market.
The company, which claims to be the first French group to have received such
authorisation to set up a life insurance subsidiary in Japan, said that it
aims to achieve FFr1bn of premiums within five years and more than FFr4bn
within a decade.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Conseco set to buy Kemper in 1980s style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kemper, the US insurance and mutual funds group, has accepted a Dollars
67-a-share bid from smaller rival Conseco, in one of the biggest leveraged
acquisitions of a US financial company.
Kemper's decision had been expected after GE Capital last week dropped its
Dollars 60-a-share bid. The Conseco offer values Kemper at Dollars 2.7bn on
a fully diluted basis, though the company puts the total value at Dollars
3.25bn, including Kemper's preference stock.
The bid from Conseco, a fast-growing insurance holding company based in
Carmel, Indiana, marks a return to financing techniques rarely seen since
the late 1980s. The offer, Dollars 2.2bn of which is in cash, is backed by
junk bond financing, Dollars 1.2bn of bank debt and a private buy-out fund
run by Conseco.
In a step not used in a large transaction in the 1990s, Morgan Stanley,
Conseco's adviser, has issued a letter stating it is 'highly confident' it
can raise Dollars 750m of bond finance. Such letters were the hallmark of Mr
Michael Milken, who pioneered the use of sub-investment grade paper in
acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert.
All the main rating agencies are reviewing Conseco's debt with a view to
downgrading it as a result of the leveraged deal, a move likely to put it
firmly in the non-investment grade category.
Mr Jim Parrish, in charge of sub-investment grade ratings at Moody's, said
the Conseco deal marked a return of junk bonds to back acquisitions. Until
now, the re-emergence of junk bonds in the 1990s had been based on
refinancings of 1980s deals or to raise money for companies which previously
would have turned to bank finance.
The Dollars 1.2bn commitment of bank finance from Citibank is the latest
large-scale bank deal for an acquisition. The takeover battles for Northrop
and Paramount both involved committed credit lines from individual banks
topping more than Dollars 1bn.
In another echo of the 1980s, the bid for Kemper turns on a buy-out fund run
by Conseco. Known as Conseco Capital Partners II, this fund, with equity
capital of Dollars 624m, will take over Kemper's insurance and property
activities, leaving Conseco with the less capital-intensive, fee-generating
activities.
US buy-out funds were largely left on the sidelines last year as high stock
market prices enabled quoted companies to use their paper to make
acquisitions. Lower share prices have seen the funds returning.
Forstmann Little, a buy-out specialist that has not mounted a deal since
1992, is involved in a battle for control of Western Union, a money transfer
business. Unusually, its Dollars 650m offer would be backed entirely by the
funds it runs, signalling the large resources available to the US buy-out
industry.
Although the Conseco bid is remarkable for its size, there have been other
highly-geared takeovers of financial companies during the 1990s. American
Re, the US's third largest reinsurance company, was bought from Aetna for
Dollars 1.3bn in 1992 in a deal led by buy-out specialists KKR. With only
Dollars 300m of equity behind the deal, American Re was relegated to
junk-bond status by the rating agencies. However, it has since returned to
investment grade after being taken public.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (17): Difficult choices -
Standards dilemma / Network managers have been hoping for a standard method
of controlling their distributed systems, but no single standard has yet
emerged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many network managers will be forced to choose a product in the near future
without waiting to see if a clear standard becomes apparent.
Wide area and local area networks of computers combining a variety different
makes of hardware and software have been spreading at an extremely rapid
rate, many of them outside the authority of network managers.
Network management rose to the top of the list of concerns of European
computer systems and network users for the first time last year, according
to a study by Yankee Group Europe.
There are plenty of software tools for tackling various aspects of the task,
but there is still no standard approach to it as a whole.
Network managers want more than just the ability to monitor their system
devices - such as hubs, bridges and routers. They want to be able to control
the performance of distributed applications, deliver a high level of service
to users and ensure that information is kept secure. All this has to be done
while keeping costs down, which in many cases will be achieved by charging
users for the network service.
Many system management functions which were carried out efficiently in the
old IBM mainframe environment have yet to be worked out in the new world of
distributed or client/server systems.
Any standard method of network management for these new systems must be able
to support two key communications protocols, the Internet's Simple Network
Management Protocol (SIP) and the Common Management Information Protocol
(CMIP), the Open Systems Interconnection standard promoted by the
International Standards Organisation.
SIP is generally preferred for applications based on the UNIX operating
system, which is used by most mid-range computers of the current generation.
CMIP is favoured by users in the telecommunications industry.
There have been several candidates for a network management standard, but
none has gained sufficient support to attain that status. As yet, all the
offerings provide only parts of the required solution.
The two clear front-runners are Hewlett-Packard's OpenView and IBM's
NetView/6000, which is also being marketed by Digital.
The OSF's communications manager for Europe, Mr Mark Laureys says that they
still need an industry definition of a piece of code called an object
request broker before the DME can be completed.
In the local area network sector, Microsoft is certain to be counted among
the most important players. Its Systems Management Server (formerly
code-named 'Hermes'), was previewed in May and is due to be available in
late summer.
Based on Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, it will offer some
essential functions of a network management system, including software
distribution, network auditing and remote support for applications users.
These were all high on the list of requirements of network managers in a
preliminary study conducted by Microsoft, according to its UK business
systems group marketing manager, Ms Julie Cox.
She foresees that SMS will compete to some extent with NetView and Openview.
But industry analysts expect that although Microsoft's product will be
commonly adopted on local area networks it will not be generally seen as an
enterprise-wide solution.
Thus IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft look likely to be the strongest
forces in network management for at least the next couple of years. In that
time, network management may replace the operating system as the primary
battleground for leadership of the industry.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (15): Intuition has been
rewarded - Supplier profile - Alan Cane charts the progress of an expanding
and unusual networking company / Madge Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cisco, SynOptics, 3Com and Cabletron; the communications revolution has
thrown up a raft of fast-growing, ambitious companies listed on America's
Nasdaq stock market. Among them is Madge Networks, perhaps the most unusual
networking company to have emerged in recent years.
Founded in 1986 by Robert Madge, a British architectural journalist and
entrepreneur with no technical background but a sharp appreciation of the
potential of computer networking, it is now registered as a Dutch company
with research and development in the UK and substantial marketing offices in
San Jose, California, and Tokyo.
The company was listed on Nasdaq, the world's largest over-the-counter
market, last August through an initial public offering which raised Dollars
30m in cash net of expenses. Madge says the aim of the Ipo was not to raise
money but to raise the status of the company - 'we didn't have a need for
cash; it was more a natural progression.'
There was also the problem that the company was becoming uncomfortably large
and if the offer had been left much longer, it could have been a difficult
proposition for Nasdaq, which specialises in start-up companies, to digest.
Why Nasdaq, rather than London? Madge says it was a matter of conforming to
the norms of the electronics industry - 'no specialist networking company is
listed outside the US. It was the natural place to be. We started with a
disadvantage because we missed out on the two or three-year period during
which the US venture capital community promotes new issues, so we had more
talking to do. Now Madge Networks is reasonably well understood by
investors. US investors are very knowledgeable in this area.'
And the transformation into a Dutch company? Convenience: listing as a UK
company would have thrown up tax and share complexities.
Madge specialises in token-ring networking, the technology championed by
International Business Machines for local area networking. It develops and
markets a range of hardware including network adapters, hub and router
adapters and FDDI adapters. Token Ring and Ethernet are the two key LAN
technologies. Ethernet depends on a collision detection mechanism to ensure
transmissions pass securely through the network; on a token network, the
right to transmit depends on possession of a software 'token.'
Token ring technology, Madge says, is well suited to large organisations
with widely dispersed groups of users - 'it was a new business area in
1986,' Madge says. 'We built a position as a second source to IBM in token
ring. We believed the technology would give us opportunities that others
were avoiding, afraid of the power of IBM.'
His intuition was rewarded. Revenues of Dollars 10m in 1990 grew to Dollars
145m by 1993; in the first quarter of the current year revenues were Dollars
45m, up from Dollars 29.7m in the same period the previous year. The company
was capitalised earlier this year at over Dollars 400m and Madge has become
one of the UK's richest men.
The challenge for successful young companies, especially those in the high
technology arena, is to maintain growth and profitability and keep on top of
technological developments. Madge points to heavy investment in research and
development amounting to almost Dollars 11m in 1993 and a close relationship
with customers - 'we realised that customers needed more than technology so
we have been developing customer service; we take an interest in solving
their problems.
'It is not the kind of consultancy for which we charge. Virtually all our
revenues come from product sales together with licensing fees from other
vendors. We don't have to sell consultancy; we are able to command premium
prices because of the quality of our technology.'
In 1989, for example, Madge was one of the first companies to add
intelligence to its adapters which enabled them, for example, to handle the
processing necessary to communicate between different kinds of equipment -
'we created this concept and it has become the biggest sector of our
business,' Madge says. Although the company remains wedded to token ring
technology, it is now looking beyond it to the technologies of choice for
the future. It is putting resources into Asynchrononous Transfer Mode, a
telecommunications technique which both telecommunications companies and
computer companies are exploiting with a view to providing multimedia
services.
'ATM will be the core technology in a few years time,' according to Mr
Madge. 'We know some things about the direction in which the technology is
evolving and we know what we can do with that technology. Our customers can
tell us what they think they are going to want to do about technology. We
can arrange the marriage of the two when the products are available.'
How does the company want to be assessed by the business world? 'We measure
ourselves not only in financial success but in terms of our reputation. We
want people to think highly of us,' Madge says.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (13): Making painful progress
 -Mobile data services / Technical and marketing issues have constrained the
market for mobile data services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I started writing this article in longhand
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
surprisingly, perhaps - when I was over in France for the fiftieth
anniversary of D-Day. It would have been easier if I had taken a laptop
computer with me. Things would have been easier still if I could have
checked out various bits of information for my article by accessing, over my
laptop, the Financial Times Profile information database.
Once completed, I could have sent my article down the telephone wire to the
Financial Times at Southwark Bridge in London.
The technology and the service providers already exist to send and receive
messages over computers using radio signals. In the UK, for example, there
are three mobile data network operators. But the commercial implementation
of mobile data has been painfully slow, particularly compared to mobile
telephones.
There are 2.3m cellular telephone users in the UK today - equal to four per
cent of the population. Mobile data operators, on the other hand, have only
5,500 subscribers. A variety of technical and marketing issues have
constrained the market for mobile data since IT and telecommunications
companies developed the first technologies in the early early 1980s. A
report, Mobile Data: Market Strategies, by Ovum, the London information
technology and telecoms consultancy, lists six reasons why mobile data has
not lived up to expectations. They are:
Lack of confidence in technology.
Availability of networks.
Lack of suitable terminals.
Solutions and applications.
The weakness of systems integration.
Market education.
On the technology side, a lack of suitable terminals and inadequate software
systems has been a problem. Mobile data terminals come in two generic forms:
specialist terminals; and general terminals with separate mobile data modems
to allow them to communicate over the mobile data network.
One of the main reasons for implementing a mobile data system is to extend
corporate network facilities to new groups of users, and in particular,
mobile field forces. Users have found that specialist terminals do not have
the same software capabilities as corporate systems. Those terminals which
do have software packages that match corporate networks tend to be
expensive.
Price is also an issue for users who are considering buying radio modems for
their laptop PCs.
Radio modems are larger and more expensive than their fixed network
counterparts. They are built as separate pieces of hardware rather than
incorporated into terminals. Portable modems are about the same price as
portable PCs.
Martin Garner, a telecoms consultant and mobile data specialist at Ovum,
believes the failure to attract widespread support from systems integrators
and software developers has been an important reason for mobile data's slow
growth.
The Ovum report notes that 'the leading users in mobile data tend to be very
large organisations because of the difficulty and costs associated with
engineering a mobile data system.'
Large organisations have their own sophisticated systems integration
expertise in house, and have long-standing relationships with external
systems integrators.
Confusion over the choice of network also affect the market: in the UK, for
example, there are too many networks - users are not clear about the best
choice of networks and services, and therefore delay buying-decisions until
clear winners emerge.
The Deparment of Trade and Industry awarded five mobile data network
licences in 1990. But two of the licensees handed back their licences and a
third built a network and then shut it down because it had no subscribers.
This leaves two mobile data operators, Cognito and Ram Mobile Data. A third
mobile data operator, Paknet, was awarded a licence in 1992.
But the confusion does not end there. Cellular operators Cellnet and
Vodafone offer mobile data services over their Tacs-900 analogue cellular
networks. They will soon begin offering improved data services over their
GSM digital cellular networks.
The UK's two other cellular operators, Mercury One-2-One and Orange are also
planning to offer mobile data services. In addition, National Band Three,
the national public access mobile radio operator, and a number of regional
pamr operators, also offer data services.
As a general rule, analogue cellular networks are less suited to mobile data
services than digital cellular networks. Data is transferred using
circuit-switched transmission, which is less efficient than packet-switched
transmission over GSM networks. On the other hand, GSM is still relatively
new - the first services were not launched until 1992 and the various data
transmission capabilities within the standard have not yet been implemented.
Analogue cellular networks tend to be suited to long data transmissions such
as fax and file transfer. One of the first data services over GSM will be
short messaging, which is the same principle as radio-paging.
The UK's three dedicated mobile data networks all use different system.
Cognito uses a packet-switched data protocol and has positioned itself as a
provider of relatively uncomplicated data services such as two-way
messaging.
Paknet runs a standard X25 packet switched data service. It is used mainly
for fixed applications such as electronic funds transfer at the point of
sale (Eftpos) and does not handle mobility features such as hand-off between
cells.
Ram Mobile Data uses a proprietary system, developed by Nokia of Sweden,
called Mobitex. This is also a packet-switched data system. Its main
advantage is that the network can be used by users of fixed or mobile
terminals, and by both open and closed groups of users.
In other European countries, however, there have not been enough networks -
some countries have only licensed their first mobile data operators within
the last year.
Meanwhile, Mobitex is rapidly emerging as the preferred system for mobile
data operators across Europe. Mobile data operators in eight countries -
Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, the UK,
have now adopted this system. They are planning to introduce 'roaming'
between networks, allowing subscribers in one country to use networks in
other countries.
The only potential challenger to Mobitex is Motorola's RD-LAP systems, which
is used by Deutsche Telekom in Germany. It is also used by Hutchison, the UK
mobile data operator which shut down its network last year. Motorola is now
considering buying the network from Hutchison, to operate it as a joint
venture with Cognito.
In spite of the problems that mobile data has faced, operators and
manufacturers remain confident that the market will grow rapidly. Ovum
predicts that the number of mobile data subscribers in Europe and North
America will multiply 25 times between 1994 and 2000 to reach just over 18m.
The early adopters of mobile data have been vertical markets such as police
forces and airlines. British Airways, for example, uses mobile data to check
in passengers. But over the last year, Microsoft, Novell and other software
companies have brought out products which will fuel growth in horizontal
markets.
Laptop computers with built-in radio modems could be standard items for
journalists by the time the one-hundredth anniversary of D-day is
commemorated on the Normandy beaches.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (12): Solutions more
affordable - Open systems / Open systems often owe more to theory than
reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Bowmar is divisional manager of information technology (IT) at the
construction arm of Trafalgar House. His company is one of the largest
building concerns in the UK, with projects as diverse as the Humber Bridge
and Malaysia's Pergau Dam to boast about.
This working environment is not ideally suited to computer systems. Nobody
lays out a motorway expansion site to please the IT department. Yet
two-thirds of Trafalgar House Construction's 3,000 staff have a computer
terminal.
These machines are spread over 70 locations with links to projects as far
afield as Hong Kong. The Pounds 4m inventory of computer systems embraces a
raft of suppliers and software packages. The division has an annual IT
budget, including staff and vehicles, of Pounds 5m.
However, Mr Bowmar's colleagues concentrate on engineering projects. They
are happy to make do with whatever IT equipment they've inherited, as long
as it works - 'a construction company often grows by acquisition,' he says.
'We pick up computer systems as new businesses come on board. And we don't
throw away anything on the IT side]'
This attitude towards hardware and systems might sound economical, but it
offers a real challenge to the network manager. He faces linking up local
area network (Lan) elements in a coherent wide area network (Wan). Five
years ago, that was Bill Bowmar's job.
On the surface there was an obvious answer to this networking dilemma. Open
Systems have long been touted as the panacea for networking. The term is
self-explanatory, denoting mutual standards between different suppliers.
This should allow users to mix and match equipment without worrying about
compatibility.
But Mr Bowmar quickly discovered that open systems owe more to theory than
reality. In theory, an EC-endorsed international communications protocol
known as Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is the route to networking
computers. In practice, there is still an annoying amount of adaptation
involved in creating a trouble-free Wan.
'Computing and networking should be like Japanese hi-fi,' says Mr Bowmar.
'You should take the system out of the box, plug it in - and play.'
Unfortunately, OSI failed to meet this simple test - 'we found OSI is not
like that; it's very difficult to get kit from two suppliers to interconnect
over the network.
'Our philosophy is that anything should speak to anything else, wherever the
site is located.'
Mr Bowmar's experience lead him to endorse a formidable mouthful of
technical terms: Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This
communications standard grew out of the US defence community.
TCP/IP conquered the US's vast academic computer base as a convenient
standard embedded in the depths of the computer but allowing machines to
communicate across networks.
TCP/IP is regarded as cheaper and easier to implement than the notorious
layers of regulations that constitute the OSI model.
To keep data flowing between the Lans and the Wan, Mr Bowmar called in 3Com,
a networking hardware supplier. He wanted a sole outside contractor to
deliver the routing and management computers that direct network traffic.
This equipment cost Pounds 500,000, and established Bill Bowmar's definition
of a rapport between supplier and customer - 'it's a good relationship, but
we drive them hard,' he says.
Sticking to one source simplified the question of protocols: in effect, Mr
Bowmar defined his own standards.
Despite initiatives from central government and international bodies, users
still insist on giving OSI the cold shoulder. Richard Crisp, a
communications specialist at McDonnell Douglas Information Systems (MDIS),
is not surprised - 'TCP/IP is very much a de facto standard. It's extremely
well-developed, it gives a fair fit in terms of connectivity.'
Mr Crisp is pragmatic about the computer industry's habit of trumpeting the
joys of open systems.
He confirms the gap between the official term and the practice of stringing
different systems together in a network - 'there are degrees of openness. It
is certainly getting better.'
Away from the bewildering world of communications protocol's and acronyms,
open systems have produced one great benefit. Standardisation has made it
difficult for networking specialists to differentiate between their
products.
Mr Crisp's colleague Dennis Lindsey highlights the consequences - 'open
systems have driven prices down,' he says.
'Solutions are much more affordable. If I was buying a Wan eight years ago
I'd have spent between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 500,000. Today, you could
get up to 12 remote sites on a Wan for Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 70,000.'
The key to networking is to find an infrastructure that will support the
customer's needs. St Paul Insurance specialises in high-risk operations,
from hang-glider pilots to supertankers.
Its premiums do not come cheap, and St Paul relies on constant exchanges of
information between six UK sites to keep highly specialist knowledge
flowing.
St Paul uses computers from IBM, ICL and Olivetti, and expects to be able to
pool data from these disparate sources without any problem.
'Just 18 months ago we had a series of Lans, but no infrastructure to
connect them,' says Luke Bazzard, technical services manager. Rather than
rationalise different systems that individual offices were comfortable with,
Mr Bazzard opted for the black box approach.
For Pounds 190,000, Californian Network Equipment Technologies (Net)
provided Mr Bazzard with six network management processors. These dedicated
computers took over the intricate labour of introducing traffic from one Ian
to another.
Luke Bazzard characterises his system as a 'postal service' with with TCP/IP
and an industrywide protocol from Lan giant, NoveIl acting as envelopes that
contain data. Net's contribution is to act as a post office.
Mr Bazzard's communications budget is still Pounds lm a year, on top of a
Pounds 6m IT budget. But with that kind of money in play, the Net system is
a small investment in return for maximising market intelligence spread
across a 450-strong operation.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (11): New dimensions in
messaging - Electronic data interchange and electronic mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronic data interchange (EDI) and electronic mail (e-mail) have become
embedded in the way that many companies work. They are the basic components
of a more potent group of applications, sometimes known as document
interchange and groupware. These provide the ability to interconnect groups
of people who may work in different locations or even time-zones, but
nevertheless need to work as a team.
These methods have become almost a 'lifestyle' for their users, so much that
it becomes difficult to separate out the technologies from the applications
which use them. Nor should one want to: the whole point about the benefits
of using document interchange or e-mail is that they should be to integral
to operations, just as water pipes distribute the benefits of central
heating.
The great increase of 'IT-aware' PC users has brought a new dimension into
the use of messaging. Initially, PC networks started as a way of sharing
expensive resources among several users - typically printers or other
peripherals.
The potential of connecting people so that they could share documents, and
participate in special interest groups and 'electronic diaries' really began
to dawn with widespread adoption of PC products such as Lotus Notes.
For many years, the mainframe had provided a proportion of these facilities.
A remote 'dumb' terminal (with no local processing power, such as a PC or
workstation provides) could be situated almost anywhere with a dedicated
phone line, allowing many pioneering 'teleworkers' to do their programming
from home.
Some mainframes also provided a messaging system, fairly rudimentary and
limited, inevitably, to the IT elite (already removed from the common herd)
who were likely to have a terminal in the first place.
But now, 'client-server' systems have begun to displace - or at least work
alongside - mainframes, and are used by people at every level of an
organisation. Using a far more complex structure, these systems provide a
great deal of local processing power, connected to a 'file server,' often
remote, which delivers the data across the network, from a master repository
that can be located anywhere on it. E-mail often becomes the 'glue' in some
organisations who support heterogeneous networks.
There are three phases in the development of document interchange, according
to Steve Sheppard, European marketing manager of GE Information Services,
one of the largest providers of electronic trading services globally - 'in
terms of the benefits organisations can realise out of electronic trading,
they need both the document and the data exchange - that's structured
information, representing business processes, such as invoices - and the
interpersonal communication as well,' he says.
'In practice, if an organisation exchanges a purchase order, that's
structured, but there might be a dozen interpersonal messages to support
that transaction.
'So, by using interpersonal services, such as electronic mail, we can make
that exchange of information more efficient.'
Some of the pioneer industries in developing EDI were banks, retailers, and
automoative companies. GE Information Services owns International Network
Services, INS, set up jointly with ICL to service the burgeoning electronic
trading market.
Mr Sheppard uses examples from experience to illustrate his 'three phases:'
First comes exchange between parts of an organisation - 'one pharmaceutical
customer originally set up e-mail in subsidiaries, different offices in
remote locations to allow people within the organisation to exchange
information. In phase two, users exchange data with organisations outside
their own company. That was typically structured information, such as
usually meant by EDI: invoices, payment, and so on,' he adds.
'It's important to note the distinction: it was an automation of existing
processes of organisation and trading with partners. That can bring big
benefits in cost-cutting.'
Mr Sheppard gives an example of the cost of processing an invoice, reduced
for one customer from Pounds 15-Pounds 20 per invoice to between Pounds 5
and Pounds 10 - 'a significant saving if you are processing tens of
thousands.'
Nevertheless, it's in the third phase that the benefits come home, he says.
The external value chain may start with structured messaging, but many
interpersonal messages begin to take place to support the business
processes. These can be in the form of structured and unstructured: e-mail,
intelligent 'decision-making' applications, anything to support the business
transactions.
'It's easy to connect e-mail systems even where there are different hardware
hosts. That's where the value-added service providers come in, to connect
the different services. The role of the network is in the integration of
management, security, and tying together various systems to enable better
information exchange.'
E-mail has a respectable history of 'empowering' applications, especially
where it has been used to package ready-formatted information. For example,
for some years, Whitbread Beefeater restaurants have used simple
pre-determined forms to file weekly reports, using the mainframe Verimation
Memo system.
The system can also used for urgent needs, if, for example, one branch run
short of beefburgers and need a consignment from another. But its most
imaginative growth has been its use for ad hoc questionnaires, research on
competitive menus locally, and proposed price rises.
Just as typical of e-mail use are highly complex applications built by third
parties, which use electronic mail and document interchange as part of an
application. For Royal Mail, the recent re-organisation from 64 districts
and four national territories into nine geographical divisions triggered a
re-think about communication.
What Royal Mail wanted was an open flow of information among its divisions,
and the ability to allow remote groups of people to work together as it they
were in the same office. Electronic mail had already proved itself by the
mid-1980s, in an initial experiment with 3Com's local area network and
3+Mail.
Assisted by the consultants KPMG, Royal Mail implemented a system based on
Lotus Development Corp's Lotus Notes in 1992. Called InfoRMac, (Information
and Communications system for the Royal Mail), it connects Royal Mail's
divisional general managers and directors so that they can communicate with
local managers, and co-ordinate their activities with one another. All work
with the same up-to-date information.
Royal Mail's system is based on a network of IBM AS/400s computers, one in
each of its 64 areas, running OfficeVision.
The InfoRMac project now pulls together all the Royal Mail locations in to
one X25 wide area network. Four hundred of the organisation's managers are
users, and as part of a three-year rollout, Royal Mail has bought 15,000
copies of Lotus Notes.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (10): United, we stand a
better chance - Groupwar / Good communications and the ability to share data
helps make organisations efficient. Networked applications keep the work
flowing, whether in finance, retail or manufacturing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In a business world connected by networks, communication has become a vital
part of competition.
It is almost as important to understand the basics of how things connect,
and the vital flow of processes, as it is to do the job itself. Speed of
response is now a vital element of business: if not, then some rival
organisation will move in first and win the business.
The fashion for 'business process re-engineering' (BPR) has brought another
challenge to human aptitude: how to adapt working practices and skills to a
more efficient working of the entire organisation.
The shift in thinking is not unlike the impact on manufacturing of
'just-in-time' techniques, but the target of most business process
re-engineering is not the inventory of goods, but of people. Cutting costs,
doing a better job, providing a better service with fewer staff, is the
focus of many BPR projects.
As a mere 'enabling' technology, networking is the method under-pinning many
of these changes. Users have already caught on to the potential of e-mail
alone: the sales of Lotus Development's LAN-based cc:mail and Lotus Notes
products have doubled over the last few years, with an estimated 5m users
worldwide.
The next wave is 'workflow,' groupware and so-called 'intelligent' document
management systems, (EDMS) often front-ended by document image processing
(Dip) which is used to scan in images of paper documents.
Early document management systems tended to be 'departmental.' They worked
in a closed loop, relying on scanning in of paper (Dip), and beginning and
ending the process in under one roof. That changed with the arrival of wide
area networks using heterogeneous hardware, and with the fact that much
internal information actually originates in electronic form.
A workflow system, such as the Caress system used by British Airways to
process customer complaints, can now use the network to access other
departments, sending and receiving information vital in solving a customer's
problem.
The more recent availability of high-quality ISDN lines for data
transmission adds another possibility to workflow applications: the sending
of images as well as messages.
Mr Rory Staunton, senior analyst at Gartner Group UK, is responsible for the
Intelligent Document Management Service in Europe. He notes two intertwined
themes: workflow tools, which he says originally arose as a way of
differentiating document imaging products; and a clutch of emerging
technologies including EDI, electronic data interchange, intelligent
workflow and GIS (Geographical Information Systems).
'Workflow has extended well beyond distributing images towards business
process modelling tools,' he says. 'In Europe, such products as ICL's
ProcessWise, IBM's Flowmark and Staffware from SCMC are now being used to
model business processes. They are enabled by modern high-speed LAN
communications, but what is interesting is the emergence of high-speed
networks in Europe such as ISDN. This has suddenly enabled traditional
back-office operations to be brought nearer to customers so that they can
add value.'
As an example, he says that Phrasea of Paris, in the media business, is
distributing quality colour images from its picture library, sending a high
quality image down the line in 15 seconds - 'that has revolutionised the job
of picture selection. The effect is to enable companies to reconsider the
structure of their company document repositories, so that they can maintain
the integrity and security of central archives whilst still delivering the
latest information when it's needed, where it's needed - in other words,
moving towards just-in-time documents, which don't go out of date unlike
their paper counterparts.'
Another option, for infrequently connected users, is to replicate the
document repositories, a feature that characterises the market leader, Lotus
Notes, which works by copying the database and sending it elsewhere.
Mr Staunton puts the other 'enabling' technologies into order of importance:
imaging, followed by Edi, then applied intelligence systems, and fourthly,
GIS.
'Although those are key technologies for re-engineering, IT departments
still talk about TCP-IP, client-server, and object oriented databases. The
IT community still has to grasp the challenge of becoming 'enablers' of
re-engineering rather than technology pushers.'
In the automotive industry, which pioneered so much co-operative development
in Edi, document management is providing the next step. Ford is using
Intergraph software, an EDMS system with roots in technical authoring and
desktop publishing, to create, publish, translate and distribute the
documentation, workshop manuals and training material for its first 'world
car,' the Mondeo.
Ford's partner in developing an all-purpose vehicle, Volkswagen, uses the
same system, which will help cut down the tight timescale in which such
documentation has to be produced. The new vehicle is being built in
Portugal: the documentation can in theory, be done anywhere.
Office automation, the most visible and obvious of targets for streamlining,
still poses IT problems, not least of infrastructure. The London Borough of
Tower Hamlets recently rebuilt its entire IT operations, using five
different but interconnected local area networks.
The restructuring, helped by networking specialist Fibronics, had to be done
within days, so essential was the network to the service Tower Hamlets
provides. Eddie Best, business co-ordinator at Tower Hamlets, already notes
a change in culture - 'with the new network there is a greater amount of
shared data, which means more people are better informed. We are also
experiencing a change in culture towards communication by electronic means.
E-mail is quickly becoming indispensable.'
Processing power in office automation applications, such as at Tower
Hamlets,uses only a fraction of the computing power available.
Financial applications, especially those involving complex computations,
slow down networks much as heavy loads used to slow down the processing on
mainframes. Nor are networks as adaptable to uneven processing loads.
One solution is JetNet, a PC system that works on the time-sharing
principle. As yet unproven on a very large scale - except in one remarkable
application for the main telecommunications authority in New Zealand - it
shares out unused PC power across the network to speed up intensive
processes such as calculation and compilation.
In financial and trading applications, more conventional solutions include
the high-volume servers from Auspex Systems.
Auspex specialises in high-speed file servers for applications like fixed
income, and foreign exchange trading: anything involving fast processing for
a great number of users.
In mathematically intensive applications such as Collaterised Mortgage
Obligation (CMO) calculations, the volume of processing can put a strain on
networks. An increasing amount of 'intelligent' analysis, based on
pre-determined rules, increases the workload further.
'Networks have lowered the costs of analytical applications dramatically,
combined with Unix and inexpensive Ethernet high-speed networking,' explains
Dr Bruce Nelson, chief technologist at Auspex.
'Large groups such as Amex can now use networks of low-cost Unix computers
for intensive processing. Everyone is looking to keep costs at rock-bottom.
'IT planners in a lot of financial institutions probably think of putting
50-100 users of Ethernet and token ring networks for such applications as
word processing. But for advanced trading applications, such as foreign
exchange options and CMO, the computational power needed is so high that as
few as 10 workstations can burn up an Ethernet.'
It is this trend that has driven companies like Auspex to supply server
products that can support 24 simultaneous Ethernets with four simultaneous
FDDIs (fibre distributed data interfaces), and hundreds of gigabytes of
online disc storage, he says.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (9): EDS wins big Xerox
contract - Dollars 3.2bn landmark 'outsourcing' deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Xerox Corporation has awarded a 10-year, Dollars 3.2bn contract to
Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the computer services company owned by
General Motors, to operate the Xerox worldwide computer and telecoms
network, writes Michael Wiltshire.
The 'outsourcing' contract is believed to be the largest of its kind, and
the first to encompass the worldwide information management operations of
any company.
Under the arrangement, EDS will assume responsibility for Xerox
data-processing, telecoms and computer network services in 19 countries, and
provide and maintain the computer applications that support Xerox's internal
business processes.
EDS will control data centre operations, including the main ones in the US,
the UK and Brazil; worldwide voice and data communications; desktop systems
support; and business-support applications.
Xerox will retain responsibility for determining the architecture of its
computer systems, strategy and program development. It will also continue to
service and support its customers.
In all, 1,700 Xerox staff, including 1,400 in the US and 750 in the UK, will
transfer to EDS over the next 18 months. Xerox has taken the unprecedented
step of outsourcing almost all its information management operations to
'focus resources on our core business of document processing, which is
critical to ensure our continued success in a fiercely competitive
industry,' says Mr Paul Allaire, Xerox chairman.
The outsourcing arrangement will cut costs, he adds - 'this is the first
truly global commercial information management outsourcing arrangement and
provides an opportunity for EDS to showcase its proven abilitities.'
EDS has operations in more than 30 countries and employes around 70,000
people. Xerox awarded the contract to EDS following a six-month study of its
information management organisation. Patricia Wallington, chief information
officer at Xerox, says the cost-saving deal 'will allow us to focus on
improving the delivery of computer and telecoms services that support Xerox
people; and free Xerox management to pursue a strategic course to design and
integrate new technologies.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (8): Managers are discovering
new Lans - New technologies are linking local and wide area networks / Many
observers see ATM technology as the key to high-speed networking, both for
wide-area and national networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Network managers do not install new local area networks (Lans) - 'managers
discover them,' says Sean Phelan of the Yankee Group Europe. 'It's not
unknown for a Lan to be purchased out of the furniture budget, and only to
come to light when the finance director queries a maintenance demand on
furniture.'
Low prices are turning Lans into a commodity, with a compound sales growth
of 70 per cent a year, according to the consultancy, Ovum. But increasingly,
the challenge companies face is not how to connect personal computers into
Lans, but how to integrate all the Lans within a building - and beyond that,
around the company.
Many Lans are installed to meet a specific need (such as the need for a
group of workers to share information); others are set up on an ad hoc
basis. The latter tend to be introduced to share a printer, after which a
file server (a computer which stores files), and basic electronic mail
(e-mail) follow.
The drivers for Lan integration are somewhat different. They include:
Globalisation:
As companies increasingly compete on a global basis, they want quick access
to market intelligence from around the world and better internal
communications. This can be achieved using Lan e-mail.
Legacy systems:
If aging, mainframe-based 'legacy' applications are made available via
company Lans, some of their complexity can be disguised by graphical user
interfaces.
Cost-savings:
Companies can cut costs by moving applications off the mainframe and on to
smaller systems, such as local-area networks of PCs, where hardware and
development costs are lower. Lans are also an important component of
client-server computing (where processing is shared between 'client' PCs and
more powerful 'server' systems).
Delayering:
As company remove layers of management, the information and tools for
dispersed decision-making need to be made available to users throughout the
organisation.
Lans can be interconnected using a number of devices including bridges,
routers and gateways. Routers have become the most popular for large-scale
Lan integration.
They are so-called because as well as connecting two networks they also have
the ability to select routes through a network. The drive towards Lan
integration is boosting sales of routers, benefiting suppliers like Cisco
and Wellfleet. The Yankee Group says router sales are doubling every year.
If two or more Lans are to be connected, a router most be put on each and
the two routers linked by a cable. If the two Lans are within the same
building or at the same site they become a bigger Lan.
EXPANDING THE NETWORK
If two or more Lans at different sites are connected, they become a
wide-area network, or Wan. (Any public or private network which connects
computers over distance, such as a public X25 network, can also be described
as a Wan.) The main difference between a Wan and a Lan, says Phelan, is that
'you have to pay other people for bandwidth.'
The situation is analogous to the telephone. If you phone a colleague in the
same building, the call is free, but if you phone someone in Manchester, the
chances are that your company is paying BT or Mercury for the call, or at
the very least renting leased lines from them.
A number of technologies are available - or becoming available - for linking
Lans into Wans. They include: leased lines, X25 packet switching, frame
relay, and ATM (or asynchronous transfer mode). Each has their pros and
cons.
Leased lines (point-to-point telecoms links) are fast, offering
data-transmission speeds of 64 Kbits or higher, but they are really
expensive.
X25, a form of packet switching, once seemed like a good compromise. It can
be used over a public data network (provided by BT, Mercury or others).
Because users share the network, sending their data in 'packets,' costs are
lower than for leased lines. The drawback is that X25 is slow, offering
typical speeds of 9,600 bits per second.
Today, frame relay provides a better solution for connecting Lans. Peter
Cook, marketing director Europe at AT&amp;T Istel, describes frame relay as
'like X25 on speed' because, though similar, it is five to 10 times faster.
It starts where X25 finishes at 64 kilobits. But a lot of error-correction
codes - not needed on modern telecoms lines - have been stripped out.
Frame relay is also cheaper because companies only pay for the bandwidth
they actually use. It is ideal for the 'bursty' traffic typical of Lan
usage, where data (such as a file) is only sent from time to time.
Frame relay networks are being rolled out by a number of companies including
BT and AT&amp;T. These cover larger cities in the UK and a growing number in
other countries.
Interest from users is high. Twenty-five per cent of the
requests-for-proposal that BT Global Network Services (GNS) receives include
frame relay. Nick Brooks, product manager for Lan interconnect at BT GNS,
says: 'Later in the year, we will also be offering ISDN (integrated services
digital network) as an alternative to frame relay for occasional Lan
traffic, or as a back-up.'
Market researchers Frost &amp; Sullivan believe that technologies such as frame
relay and ATM will take market share from widely available (but limited) Lan
protocols like TCP/IP (Transaction Control Program/Internet Protocol).
FRAME RELAY CHALLENGE
ATM could, however, also pose a threat to the emerging frame relay market.
Though still only in the trial phase in Europe, there are great hopes for
ATM because it was designed from day one for fibre-optic networks and
multi-megabit speeds.
It processes data in hardware rather than software, which is much faster. So
ATM chips can be designed to do nothing but pump out 53-byte data cells at
phenomenal speeds.
As well as superseding frame relay, ATM could also replace metropolitan-area
networks, (Mans).
These systems were originally conceived as high-speed networks that would
cover a city. Mans have been talked about as possible on and off-ramps for
information highways, the national information networks envisioned by US
vice-president Al Gore.
Many of the ideas behind Mans have influenced the development of ATM. But so
much more research and development money is going into ATM, that Mans are
unlikely to play more than a niche role. For example, BT now uses the
technology behind Mans - SMDS (or switched multi-megabit data service) - to
provide very high speed links between computers, such as high-powered
workstations and supercomputers.
'ATM is happening in Europe this year,' says Phelan. 'A lot of people are
seeing it as the future of high-speed networking, both for wide-area and for
national networks'.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (7): The battle intensifies -
Race to supply new operating systems software - The emerging mid-range
systems market has now become the main battleground for the new strand of
operating system development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Operating systems software occupies a pivotal position in modern computer
systems. Not only does the choice of operating system define the computer
hardware - it also defines the application.
The choice of operating systems platform has, in effect, replaced the choice
of hardware for users.
While in the past, there was always a danger that computer users could
become dependent upon their hardware supplier, over the last decade the
emphasis has shifted to the operating system platform supplier. This has
become increasingly confusing for users and software developers who are
looking for a stable platform on which to build applications.
The result has been a bitter public conflict among operating system
suppliers, each hoping to gain dominance in the market.
This conflict dates back to the mid-1980s when the virtues of common
operating environments were first recognised.
The success of IBM's Personal Computer (PC) along with Microsoft's MS/Dos
created a large, homogeneous software product market for the first time.
Previously, every computer came with its own operating environment - making
it impossible to move application software from one machine to another
without significant changes.
The MS/Dos PC changed this and allowed a new breed of mass market software
developers such as Lotus, Novell and Microsoft to dominate personal computer
software.
Towards the end of the 1980s, these and other software producers saw that
the same approach could be taken to build software for larger systems -
either in the form of PC networks or client-server systems.
The need emerged, therefore, for an operating environment which could
deliver the same advantages as a PC operating system, while coping with the
greater complexity of multi-user systems.
It is this emerging mid-range systems market which has become the main
battleground for the new strand of operating system development. There is no
shortage of contenders. Microsoft is in pole position with the extended
version of its successful Windows-MS/Dos operating system for the PC.
Known as Windows NT, it is claimed to be the natural migration path for
single PC users who want to move into multi-user networked systems.
Microsoft aimed to sell a million copies by the end of its first year and,
while this target has proved to be ambitious, Microsoft has managed to get
close to it. More significantly, sales of the original Windows are now about
50m worldwide and growing quickly. Microsoft's main rival comes from a
combination of Novell and other Microsoft competitors who back various
flavours of the Unix operating system originated by AT&amp;T's Bell laboratories
in the 1970s. Unix has the advantage of a long history of supporting
multiple users and wide backing across the industry.
Most hardware manufacturers offer a Unix platform - although they are not as
consistent as they should be in conforming to the standards. Unix has
managed to gain some success in the mid-range systems market and a good
portfolio of applications software now exists for it.
The other main rival to Windows NT is OS/2 - an operating system developed
originally by both Microsoft and IBM. When it was announced in 1987, it was
designed to replace MS/Dos. But after slow initial success, IBM and
Microsoft went their separate ways - leaving IBM to continue OS/2
development on its own. OS/2 has attracted a solid core of established large
IBM customers because it fits in well with their existing systems.
The OS/2 operating systems has an estimated four million users worldwide -
but has had little success outside the IBM market.
These three - Windows NT, Unix and OS/2 - are the main contenders in the
operating systems conflict and each faction has embarked on a campaign to
attract firstly, application software developers and, secondly, end-user
companies.
The conflict is further confused, however, by the emergence of a new strain
of object-oriented operating systems. Apple's Macintosh, for example, has
attracted attention - although it is limited by its ties to Apple's
hardware.
Apple founder Steve Jobs left to form Next Computer in the late 1980s,
creating yet another potential rival operating environment. Next has built a
version of its Nextstep object-oriented system for the PC and, again, has
scored some success in niche markets.
Another object-oriented environment has grown out of a joint venture between
Apple and IBM under the Taligent name. Taligent promises to improve
development productivity with its operating system - although it will be
some time before it its ready for the market.
The primary task of all of the contenders in the operating system battle is
to woo software package developers. MS/Dos was successful because Microsoft
was able to persuade a large number of application builders to base their
packages on it.
Software developers are sanguine about operating systems, however, and many
have accepted that, unlike the MS/Dos market, they will have to back several
different options.
'We have taken the view that the operating system is irrelevant to the
end-user and are working to hide it,' explains Mr Ketan Karia, director of
marketing at application software tool specialist Cognos UK.
'We aim to make our tools work across a range of operating systems but we
are concentrating on Unix and Windows NT at the moment.' Mr Derek Masters,
managing director of Sterling Software UK, comes at the problem from a
different angle. As a veteran software supplier to the IBM mainframe market,
Mr Masters says his company has been driven by customers moving from
mainframe-based systems to networked systems.
'Three years ago our customers were entirely mainframe based. Now they have
lots of Unix, Windows and OS/2 systems which they want attached to their
mainframes. We have had to change our products to cover the whole range.'
Sterling's products involve managing communications and data storage across
an enterprise and must, therefore, be capable of coping with any operating
environment which might be connected to the network.
'Microsoft is in a strong position with Windows NT - although we find our
traditional customers favour OS/2 because of its IBM background. Then again
we see Unix creeping in - especially in applications which use electronic
data interchange (EDI),' Mr Masters adds.
In theory, users should not have to worry about operating systems and, in
the long term, it seems likely that much of burden caused different
environments will be shouldered by tool builders.
Meanwhile, software developers and users will have to accept that they must
keep an eye on all of the main contenders - and maybe some of the
'also-rans.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (6): Big benefits ahead -
Client-server technology / Larger companies see 'downsizing' as a way to cut
computer hardware costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER

<TEXT>
The fruits of the collision between computers and telecommunications over
the last 20 years have seldom lived up to their promise. Persistent
predictions about the imminence of mass teleworking and the global village
have always proved premature.
The fundamental problem is that getting computers and telecommunications to
work together at all is a tough task.
Firstly, the two industries are culturally poles apart - telecommunications
is slow-moving, heavily regulated and capital intensive, while computing is
fast-moving, unregulated and skills-intensive.
Secondly, rival suppliers in both industries must be coerced into agreeing
to basic technical standards - while leaving them enough room to innovate
and differentiate themselves in the market. And standards take years of
negotiation, are usually out-of-date or irrelevant by the time they are
published and are difficult and expensive to enforce.
That it is possible to connect two different computers to a telephone line
and get them to swap messages is a modern wonder of the world, against such
a background.
Even assuming that it is possible to get two different computer environments
to talk to each other, the problems of distributing computer power across a
network have only just begun. It is not just a case of distributing power by
putting workstations on desktops and large local 'server' computers in
offices. Modern distributed systems need ways to distribute functionality,
too.
This is not simple. Decisions must be made about the distributing
applications and the difficulties of achieving this are a significant
barrier to the spread of client-server technology.
The so-called client-server architecture is now widely seen as the way to
solve the problem of distributing functionality. It splits information
technology (IT) systems into 'client' processes and 'server' processes.
Typically, a desk- top workstation incorporating local processing power will
be the 'client' and a high-speed laser printer or large data storage device
will provide the services through the network.
This design approach has been very successful for installing PC-based
networks where the design issues are relatively simple - connecting
workstation PCs to each other and to printer and data storage resources.
But the scope of client-server is now being extended to embrace - and even
emulate - traditional central terminal/host applications based on
mainframes. This phenomenon is usually called 'downsizing' and it has caught
the imagination of large user organisations which see it a way to reduce
hardware costs and give them the flexibility to bring their old applications
into the 1990s.
According to a survey of UK users conducted by client-server database
company Gupta, earlier this year, 75 per cent of companies see client-server
technology as central to their future IT strategy.
Using client-server design principles for 'legacy' applications means that
they can be equipped with better 'front end' user interfaces on the desktop.
Software environments such as Microsoft's Windows or Apple's Macintosh
enable old applications to be presented with a new graphics-based 'front
end' and make life easier for users.
But genuine client-server systems must go much further than this. Decisions
about where to the put the 'logic' of the application - either on the client
or the server - are difficult to make. Many companies are ill-equipped for
this task.
'One of the main lessons we have learned from large-scale client-server
projects is that development people need re-educating and their skills need
to change,' says Mr Lawrence Hunt, director of software company ACT's
distributed systems group.
'To get the real benefits from client-server technology you need a different
attitude to systems design and development. You need to relate more closely
to the business needs and get application designers to think about them
rather than concentrating solely on the technology,' he adds.
There are, of course, technology issues involved and application designers
face evergrowing complexity when trying to integrate client-server systems -
'in the past it was the hardware companies that took on the integration role
 -but now it is software companies and tool builders,' says Mr Michael
Miner, chief executive of Blyth Software, a development tool and database
software specialist.
'The problem is that a lot of people have been trained in 1970s technology -
much of which is no longer relevant in client-server systems,' adds Mr
Miner.
Like Mr Hunt of ACT, Mr Miner sees the answer in improving the skills of
development staff and placing increased emphasis on business needs.
'Typically, you need a team of people who are skilled with various
technologies, but with a focus on the business problem. They need to create
new business rules and use tools which make application development easier.'
A key aspect of this is to choose tools which can to sort out the dividing
line between the client and the server - in other words, whether to place
the application logic on every desktop or to place it solely on the server.
'We see the future of client-server in what we call second generation
tools,' explains Mr Ketan Karia, director of marketing at software tools
builder Cognos. 'Our Axient tool allows developers to build the application
code once and then deploy it across different platforms - across databases,
operating systems and different approaches to client-server.
'This means that the client can be a 'fat' client with lots of application
logic built in or a 'thin' client which relies on logic in the server,' he
continues.
This approach is likely to become the norm for tool-builders and will help
application builders with the difficult problem of dividing client and
server components. Even with this particular problem solved, however,
client-server systems are likely to be as complex - or, perhaps, even more
complex than their predecessors.
This will inevitably mean that any savings in hardware costs will be matched
by increased software development and system integration costs. The benefits
 -more responsive and more flexible systems - should be worth it, however.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (4): Link for 25m users - Rush
to join the global Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Use of the Internet, an global network of computer networks, is expanding
rapidly as individual personal computer users and companies recognise its
value for communications, research and marketing.
The Internet is the most expansive network of computer networks in the
world, linking an estimated 2.2m computers and over 25m users in 137
countries. Use of the Internet is growing at a rate of about ten per cent
per month.
'The Net,' as it is commonly called, is an outgrowth of a US government
funded research program that began in the late 1960s to electronically link
researchers at US universities and government laboratories. Throughout the
1980s, the Internet grew in popularity among computer hobbyists - it
provides cheap electronic mail, conferencing and network searching
capabilities for personal computer junkies. 'Virtual communities' with
common interests are linked on the Internet, exchanging messages from all
over the world.
One of the Internet's attractions is that it allows users to explore
computer data bases all over the world. It is possible, for example, to pour
through the catalogue of the Library of Congress, access information about
NASA space shots, or log on to computers in Australia  - all for the cost of
a local phone call, plus whatever connect charges are imposed by the 'access
provider.'
The growing popularity of the Internet has spawned dozens of these 'access
providers'; companies and organisations that provide individual and
corporate computer users with 'dial up' links to the Internet.
Some, such as the Web in Northern California, encourage social interaction
on-line and off, among their users. This gives them a distinct 'net culture'
reflecting the views and interests of their subscribers. Others act simply
as a connection service, much like a phone company provides links to its
voice network.
Until very recently, however, use of the Internet has been limited to those
with a relatively high level of computer expertise. Most computers on the
Internet run the UNIX operating system, which is unfamiliar to the majority
of PC users. The Internet therefore lacked the 'user friendly' features such
as graphical user interfaces that have made PCs increasingly easy to use.
Now several interface programs are making the 'Net' more accessible to
computer novices. In particular, a program called Mosaic, developed by the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is gaining popularity as an easy to use point
and click interface for searching portions of the Internet.
Millions of new Internet users are also beginning to gain access to the
worldwide network via commercial on-line information services such as
Compuserve and America Online.
Business use of the Internet is also on the rise , with thousands of
companies hooking their internal networks on to 'the Net.' In the US, the
number of business 'host' computers directly linked to the Internet
increased 63 per cent to 567,686 over the 12 months ending in January,
almost equaling the number of Internet links to US colleges and
universities. Each 'host' computer can support numerous individual personal
computer users.
Use of the Internet in the UK jumped 94 per cent over the same period, with
113,930 host computers hooked up by the end of January. Much of the UK
growth is also believed to come from the commercial sector. Companies are
rushing to take advantage of the Internet as a low-cost route for
international electronic mail. Digital Equipment, the US computer company,
is one of the heaviest users of the Internet, with over 31,000 computers
linked to the system. The company exchanges an average of 1.7m e-mail
messages with people outside the company per month.
The open nature of the Internet with its millions of users and the lack of
any central control has , however, created security problems. Corporate
users of the Internet therefore typically try to isolate their internal
computer networks from the Internet to avoid intrusions from curious or
malevolent computer 'hackers.'
'Security has become a barrier to the commercial growth of the Internet.
Many clients want to connect, but won't do it because of the security
problems,' says Jim Hogan, vice president of global communication and
information processing services at Digital Equipment. The company has 'at
least one or two (computer) break-in attempts per week,' he acknowledges.
'Over the past ten years, we've developed methods of securing our own
network that, as far as we know, have never been penetrated.'
Digital recently announced an Internet security service based on the
technology and expertise that it has developed to protect its own networks.
Digital's system incorporates two 'gateways,' one that is linked to the
Internet and a second that is hidden from the outside world. In effect, the
system builds 'firewalls' around internal networks, protecting them from
unwanted intruders. Encryption and user authentication systems could bring
greater security to the Internet, experts say. However, the introduction of
such systems is not welcomed by many Internet enthusiasts who fear that they
will detract from the open communications that have long been a central
facet of 'net culture.'
O'Reilly and Associates, a US publishing group, has created the Global
Network Navigator, a free Internet-based information center that includes
news, an online magazine, an interactive catalogue and a global marketplace
containing advertiser-sponsored information on a wide range of products and
services.
In California's Silicon Valley, a consortium of companies and organisations
is establishing CommerceNet, an electronic marketplace for high technology
companies.
Mecklermedia , a US technology publishing group, recently launched
'MecklerWeb,' an electronic communications and marketing system aimed at
companies that want to have a 'corporate presence' on the Internet.
Such business uses of the Internet will secure its future as a critical part
of the 'information superhighway,' drawing resources to the development of
new software for use on the Internet and encouraging its expansion.
The Internet of the future is , however, likely to be very different from
the research oriented network that its creators originally envisaged, and
from the computer hobbyists' playground that the Internet has been for the
past decade.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (5): Viruses are no joke -
Worries over network saboteurs - Networking allows an easier spread of
information across an organisation - unfortunately, the same principle
applies to computer viruses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY

<TEXT>
Computer hackers have a powerful disguise. Forget the image of the amateur
hacker who has the habit of gazing into a screen, probing password
combinations, long after sane people have gone to bed.
Technical ability is nothing beside the rather comic image of the socially
inadequate teenager whose world revolves around intruding into computer
networks. And once the hacker is perceived as an ineffectual individual, it
follows that his activities are harmless and do not merit serious
punishment.
This failure to spot a real threat has allowed hackers, and the authors of
computer viruses, a remarkable freedom of movement. A recent DTI sponsored
survey on IT security found that viruses were responsible for 27 per cent of
security breaches in PC networks. The figure for standalone PCs, isolated
from any network, is much higher. But the potential for damage once a virus
is loose in a network is enormous.
One of the most expensive virus outbreaks infected three large networks and
over 200 personal computers. Immediate costs to the company concerned ran to
Pounds 100,000. This is not petty vandalism. But like their creators,
computer viruses still retain the air of a practical joke.
The world's largest computer company IBM uses a huge number of internal
networks. Mike Collins, UK manager for IBM local area network (Lan)
software, reports that the virus threat is taken very seriously - 'a virus
on a Lan can wreak havoc. It can lie dormant until triggered on a certain
date when it corrupts every file. It's possible to lose a whole database or
the contents of every hard disk.'
Mr Collins concedes that some lightweight hackers are just out to poke fun -
'these anorak-types are usually quite visible, but people who infiltrate a
destructive virus are perpetrating wanton vandalism when translated on to a
computer screen.'
The tacky glory of Las Vegas will witness just how far the network saboteurs
can go when the gambling resort hosts a three-day conference from July 22.
The title is 'Def Con II,' a sarcastic jibe at military systems and their
escalating scale of what are termed 'defence conditions' or 'def cons' for
short - which are states of alert. 'Def Con II' invites hackers and virus
writers from across the globe to swop ideas and lines of code. Among its
'highlights' will be an award to the winner of the Second International
Virus Writing Contest. The conference is legal under US law.
Faced with worries over serious hackers and virus writers, how can a company
secure its networks against a determined, and apparently organised, enemy?
Dr Nigel Bennee spent 11 years with Nato headquarters in The Hague. A
nuclear physicist by training, he was responsible for secure systems in a
highly sensitive environment. These days he has left the world of military
counter-measures to take up a post as director at the networking
specialists, Intelligent Networks.
Characterising his area of expertise as 'wizardry,' Bennee explains that he
'understands things from inside out' - this often means spurning the
technology-intensive approach for 'common sense tactics . . . viruses are
totally defeatable, purely by procedures. One of the best devices at your
disposal is terms-and-conditions of employment.'
Viruses are frequently transmitted via computer games, he explains. Hence a
growing number of companies regard game-playing as a sackable offence. It
sounds a draconian solution. But a sales person returning from the field
with a portable personal computer has to download sales data. If his or her
machine contains an unauthorised program, it can infect an entire company
with a destructive virus in a matter of seconds. Best practice means keeping
a strict eye on which programs are running and where they appear. The whole
point of networking is that it allows information to spread across an
organisation - unfortunately, the same principle applies to viruses.
'I've seen Flight Simulator running on a Pounds l0,000 graphics
workstation,' Bennee recalls. 'If that copy had been purchased by the
company for staff to play with, fine. If an employee brought it from home it
constitutes a danger.'
In an ideal world, companies would recognise the overpowering temptation to
indulge in high-tech games: a standalone PC, isolated from the network and
dedicated to personal software is one answer. But staff need to be fully
aware that carrying a disk across from this box to their professional system
is risky. The threat of severe disciplinary action is certainly one way to
reinforce this message.
Reflex Magnetics expanded into the business of virus protection after a
virus attack threatened its original line of duplicating computer data.
Reflex sells Disknet, a program that resides on a network and interrogates
floppy disks to ensure they have already been scanned for virus infection.
In the absence of a positive response, Disknet prevents the suspect disk
from accessing the computer's hard disk, and hence passing a virus on.
Disknet costs Pounds 5,000 to implement across a 100-user network. Reflex
sales director Andy Campbell has become increasingly concerned about the
virus threat to networks. Files are 'compressed' in order to be flashed over
a network - 'these present a problem, it's harder to identify a virus,' he
says.
Disknet spots those files on a disk that have been compressed, expands them
to their original format, and hands over to an additional tool whose name
should impress 'codeword crazy' virus authors: the tool is Thunderbyte,
developed by the Dutch systems house, Esass. It scans for the presence of a
virus.
Thunderbyte apart, Reflex technical director Dr David Aubrey-Jones knows it
takes more than a macho name-tag on a scanner to halt the flow of viruses
christened with names like 'Pathogen' or 'Ripper.'
UK authorities are applying a firm policy to help avert the virus threat.
Scotland Yard's computer crime unit has hit back, too, closing down
electronic bulletin boards that have been used to pass on details of
destructive viruses.
But the culture represented by the 'Def Con II3 event is still active. Dr
Aubrey-Jones reports that a particular CD-rom disk, containing masses of
computer data, is headed for Europe from the US.
On sale for Dollars 100, the disk contains a large catalogue of viruses for
the corporate saboteur to savour.
Thunderbyte should be busy.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (2): Guide to the networking
revolution / Book review of Encyclopedia of Networking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you don't know your hub* from your router**, the LAN Times Encyclopedia
of Networking could be the book for you. Managers who have struggled to come
to grips with the language of computing are now faced with a whole new set
of acronyms and expressions as the networking revolution gathers pace,
writes Alan Cane.
Because computing and telecommunications are culturally and historically
quite distinct disciplines, much of networking can seem a black art even to
data processing specialists.
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), for example, without doubt the most
important new buzzword in networking, foxes even experienced software
specialists. The Encyclopedia takes eleven pages to explain ATM in depth,
starting with the proposition that this data transmission technology has the
potential to revolutionise the way computer networks are built.
It uses the analogy of vehicles crossing a bridge. If all the vehicles are
the same length and driven at the same speed, it is easy to predict when a
vehicle reaches the far side of the bridge.
ATM involves chopping digital information into packets or cells of similar
size travelling on the network at similar speeds.
This provides a speed and efficiency denied earlier technologies where
packets vary in size and therefore cause delays at switching points - 'using
same-size cells provides a way of predicting and guaranteeing bandwidth for
applications that need it,' the Encyclopedia says.
Written by Tom Sheldon, it takes an appropriately broad view of the
networking world, including topics such as Arpanet, the experimental
computer network which eventually gave rise to the Internet; client-server
computing, the new model for data processing in the 1990s; and Lotus Notes,
the emerging standard for group working.
The Encyclopedia is intended as a reference work rather than a guide to
networking, but any manager anxious to make sense of networking should be
able to translate trade paper and journal articles with its help.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (3): Buzzwords in brief - From
Ace and ATM to Lans, Mans and Vans / Although networking has vital
implications for the business world, the technology is often obscured by
technical jargon and buzzwords. Here, for the non-technical reader, Michael
Wiltshire offers some simplified definitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Access control method: the main distinguishing feature between different
local area network (Lan) technologies.
ACE: advanced computing environment - a standard sponsored by a consortium
of 22 vendors, including DEC, Microsoft and Compaq.
ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is the
standard method of identifying characters, numerals and punctuation marks.
ATM technology: asynchronous transfer mode, developed in France in the
mid-1980s, is a breakthrough in communication technology with the potential
to support transmission of combined data, voice and video at up to 45
megabits a second.
ATM opens the door to many new network applications.
Baud: a measure of signal changes per second in a device such as a modem.
Backbone: generic term for a Lan or Wan connections 'trunk' between
sub-networks across an enterprise. Subnetworks are connected to the backbone
via bridges and/or routers.
Bandwidth: the range of signal frequencies that can be carried on a
communications channel.
Bit: a binary unit of information that can have two values, 0 or 1. The word
'bit' is a contraction of binary digit.
Block: a collection of transmitted data.
Broadband: a term with a number of meanings - it was coined originally to
describe a channel with more bandwidth than a standard voice grade channel,
usually a 48kHz link, equal to 12 voice-grade channels. Such channels are
gradually being superseded by digital circuits.
Broadcast: when a user sends a message from one terminal to others on the
network.
CCITT: an international body, made up of telephone companies and other IT
players, responsible for setting global communication standards.
Client-server technology: the most widespread example of network computing:
moves information processing to where it is most economical, fast and
useful; divides computer systems into front-end 'client' workstations and
back-end 'server' processes.
CTI: computer-telephony integration - also known as computer-supported
telephony.
Data compression: a key topic for network managers as multimedia, video,
document imaging and other technologies emerge.
Domains: a Microsoft inspired network structure which separates large
networks into smaller, more manageble segments. A domain can be made up of
multipler servers and thousands of workstations.
DBMS: database management system - a software system to manage data.
DCE: data communications equipment, the hardware that provides connection to
the network; DTE stands for data terminal equipment on a network, eg
computers, printers and plotters.
Digital signature: an encryption method to validate an electronic message.
Distributed database: data located at multiple sites.
Digital signal: this has only two values, normally 0 and 1, during
transmission, as opposed to analogue signals whose values vary all the time.
Dynamic routing: a way of sending messages across a network - if a line
fails or is overloaded, the system will automatically re-route the message.
Packet switching operates on this principle, with the system always poised
to react to ever-changing conditions.
EDI: electronic data interchange for business data such as purchase orders
and invoices between companies.
Electronic mail: sending and receiving messages and text-based information
between computers; the most common application on networks.
Ethernet: one of the oldest Lan technologies, developed by Xerox, Intel and
DEC to run over coaxial cable; highly successful and still popular.
File server: a computer attached to a Lan, usually running on a network
operating system (Nos).
Frames: a segment of data sent over a network medium using a cable or laser.
The frame size is dependent on the protocols and services used.
Frame relay: a data communication method for wide area networks, slowly
replacing X25 - an X series standard, specifying the interface between
computers and packet switched networks.
Groupware: network software that defines applications used by a group of
people. See page five.
GUI: a graphical user interface to enable computer users to easily select a
'menu item' by using a 'mouse' to click on to a graphic icon.
Hub: the centre of a star topology network or cabling system.
Interoperability: the ability of applications on two computer systems to
exchange information so that they can understand each other.
ISDN: the slow-to-emerge integrated services digital network covering a
range of voice, data and image services.
Internet: the most expansive network of computer networks in the world, with
25m users - see article on facing page.
ISO: International Standards Organisation, based in Geneva; responsible for
many data communication standards, the best-known being the seven-layer Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.
Lan: a local area network - in its simplest form, a cabling system.
Installing a private cabling system (to which computers can be connected)
and by using agreed proceedures (protocols), communications between all
stations is possible.
Man: metropolitan area network; usually high speed fibre-optic systems.
Modems: short for modulators/demodulators; devices for connecting computers
to public switched telephone networks (PSTN).
Multimedia: brings voice, video and graphics to the network in the form of
large files, requiring high disc storage space; plus large amounts of
bandwidth during transmission.
NetWare: Lan networking products including an operating system developed by
Novell that holds a large market share of the Lan server sector. Novell
claims to have 40m clients on its networks.
Network audit trail: a continuous record of a network's activity.
Network management: 'A term used to cover a multitude of sins,' says David
Palmer-Stevens, author of the Guide to Local Area Networking.* 'As yet,
there are few complete solutions available - a patchwork of network
management systems cover a variety of areas . . . basically, vendors'
systems fall into one of two camps, concerned with either physical
(hardware) elements or the logical side of the network - the control and
management of inter-process communication.'
OME: an open messaging environment.
Object-oriented technology: reusable software programming that simplifies
development of applications.
OS/2: cornerstone of IBM's client-server strategy for desktop computer
systems.
OSI model: a seven-layer model developed by the International Standards
Organisation, ISO, specifying how computers should communicate over a
network.
PowerPC: microprocessor architecture developed by Motorola, in conjunction
with IBM and Apple Computers.
PDNS: public data networks.
Packet: a group of bytes, sent over a link.
Packet switching: a method of switching data in a network where individual
packets of set size and format are accepted by the network and delivered to
their destinations. With various companies sharing a network, the packet
option can be a cost-saving method of communicating data.
TCP/IP: suite of protocols developed by the US Department of Defense, since
adopted as an international standard, particularly for networks of
interconnected Ethernet Lans.
SNA: Systems Network Architecture, introduced by IBM, the world's first
network architecture.
Token ring network: the standard of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers.
Unix: a multi-user operating system that supports networking and distributed
file systems.
Vans: value added network services - a network that provides specialised
facilities beyond the normal carrier service by adding computer-control and
communications.
Wan: a wide area network, covering a larger area than a local area network,
and including telecom links. Examples include packet switched networks, PDNs
and Vans.
X series: recommendations specified by CCITT governing the attachment of
terminals and computers to a data network.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (1): A challenge which cannot
be ignored - Computer networking opens up new opportunities for business,
ranging from simple electronic mail to a plethora of multimedia services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer networking, at one time a narrowly focused, technical subject for
electronics specialists, has become synonymous with a raft of profound
changes which are expected to reshape business in the late 1990s. Business
leaders ignore its implications at their peril.
Among the expected changes are the growth of electronic channels to the
customer: home shopping, for example, through video catalogues will
profoundly influence retailing. The potential of the automated teller
machine, widely deployed by banks and other financial institutions, has yet
to be fully explored and could provide an electronic market stall for a
broad range of goods and services.
The ability of computer networks to overcome barriers of time and space will
increasingly threaten the position of intermediates in a wide range of
industries, starting with financial services. The growth of desk-top
video-conferencing, now being pioneered by telecommunications companies
including AT&amp;T and British Telecom as well as computer manufacturers like
International Business Machines and Olivetti, seems certain to have an
impact on the travel business.
All of this implies drastically more flexible and higher capacity networks
than those available at present. The chief technical change is expected to
be be the emergence of an enterprise-wide, high speed network capable of
carrying all an organisation's electronic traffic. This implies a single
network capable of supporting data, voice, facsimile and video. Such a
network could carry services ranging from simple electronic mail to a
plethora of multimedia services. Multimedia services involve text, graphics,
video and sound converted into computer language and delivered through a
single interactive channel.
Networks of this kind should prove more cost effective and efficient than
the multiplicity of parallel networks which characterise voice and data
communications in large organisations today, but they will also make
possible new ways of doing business and facilitate new commercial
relationships.
Forrester Research, for example, a US-based consultancy, anticipates the
emergence of 'social computing': 'It will consist of a new generation of
telephones, televisions, and personal computers that access on-line services
through a variety of networks. We assert that large firms will use social
computing to build new connections to customers. Companies that do not
address the emergence of this powerful new communications channel will
suffer in the marketplace'.
The message seems to have struck home. Mr James Cosgrove, head of AT&amp;T's
data-communications services group, says customer demand for the new
services is almost outstripping the company's ability to provide them:
'Their argument is: 'If I do not keep up with this, I will be at a
competitive disadvantage,'' he says.
Mr Cosgrove identifies at least three trends driving change. First, the
convergence of computers and communications in the move from mainframe based
data processing to client-server, or networked, systems: 'Routers and local
area networks have changed the way people think about computing. Today,
people think about networking' he says.
The growth of local and wide area networks has led to the emergence of a
lively group of companies which provide the hardware and software which make
them work. Novell, for example, the market leader in networking software,
earlier this year formed a networking alliance with AT&amp;T. Hubs, the control
and management centres at the heart of local areas networks, and routers
which interconnect networks are provided by Cisco, 3Com, Chipcom, Cabletron
and Synoptics among others. The rates of growth of these companies
illustrates the health of the sector. Chipcom turned over Dollars 48m in
1991, Dollars 87m in 1992 and Dollars 150m last year.
Second, the emergence of highly mobile employees; they are more effective
because they are able to spend more time with their customers. Mobile
employees have to be supported with the elements of a 'virtual office' -
portable computing and telephony; cellular radio links for voice and data.
Third, a growth in intercompany as opposed to intra-company networking.
Companies generally established data networks on a proprietary basis to
disseminate information through their own organisations.
Today, the aim is to share information on a much broader basis. The
influence of Lotus Notes, software which enables groups of people to share
and work on the same information, Mr Cosgrove says, could be compared to a
new industrial revolution.
The keys to many of the new possibilities are information carried in digital
form so it can be stored and manipulated by computers, high bandwidth fibre
optic cabling providing adequate conduits for the volume of information
carried, a new generation of powerful microprocessors and, most important,
an enabling technology called asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) which looks
like revolutionising the way computer networks are built. It provides high
speed transmission and is suitable for many kinds of traffic including
voice, data, facsimile, real-time video, CD-quality audio and imaging.
In the US, carriers including AT&amp;T and US Sprint are already offering their
customers services based on ATM technology.
In Europe, a committee led by Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner,
warned that Europe could not afford to be left behind.
'One important development is the integrated services digital network, ISDN.
This offers the opportunity to send not only voice but also data and even
moving images through telephone lines,' a committee report said.
'ISDN is only the first step. New multimedia services, for instance, high
quality video communications, require even more performance. ISDN is showing
the way and the next technological wave aims for the multimedia world. This
is integrated broadband communications providing an opportunity to combine
all media in a flexible way. The lead technology to implement this is ATM.'
ATM is the latest step in a technological progression which began with
packet switching in the 1970s. As the technology has improved, speed and
capacity has risen inexorably.
Packet switching involves the movement of labelled packets of data each of
which takes the best route through a network. It works well, but it is slow.
Frame relay, the current favourite, is faster. ATM gets its speed from
technological improvements which mean that each packet needs only minimal
addressing and minimal error correction.
Most managers are aware, however, that information technology properly
implemented has the potential to boost business efficiency while poorly
designed and poorly implemented, it is more likely to damage a company's
performance, absorbing money, creating inflexibility and taking up senior
management time.
This double-edged property of IT is amply demonstrated in the current growth
of computer networking. On the one hand, through networking, managers have
the opportunity to change the shape of their organisations for the better by
the timely dissemination of information through and between companies.
On the other, it not easy to accomplish. Senior managers may see parallels
between the stage networking has reached today and the early days of data
processing.
The complexity and novelty of the changes involved requires technical skills
which are in short supply. Substantial cultural barriers may have to be
negotiated - and most companies today are not prepared for the structural
changes which follow on from advanced computer communications. Some
organisations have already decided they are not in the business of network
management and have outsourced their network services to companies like
AT&amp;T, BT, Cable &amp; Wireless and GEIS.
If the 1970s and 1980s was the heyday of the data processing manager, it
seems clear that over the next few years the network manager will take a
leading role in setting a company's IT strategy.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Rail strike still on as talks fail to reach deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow's 24-hour strike by railway signalling staff is still on after
talks at Acas were adjourned early this morning without a settlement.
Railtrack, the rail network operator, and RMT union officials failed to
reach an agreement after 10 1/2 hours of intensive negotiations at the
conciliation service, but they agreed to resume at 10am today.
Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's industrial relations director, said after
the talks that the union had declined to lift the strike threat for
tomorrow. 'We have not made as much progress as I would have expected. I am
disappointed about that,' he added.
Mr Vernon Hince, RMT's assistant general secretary, said: 'A strike is still
firmly on, but we are still talking. At the present time there is still a
long way to go. It is a very complicated situation.'
Neither side would reveal what they had achieved so far in their marathon
negotiations.
Railtrack still insists it cannot pay increases for past productivity while
the union says there must be an 11 per cent interim pay award for past
performance. Railtrack has already offered 2.5 per cent for all its
employees.

FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was down 6 at 168p after volume of 4.7m
as several brokers advised investors to sell the stock. The list of sellers
was said to have included SG Warburg and Strauss Turnbull, both believed to
have advised investors to switch into British Aerospace.
Rolls-Royce had, until recently, been one of the best performing stocks in
the market this year. However, a feeling that the shares had run too far
ahead emerged in recent sessions.
A lacklustre presentation to analysts last week brought a further retreat,
with researchers concerned about the rating of the stock and poor order
flows, particularly for spares. BAe put on 5 at 450p amid trade of 1m
shares.
Tobacco to insurance conglomerate BAT Industries rose 17 to 389p on
speculation that the company might pull out of a Dollars 1bn deal to buy the
cigarette arm of American Brands. The company denied the speculation and a
number of experienced market professionals were sceptical. But hopes that
the company might have an escape route away from an environment of
increasingly tight legislation against the tobacco industry gave comfort to
the market.
Chemicals group ICI moved forward 14 1/2 to 765p as the company arranged
trading update meetings with analysts following its successful presentation
last week.
Composite insurers recovered sharply with the help of a certain amount of
institutional buying. The stocks also responded to a bounce in gilts; most
of them hold more than 50 per cent of their investments in the government
bond markets. General Accident advanced 16 to 552p and Royal Insurance 10
1/2 to 252p.
Cadbury Schweppes, which has underperformed the market by about 11 per cent
in the last month, was held back to a rise of only 2 1/2 to 415p as NatWest
Securities reiterated its caution on the stock. The house said: 'Whilst
Cadbury is keen to reassure the market that profit expectations are still
justified, there do seem to be a number of chinks in the armour which
justify further caution on the stock.'
A UK analysts' visit to some of Grand Metropolitan's US food operations
helped the stock harden 4 to 380p as 4.5m shares were dealt.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which reports figures on Monday, was in demand. The
shares appreciated 15 to 517p. NatWest Sec-urities is predicting profits of
Pounds 232m.
House builder Higgs &amp; Hill fell 4 to 100p after announcing that its Pounds
22.2m rights issue was only a third taken up by shareholders. It said in May
that it planned to raise the money to buy house-building land on 13 sites.
H&amp;H shares have dropped nearly 25 per cent since the rights announcement,
partly reflecting the recent weakness in the sector. In April, housebuilder
Redrow Group (off 5 at 108p) scaled back flotation plans in the light of the
slack demand.
High street retailer Dixons gave up 7 1/2 to 179p, with Goldman Sachs said
to be negative on the stock. The group reports figures a week tomorrow.
Nervous trading in Vendome ahead of figures due on Friday left the shares 5
off at 449p.
Associated British Foods slipped 4 to 501p after investment bank BZW pointed
out that the recent decline in UK gilts may soon force brokers to revise
profit expectations if there is no recovery. The group has substantial
investments in gilts.
Tate &amp; Lyle improved 2 to 404p after reassuring the market that its recent
purchase of a 61.3 per cent holding in Orsan which received approval from
the French, Belgian and German authorities will not dilute earnings per
share.
Bargain hunters helped engineering group Siebe rally 12 to 528p after its
recent dollar induced weakness. Vickers advanced 4 to 175p ahead of an
analysts' visit to its Challenger 2 tank factory in Leeds.
Motor dealer Lex Service relinquished 8 to 418p, with James Capel said to be
negative on the stock.
Profit-taking after the recent strong run in Airtours, together with worries
of overcapacity in the package holiday market, left the group's shares
trailing 15 to 473p. Airtours reported a loss of Pounds 17.6m, in line with
market expectations, but analysts upgraded profit forecasts for the full
year.
Advertising group WPP fell 3 to 99p on Sunday newspaper reports that it had
shelved a planned Dollars 400m flotation.
An oil find in China by the Exploration Company of Louisiana saw the
company's shares rise 16 to 105p.

FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Newspapers up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Telegraph rebounded as it fought to minimise the effect of the recent
price cut which last week poured fuel on the smouldering newspaper price
war.
Chairman Mr Conrad Black was reported to be considering taking the newspaper
back into private hands if the shares fell further. More controversially, he
claimed that the drop in profits from the price reduction would be limited
to no more than Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m a year.
Elsewhere, there was widespread relief that middle market newspapers Daily
Mail and Daily Express had resisted the pressure to cut their cover prices
and had taken the less expensive promotional path. Daily Mail Trust 'A'
shares bounced 23 to 893p and Express parent United Newspapers recovered 13
to 498p.

FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Changes at top hit Reed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shock announcement that Mr Peter Davis, the chairman of Reed
International, had resigned following what is widely seen as a power
struggle within the group saw the shares slide 41p in early trading.
The official company statement pointed to a clash of management styles and
follows a shift nine months ago when Mr Davis was appointed co-chairman,
with the executive role taken by the management committee.
City analysts saw the stock's performance as a tribute to Mr Davis's
management skills. One commented: 'If a company's share price is doing badly
it is easy to blame the management, and when it is doing well it has to be
worrying that the principal player leaves.'
Over the past 12 months the company has outperformed the FT-A All-Share
Index by about 12.5 percentage points. In late trading, Reed rallied with
the market but still ended a net 9 off at 741p, with turnover unusually high
at 3.3m. Elsevier shares were also marked down sharply in Amsterdam.

FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong rally in international bond markets reversed an initial poor
performance by index futures yesterday, writes Steve Thompson.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 index began the session under
intense pressure around the 2,859 level, with marketmakers already
positioned to see the cash market fall to 2,800 and reacting to an early
sell-off in the gilt-
But with no fresh crisis developing in currencies, where the dollar bounced
from its lowest level against the Japanese currency since the Second World
War, a firmer trend in bonds produced a similar performance in the futures.
After reaching a session low-point of 2,852, September rallied to the day's
high point of 2,917, before ending the session at 2,912.
Turnover in the FT-SE future was an unremarkable 16,681 contracts.
In a fairly pedestrian traded options sector one of the London market's
biggest agency brokers bought 3,500 September 2,825 calls in the FT-SE 100
option. Elsewhere, activity was relatively light with Land Securities the
most active stock option with 1,354 contracts traded, followed by SmithKline
Beecham 'A', with 1,174 lots dealt and Ladbroke where turnover reached 1,000
contracts.
Total volume at the close was 31,818 lots.

FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market prices rally behind
firmer gilts - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries that continued turbulence in international currency markets would
trigger another wholesale retreat by the London stock market were proved
wrong yesterday. The market shrugged off an initial bout of selling and
moved ahead strongly in the wake of a firm gilt-edged market and a good
opening performance by Wall Street.
The FT-SE 100 Index finished another tense trading session a net 23.3 higher
at 2,899.9, having penetrated the 2,900 level in mid-afternoon. At the
outset the index looked set to threaten the 2,800 mark as investors fretted
about the current crisis in foreign exchanges where the US dollar has come
under heavy selling pressure.
The market rally was generally confined to the front-line stocks; second
tier issues came under continued pressure, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index
ending 10.8 lower at 3,363.4. Share prices began the day under pressure,
with marketmakers reacting to the big sell-off of stocks and bonds on Wall
Street late on Friday by chopping their opening prices for the leading FT-SE
100 and Mid 250 stocks. Sentiment was also hit by the sharp slide in
Japanese equity prices on Monday after the shock resignation of the Japanese
prime minister.
Taking its cue from the gilts market, where long-dated stocks were down more
than a half-point in very early trading, the FT-SE 100 index registered a
fall of almost 32 points at 2,844.7 within 30 minutes of the opening of
business, as the dollar moved to its lowest level against the Japanese
currency since the Second World War. The rally in gilts was attributed to a
more confident feeling in currencies, as well as buying ahead of tomorrow's
auction of Pounds 2bn of floating rate gilts.
With no signs of any institutional selling pressure evident in the stock
market, and with gilts beginning to rally in the wake of a shift in
sentiment in the foreign exchange markets, share prices gradually clawed
their way back as the session wore on.
The FT-SE 100 reached positive ground just after midday and thereafter moved
ahead fairly comfortably, reaching the day's high point of 2,902.2, up 25.6,
before slipping off its best level just before the close.
While acknowledging the UK stock market's better tone yesterday, senior
marketmakers remained extremely nervous about the market's potential for
further big losses. 'There were big movements in share prices both ways and
the market is looking increasingly disjointed. This market could still fall
to 2,800 in the very short term,' said a marketmaker at one of the top UK
integrated securities houses.
He added that European bourses and Far Eastern markets had performed badly
and that the lack of consistency in international markets remained one of
the biggest worries to traders.
Activity in UK equities remained very poor, with turnover amounting to only
463.2m shares, raising the possibility that the big investment institutions
may not return to active trading in the market until the third quarter of
the year. Non-Footsie volume accounted for more than 58 per cent of the
total.
The value of customer business in the market last Friday dipped below the
Pounds 1bn mark for the third time in a week, totalling only Pounds 920.9m.
Newspaper shares were again the centre of attention as the market responded
to comments from Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of The Telegraph, that the cost
of the price-cutting war could be less than had been feared.

Equities moved ahead strongly after Friday's losses on news that Mr Jorge
Carpizo, the interior minister, had agreed to withdraw his resignation.
Sentiment was also boosted by the rebound on Wall Street.

Toronto closed mixed after light trading. The TSE 300 index gained 43.7, or
1.1 per cent, at 4,003.6, following a 1.85 per cent fall on Friday.
Share prices traded in negative territory until the early afternoon, when
they rebounded. Declining issues, however, still led rises at the close by
494 to 262. Volume came to 46.5m shares.
All but two of the 14 stock groups ended higher, but golds lost 1.47 per
cent.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rebounds as dollar
improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks surged yesterday afternoon as the dollar firmed without further
intervention by the world's central banks, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 48.56 higher at 3,685.50,
rebounding strongly from a 26-point decline at the opening. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 4.51 at 447.31, even though there was an
even split between New York SE rises and declines. Volume was a moderate
250m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite lagged behind with a
0.85 decline to 425.45, but the Nasdaq composite enjoyed a handsome gain of
8.89 at 702.68.
From the first hour of trade, investors defied expectations of a powerful
after-shock on the heels of Friday's 62-point Dow sell-off. At first, the
news from the foreign exchange markets was barely supportive, with the US
currency slipping below the Y100 mark in overnight trading and flirting with
that level throughout the morning.
But the relative stability of the dollar, without any further intervention,
seemed to be enough to shore up the bond market. Treasuries started out with
moderate losses, but staged an impressive rally of their own during the
afternoon.
The blue chips fared even better, gaining a foothold on positive ground by
mid-morning and never turning back. Two stocks, Caterpillar and Walt Disney,
led the advance.
Shares in the world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment improved
Dollars 4 to Dollars 105 1/8 , even though a strike by 14,000 production
workers dragged into its second week. Bargain hunters appeared to be taking
advantage of a stock well off its 52-week high of Dollars 121 3/8 .
Walt Disney, meanwhile, climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43. The company's
new film, The Lion King, became the third biggest Hollywood release of all
time, selling Dollars 41m worth of tickets in its first weekend.
The Big Three US car makers were back in favour, with Ford Motor advancing
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 , General Motors up Dollars 2 at Dollars 52
3/8 and Chrysler adding Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 47 3/4 .
Banking issues improved, including JP Morgan, Dollars 1 1/2 ahead at Dollars
63 3/8 . Technology stocks were generally higher as well, led by IBM. Big
Blue rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 in spite of reports that
production delays were forcing Big Blue to scale back the launch of its
much-vaunted PowerPC line of personal computers.
A rebound by computer-related stocks helped the Nasdaq climb off its weakest
close in a year on Friday. Wellfleet jumped Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 25 1/2
, Microsoft climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 and Oracle added Dollars
1 1/8 at Dollars 37 3/4 .

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Weak dollar gives global equity markets
a bad time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in the dollar last week gave most global equity markets a bad time,
and Tokyo equities had one of their worst days this year yesterday after the
resignation of yet another Japanese prime minister.
However, the dollar crisis also pointed up the singular strength of Japanese
equities this year, up 15.2 per cent by last Friday in local currency terms,
and by 27.4 per cent in terms of the wilting dollar. For US equities,
unfortunately, the pattern was reversed: a fall of 4.9 per cent on a local
currency measure, compared with one of 2.1 per cent for the FT-Actuaries
World Index, stretching to 14 per cent in terms of the Japanese yen.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg falls 2.5 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South African equities ended 2.5 per cent lower as world market weakness
kept buyers away. Gold's inability to hold or make ground in spite of the
dollar's weakness also put pressure on related stocks.
The overall index finished 139 weaker at 5,453 after the 96-point retreat on
Friday. Industrials shed 190 to 6,287 and golds dipped 91 to 2,090.
De Beers lost 75 cents at R109.25 after bouncing off a day's low of R106.
Anglos declined R6 to R230 and JCI R5 to R100.
Gencor closed unchanged at R11, after an early R10.50, and SAB fell R2 to
R86. Banks had Stanbic and Firstbank each down R3 at R113 and R98
respectively. Among golds, Kloof receded R3.75 to R52.50, Vaal Reefs R13 to
R412 and Loraine R1 to R16.75.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei's 2.2 per cent
decline provides lead for region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Share prices dropped as the yen set a new high against the dollar, sending
the Nikkei 225 average down 2.2 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index declined 465.79 to 20,300.96 in low volumes as most investors
remained absent due to the turmoil on the currency markets. The Topix index
fell 23.29, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,649.78.
Traders said the political situation had little impact on investor
confidence. One commented that the resignation of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime
minister, at the weekend actually had a favourable effect since it meant
that a general election would be avoided.
The Nikkei 225 opened at the session's high of 20,649.53, but soon fell on
arbitrage selling to hit the day's low of 20,168.53 in the afternoon, before
recouping some of the loss on buying by financial institutions.
Volume was 363m shares, against 355m. The Nikkei 300 weakened 3.76, or 1.2
per cent, to 300.23 and first section declines overwhelmed rises by 1,006 to
89, with 95 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.71
to 1,342.75.
High-technology shares suffered a sell-off due to the high yen: Toshiba fell
Y27 to Y798 and Fujitsu lost Y30 at Y1,080. Consumer electronics makers were
also lower, with Sony down Y140 to Y5,980 and Matsushita Electric Industrial
off Y30 at Y1,780.
Steels were sold, with Sumitomo Metal, the day's most active issue, falling
Y8 to Y292. Automobiles were also lower, with Honda Motor down Y30 to Y1,840
and Nissan Motor falling Y24 to Y850.
Sharp, however, reversed its morning decline to close Y10 up at Y1,800,
while buying orders from public funds lifted Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Y3,000 to Y837,000.
Electric power companies, which are large importers of fuel, were the least
affected by the bout of selling, and Tokyo Electric Power advanced Y30 to
Y3,130.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 467.82 down at 22,774.56 in volume of 12.9m
shares.
Roundup
The region's markets took their lead from activity in currencies.
HONG KONG was led partly by a volatile futures market, which took a late
slide. The Hang Seng index closed 233.52 lower at 8,647.48.
Properties were hardest hit, with investors worried that developers'
earnings might be affected by recent government measures to cool prices. Sun
Hung Kai fell HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 45.50, New World Development by 80
cents to HKDollars 21.50 and Henderson Land by HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars
35.50.
There was said to be little impact on equities from the latest delay in
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's future.
SYDNEY saw its biggest one- day decline since August 1991, which left the
All Ordinaries index down 60.5 at 1,957.4. Turnover came to ADollars 502.1m.
The takeover target Bridge Oil was the most heavily traded stock, with
56.49m shares exchanged after Parker and Parsley lifted its bid to 90 cents
a share from 80 cents. Bridge moved ahead 4 cents to 90 cents.
The insurance sector registered the biggest fall in percentage terms, losing
4.6 per cent on the day, as GIO fell 11 cents to ADollars 2.29.
SINGAPORE was sharply lower, with losers swamping gainers by 319 to 13 in a
nervous market.
The Straits Times Industrial index fell 37.11 to 2,208.71.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded from a day's low of 996.90 to close 11.51 off on
balance at 1,003.52. However, expectation of forced selling if the market
weakens further took its toll of second-line stocks; Idris fell 16 cents to
MDollars 4.68 in volume of 9.8m shares.
SEOUL, one exception to the downtrend, saw a technical rally after a
five-day decline, with healthy institutional support noted for banking
shares - viewed as undervalued, given improving business performance.
The composite index added 11.08 at 931.04. Both Cho Hung Bank and Korea
First Bank went limit up, each gaining Won600 to Won10,800 and Won12,500
respectively.
Trading and construction companies also gained momentum in anticipation of
preparatory talks at the border vil-lage of Panmunjom today for a first-ever
summit between presidents of the two Koreas.
BOMBAY finished lower but after staging a mild recovery from the day's worst
level. The market was not expected to encounter fresh impetus until
Thursday, when the two-week account in specified shares ends. The BSE
30-share index lost 38.61 at 4,174.40.
MANILA declined steadily throughout the day and the composite index ended
off 39.69 at 2,749.45. Declines exceeded advances by 61 to 7, with 31 issues
unchanged.
Turnover shrank to 565m pesos from Friday's 1.34bn pesos.
Manila Electric 'B' shares dipped 5 per cent, or 17.50 pesos, to 327.50
pesos and Philippine Long Distance Telephone lost 1.5 per cent, or 25 pesos,
to 1,655 pesos.
BANGKOK fell steeply, although it ended off the session's low point. The SET
index dipped 37.73 to 1,254.81, having seen a downside of 1,248.56. Turnover
was Bt5.9bn. One broker said there was support for the index at 1,250.
Finance and bank stocks were the hardest hit - Bangkok Bank retreated Bt5 to
Bt176 and Thai Farmers Bank Bt4 to Bt115.
WELLINGTON ended at its lowest level this year in below average turnover,
with most of the selling coming from retail customers. The NZSE-40 capital
index shed 77.47 to 1,961.30 in turnover of NZDollars 29.13m.
COLOMBO was supported by strong interest from domestic investors and renewed
foreign demand, which lifted the all-share index 40.84 to 993.28. Turnover,
however, contracted to SLRs149.9m from Friday's SLRs221m.

FT  28 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses show resilience after
morning setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Friday afternoon's slide in New York, more pressure on the dollar and
the fall of another Japanese government, bourses were ready for another
setback yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff; but some of them were surprised
by their own resilience.
FRANKFURT, initially, fell with the rest and the Dax index closed 16.71
lower at 1,988.60 after a session's low of 1,968.61. However, the September
bund future recovered from a low of 91.23 to a high of 92.42, and seemed to
be holding the 92 level at the end of the equity post-bourse, when the Ibis
indicated Dax showed a further recovery at 2,000.48.
Behind this, and reflecting the swing in the market's mood, was the
performance of Deutsche Bank. During the session Bayernverein and Dresdner
offered some relief from this year's consistent weakness in the sector,
rising DM7.50 to DM433, and DM6.50 to DM364.50 respectively.
But Deutsche was measuring Friday's downgrade by Merrill Lynch in New York
against a reaffirmed buy recommendation yesterday from Morgan Stanley in
London, the latter backed up by B Metzler in Frankfurt. German's biggest
bank hit a new 1994 low of DM659 before closing the session down DM3.80 at
DM666, and recovering to DM673.40 at the end of the day.
Turnover eased from DM7bn to DM6.9bn. Outside the banking sector, there was
a buyer for Volkswagen which saw the shares up DM2.80 to DM467.80 on the
session, and after a rise in five-month car deliveries. VW rose another
DM5.20 to DM473 after hours.
PARIS remained volatile, the CAC-40 index moving in a range between 1,870
and 1,920 before closing the day slightly higher, up 4.58 at 1,911.60.
Turnover was firm at FFr3.7bn. The turnround in performance was directly
related to the stronger than expected opening on Wall Street as well as
firmness in the bond market.
Beyond the current turmoil in the financial markets, there was good news on
the horizon as an association of French analysts said that they had produced
a further upward revision of their outlook for company results this year.
Rhone-Poulenc saw heavy trading and the shares dropped to a session low of
FFr113.80, before closing off FFr3.80 or 3.2 per cent at FFr114.70 in
further reaction to disappointing earnings news last week from its US
subsidiary, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. The US company, subsequently, was the
object of a number of brokers' downgrades.
Suez dipped FFr1.40 to FFr266.50 as the group noted that it might increase
its stake in Lyonnaise-Dumez, up FFr15 to FFr515, to 20 per cent.
AMSTERDAM was lifted off its session lows by the improvement late in the
session on Wall Street, the AEX index closing off 4.3 or 1.1 per cent at
377.10, having tested the 374 level earlier in the day.
Aside from outside influences the market was also affected by the failure of
talks aimed at securing a workable coalition government following the
inconclusive general election result on May 3.
Reed Elsevier suffered at the opening from the unexpected resignation of the
co-chairman of the UK/Dutch group, the shares easing to Fl 145 before
picking up later to close down Fl 1.80 at Fl 150.20.
MILAN was again lower in thin volume as foreign investors continued
selectively to take profits and domestic funds remained inactive. The Comit
index fell 4.91 to 694.01, with some analysts predicting that the market
would fall to the 650-660 level before it rebounded.
Industrial blue chips were mostly lower, in line with the market, but Fiat
was L60 or 0.9 per cent down at L6,345.
The insurance sector was harder hit, led by a L1,215 or 2.9 per cent fall to
L40,866 by Generali. One dealer noted that the slide came in the wake of
weekend details that premium income rose more slowly than expected in the
first five months of the year.
He added that the sector was also being hurt by worries that the companies'
portfolios would be badly hit by losses in the bond markets. RAS fell L790
to L25,500 and SAI was L482 down at L20,648.
Fondiaria dropped L545 or 4.1 per cent to L12,805 as it warned that it might
have to launch a capital increase if it was to buy back the 20 per cent
stake held by Groupama, and which the French group has said it planned to
sell.
ZURICH picked up from its lows as Wall Street opened firmer after a day in
which futures related trading made for volatile conditions. The SMI index
finished 15.8 easier at 2,561.4, after a day's low of 2,525.5, in thin
turnover.
UBS bearers picked up SFr12 to SFr1,145 amid futures related buying, but
renewed demand emerged for some insurers. Zurich rose SFr10 to SFr1,300 and
Winterthur gained SFr16 to SFr705.
Chemicals were out of favour with Ciba losing SFr35 or 4.3 per cent to
SFr770 and Roche certificates down SFr65 to SFr6,245.
MADRID's general index eased 0.97 to 298.17 after a day's, and year's low of
295.50. Turnover was thin at Pta22.29bn.
In one of the worst performances of the day, Union y Fenix fell Pta120, or 7
per cent to Pta1,520 on shareholder approval of the reverse takeover of the
insurer by the French company, AGF. Among the better performers, Amper rose
Pta12 to Pta770 after Pta798 following Friday's sale of a lossmaking
electronics subsidiary.
WARSAW rebounded from the year's lows in thin volume as investors,
encouraged by revived demand during the previous session, held back from
making further sales. The Wig index rose 463.1 or 6.4 per cent to 7,678.3.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Central banks hold fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange markets were caught in a stalemate yesterday as
participants waited for a repeat of Friday's central bank support of the
dollar, which failed to materialise, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar remained very weak and closed in London at Y99.865 against the
yen, from Y100.9 on Friday. Earlier the US currency had touched a post-war
low of Y99.50 during Japanese trading.
Against the D-Mark the dollar finished at DM1.5758, more than two pfennigs
down from Friday's close of DM1.5972. In New York the dollar improved to end
at Y100.45 and DM1.5830.
In spite of the dollar's weakness, it avoided going into freefall as some
had feared and this lent support to bond and equity markets.
Many observers had expected central banks to continue Friday's intervention,
but others said that the failure of their earlier efforts had forced them to
pause and reassess their objectives.
In Europe, meanwhile, the D-Mark fell victim to profit-taking as investors
cashed in on the currency's recent bout of strength on the back of the weak
dollar.
The Belgian franc, Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo all finished firmer
against the D-Mark, but it was stronger against the French franc and the
Italian lira.
Traders reported that the only central bank intervention in support of the
dollar came from the Bank of Japan during Japanese trading. Market estimates
were that the BOJ bought Dollars 750m to Dollars 1bn supporting the
currency, but to little avail.
The dollar's woes were aggravated over the weekend by the resignation of Mr
Tsutomu Hata's eight-week-old minority coalition. The departure of the prime
minister raised doubts about whether the US and Japan would be able to reach
an accord over trade issues at next week's G7 summit in Naples.
Mr Steve Hannah, director of research at IBJ International in London, said
intervention was probably a 'waste of time' given the skittish state of
market sentiment, where signals were likely to be misinterpreted. 'The
market is going through quite a frantic period and reassessing its views
about the dollar,' said Mr Hannah.
He said failed intervention, such as on Friday, was worse than inactivity
because sentiment was adversely affected by a failed attempt to arrest the
dollar's decline.
The IBJ analyst said the central banks would probably let the market turmoil
run its course for a while before acting again. He predicted that they might
wait until late-July or August before acting.
But Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan in Europe,
said central banks might act this week 'to restore their battered
credibility after Friday's debacle'. He predicted that they would fail
unless such a move came in tandem with a strong signal on interest rates.
The danger, added Mr Persaud, was that central banks would see intervention
as a substitute, rather than a complement, for higher rates.
Most observers agree that central bank concern is rooted not in dollar
weakness in itself, but in the ramifications that this might have for
financial markets and the world economy in general.
Mr Hannah disputes the view held by some in the market that US and German
authorities are unconcerned about dollar weakness. He said there was a
danger of a 'free- fall' scenario whereby a sharp fall in the dollar
translated into increased US inflation, higher US interest rates and a
general brake on world economic recovery.
In this case, Germany, in particular, would have a lot to lose since its
recovery is still in an early stage. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor,
will also be mindful of the possible political damage he could suffer in
October's national elections, should the economic recovery falter.
Prices in the interest rate futures market were volatile, while volume was
fairly subdued. Sentiment in short sterling was buoyed by the positive
showing in gilts, and the back-month contracts were particularly well bid.
The December future saw nearly 18,000 lots traded and ended at 93.73, two
basis points up from Friday's close, but 10 basis points above the low for
the day of 93.63. The December 1995 contract closed at 91.52, leaving it 18
basis points above where it started the day.
The December Euromark contract traded nearly 18,000 lots and finished four
basis points firmer at 94.89.
In the German money markets, call money traded slightly higher at 4.90/5 per
cent, from 4.85/4.95 on Friday, as banks sought funds ahead of end-of-month
reserve requirements and pension payments.
In the UK money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 671m of
assistance, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 650m. Overnight money
traded between 4 and 5 per cent.
Sterling ended at DM2.4498, more than 1 1/2 pfennigs weaker. Against the
dollar it finished higher at Dollars 1.5547 from Dollars 1.5422. The market
ignored newspaper reports that the UK chancellor will today raise his growth
forecast for the economy.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: British growers size up the
competition - The post-Gatt debate at Cereals '94, the premier UK grain
event
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question in most producers' minds as they heard a debate between rival
suppliers at Cereals '94, the premier UK grain event this month, was summed
up by Mr Alan States, a US farmer. 'What you all want to know,' he said, 'is
whether we're going to out-compete you - but we're all in this together and
the most efficient of us will survive.'
Mr States, who farms 4,000 acres (1,600) hectares on his own in Kansas, is
one of the large US producers who will be competing head-to-head with his
European counterparts on world markets as support prices are stripped away
under the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade settlement.
He now makes the equivalent of Pounds 22 an acre profit to cover his fixed
costs after getting a market price of Pounds 75 a tonne for his wheat plus
government support of Pounds 18 a tonne.
His income per tonne puts Mr States near the top of the earnings scale for
the international farmers polled at the seminar. Mr Oliver Walston, the
British producer whose farm was the venue for the cereals show, reckoned
that British farmers were getting Pounds 95 a tonne for their wheat with an
added subsidy of Pounds 30 a tonne.
That put British producers on a par with Mr Jeremy Talbot, who farms 451
hectares in New Zealand, producing 1,000 tonnes of wheat. He is being paid
Pounds 120 a tonne by millers in his own country, where he receives no
subsidies at all.
Mr Talbot said he was trying to adapt to the new unsupported market by
growing specialist crops for Asia, such as Chinese mustard and Chinese
cabbage.
But both Mr Talbot and Mr Peter Barclay, a wheat farmer from Nakuru in
Kenya, had to fight hard against the dumping of subsidised grain from the
European Union and US. 'Wheat is pouring into Mombasa at Dollars 90 and
Dollars 100 a tonne - we can't compete with those prices,' said Mr Barclay.
Mr States called for government aid to farmers to be completely uncoupled
from production - a direction in which both the US and EU are moving - as a
way of getting rid of surplus output. 'We don't care if the French want to
increase their subsidies to farmers as long as they don't have to plant a
crop to get it,' he said.
Mr Esteran Artica, an Argentine wheat farmer, plans, however, to increase
his output in coming years to take advantage of the new, more stable climate
in the country now that inflation is under control. Mr Artica receives the
equivalent of Pounds 80 a tonne for his grain without government support. He
said he wanted to push Argentina as an organic farming area as many farmers
could not afford artificial fertilisers.
One of Mr Artica's main expenses is the cost of sending his wheat to the
nearest port as there are no trains near his 4,300 hectare holding.
Similarly, Mr Roy Levee, a Canadian prairie farmer with 4,000 acres, 35
miles (56km) north of the US border, finds transportation costs eating into
his income.
Mr Levee's farm is 1,000 miles from the nearest port at either Vancouver or
Thunderbay on the Great Lakes and transport for wheat costs are Dollars 26 a
tonne. The government funds Dollars 15 of the cost but pays this directly to
the railroad, which Mr Levee believes subsidises inefficiencies of the rail
operator.
The transport subsidy is the only government support received by Canadian
farmers like Mr Levee, who is getting a payment of around Pounds 60 a tonne
from his local grain elevator. This comes in the form of Pounds 45 a tonne
outright with the rest to follow at the end of the season.
Mr Levee's short growing season, with only 120 frost-free days a year and
extreme heat in summer, means he has a yield of three-quarters of a tonne
per acre compared with Mr States' 1.1 tonnes per acre in Kansas and closer
to 3 tonnes in the UK.
Mr Oliver Walston said he had simplified his production methods as much as
he could to compete with low-cost producers overseas. He sold off a third of
his 3,000-acre farm 5 years ago so that he could pay off debts. 'It's very
difficult to do that because every farmer wants to farm more acres,' he
said. 'But I've seen so many producers all over the world in terrible
trouble because they're too highly geared.'
Mr Walston's fixed costs are now Pounds 120 per acre - Pounds 60 lower than
5 years ago - and he makes a profit of Pounds 150,000 a year.
'Everything will get much more competitive: you either compete by becoming
large and extensive or intensify production in some sectors. There will be
no place for a small farmer growing wheat.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee frost brings back
chilling memories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's meteoric rise in international coffee futures triggered
comparisons with previous Brazilian frost dramas - and aspirations towards
previous market records.
Ms Judith Ganes, softs analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, had her eye on
the all-time highs of the late 1970s. 'It's too early to pinpoint, but
people should be aware that this market has the potential to get there,' she
said.
'In the past we had a freeze and the trees were healthy. When you take a
crop that hasn't been fertilised for four years and was unhealthy to begin
with because of a lack of care, the damage could be untold.'
The excitement was heightened by the fact that the crop damage has hit
early, with a further six weeks to go when frost can occur in Brazil.
Ms Ganes was highlighting the lack of investment in world coffee production
that has resulted from the five years of low prices that followed the
collapse of market intervention measures in 1989.
The inability of coffee producers to respond rapidly to the current
shortfall in world supply has fuelled the market's bull run this year. But
prices still have a long way to go. Second position robusta coffee futures
in London peaked at over Pounds 4,000 - or more than Dollars 7,000 a tonne
at the prevailing exchange rate - in March 1977. Yesterday's surge took the
second position to a day's peak of Dollars 3,150 a tonne, the highest level
since November 1986 when it hit Dollars 3,700.
That gap is also reflected in retail coffee prices. A 100g jar of Nescafe in
the UK, for example, is still about 3p cheaper than in March 1986, even
after a 12 1/2 per cent rise in January, according to its manufacturer,
Nestle.
Whether prices continue upwards will depend partly on the extent of the
frost damage at the weekend, which could only be guessed at yesterday. It
was described by one Brazilian broker as the worst since the 'very grave'
frost of July 1975, which triggered the rise in prices to all-time highs.
Next year's coffee harvest is expected to be substantially reduced but no
clear figures are available yet, according to growers and brokers.
Predictions yesterday ranged from a loss of fewer than 1m bags to as much as
5m bags. Production this year in Brazil, which accounts for around a quarter
of world output, is expected to be about 24m bags.
Coffee broker Mr Eduardo Carvalhaes Jnr said most of Brazil's important
production areas in the states of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Parana were
hit.
He said the 1995-96 and 1996-97 harvests would be smaller and the quality of
the 1994-95 coffee crop could be affected. 'It seems that some areas in
Parana were 100 per cent hit while parts of Sao Paulo lost 20-25 per cent.'
Carlos Duarte de Conceicao cedilla accent on last c, tilde accent on a ,
president of the Coplan coffee growers co-operative in Campinas, Sao Paulo,
said it was too early to tell how much production would be lost but he
estimated losses could reach 4m bags.
Some of the sting has been taken out of Brazilian frost scares by the fact
production has moved northwards since 1975. Whereas Parana was once the main
producer, it now accounts for 2m to 3m bags of annual output. Most
production takes place in Minas Gerais state, southern parts of which have
apparently been badly hit by the latest frost.
Moreover, although Brazil is the world's biggest producer, its dominance is
much less than a decade ago.
None the less, the frost damage comes at a sensitive time for the world
market. The International Coffee Organisation predicts a shortfall in world
supplies of about 2m bags this year, compared with demand, and now says that
'further drops (in supplies) are likely next year'.
Supply tightness has led to a run-down in consumer stocks. The ICO estimates
these have fallen by about 2m bags this year to some 15m bags.
How far the frost drives prices will also depend on how producer countries'
stocks are released on to the world market, said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst
at GNI, the London commodity brokers. The Brazilian government is sitting on
a stockpile of 17m bags and further coffee is due to be released by other
members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper price seen holding gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper's price will on average be at least Dollars 1 a pound (Dollars 2,204
a tonne) for the next ten years, suggests Mr Burgess Winter, president of
Magma Copper, third-largest of the US producers.
He dismisses suggestions that a huge upsurge in output from new mines from
1995 onwards and the new low-cost solvent-extraction, electro-winning
production process will drive down prices.
Not all the scheduled capacity will arrive on time, he says, and inevitably
there will be interruptions to existing supply.
Magma expects copper demand to rise by an annual average of 2.3 per cent -
and that would require a new mine the size of Escondida in Chile (400,000
tonnes last year) and a new smelter every second year, Mr Winter points out.
Nevertheless, Magma has taken the precaution of initiating a price
protection programme that guarantees a minimum realised price of 84 cents a
pound compared with Dollars 1.10 on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. The
programme consists mostly of 'put' options which allows the company to
benefit from any rise above 84 cents.
Mr Winter says Magma wants to guarantee a floor price for 1995 output - no
matter what happens to short-term copper prices - at a modest cost of one
cent a lb because the company cab be sure of covering the cost of its
Dollars 300m Robinson mine in Nevada, due in production early next year,
without touching its Dollars 200m line of revolving bank credit.
In spite of Mr Winter's bullish price outlook, Magma has been driving down
production costs so that by 1996 it expects to achieve cash costs of 50
cents a lb and full pre-tax costs of 70 cents. In the first quarter of 1994
Magma's cash costs were 59 cents.
Mr Winter's views on future copper prices are not universally supported.
For example, Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, argues that the copper
industry is about to be transformed by solvent-extraction, electro-winning
technology, which does away with the need for a smelter when an ore body
lends itself to this treatment. He suggests that ultimately, the price of
copper will fall towards the marginal cost of current production: Dollars
1,350 a tonne (61 cents a pound) as high-cost concentrate/smelter output is
displaced.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold drops despite dollar's
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold prices dropped sharply in London and New York yesterday. The precious
metal closed in London at USDollars 385.70 a troy ounce, down Dollars 6 from
Friday's close.
Dealers suggested that US investment funds started gold's slide by selling
on the New York Commodity Exchange because they were disappointed that it
had not reacted to a weakening dollar in the expected way - by rising
sharply.
The funds began their latest foray into the gold markets on June 17 on Comex
and their appearance in force lifted gold's price that day - and
subsequently in London on the following Monday - to the highest level in
three-months.
Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, said last night that
the funds had bought gold a week ago, betting that the price would go
higher, while at the same time some producers had started to sell in the
belief that the price had peaked.
It was also possible that the investment funds had been looking for
second-quarter profits in the small and malleable commodity markets to
offset first-quarter losses in bonds and currencies.
'The gold market is clearly at a turning point,' said Mr Smith. 'Only the
small matter of its direction is unclear.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries rally after early
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds rallied yesterday after the dollar firmed against the yen
and D-Mark.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  23/32 better
at 85 23/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.451 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was unchanged at 99 7/8 , to yield 6.050 per cent.
In early activity, an air of uncertainty hung over the market as traders
anxiously awaited fresh developments on the dollar. In overnight trading,
the US currency sunk below Y100 but recrossed the line during the morning.
By late afternoon, it had improved slightly.
Bonds first reacted with a modest move lower, but traders had no appetite
for a fresh sell-off after Friday's rout. Dealers were buying government
securities on weakness, helping to build a new floor for prices. As the
afternoon progressed, the rally gathered momentum in light trading, assisted
by a softer trend in commodities.
The big question was whether the Federal Reserve would lead a second round
of intervention on behalf of the dollar in spite of the failure of last
week's efforts. By late afternoon, the central banks had held their fire in
the currency markets, though there were reports of them buying Treasury
bills and short-term bonds with dollars acquired in Friday's intervention.
With the focus set squarely on the travails of the dollar, the day's
economic news barely raised a ripple of interest. The National Association
of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes had fallen 0.7 per
cent last month, in line with expectations.
A large purchase of UK gilt futures, rumoured to be by a US hedge fund,
pushed London higher yesterday, while other European bond markets enjoyed a
late rally following earlier falls.
Trading activity in the continental Europe was subdued, with most activity
limited to the futures market. They opened lower but recovered later in the
day, led by Germany, after a relatively calm day for the dollar removed the
immediate threat of an emergency rise in US interest rates to protect the US
currency.
Analysts said market sentiment remains nervous ahead of further developments
in the currency markets and in US interest rates.
'This is just a short squeeze upwards after a crash,' said Ms Alison
Cottrell of Midland Global Markets.
'Markets are pausing for breath ahead of more data and before the long
weekend in the US, the (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, the next
Bundesbank meeting and the G7 summit in Naples,' she said.
UK government bonds benefited from the government's White Paper on pension
industry reform, analysts said. But the single large purchase by a US hedge
fund of gilt futures was the principal factor driving gilts higher.
The move upwards in the futures market fed through into the cash market. The
long gilt future was up 1 31/32 points in late trading at 101 23/32 .
'People have had time to consider the implications of the paper and realise
that in the long-term it is favourable for bonds, in that it could involve
quite a substantial switch out of riskier assets like equities into
long-term gilts,' said Mr David Miles, senior UK economist at Merrill Lynch.
The Bank of England was reported to have supplied bonds to the market
yesterday due to increased demand.
The UK Treasury's latest forecast for the UK economy will attract attention
today. It is expected to predict higher economic growth and lower inflation
over the next two years than previously forecast.
Of particular importance for the gilt market will be the projection for the
public sector borrowing requirement, which is expected to be revised
downwards.
Data showing a fall in German consumer price inflation in June helped lift
market sentiment but analysts remained sceptical about the immediate
prospect for German bonds.
The September bund contract was up 0.54 points at 92.40 in late trading.

unit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing,
has raised a Pounds 700m loan for its tele-communications subsidiary in the
UK.
There was strong demand for the loan, which has a term of three years and
pays 55 basis points above the London inter-bank offered rate (Libor).
Hutchison originally came to the market for Pounds 500m.
The deal also marked an unusual display of co-operation among the UK's two
leading clearing banks, Barclays and National Westminster, which arranged
the loan together with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
Mr Ashley Wilkins, director of capital markets at NatWest Markets, said: 'To
get the two biggest UK banks in the market together means there's a lot of
credibility behind the deal.'
The proceeds of the loan will be used by Hutchison Telecommunications
Holdings (UK) to finance Hutchison's investment in the company.
Hutchison has a 65 per cent interest while Barclays owns 5 per cent and
British Aerospace the remaining 30 per cent.
The UK subsidiary recently launched a digital personal communications
network in the UK under the name of 'Orange'.
The loan was underwritten by a group of six arrangers; Barclays Bank, Chase
Manhattan Asia, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp, NatWest Markets, and Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale.

Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy, fertilisers and metals group which is 51
per cent owned by the state, has raised NKr4.7bn through its one-for-nine
rights offering, in line with expectations.
Merrill Lynch, global co-ordinator of the SEC-registered offering, said the
23.6m new shares were priced at NKr200 each - a slight discount to the old
shares, which traded at NKr219 yesterday.
Of the total amount, 30 per cent was taken up by US investors and the rest
by European and domestic investors. The state subscribed in full to its
entitlement.
Svedala, the mineral processing and transport company, has raised SKr843.6m
through the sale of 87 per cent of its shares in Kalmar, a subsidiary which
manufacturers fork-lift trucks. Svedala plans to sell its remaining shares
at a later date as part of its strategy of concentrating on its core
businesses and paying down debt.
The 11.1m shares were sold at SKr76 each, to give a historical
price-earnings ratio of 29. Merrill Lynch, the global co-ordinator, said
7.2m shares were bought by European and Swedish investors and 3m by US
investors.
A further 900,000 shares were sold to Swedish retail investors. The shares
will be listed in Stockholm on July 11.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Yen's strength against dollar brings
flurry of deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The yen's strength against the dollar prompted a flurry of yen-denominated
issuance in the eurobond market yesterday and syndicate managers said this
trend was likely to continue as long as the outlook for the Japanese
currency remained favourable.
'If there isn't a trade accord soon between the US and Japan, there will be
even more investor demand for yen-denominated assets,' said an official at
Merrill Lynch, which arranged two of the three euroyen deals that emerged
yesterday.
Other syndicate managers said the recent spate of publicly-underwritten
issues did not reflect fully the strength of demand for euroyen bonds from
Japan and Europe, noting that they only represented around one-quarter of
the volume being raised through private placements.
Yesterday's three euroyen deals were concentrated at the shorter end of the
yield curve, which showed that investors were still nervous of longer-dated
maturities.
Both Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Safa, the South Australia state
treasurer, are believed to have swapped the proceeds of their deals while
Xerox Corp kept its funds in yen for its Fuji Xerox operations.
Merrill Lynch made further inroads into the eurosterling sector yesterday
when it won the mandate to lead-manage a Pounds 47m offering of 25-year
eurobonds for the European Coal &amp; Steel Community.
Last week, Merrill arranged a Pounds 200m offering of 10-year eurobonds for
Austria, the bank's first eurosterling mandate since becoming a market-maker
in UK gilts earlier in the year.
The ECSC's bonds, which were priced to yield 38 basis points over the 8 3/4
per cent UK gilt due 2017, were bought by UK and foreign investors who have
been starved of long-dated sterling bonds. When the bonds were freed to
trade, the spread was unchanged.
An ECSC official said the deal represented the last instalment of its Pounds
200m loan to the Channel Tunnel. He added that the European Community was
likely to tap the Ecu sector of the market next month.
Elsewhere, Federal Home Loan Bank could steal Freddie Mac's thunder next
month when the two US mortgage agencies launch their inaugural global bond
offerings. FHL, which set up a Dollars 5bn global medium-term note programme
via Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley last week, plans to raise at least
Dollars 1bn by mid-July.
Moody's has placed the double-A3 long-term foreign currency debt rating of
Ireland under review for a possible upgrade. Last month, Standard &amp; Poor's
revised its outlook on Ireland's double-A minus rating to positive from
stable.
Moody's also said it had downgraded the long-term rating of the Spanish
autonomous region of Catalonia by two notches to A1 from double-A2. Around
Dollars 730m of debt securities are affected.

Amoco, the US oil group, has received about Dollars 440m, including
interest, from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, Reuter

The settlement will result in a second-quarter after-tax gain of about
Dollars 270m.
The company said the payment was the final settlement of a dispute involving
'windfall profit taxes' in the 1980s.
The settlement stems from seven cases filed by Amoco Production and its
subsidiaries that contested notices of deficiency issued by the IRS, which
alleged Amoco had underpaid its windfall profit tax liability from 1980 to
1986.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Stakes raised again in Bridge
Oil bidding war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The stakes were raised again yesterday in the hotly-contested bid for Bridge
Oil, the Australian oil and gas company, as Texas-based Parker &amp; Parsley
raised its terms to 90 cents a share - valuing Bridge Oil at ADollars 378m
(USDollars 277.9m) - and snared almost one-fifth of its target's shares.
But Gantry Acquisition Corporation, the rival bidder which is offering 85
cents a share, quickly stressed that it was not out of the race. 'We're
still very much in the game and considering our response,' said Mr Gene
Humphrey, Gantry's president.
Gantry is the bid vehicle for Joint Energy Development Investments, an
investment partnership owned jointly by Enron, the North American gas
company, and the California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the
largest public-sector pension funds in the US.
P&amp;P, which opened the bidding with an offer of 70 cents a share in cash last
month and had already raised that to 80 cents, said it was adding a further
10 cents to its price as the markets opened. No sooner had these new terms
been announced, than Prudential-Bache Securities, acting for P&amp;P, said it
would buy in the market at the revised offer level.
By the close of business, the bidder's interest had increased to 19.4 per
cent of Bridge's equity, compared with just over 4 per cent previously. Mr
Herb Williamson, executive vice-president of Parker &amp; Parsley, said he
believed the new offer was 'a compelling bid'.
News of the higher offer from the Texan oil independent prompted the Bridge
Oil board to switch its allegiance. Having previously recommended the 85
cents a share offer from Gantry, directors said they were now supporting the
new bid from Parker - in the absence of any further higher offer.
Aside from price, the two bids differ in that P&amp;P has said it will retain
Bridge's Australian assets, whereas Gantry has suggested that it is
interested primarily in Bridge's US operations and would expect to dispose
of the Australian operations.
Grocery wholesaler Foodland Associated plans to refinance all banking
facilities within the group by the end of October, Reuter reports.
Foodland, the target of a ADollars 501m takeover offer by New Zealand's Rank
Commercial and Coles Myer of Australia, said the refinancing would be
undertaken on the basis of a common borrowing and security structure.
The company said it expected to require core debt facilities of around
ADollars 250m. All current lenders would be offered an opportunity to
participate in the refinancing, Foodland said.

outlook for year

<TEXT>
Ares-Serono, the biotechnology-based drugs group, is 'quite optimistic'
about its profit prospects for 1994.
Mr Ernesto Bertarelli, deputy chief executive, said he thought the worst
effects of drug price cuts in the important Italian market had been felt in
the first quarter.
Last year Ares-Serono profits fell by a third to Dollars 72.5m because of
price cuts and currency devaluations in some of its main markets.
At the group's annual press conference, Mr Bertarelli said overall profit
margins were set to improve now that the weak over-the-counter drugs and
diagnostics divisions had been sold.
However, Mr Christian Raymond, treasurer, acknowledged that a continuing
weak or weaker US dollar would have a big impact on profits this year.
Ms Kathryn Biberstein, the group's general council, said Ares-Serono was
unconcerned by lawsuits launched recently by dissident minority shareholders
of Ares-Serono's Israeli subsidiary, InterPharm Laboratories.
Two weeks ago, the group closed a tender offer for the 24 per cent of
InterPharm shares it did not already hold at Dollars 22 per share.
Dissidents representing 12 per cent of the shares have held out for a higher
price, and have won an injunction in Israel preventing InterPharm from
exporting its beta interferon technology to Ares-Serono.
Ms Biberstein said the group expected to reach an agreement with Israel's
chief scientist in the next few weeks on the use of the technology.
Ares-Serono was also in discussion with the Nasdaq market, where InterPharm
is listed, about delisting the shares.
The company meanwhile confirmed that it would be paying a maintained
dividend of SFr6 per bearer share and SFr2.40 per registered share.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hard road for Japan's bank
mergers - Rationalisation plans may be at turning point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Takao Nakamura, a leading client for Kita-Nippon Bank, handed in a
petition of 30,000 signatures to the bank earlier this month opposing a
merger with two regional counterparts, he was unsure if he was doing the
right thing.
In the event, the plan to put together Kita-Nippon Bank, Shokusan Bank and
Tokuyo City Bank - all based in Tohoku, northern Japan - was subsequently
abandoned in spite of pressure for the deal from the powerful ministry of
finance.
The ministry is attempting a radical consolidation of Japan's many regional
banks. 'We didn't want Kita-Nippon to turn into something else, but we
didn't want to jeopardise its position either,' says Mr Nakamura, who heads
the bank's client union.
However, rationalisation and the expansion of market share through mergers
has become an increasingly urgent fact of life for Japan's financial
institutions as the country heads towards full financial deregulation.
Japan's banking sector contains a number of imbalances: 45 per cent of the
private-sector domestic loan market is held by the top 21 banks, the city,
long-term and trust banks: the remaining 5,700 institutions fight over the
other 55 per cent.
Under these circumstances, rationalisation is inevitable, especially with
many of the smaller and weaker banks suffering from bad loans made during
the asset 'bubble' of the 1980s. Instead of letting small banks fail, the
ministry of finance has encouraged mergers between the weaker and stronger
banks with the aim of avoiding public bailouts and crises of confidence and
helping local institutions to achieve economies of scale.
Initially, the three-way merger, which would have created the fifth-largest
of the second-tier regional banks with deposits of Y2,190bn (Dollars
21.26bn) and 225 branches, was welcomed by financial officials, clients and
employees. But the euphoria within Kita-Nippon soon gave way to apprehension
over allegations that Tokuyo City had bad loans of more than Y100bn.
Tokuyo City, which made a pre-tax loss of Y1bn last year, down from a Y7.6bn
loss in 1992, refuses to confirm or deny its bad loan figure. Although the
bank has a reputation for heavy lending to real estate companies, it says
most of its loans were not 'bubble' related, but were made before the real
estate investment boom.
'Every bank has non-performing loans,' stresses Mr Yoichi Oyama of Tokuyo
City.
Unions at Shokusan and Kita-Nippon objected to the merger on the grounds
that job security would be threatened by merging with a bank with
potentially high levels of problem assets.
'We've had great doubts about the merits of the economies of scale of the
merger as well,' says Mr Akira Yukinoura, head of Kita-Nippon's employee
union. Since the three banks are based in different areas of northern Japan,
there would be no cost-cutting benefits through closing branches, he says.
In addition, the initial cost of setting up new computer networks would be
too large.
'The ministry of finance's plan ignores the feeling of us local clients, and
the importance of Kita-Nippon's strong relationship with us,' says Mr
Nakamura, who owns a food manufacturing company in Iwate prefecture, where
Kita-Nippon is based.
Clients were also concerned over rising speculation about the reason the
merger was to take place on January 1 next year, in spite of the business
year starting in April. 'It seemed like the financial authorities wanted to
avoid having to reveal Tokuyo's poor financial statement for the year ending
next March,' he says.
Banking analysts suggest the collapse of the three-way merger represents a
turning point for the ministry of finance's bank plans to rationalise the
banking industry. 'The ministry can still orchestrate these mergers but they
need to make incentives clearer for the banks involved,' says Ms Alicia
Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo.
Clients and employees of Kita-Nippon, which had the courage to reject the
ministry's guiding hand, are aware that the bank may face more pressure from
the ministry and increasing competition from other local banks.
Mr Nakamura says that by forcing Kita-Nippon to drop its merger deal, the
client group has pushed the bank to choose a 'road full of thorns'.
He stresses, however, that customers of Kita-Nippon acknowledge that they
too must play their part in making sure the bank survives.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Court gives BHP time to defend
ADollars 4bn lawsuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Victoria Supreme Court yesterday set aside an interlocutory judgment for
damages against Broken Hill Proprietary, in respect of the ADollars 4bn
(USDollars 2.9bn) environmental lawsuit brought against the large Australian
resources company by villagers living around the Ok Tedi copper mine in
western Papua New Guinea.
BHP had been found guilty by default earlier this month because it failed to
lodge a defence to the writ within a 30-day period - although lawyers
quibbled over the precise deadline.
The Australian company, which manages the mine, has since submitted its
defence documents and said it will contest the action. The biggest of
Australia's natural resource groups, BHP is due to report its full-year
results on Friday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thai International Airways has temporarily shelved plans to issue USDollars
200m in Euro-convertible debentures because of a lack of demand in that
market.
Instead, it will mobilise funds worth some Dollars 686m to purchase the nine
aircraft it expects to take delivery over the next two years.
Some Bt11bn (Dollars 438.6m) will be raised with the issue of Y40bn (Dollars
388.3m) of samurai bonds to refinance the purchase of four Airbus A300-600s
and one Boeing 747-200; Y6bn in Euro-commercial paper will be issued to
refinance the outstanding cost of two Airbus A300-B4s.
Mr Kasem Suwanagul, the airline's chairman, said that the airline would pay
'much lower interest rates of between 2 and 6 per cent for the bond and the
commercial paper.'
The finance ministry has also approved Thai Airways' plan to issue
debentures, with warrants attached, worth Bt5bn in the domestic market
towards future purchases.
The company is also investigating other debt instruments; a medium-term note
worth Dollars 200m will be issued with the support of the finance ministry,
and a Japanese leverage lease will also cover USDollars 286m in purchase
costs.
The airline intends to take delivery of five Airbus A330-300s and one Boeing
747-400 this year and three more Airbus A330-300s next year.
The refinancing exercise will save around Bt100m a year, Thai says.
The airline is seeking a management consultant to help it improve its
corporate image.
The company wants to refurbish its staff uniforms and interior decoration,
although the carrier will keep its colour scheme and logo.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japanese 'ignoring' laws on
outsiders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese companies are largely ignoring a new law requiring them to appoint
at least one outsider to their boards, according to the US-based Investor
Responsibility Research Center.
Last year, largely as the result of pressure from US trade negotiators,
Japan passed laws requiring all corporations to appoint at least one
outsider to their boards of so-called statutory auditors, non-voting board
members whose role is to ensure that Japanese companies are run in a legal
manner.
Normally, boards of directors at Japanese companies are composed entirely of
each company's top executives, according to earlier surveys by IRRC, a
non-profit group which monitors issues affecting corporate governance.
IRRC surveyed 911 candidates for the role of outside statutory auditor.
Some 80 per cent of Japanese companies have scheduled annual shareholder
meetings for June 29, at which the individuals are set to be approved.
According to Mr John Taylor, senior analyst specialising in east Asian
companies at IRRC, Japanese corporations are exploiting a loophole in the
law to allow them to classify as outsiders those who are actually employees.
While employees are paid out of a company's profit and loss account, board
directors are paid bonuses out of profits. Thus, a director who has not been
on the payroll for the previous five years can be technically classified as
an outsider.
Mr Taylor said that out of the 911 individuals surveyed, some 17 per cent,
or 156 candidates, fell into this category.
'One out of six of Japan's 500 biggest companies - including international
giants Sony and Mazda - appear this month to be nominating individuals to
outsider slots who are really employees of the company,' Mr Taylor said.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Del Monte Foods changes hands in
Dollars 1bn transaction
</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Del Monte Foods, one of the world's largest food processors, is to be
acquired by Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, the Mexican chairman of Del Monte Fresh
Produce, the tropical-fruit trading company, and a group of investors in a
transaction worth about Dollars 1bn.
Mr Cabal and his partners will pay Dollars 277m in cash for Del Monte Foods,
and re-finance about Dollars 700m of debt.
The transaction is set to be finalised by mid-September, with most of the
financing expected to be obtained from a syndicate of international banks.
Del Monte Fresh Produce and Del Monte Foods, which is owned by a group of
investors including Citibank and Merrill Lynch, used to be part of the Del
Monte company, which was broken up in to four parts and sold off in 1989 by
RJR Nabisco of the US. Mr Cabal plans to re-merge the two companies,
according to an official familiar with his plans.
Del Monte Foods is based in San Francisco, although it has operations in
Mexico, Central America and the Philippines. It processes vegetables,
fruits, tomatoes and snack foods, and last year had revenues of Dollars
1.6bn.
Del Monte Fresh Produce, which markets and sells tropical fruit and
vegetables, had revenues of more than Dollars 300m in the first quarter this
year.
A previous attempt by Mr Cabal to buy Del Monte Foods fell through earlier
this year.
Mr Cabal decided to buy Del Monte Foods both to obtain synergies from
merging it with Fresh Produce, and also to give him more control of the Del
Monte brand, according to a spokesman. 'Del Monte has a terrific brand,'
said the spokesman 'and he intends to build on it.'

<TEXT>
Three Mexican companies plan to offer a total of more than Dollars 600m in
equity on international markets this week.
The offerings will test the receptiveness of investors to Mexican paper in
the light of recent political instability and less than two months before
presidential elections.
Grupo DESC, a large industrial conglomerate, will float 10.5 per cent of its
capital via an American depositary shares (ADS) offering, being co-ordinated
by Goldman Sachs, and a domestic offering underwritten by Inver Mexico.
The company hopes to raise between Dollars 200m and Dollars 235m, with
proceeds to be used primarily for new investments in car components,
property and food.
'Analysts have been telling us that they are looking less at Mexico as a
whole and more at company particulars,' said one adviser to the offering.
'We hope that is the case here because we believe our risk is lower than
that of Mexico in general,' he added.
Banpais, a medium-sized bank that recently bought Asemex, the country's
largest insurance company, from the Mexican government, plans to sell around
20 per cent of its capital for about Dollars 170m.
The ADS offering, accounting for 85 per cent of the shares being offered, is
underwritten by S. G. Warburg.
Grupo Sidek, a constructor specialising in tourist developments and hotel
operations, also expects to raise Dollars 200m this week with its own ADS
offering being co-ordinated by James Capel.
Sidek originally considered a Eurobond issue instead of a share offering,
but felt that the bond market was treating Mexican companies too
'generically'.
The success of these issues is being watched closely by a number of other
Mexican companies which are anxious to raise money via equity offerings but
unsure of how to time them effectively in view of the August 21 election.

battle

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A boardroom battle at Tatra, the Czech truck maker, could come to a head
today at a shareholders' meeting at which three US executives are expected
to come under fire.
The executives, who were offered 15 per cent in the truck maker last year in
return for help in bringing Tatra back to profit, face criticism about their
management style and commitment to the company by some of its Czech
directors.
Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-president of Chrysler, the US carmaker,
and two former executives of International Harvester, Mr David Shelby and Mr
Jack Rutherford, were hired by the Czech government amid considerable
fanfare early last year to implement a rescue package at the company, which
has seen its workforce cut from 16,000 to 12,000.
Some of the Czech management expressed doubts about the US executives'
commitment to Tatra, and accused the three of absenteeism and 'management by
fax', a charge they reject.
Analysts in Prague said the men were likely to get the continued backing of
Tatra's shareholders and that the company had little option but to continue
restructuring.
Since their arrival in May last year stocks have been cut and Tatra has been
able to raise short-term capital after restructuring its debt, estimated at
Kcs3.7bn (Dollars 132m).
Tatra lost Kcs439m in 1992 and a further Kcs947m in the first nine months
last year, compared with a profit of Kcs729m in 1991. The administrator of
Banka Bohemia, the Czech bank closed by the banking authorities after
issuing Dollars 600m of fraudulent prime bank guarantees, said last night 'a
majority' of the securities had been recovered.
Mr Miloslav Dudek, the administrator appointed by the Czech National Bank,
said the Swiss authorities still had not located a block of the guarantees
with a face value of Dollars 25m.
Banka Bohemia issued the guarantees in March but the US Securities and
Exchange Commission warned that investors who bought them might not be able
to recover their money.
The CNB was forced to close Banka Bohemia in April after panic-stricken
depositors began withdrawing funds, creating a liquidity crisis. A senior
official of the bank is being sought by Interpol.

<TEXT>
John Labatt, one of Canada's two big brewing groups, has raised the
possibility of selling parts of its CDollars 1bn (Dollars 700m)
entertainment businesses.
These would include the Toronto Blue Jays baseball club, the Toronto
Argonauts football club and broadcasting assets.
The remaining interests would then be packaged in a new company, 49 per cent
of which might be sold to the public, said Mr George Taylor, president of
Labatt.
The timing of any such offer, however, would have to await improved stock
market conditions.
Mr Taylor told analysts in Toronto that the proceeds from the asset sales,
around CDollars 500m, would be put in to brewing and other entertainment
acquisitions.
Labatt has been unhappy with the performance of its sports, broadcasting and
entertainments businesses.
The company earned CDollars 155m, or CDollars 1.53 a share, in the year
ended April 30, up from CDollars 133m, or CDollars 1.32, in fiscal 1993,
from continuing operations. Sales rose 9 per cent to CDollars 2.32bn.
Brewing earnings were ahead by 19 per cent, while the broadcasting, sports
and entertainment units contributed CDollars 32m, against CDollars 56m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zeigler Coal, the fourth largest US coal company, has applied to the
Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 10.6m shares in an initial public
offering.
The company said it planned to sell the shares for between Dollars 15 and
Dollars 17. The timing of the offering was not disclosed.
The company plans to use the proceeds to reduce debt and increase its
ability to acquire new coal properties and develop new mines on existing
reserves.
Illinois-based Zeigler produces about 40m tons of coal annually, with mining
operations in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Wyoming.
The company has expanded rapidly since 1990, acquiring the coal assets of BP
America in 1990, and of Shell Oil Company in 1992.
Zeigler said it recorded first-quarter net income of Dollars 6.3m on sales
of Dollars 220.1m.
Analysts said the Zeigler shares would offer a rare 'pure coal' opportunity
for investors. The leading US coal companies are held by conglomerates and
their shares are not traded independently of their parent companies.
US coal companies have not shared in the strong performance of other
commodities-based businesses this year.
Labour unrest and clean air regulations have battered the industry, leaving
only the strongest companies - with long-term sales contracts with large
utilities - in profitable positions.

tumble 24%

<TEXT>
Shares in Giddings &amp; Lewis, the US machine tool manufacturer, fell 24 per
cent yesterday when the company announced it expected 1994 earnings per
share to be some 20 per cent below Wall Street forecasts.
It blamed the shortfall in part on competitive industry pricing, which
resulted from Europe's soft machine tools market.
The stock, which is quoted on the Nasdaq market, closed at Dollars 15 3/4 ,
down Dollars 5 on the day.
The company said it expected second-quarter earnings per share to be flat or
slightly above the 20 cents earned in the first quarter, while for the full
year earnings were likely to be 20 per cent below the Dollars 1.35 to
Dollars 1.45 being forecast by analysts.
The company had earnings per share of 34 cents in the second quarter of last
year with Dollars 1.31 in 1993 as a whole.
Mr Joseph Coppola, chairman, said a number of contracts booked in prior
periods had proved more costly than anticipated.
In addition, competitive pressures meant that 1994 gross margins, which the
company had anticipated to be around 24-25 per cent, should instead be in
the 22-23 per cent range - even though the group expected continued growth
in quarterly bookings compared with last year.
The soft market for machine tools in Europe had meant lower bookings for the
company's operations there and also affected worldwide pricing: competitors
suffering sharp order declines overseas were bidding aggressively for
contracts in the US, creating more intense pricing pressure.
Furthermore, the company's automation technology group, which makes highly
engineered machine tools and cellular systems, had suffered weaker than
expected bookings because US purchasers remained cautious about the economy.
On the positive side, its domestic automotive business remained strong.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: BellSouth may not take up option
on QVC stake
</HEADLINE>

   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
BellSouth, the Baby Bell telephone company, is unlikely to exercise an
option to buy a stake in QVC Network, the television home shopping channel,
a BellSouth executive confirmed yesterday.
Ms Nancey Humphries, director of investor relations, made the remark at a
technology conference organised by Bear Stearns, the New York investment
bank.
Separately, Mr Barry Diller, who heads QVC, said after the company's annual
meeting that 'one would assume' BellSouth would not exercise its option to
buy Dollars 500m of QVC shares at Dollars 60 a share.
The deal was part of QVC's financing of its unsuccessful Dollars 10bn bid
for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group, and was seen as
a way for BellSouth to get a toehold in the entertainment business. At the
time of the agreement, QVC's stock was trading at over Dollars 50 but it has
been below Dollars 40 since April.
Mr Diller said QVC could be expected to seek expansion opportunities beyond
electronic retailing, including possibly into production of fiction and
non-fiction programming.
Speaking later, he said the company's basic television shopping service had
restored double-digit sales growth after a five-month slowdown.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Trident poised for Ukraine TV
franchise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Trident Television, a privately-owned UK company operating in Ukraine, is
about to purchase a 25-year franchise for one of the two national television
channels in Ukraine from the state television company.
If the deal goes through, it will be one of the first of its kind in the
former Soviet Union and give Trident a leading position in Ukraine's growing
and largely untapped advertising market.
Mr Andy Bain, managing director of Trident, expects the company's initial
investment to be between Dollars 12m and Dollars 15m. The investment is to
be made in the form of equipment and improvements to the transmission
facilities of Derzhteleradio, the Ukrainian state television company.
'Certain assets in this country are selling for pennies on the dollar and we
are getting one of them,' Mr Bain said.
Trident, which is raising funds for the investment through a private
offering, hopes to purchase the right to broadcast and sell advertising for
16.5 hours a day, seven days a week on Ukraine's Channel Three.
Under the contract, Derzhteleradio will receive part of the advertising
revenue as its licensing fee and will retain ownership of the transmission
facilities.
Derzhteleradio will continue to exercise full control over the news and
political content of the channel. The state television company is subject to
strong political control from the government.
Mr Bain believes that part of the reason Kiev is selling the channel so
cheaply is to create a popular, Ukrainian language alternative to Ostankino,
the Moscow-based channel that broadcasts throughout the former Soviet Union.
Ukrainian government officials regularly accuse Ostankino of politically
biased reporting, but Ukraine's home-grown, provincial television channels
are no match for the slick Russian station.
Trident, which hopes to go on air next year, could change that, by offering
in the Ukrainian language a mix of sitcoms, game shows, movies, and serials
imported from the west and US-style programming produced in Ukraine.
Mr Bain is confident that Ukraine's booming advertising market will allow
Trident rapidly to recoup its investment.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Gold producers to form new group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International institutional investors are being asked to provide Dollars 75m
to facilitate a merger of four small gold companies into a widely-held,
intermediate-sized North American gold producer, Atlas Gold Corporation,
listed in New York and Toronto.
Next year the new Atlas group was likely to be producing at an annual rate
of more than 300,000 troy ounces, said Mr Steve Manz, president and chief
financial officer, yesterday.
This would qualify the group for inclusion in the new Financial Times Gold
Mines Index.
Mr Manz and two colleagues - Mr David Birkenshaw, now chairman, and Mr
Michael Gross, chief operating officer - moved into Atlas last September
when the company was close to bankruptcy.
They had previously been officers of Royal Oak Mines, the Canadian group
being quickly built into a significant gold producer under the guidance of
Ms Peggy Witte, its president.
They now expect to raise Dollars 75m, about half from US investors and the
rest split about equally between institutions in Canada and the UK. This
will be used:
to buy 37.2 per cent of Granges, a Canadian precious metals producer, for
CDollars 50.7m (USDollars 36.4m) from MIM, the Australian resources group;
to acquire about 20 per cent of Dakota Mining, a Denver-based company
formerly known as MinVen Gold, for between Dollars 15.3m and Dollars 18.4m.
Atlas then hopes to use these stakes to acquire the rest of Granges and
Dakota as well as the remaining half of Granges' 50 per cent-owned Hycroft
Resources before the end of 1994.
At a presentation to institutions in London, Mr Manz said that the merged
group would start out with Dollars 86m cash (mostly coming from the sale by
Granges of its Trout Lake mine to Hudson Bay, the Minorco subsidiary) and
other working capital of Dollars 2m and long-term debt of about Dollars 2m.
Exercise of outstanding Atlas and Dakota warrants would add another Dollars
18m cash.
The merged group would have annual gold production between 200,000 and
300,000 ounces a year at cash cost of between Dollars 260 and Dollars 270 an
ounce (and total costs of Dollars 296) and reserves of 2.4m ounces.

ChinaTek has signed a contract with Motorola, the US electronics company, to
provide cellular telephone services to eight cities in China, Reuter reports
from New York. ChinaTek is the US holding company of a group of businesses
principally engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and distribution
of state-of-the-art television sets.
Under the contract, which has been approved by the Chinese government,
ChinaTek will install a cellular telephone network in eight cities in Liao
Ning province, a large industrial centre in north-east China.
Installation of the facilities and the sale of cellular telephones are
expected to begin in October, it said.
Under the plan, the network should be operational by December of 1994, after
which ChinaTek will run it for four years. Motorola has agreed to supply the
network equipment and cellular telephones, which will be purchased by
ChinaTek.
In return, ChinaTek will receive all revenues from selling the cellular
telephones as well as all service fees. ChinaTek expects net revenues from
the cellular phone programme during the four years to be in the Dollars 23m
to Dollars 25m range.

chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Months of speculation over the top job in German industry is set to end
tomorrow with the appointment of Mr Jurgen Schrempp as the next chairman of
the management board of Daimler-Benz, the German vehicle, aerospace and
technology group.
Daimler refused to comment yesterday ahead of the meeting of the company's
supervisory board, but it is understood that Mr Schrempp, 49, chief
executive of Deutsche Aerospace, Daimler's loss-making aerospace arm, will
be appointed to succeed Mr Edzard Reuter from May next year.
Mr Reuter, 66, architect of an ambitious strategy to expand Daimler into a
global technology group, will step down before his contract runs out at the
end of next year. He is expected to be appointed to the Daimler supervisory
board although it has not been decided whether he should succeed Mr Hilmar
Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, as chairman of that body.
Mr Schrempp is seen in Germany as Mr Reuter's favoured candidate for the
succession and is thought unlikely to break radically with the strategy
established by his mentor.
The other main contender was Mr Helmut Werner, 57, chief executive of
Mercedes Benz, the luxury car company which accounted for 70 per cent of
Daimler's DM97.7bn (Dollars 59.9bn) turnover last year and usually accounts
for the bulk of the group's profits.
The appointment of Mr Schrempp is due to take effect at the shareholder
meeting in May next year, allowing Mr Reuter to take credit for the expected
recovery in Daimler's profits this year. Last year the group made a loss of
DM1.8bn.
The Daimler supervisory board is likely to discuss the question of Mr
Reuter's appointment to the chairmanship of that body in November this year.
Should Mr Kopper step down from this position, it would be a break with the
past as a representative of the Deutsche Bank has occupied the position
since the 1920s.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks return to
aircraft leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese banks are returning to the aircraft leasing market after a two-year
absence, amid signs of an improvement in the financial situation of the
international airline industry.
Japanese institutions dominated the aircraft leasing business in the five
years until 1991, accounting for more than 50 per cent of all new aircraft
financing. Their share subsequently collapsed to less than 10 per cent as
Japanese banks, hit by a fierce credit squeeze, abandoned the troubled
airline market.
However, a number of recent aircraft leasing deals have confirmed the
renewed interest of Japanese banks. They have bid aggressively for aircraft
leasing business, which has in turn led to a drop in debt financing costs
for airlines.
Swissair is believed to have secured a spread of between 50 and 55 basis
points on the cost of a Dollars 120m lease, arranged by Sanwa Bank of Japan,
for a new McDonnell Douglas MD-11 wide-body aircraft. It would have probably
faced a spread of between 60 and 70 basis points 18 months ago for a similar
leasing deal, said Mr Ian Hosier, the head of Sanwa's London transport
finance arm, yesterday.
This reflects increased competition among banks for arranging aircraft tax
leases for quality airlines, although the spreads have yet to reach the lows
of around 25 basis points commanded by top airlines three or four years ago
during the industry's last boom.
The Swissair deal to be signed next week is also significant because the
Swiss carrier has traditionally turned to the US aircraft tax lease market
for aircraft financing, but decided to switch for the first time to Japan
because of the more competitive terms offered by the Japanese bank.
Japanese and US institutions have also been battling over a Dollars 220m
leasing deal involving two MD-11 aircraft for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The
US banks are understood to have clinched the deal, but only after being
forced to make additional concessions to improve on a rival Japanese bid.
Other significant deals include the Dollars 550m financing by British
Airways between February and April of six Boeing aircraft through the
Japanese lease market on spreads of 50 to 55 basis points on the debt.
British Aerospace is also back in the Japanese aircraft leasing market for
the first time since 1992. BAe's new aircraft leasing asset management
organisation has just completed three leasing transactions with Japanese
institutions and is believed to be negotiating up to eight more.
These leasing transactions also cover a 10-year period, reflecting renewed
confidence in BAe's financial situation on the part of the international
banking community, including Japanese banks.
Only 18 months ago banks were not prepared to take more than five-year
credit exposure on BAe aircraft.
'We are seeing increasing interest from banks of all types to invest in
aircraft leasing, but particularly from Japanese banks which faced the
biggest squeeze but are now recovering,' Mr Hosier explained.
After cutting back sharply in aircraft lending, many banks were now finding
themselves 'underlent' at a time when the airline industry was picking up
and had overcome the traumas of airline bankruptcies, widespread
cancellations and deferrals of new aircraft orders, and the collapse of GPA,
the Irish leasing company.
The International Air Transport Association is forecasting that airlines
will return to profit on international scheduled services this year after
four years of record losses.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Portugal puts telecoms on the
line - Part of new utility will be sold off next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The restructuring of Portugal's telecommunications industry has started at a
brisk rate. The process began on Thursday when three state-owned utilities
were brought together in the country's biggest merger to create Portugal
Telecom (PT), the largest Portuguese company by number of employees.
Part of PT is to be sold next year in one of Portugal's biggest
privatisations. It will become one of the largest companies quoted on the
Lisbon stock exchange. Along the way, important services may be spun off
through the most ambitious buy-out attempted by Portuguese managers.
Critics say the process could also prove one of the centre-right
government's biggest mistakes. 'Creating a company of this size will
inevitably lead to enormous inefficiencies and a loss of control over
costs,' says Mr Joao Oliveira Martins, a former telecommunications minister.
'Merging three companies with such different cultures will drastically
reduce competitiveness.'
Portugal's restructuring fits a pattern in Europe, where smaller countries
are rationalising, liberalising and privatising state telecommunications
operations. Objectives include cash for modernisation, market-oriented
management and a place in one of the international alliances taking shape.
PT will bring together Portugal's domestic and European telecommunications
services, as well as television signal broadcasting, mobile communications,
cable television and data transmission, under the management of a single
state monopoly.
Intercontinental services run by Radio Marconi will be brought into the
group later this year, when the government buys or exchanges shares held by
private investors who own 49 per cent. The government is considering a
proposal for a management buy-out of Marconi's 40 overseas subsidiaries and
non-core services.
But Mr Eurico Cabral de Fonseca, president of Comunicacoes Nacionais, the
holding company for state-owned telecommunications companies, says the loss
of Marconi's international expertise would be a fatal blow to PT.
The government defends the PT merger as an essential reshaping of an
irrationally divided sector. Mr Cabral de Fonseca says Portugal could not
hope to join an international alliance if it left telecommunications
services divided between separate companies.
Analysts say the merger will also help Portugal rebalance low local-call
tariffs with high long-distance and international call prices.
But critics fear the new utility runs the risk of becoming an inefficient
colossus that could lose market share to foreign companies. It is widely
accepted that market demand will force the liberalisation of voice services
in Portugal before the 2003 deadline - five years after most other European
Union countries - set by Brussels.
Raising funds for investment through privatisation is a priority for
Portugal. Although the country has made significant progress by increasing
the number of telephone lines for every 100 inhabitants from 20 to 34 over
the past decade, that is still the lowest level in the EU. The government
has set a target of 45 for the year 2000.
Expansion at that rate will cost an estimated Es130bn (Dollars 787m) a year.
The government believes PT would be able to generate sufficient cash for the
investment without an injection of fresh capital. But the company is
burdened at the outset by a pension fund for its 20,000 employees that is
undercapitalised by Es130bn. .
Officials say the privatisation of 25 to 30 per cent of PT in the first half
of 1995 will be primarily aimed at creating a sound base for growth. Initial
estimates value PT at more than Es1,000bn. But privatisation will be too big
for the Portuguese market to swallow alone. 'Even the biggest Portuguese
corporate groups lack the financial capacity to acquire more than 5 per cent
of PT,' says one analyst.
Because of these limitations, the first sale of PT shares is due to be made
simultaneously on several international stock exchanges. The government will
limit the holding any single investor may acquire to 5 per cent of the total
capital.
The second stage of the process should involve an alliance with a
international telecommunications partner. But it is unlikely that this
politically sensitive issue will be resolved before Portugal's next general
election in October 1995.
Mr Cabral de Fonseca sees only three possible candidates: British
Telecommunications; the alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom; and Unisource, the Swedish, Swiss and Dutch national telecoms joint
venture - each of which are forming alliances with important US and other
operators.

merger approval

<TEXT>
Cogefar-Impresit, the Fiat construction subsidiary, yesterday took another
step towards the creation of Italy's largest construction group, when
shareholders approved the first phase of a planned merger with two other
building companies.
At the same shareholder meeting, the chairman and chief executive of Cogefar
said they would stand down, having completed the cleaning-up of the company.
A number of former Cogefar executives were allegedly involved in Italy's
bribes scandal, but Mr Marcello Franco, who became chairman in May 1993,
said yesterday that he and Mr Paolo Rucci, outgoing chief executive, had
'carried out the job of regularising and systematising the accounts'.
Fiat announced in December that it planned to cut its exposure to the
building sector with a complicated three-way merger between
Cogefar-Impresit, Lodigiani (Italy's second largest private construction

<TEXT>
Helikopter Service, the Norwegian helicopter group, yesterday announced
plans to acquire Aberdeen-based Bond Helicopters in a cash-plus-shares deal
which values Bond at NKr800m (Dollars 115m).
The deal will create the world's largest helicopter group with a fleet of
169 aircraft and annual turnover of NKr2.5bn. Following four years of
co-operation between the two groups, HS yesterday acquired 49 per cent of
Bond and will take over the remaining 51 per cent during the next three
years.
The owners of Bond will acquire up to 12.2 per cent of the shares of HS
during the amalgamation period, making them the biggest single shareholder;
3i, the UK venture capital company, is disposing of its 30 per cent stake in
Bond.
Mr Christian Brinch, managing director of HS, said the companies would
retain their identities during the next three years and that there would be
no formal changes to management. Mr Brinch will become the managing director
of the new entity.
The merged group with 1,800 employees, 156 helicopters and 13 aircraft will
command 42 per cent of the North Sea market.

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: GAN poised to replace chief
ahead of sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman of GAN, the state-owned French insurance
group, is set to be replaced by Mr Jean-Jacques Bonnaud, head of the
company's international operations, according to government officials.
Mr Bonnaud, whose appointment is expected to be confirmed within the next
few days, will be faced with the task of preparing GAN for privatisation.
The company is one of 21 public-sector groups slated for sale, although its
privatisation is unlikely this year and must await the sale of Assurances
Generales de France, a rival state-owned insurer.
The change at the top of GAN is prompted by the expiry of Mr Heilbronner's
mandate. But it also follows the relatively poor performance of the group,
which has seen profits decline sharply over the past few years.
From net profits of FFr2.32bn (Dollars 424m) in 1991, results at GAN fell to
FFr402m in 1992 and remained flat at FFr414.3m last year. The decline in
profits partly reflects GAN's exposure to France's troubled property sector,
which forced it to restructure its banking operations and transfer FFr18.4bn
of non-performing property loans from its balance sheet earlier this year.
Following the restructuring measures, Mr Heilbronner said that the company
was on course for 'very strong' growth and should be ready for privatisation
later this year.
Mr Bonnaud's appointment has been strongly supported by Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister. According to officials, Mr Alphandery is
in favour of an internal appointment to head the group, as opposed to the
series of external appointments which have taken place at other public
sector companies.
Mr Bonnaud, 59, joined GAN in 1979 and has been managing director
responsible for international operations since 1986.

Since Higgs launched its issue in May, the FT-SE 100 index has fallen by 250

Fondigest said that economic conditions in Italy were ripe for recovery, and
the election of the pro-free market right wing coalition would also support
economic growth.
The fund will have a bias towards smaller and medium-sized companies, which
it said were under-researched but would be helped by new tax incentives.
A placing of the trust with institutions was under way; the public offer

Shares in WPP Group slipped 3p to 99p yesterday as the marketing services
concern revealed at the annual meeting that 'worldwide revenues in constant
currencies' had risen by more than 3 per cent during the first five months
of the current year on a like-for-like basis.
The operations in the UK, Asia Pacific and Latin America had turned in
stronger performances than previously, though the reverse was true of the US
and Canada.
By type of operation, advertising revenues were 1 per cent ahead, market
research grew 10 per cent, non-media activities advanced almost 7 per cent,
and specialist communications rose more than 5 per cent. Public relations
had been 'disappointing'.
The chairman said that the group's trading margins had continued to improve
in the five months - in line with the business plan which stipulates an
increase of 1 per cent in operating margins in both 1994 and 1995 on a
like-for-like basis.
Debt averaged about Pounds 281m, against Pounds 323m. The Dollars 150m
bridging facility had been repaid.
WPP said it had delayed its decision on the flotation of its market research
interests 'as a result of the volatility in the equity markets on both sides
of the Atlantic'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Beckett, chairman of Monarch Resources, told the annual meeting
that the company was in a strong financial position to fulfil its five-year
strategy following the start-up of the La Camorra mine and the raising of
Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.4m).
The company has gold mining and exploration operations in Venezuela but is
listed in London. Following the cash raising it is also traded on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.
Mr Beckett reported that the first gold was poured at the La Camorra mine in
Venezuela on Friday following a two year Dollars 25m development programme.
The mine, which has 400,400 troy ounces of gold reserves, is budgeted to
produce an annual 81,000 ounces at an average cash cost of less than Dollars
125 an ounce.
The troublesome Revemin plant reported record production and profits in the
first half. Its ability to continue this depended on being able to identify
new sources of high-grade hard-rock or sands.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity losses will not exceed
Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade Indemnity, the trade credit insurance company, expects to report net
losses of no more than Pounds 6m, as a result of last week's appeal court
judgment which ruled victims of poor financial advice were entitled to more
compensation.
The court ruled on Friday that the Investors Compensation Scheme was wrong
in using its discretion to limit compensation to investors in home income
plans.
Trade Indemnity insured the scheme's liabilities in this matter on a policy
underwritten in April 1990. Its 'Special Underwriting Unit', which wrote the
policy, stopped writing new business in November 1991 and the policy expired
at the end of March 1992.
Gross losses, taking into account reinsurance recoveries, are expected to
amount to Pounds 20m. An additional provision of up to Pounds 6m will be
charged to the 1994 profit and loss account.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chez Gerard completes Scotts buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Chez Gerard, the restaurant company, yesterday completed its first
acquisition since flotation last March, paying Pounds 380,000 for Scotts
Restaurant in Mayfair.
Scotts, which specialises in shellfish and seafood, has just under 200
covers across 7,500 sq ft, making it the biggest restaurant in the group.
Mr Neville Abraham, chairman, said the purchase was in line with the group's
declared strategy of investing in restaurants in central London.
It would be funded from the Pounds 3m raised by the flotation for
acquisitions. Mr Abraham added that the group was looking for further
expansion.
The flotation at 112 1/2 p gave the group a market capitalisation of Pounds
21m.
The shares closed down 3p yesterday at 98p.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Improved margins lift Business Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved margins in the second half helped Business Post Group, the parcel
and express mail company which came to the market last July, raise annual
pre-tax profits by 26 per cent to Pounds 5.3m.
Sales for the year to March 31 rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 41.8m while
operating profits advanced 11 per cent to Pounds 5.2m.
The shares, which came to the market at 120p, fell sharply after the group
last November reported a decline in first half margins.
They closed 2p higher yesterday at 102p.
Mr Peter Kane, chairman, said the group had continued to win business from
its competitors and saw a 20 per cent increase in operating profits in the
second half.
'The improvement in margins in the second half has continued into the first
two months of the current year and I am confident that we shall make further
progress as the business develops,' he added.
The group had suspended development of UK Mail, its door-to-door
hand-delivery business, in recognition of the time it would take for the
government to finalise plans for privatisation of the Post Office.
Earnings per share rose by 6 per cent to 7.5p (7.1p).
A proposed final dividend of 2.7p makes a 3.7p (2.9p) total for the year, a
rise of 28 per cent.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Taking a position in the market -
Unshackled from B&amp;C, Exco is set to regain its listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moneybroking is an industry the profitability of which seems to run in
inverse proportion to its respectability.
It is the business which bankrolled British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial
conglomerate, on the ambitious path that ended in receivership, and which
has underwritten Lord Hollick's high profile push into television, through
MAI.
Yet, moneybrokers have tended to be the hidden source of vast cash flows,
rather than the public focus of the holding companies which own them.
Moneybrokers act as intermediaries - primarily between the banks - in the
trading of international and domestic deposits, derivative products, and
foreign exchange, the world's largest traded market. The operators have also
tended to build up fixed interest securities businesses.
The brokers write billions of dollars of transactions daily, in frantic
trading rooms banked with screens and microphones, yet business risk is
limited to client default, or mismatches. The companies do not take house
positions in the markets.
The industry's reputation can be explained in part by the image of excess
held by the foreign exchange trader, and staff costs are certainly high.
Exco, which is being floated this week by the administrators of British &amp;
Commonwealth, paid Pounds 109m in staff costs last year, or an average of
Pounds 55,000 per head.
In addition, listed moneybroking businesses have had a somewhat chequered
history.
However, the impending flotation of Exco is underlining the fact that the
big players within the industry have not only survived the recession
unscarred, but are seeing an explosion of profits.
There are four large broadly-based global players in moneybroking, MAI,
Exco, Marshalls and Tullett &amp; Tokyo, and then an enormous number of
company's focusing on niche markets.
According to Mr Ron Sandler, chief executive of Exco: 'The big are getting
bigger, and the small are either getting increasingly specialised, or just
smaller.'
The victims within the industry have generally involved lack of breadth,
disastrous diversification, or parentage problems.
Prebon Yamane was a core part of York Trust (renamed Babcock Prebon), which
went into receivership in 1991, although moneybroking was not the focus of
its problems.
Exco and Marshalls had turbulent ownership histories, but they both remained
profitable. The most recent addition to the listed sector, Trio, has not
rewarded subscribers to its flotation, but it is a smaller business, with a
heavy concentration on dollar/D-Mark foreign exchange trading.
Mr Charles Gregson, MAI's deputy group managing director, said: 'In a niche
business, it is possible to set up in a garret with a few telephones and
deal successfully, but to broaden the business requires a substantial
investment in information technology and people.' Both MAI and Exco spend
some Pounds 8m a year on IT, which creates a considerable barrier to
competition.
For the global players, the market has been far steadier. 'The historic
record speaks for itself. With the exception of a crash year in 1987,
profits have grown every year in the last 20,' said Mr Gregson, of MAI's
moneybroking business.
The broader range of activities ensures a larger customer base for the
global businesses, given the growing inter-dependence of money market
products.
But ironing out the cycles is a important inducement to going global. For
example, Exco's strong position in the Asian markets was affected by a slump
in the Japanese banking sector, but this has been more than replaced by
surging securities trading in the US. Japan is now recovering, while the
securities markets may suffer a downturn.
The build up of capital adequacy regulations weakened the market for cash
deposits, but this has been counterbalanced by activity in off-balance sheet
products, such as forward rate agreements.
On the foreign exchange side, competition remains tight, and brokers have
been losing market share to direct trading between the banks, and also, to a
lesser extent, to the three automated trading systems.
The last detailed survey by the Bank for International Settlements,
published in March 1993, showed that foreign exchange brokers' market share
in the UK had fallen from 43 per cent in 1986 to 34 per cent in 1992.
However, increased volumes - more than Dollars 100bn per day in London by
1992 - have more than made up for the loss of market share.
In addition, derivatives, the third leg of the moneybroking business, has
shown enormous growth. There is less competition for broking new products,
and fatter profit margins can be achieved.
The fixed interest securities arms have had a fantastic 18 months, but with
the turning of the interest rate cycle, 'some of the steam may have been
taken out of the securities market for the time being', according to Mr
Sandler.
Further competition could also come from the threatened entry of Liberty
into the UK gilts market. However, governments have had limited success in
reducing their deficits, which should ensure that while volumes may fall to
more sustainable levels, it will not be a dramatic decline.
Longer term growth for the moneybrokers should come from the development of
new products, such as FRA options and swap options, and the brokers are also
beginning to focus on emerging markets, such as China and India.
The moneybroking businesses of both MAI and Exco are expected to achieve
double digit profits growth in the current financial year. Exco should
further benefit from its release from the spectre of B&amp;C, which is selling
its 40 per cent stake in the flotation.
Caledonia Investments, a highly respected investment company, has
demonstrated commitment to the industry by agreeing not only to retain its
27 per cent stake in Exco, but taking pre-flotation dividends in scrip form.
Exco exceeded investors' highest hopes during its six years as a listed
company in the early 1980s, and it will struggle to match that performance
second time around.
But Mr Gregson argues: 'All the evidence suggests that there is still growth
in these markets as the product range and the customer base increases, and
new financial centres are established in developing countries.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Exceptional gain helps Hogg
Robinson to Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hogg Robinson, the travel, transport and financial services group, announced
annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 13.3m of Pounds 21.5m, including a
Pounds 7.25m net gain from the sale of the holiday business to Airtours last
year.
The group benefited from an upsurge in business travel, with operating
profits for the year to March 31 more than doubled to Pounds 4.58m, compared
with Pounds 2.04m.
Profits from transport, however, were down by 21 per cent from Pounds 6.04m
to Pounds 4.76m. Mr Brian Perry, chairman, said the international trailer,
haulage and logistics businesses had done well, despite the recession in
Germany and other continental countries.
It was insufficient, however, to offset weaknesses in HR Embassy, the
UK-based general freight forwarding arm, which suffered from not being
sufficiently large to benefit from economies of scale, Mr Perry said.
He hoped to move this part of the business out of loss but said it would
never make large profits. New management had been installed. He added that
although the business was not on the market, he would consider offers.
The third part of the transport business, the shipping service to the
Falkland Islands, was severely affected by a drop in cargo movements to the
south Atlantic.
Financial services saw profits rise from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 5.65m. Mr
Perry said this side of the business had strengthened in the second half of
the year, as companies recovering from the recession increasingly purchased
advice on pensions and employee benefits.
Group turnover was down at Pounds 153.8m (Pounds 172.7m) including Pounds
9.48m (Pounds 30.4m) from discontinued activities and Pounds 1.4m from
acquisitions.
Earnings per share were 23.49p (14p). The proposed final dividend is
increased by 8.75 per cent to 4.35p, bringing the total for the year to
7.1p, against 6.6p.
COMMENT
Hogg Robinson is not helped by the widely-held perception that it is still a
holiday company. In fact, this part of the business has since been renamed
Going Places by its new owners, Airtours. Nor is it aided by its corporate
perversity in managing to run a transport business which does well in
recession-hit Germany and badly in the recovering UK. While the business of
carrying goods to the Falkland Islands is improving, it is difficult to see
its prospects are particularly exciting. The profit increase in financial
services is less than impressive in a recovering UK corporate sector and the
group will have to demonstrate that the improvement in the second half is
sustainable. The only unambiguous good news is in business travel, where the
UK upturn has shown through in buoyant profit figures.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Robert Fleming ahead sharply to Pounds
209.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Fleming Holdings almost doubled pre-tax profits in the year ended
March 31, from Pounds 106.4m to Pounds 209.9m.
Administrative expenses also rose sharply to Pounds 259.6m (Pounds 198.2m),
'almost all of which reflects a rise in performance-related bonuses to
staff,' said Mr John Manser, chief executive.
Mr Manser said that all parts of the group contributed to the profits rise,
although east Asian dealing profits and commissions were a significant part
of that. 'A big factor was profits from securities on the equities side,
particularly in the Far East,' he explained.
Overall, fee and commission income rose strongly to Pounds 273.1m (Pounds
224.3m), while net dealing income nearly doubled from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds
77.8m.
Mr Bill Harrison, chief executive of the investment banking division, said
the group was beginning to see results from its efforts to achieve greater
integration of banking, securities underwriting and distribution and
research.
It was the lead underwriter of Euro-convertible issues in the past year and
had won mandates on several key corporate finance deals, including acting as
adviser to Enterprise Oil in its bid for Lasmo, he added.
In Fleming's investment management activities, worldwide funds under
management increased by about 50 per cent to Pounds 49.5bn (Pounds 33.4bn).
Some Pounds 7bn of the increase represents net new cash, with the remainder
provided by investment returns from buoyant stock and bond markets
worldwide.
The company continued to lose clients in its traditional UK pension fund
business, although its international and retail client base grew strongly.
'It is an area where we were one of the leaders and now clearly we are not,'
Mr Manser said.
Fleming has recently recruited a new head for its asset management
activities in an effort to improve performance.
Looking ahead, Mr Manser identified two key growth areas; the activities of
Jardine Fleming, its 50 per cent owned east Asian joint venture, and a
further expansion of its continental European investment banking activities.
Also later this year, Fleming will open its first offices in Latin America
and intends to launch a broking service based in New York, which will
specialise in the distribution of research on Latin American companies.
Earnings per share jumped to 299.8p (149.6p) and the group announced an
increase in dividends for the year from 38p to 50p - a rise of 32 per cent.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach in Pounds 27.5m offer for
Busways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus group, has made a recommended share offer
for Busways, the main urban bus company in Tyne and Wear.
The deal, which would be Stagecoach's biggest acquisition since its
flotation in April 1993, values Busways at Pounds 27.5m, to be met by the
issue of new Stagecoach shares with a cash alternative and a loan note
election.
Busways, bought from the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority by its
management and employees in 1989 for Pounds 14.4m, operates more than 600
buses and has a workforce of 1,750.
In the year to March 31 it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.3m on turnover
of Pounds 42.5m.
Both companies described the proposed acquisition as a 'win win' deal. Mr
Brian Souter, Stagecoach chairman, said he did not expect any referral to
the Office of Fair Trading since his group did not currently have any
presence in Tyne and Wear.
If the acquisition of Busways and of Western Scottish, announced earlier
this month, go through, Stagecoach will have a Pounds 285m annual turnover,
5,300 buses and 16,000 staff.
It is offering 246 new Stagecoach shares for every 100 Busways. Irrevocable
undertakings have been received from shareholders, including directors and
management, in respect of 51 per cent of Busways' share capital.
Busways' employees hold the remaining 49 per cent. The offer is conditional
on valid acceptances being received in respect of not less than 75 per cent
of Busways shares by July 21.
Because of its size, the deal requires the backing of a Stagecoach EGM. Mr
Souter expects approval.
Accepting Busways shareholders can opt for cash, at an aggregate of 186.4p
per share; employees' pay-outs would be worth between Pounds 4,500 and
Pounds 13,500. Noble Grossart has conditionally agreed to purchase or
procure purchasers for the new shares in respect of which elections are made
for the cash alternative.
To fund the Pounds 4.51m loan note commitments already known and meet the
expenses of the offer, 3.36m Stagecoach shares are being placed at 173p
apiece. This placing, underwritten by Noble Grossart, will be issued whether
or not the offer proceeds and will raise Pounds 5.8m before expenses.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Norweb rises to Pounds 178m and looks to
expansion in non-core activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norweb, the Manchester-based regional electricity company, said it expected
a fifth of profits to come from unregulated businesses by 1998 as it
reported 1993-94 pre-tax profits of Pounds 178.3m, against Pounds 157.1m.
The company increased the full year dividend by 15 per cent and said its
target of achieving real dividend growth of 6 to 8 per cent annually until
the end of the decade remained in place.
Mr Ken Harvey, chairman, also said he expected dividend cover to go up from
the 3.3 times of 1993-94. This is already among the highest for any of the
recs.
The 13.5 per cent profits increase in the year to March 31 was achieved on
turnover of Pounds 1.47bn (Pounds 1.41bn). Provisions for restructuring were
increased by about Pounds 4m. Job numbers fell from 7,586 to 7,727 during
the year.
Earnings per share were 76p (64.6p) and the final proposed dividend of 16.3p
makes 23p (20p) for the year.
Explaining the company's non-core strategy Mr Harvey said the current review
of distribution by the regulator meant that price controls were going to be
tougher after next April. 'We are not going to get the growth from
distribution that we have had for the last four years.'
Mr Harvey expected the generation schemes at Gordonsville, in the US, Keadby
and Roosecote to contribute more than Pounds 20m operating profits by the
end of the decade and retailing to provide about Pounds 15m.
He added that following a 1.6 per cent reduction in July 1993 and a further
6 per cent cut in April domestic customers now had the lowest prices in
England and Wales.
Mr Brian Wilson, finance director, said the company had net cash of Pounds
30m at the year end, after taking Pounds 153m of government debt into
account.
COMMENT
Following East Midlands' decision to wind down some of its
post-privatisation acquisitions, Norweb has assumed the mantle of the most
adventurous regional power company. Through its Gordonsville acquisition it
is one of first to move abroad in a serious way, and the balance sheet
provides ample scope for more forays either overseas or into generation. The
company is also increasing its exposure to fully competitive markets by
building a telecommunications business and expanding in gas sales and
appliance retailing. The results showed that the stores business was moving
ahead, increasing profits from Pounds 6m to Pounds 7.1m - but with turnover
up by 34 per cent so it should be. Norweb has traditionally been one of the
best retailers among the recs but competition with the likes of Dixons and
Comet means even they are finding the going tough. A solid performance in
distribution, where profits rose 8 per cent, and supply, up 19 per cent, has
helped Norweb's shares to a 5.5 per cent prospective yield assuming 14 per
cent dividend growth this year. That makes it one of the highest rated
companies - not bad for a company with Norweb's ambitions.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Seeboard jumps 17% to Pounds 132m - Cost
reductions seen as main engine behind future profits growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cost cutting drive helped Seeboard, the regional electricity company for
the south-east of England, lift pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 by
17 per cent, from Pounds 112.7m to Pounds 131.7m, on turnover steady at
Pounds 1.22bn.
A proposed final of 8.45p raises the total dividend by 17.5 per cent to
11.75p - the largest increase yet seen in the electricity results season.
Earnings per share were 37.8p (31p).
This strong showing, combined with a bullish statement from Sir Keith
Stuart, chairman, and a share buy-back proposal, helped boost the share
price by 11p to 316p.
All areas of the business had advanced, said Sir Keith.
The electricity distribution business produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds
101.1m (Pounds 91.9m); profit from supply activities increased from Pounds
13.3m to Pounds 14.5m; gas supply, retailing and contracting all contributed
a small profit.
The result was helped by the cost-cutting drive launched last year.
The company shed more than 900 people and expects to reduce numbers by
between 200 and 250 in each of the next three years.
Cost reduction is seen as the main engine for profit growth in the near
future.
The dividend was 'just right for Seeboard' said Sir Keith, and was not a
signal that it was in a race with other electricity companies.
Despite the dividend increase, cover went up from 3.1 to 3.2. Sir Keith said
this could come down, but the company stood by its policy of giving
shareholders 'attractive dividend growth'.
'Anyone invested in Seeboard should assume that there are good prospects for
the future,' he said.
Seeboard will be seeking shareholders' approval to buy back up to 10 per
cent of its shares.
Mr Jim Ellis, chief executive, said this represented the best use of
shareholders' money. Although Seeboard was looking for expansion
opportunities, it intended to take a cautious approach.
The review of distribution prices now being undertaken by Prof Stephen
Littlechild, the industry regulator, would lead to tougher price controls,
said Sir Keith.
Seeboard had asked him to take account of the cost savings that electricity
companies had already made when setting their price formulas.
COMMENT
Seeboard is beginning to reap the benefits of the cost cutting exercise it
launched last year, and the share buy-back is one of the ideas it has for
using the proceeds. But in the longer term, Seeboard will have to find more
conventional ways of expanding the business if it does not want to end up
bulging with cash. The distribution price review will determine more
precisely how much cash Seeboard will have, but the company is strong enough
to handle a regulatory tightening. Meanwhile, the chairman's statement that
it will not rush into 'madcap ventures' is reassuring. Assuming 16 per cent
dividend growth this year, the shares are on a yield of 5.4 per cent, which
is one of the strongest in the sector.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Judicial review of Emap's Pounds 71m bid
for Trans World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap's Pounds 71m bid for Trans World Communications, the local radio group,
is to be the subject of a judicial review after a successful application by
Guardian Media.
Guardian Media, which owns 20 per cent of Trans World, and the company's
management have questioned the legality of a scheme devised by Emap to get
round the limits on the ownership of radio licences.
The scheme, which involves Emap transferring two of its existing licences
into a joint venture with Schroders, the merchant bank, has been approved by
the Radio Authority.
At a hearing yesterday Mr Justice Latham gave Guardian Media leave for a
judicial review of this approval.
He ordered an urgent hearing as soon as possible after July 18. It is
thought a date at the end of the month is most likely.
Emap must post offer documents to Trans World shareholders by July 20.
Emap, which owns 29 per cent of Trans World, launched a full bid of 181p a
share last week after agreeing to buy the 22 per cent stake held by Mr Owen
Oyston.
The Trans World board declined to recommend the offer on the grounds that
Emap was offering an insufficient premium for the shares and that the legal
standing of its ownership scheme was uncertain.
Trans World shares fell 3p to 170p.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cortecs International shares to begin
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cortecs International, the Australian registered biotechnology company whose
operations are based in the UK, will see its shares start trading in London
today after raising Pounds 10.6m through an international share placing.
The company announced plans for a placing with UK institutions in March, but
was caught by the downturn in the new issues market. It cut the offer price
by about 15 per cent and widened the net to include international investors,
who have taken up some 70 per cent of the new shares. The placing was
handled by West Merchant Bank and Henry Cooke Corporate Finance.
Mr Glen Travers, chairman, blamed the weak response on general market
conditions rather than any problems with the biotechnology sector in
particular. 'We had a good feedback from institutions, who liked the fact
that we had current products generating cashflow to help fund our research
programme.'
Last week Cortecs launched a cheap and fast-acting diagnostic kit in the UK
for the detection of Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium now acknowledged to
be a common cause of peptic ulcers.
Cortecs incurred a loss of ADollars 10.6m (Pounds 5m) in 1993 on turnover of
ADollars 11.6m after research and development spending of ADollars 7.02m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca, the agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals group, is to invest Dollars
100m (Pounds 65.7m) in China in the next five years after signing two
framework agreements with government organisations.
These included a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government
covering the company's involvement in agrochemicals production and a joint
venture consultancy contract with Sino-Pharm, the foreign trade corporation
of the State Pharmaceutical Corporation of China.
Mr David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, said in Beijing that the group
was close to finalising arrangements with a joint venture partner to build a
Dollars 60m plant producing paraquat, the active ingredient in its Gramoxone
herbicide.
The plant, in which Zeneca would have at least a 75 per cent stake, would be
located in the Yangtze River Delta near Shanghai.
Capacity would be 15m litres of paraquat annually.
Zeneca, which was floated in London and New York in June last year following
its demerger from ICI, plans to use its Yangtze Delta plant as a base for
developing the market for its agrochemicals products throughout China.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest burden helps Lister cut loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JYOTI JEETUN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lister, a textile maker with interests in engineering and insurance broking,
sharply reduced pre-tax losses in the year to March 26, from Pounds 2.9m to
Pounds 851,000.
The improvement was helped by an absence of restructuring costs, compared
with a charge of Pounds 1.16m, and a reduction in interest charges to Pounds
491,000 (Pounds 694,000). Losses per share were 5.55p (17.69p); there is an
unchanged dividend of 0.1p.
The group, which has been in the red for five successive years, said
improved efficiency and product repositioning helped it reduce operating
losses to Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 1.16m). Textiles incurred a loss of Pounds
285,000 (Pounds 926,000), engineering suffered from weak demand and lost
Pounds 168,000 (Pounds 242,000), while insurance broking reported profits of
Pounds 23,000 (Pounds 5,000).

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: French group may take over Ferranti
division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomson CSF, the French defence electronics group, has agreed in principal
to acquire Ferranti's industrial systems division from the administrative
receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen.
Ferranti went into receivership in December after GEC withdrew a 1p a share
rescue offer for the company following its due diligence inquiries.
Yesterday's agreement, which is subject to contract, covers price - which
was not disclosed - and other 'critical factors'.
Negotiations to finalise the sale are expected to be completed next month.
Ferranti's industrial systems division, which manufactures process controls,
has operations at Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, and Dalkeith and Aberdeen
in Scotland.
GEC acquired Ferranti's main UK defence businesses, which include Ferranti
defence systems integration and Ferranti simulation and training, from the
administrative receivers last month.
Negotiations covering the sale of Ferranti's remaining civil and
communications businesses are expected to be completed next month.
After that the receivers will re-open negotiations covering Ferranti's
components manufacturing plant at Cairo Mill in Oldham.

FT  28 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Budgie provides lift as Sleepy Kids hits
Pounds 0.26m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Sleepy Kids, the children's animation and merchandising
company, soared from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 263,000 at the interim stage, on
the back of continued demand for Budgie the Little Helicopter.
However, the share price fell 12p to 69p yesterday after running-up ahead of
the figures.
Turnover rose from Pounds 127,000 to Pounds 621,000 in the half year to
April 30. The company continued its no-dividend policy, in place since it
gained its USM quotation in 1990, although Mr Martin Powell, chairman, said
it would recommend a payment once 'a trading pattern becomes more firmly
established'.
Earnings per share rose to 0.87p (0.01p).
The company, which owns the worldwide rights to animate and merchandise
Budgie, a character launched in four books written by the Duchess of York,
has also won a further 17 merchandise licensing agreements bringing the
total to 58 - 36 of which are held by UK companies.
Mr Powell said a second animation series based on the character had been
commissioned by ITV Network Centre and was due to be broadcast early next
year. Cost of production would be in the region of Pounds 1m, of which
Sleepy Kids would provide Pounds 700,000.
The first series was launched on ITV in early January and is due to be
broadcast in Australia, France and South Africa later this year.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Kemper succumbs to Conseco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kemper, the US insurance and mutual funds group, has accepted a Dollars
67-a-share bid from smaller rival Conseco, in one of the biggest leveraged
acquisitions of a US financial company.
Kemper's decision had been expected after GE Capital last week dropped its
Dollars 60-a-share bid. The Conseco offer values Kemper at Dollars 2.7bn
(Pounds 1.77bn) on a fully diluted basis, or Dollars 3.25bn including
Kemper's preference stock.
The bid from Conseco, a fast-growing insurance holding company, based in
Carmel, Indiana, marks a return to financing techniques rarely seen since
the late 1980s. The offer, Dollars 2.2bn of which is in cash, is backed by
junk bond financing, Dollars 1.2bn of bank debt and a private buy-out fund
run by Conseco.
Morgan Stanley, Conseco's adviser, has issued a letter stating it is 'highly
confident' it can raise Dollars 750m of bond finance. Such letters were the
hallmark of Mr Michael Milken, who pioneered the use of sub-investment grade
paper. All the main rating agencies are reviewing Conseco's debt with a view
to downgrading it, a a move likely to put it in the non-investment grade
category.
Mr Jim Parrish, in charge of sub-investment grade ratings at Moody's, said
the Conseco deal marked a return of junk bonds to back acquisitions. Until
now, their re-emergence had been based on refinancings of 1980s deals or to
raise money for companies which previously would have turned to banks.
The Dollars 1.2bn commitment of finance from Citibank is the latest
large-scale bank deal for an acquisition. In another echo of the 1980s, the
bid for Kemper turns on a buy-out fund run by Conseco. Conseco Capital
Partners II, with equity capital of Dollars 624m, will take over Kemper's
insurance and property activities, leaving Conseco with the less
capital-intensive, fee-generating parts.
US buy-out funds were largely left on the sidelines last year as high stock
market prices enabled quoted companies to use their paper to make
acquisitions. Now they are returning. Forstmann Little, a buy-out specialist
that has not mounted a deal since 1992, is involved in a battle for control
of Western Union, a money transfer business. Its Dollars 650m offer would be
backed entirely by the funds it runs, signalling the large resources
available to the US buy-out industry.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Airtours dismisses talk of price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours, the UK's second largest holiday group, yesterday dismissed talk of
a summer price war, saying demand was buoyant and would be 13 per cent up on
last year.
The group announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.6m for the six months to
March 31, compared with Pounds 15.9m last time. The larger loss, in line
with expectations, is the result of the increased size of the group, which
acquired the Hogg Robinson travel agency chain and the Aspro tour operating
company last year.
Holiday companies traditionally incur first-half losses, as full payments
for the peak summer season have not yet come in. Mr David Crossland,
chairman, said the pattern of losses in the first half and profits in the
second would not change substantially because of the group's entry into the
ski market and its purchase of SAS Leisure from Scandinavian Airlines System
in April.
Nevertheless, he said the Scandinavian travel market, where SAS Leisure was
the market leader, was less seasonal than the UK, with four winter
passengers for every six summer holidaymakers. In the UK, the figure is two
winter passengers for six in the summer.
Mr Crossland said he did not believe tour operators would come under
pressure to slash prices as the summer went on. He said there were about 2m
summer holidays unsold in the UK market. Last year, 2.1m holidays were sold
between the beginning of July and the end of the summer.
Airtours' summer bookings were 41 per cent up on last year, of which 29.2
per cent resulted from the Aspro acquisition. The Hogg Robinson and
Pickfords Travel retail chains, now integrated and renamed Going Places, saw
market share rise to 13 per cent from 11.4 per cent.
Mr Crossland said hotel rates in the Canary and Balearic islands had risen
due to improved economic conditions in northern Europe. He said Airtours was
protected from the shortage of hotel rooms on the islands by its ownership
of the Bouganvilla Park hotel in Majorca.
Turnover was up 60 per cent to Pounds 235m. The interim dividend is 1.1p, up
10 per cent on last time. There were losses per share of 14.52p, against
15.27p.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Anglo-Dutch 'perfect merger' shows its faults: Raymond
Snoddy analyses reasons behind the upheaval in Reed Elsevier's marriage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When two world class publishing groups, Reed International of the UK and
Elsevier of the Netherlands, merged last year it looked as if every
eventuality had been considered.
Both sides had been looking for the right partner to aid expansion in the
increasingly international world of publishing. And everyone said that
English and Dutch company law and organisations were so very similar, citing
such historic Anglo-Dutch collaborations as Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell.
The two top men - Mr Peter Davis, chairman of Reed International, and Mr
Pierre Vinken, chairman of Elsevier - could not have been more different: Mr
Davis, the polished public performer, who left school at 17 and became a
marketing specialist and senior executive at the retailer J. Sainsbury; Mr
Vinken, the retiring, almost introverted, but very clever neurosurgeon
turned publisher.
It looked as though the tricky problem of succession - and whether the
British or the Dutch would sit on the top of the mountain - would solve
itself. Mr Davis was then 51 and Mr Vinken 65. The Reed executive would be
chief executive and Mr Vinken would be chairman, and Mr Davis would inherit
the chairmanship when Mr Vinken retired two years later.
Yesterday the mask dropped from the face of the perfect Anglo-Dutch merger
as Mr Davis resigned, moving out of Reed Elsevier's elegant central London
headquarters into a small office of his own around the corner.
There was no talk of him resigning to spend more time with his family or to
pursue other interests. The Reed Elsevier statement gives a true, if rather
lifeless, version of the drama. The board had agreed that if Reed and
Elsevier were really going to think and move as one company, there had to be
a different structure.
The co-chairmen would in future be responsible for strategy, management
development and corporate communications, while two other members of the
executive committee would be responsible for the operating businesses.
According to the agreed statement put out by the company, Mr Davis decided
that the proposed allocation of responsibilities 'did not enable him to play
an effective role suited to his management style'.
A run of meetings started with the intention of persuading Mr Davis to stay.
But by the time an all-night meeting ended at 4.30am on Saturday, terms had
been agreed for his departure. The dispute over structure reflects a
conflict between the Anglo-Saxon model of running a company, with a strong
chief executive, and the more collegiate Dutch style. The dispute was
intensified because Mr Davis was very much a hands-on manager, and because
he lost the right to become chairman.
Mr Ian Irvine, who replaces Mr Davis as co-chairman, emphasised yesterday
that to take the merger forward it was vital 'that everyone is using the
same hymn sheet and all singing the same songs'.
Mr Irvine suggested that the Davis management style - although he was not
happy he had found the right words - was less collaborative, or less
collegiate or perhaps less consensual than the other directors'.
Mr Davis said yesterday: 'The last thing I wanted to do was damage the
company or myself and I was in danger of doing both. I'm sad to be leaving.
It's not what I hoped but I am being realistic. I hope my leaving will
unblock some blockages and that the business can go forward.'
The disputes over structure go back to September when the Dutch pushed for
and got an important change. Mr Davis joined Mr Vinken as co-chairman and
four joint chief executives replaced Mr Davis as sole chief executive. The
British executive considered resigning then, but was persuaded not to by the
British non-executive directors.
The Dutch also pressed for the current structural change, which caused some
internal controversy. Mr Nigel Stapleton, chief financial officer who now
takes on the additional role of deputy chairman of Reed International, was
initially sceptical. Mr Irvine and Sir Christopher Lewinton, of the
engineering group TI, were convinced of the need for the change to protect
the long-term interests of the merged group.
One external observer points to at least one strategic issue dividing the
co-chairmen. Mr Vinken, who could not be reached yesterday for comment, is
believed to be more sceptical than Mr Davis about the speed at which
developments in electronics will transform publishing.
Another issue was Mr Vinken's apparent reluctance to retire according to the
original plan. It has, however, been agreed that Mr Vinken will retire as
co-chairman of Reed Elsevier in April 1995, to be succeeded by Mr Herman
Bruggink who will also take over as chairman of the executive board of
Elsevier. Mr Vinken is expected to become chairman of the supervisory board
of Elsevier and a non-executive director of Reed Elsevier.
Unions at Reed Elsevier believe the elevation of Mr Irvine and the arrival
of Mr John Mellon, chief executive of Reed Publishing Europe, on the
executive committee is a victory for 'the hawks' in industrial relations
over the more conciliatory Mr Davis.
Mr Irvine said the departure of Mr Davis was probably for the best when it
became impossible to reach agreement. Mr Davis, who has sold none of his
Reed Elsevier shares nor exercised any of his options, might well agree
that, once the arguments became personalised, it would be easier to run the
company without him.
It was stressed yesterday that Reed Elsevier, which has sales in excess of
Pounds 2.7bn and 25,700 employees, was trading well and that interim results
due on August 11 would show 'a performance in line with budget and usefully
ahead of last year'.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Cable &amp; Wireless seeks to grow with US alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, is in talks with US
telecoms companies about an alliance.
Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, said a 'further interest in the United States' was
essential to the group's strategy of standing apart from international
alliances between large operators.
C&amp;W's US negotiations are aimed at boosting its US subsidiary, CWI, which
supplies long-distance services to small and medium-sized companies. CWI's
turnover of Pounds 383m last year made it one of the larger 'second
division' long-distance US carriers after AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint.
Lord Young said the seven local Bell telecoms companies were particularly
attractive to C&amp;W. They are seeking partners to break into the US
long-distance market when regulations are changed to allow this.
'They are the sort of people who have direct access to companies,' he said,
but did not rule out acquisitions of smaller operators. C&amp;W has links with
Bell operators in its non-US businesses - notably with US West, the regional
Bell operator covering 14 mid-western states, in One-2-One, a UK cellular
mobile network.
Speaking on the eve of C&amp;W's annual general meeting, Lord Young said the
company's strategy remained 'totally viable' even if Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's
largest concern, joins AT&amp;T's Worldsource venture which aims to supply
one-stop services to multinationals. It emerged last week that Hongkong
Telecom was in talks with AT&amp;T.
Lord Young claimed that C&amp;W was in a 'totally different market' from the
alliances formed in the past year by AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint with European
operators including BT, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
He said C&amp;W's target was small and medium-sized trans-national companies.
'The other alliances are geared to only 1,000 multinationals worldwide,
which we are not interested in,' he said.
Lord Young confirmed C&amp;W was in talks about consortia to launch second
operators to the national monopolies in the larger countries on mainland
Europe.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Reed Elsevier chief quits over policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Davis, one of the leading executives in the international
publishing industry, yesterday resigned unexpectedly as co-chairman of Reed
Elsevier.
The Anglo-Dutch information group said Mr Davis, who had been a leading
figure in merging Reed International of the UK and Elsevier of the
Netherlands in January 1993, had resigned in a dispute over the group's
future management structure.
The executive committee which runs the merged company - Reed and Elsevier
keep separate listings on the UK and Netherlands stock markets  - decided
that in future the co-chairmen should be responsible for strategy,
management development and corporate communications.
Two members of the committee will be responsible for the operating
businesses, which range from consumer magazines and newspapers to business
and academic publications.
The company said that although there was full agreement within the board on
strategy, Mr Davis had resigned because the new allocation of
responsibilities would not enable him 'to play an effective role suited to
his management style'.
The City took a relaxed view of Mr Davis's departure mainly because of the
assurance that the group's interim results - due in August - were on budget
and would be 'usefully ahead of last year'.
Reed International's shares initially shed 50p on the news but recovered to
close at 741p, down 9p on the day. In Amsterdam, Elsevier's shares closed Fl
1.8 lower at Fl 150.2, having dipped to Fl 145 at one stage.
Mr Davis said yesterday: 'I have given a lot to Reed so the decision was not
taken lightly. I have been so involved in turning Reed from a conglomerate
to a major publishing company and putting the two businesses (Reed and
Elsevier) together. The business has done well and is doing well.'
One City analyst said: 'They have lost a charismatic leader, but perhaps the
game has changed.' Businesses such as IPC, the magazine division, and Reed
Regional, which runs local newspapers, may be too cyclical and
consumer-oriented for the group, he said.
Mr Irvine emphasised that it was business as normal, and the company would
soon begin looking at two large potential acquisitions, the database
interests of the Mead Corporation and Ziff Communications, although Reed
Elsevier would not try to buy both.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Directors' pay rises 67% at stockbroker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Payments to directors at stockbrokers Smith New Court rose more than
two-thirds in the year to April 1994, from Pounds 10m to Pounds 16.7m. The
firm had earlier reported pre-tax profits for the year more than doubled to
Pounds 95.2m, from Pounds 38.7m.
Overall the size of the board expanded to 35 from 29, and a fifth of those -
seven directors - earned more than Pounds 500,000 in total remuneration last
year. A further 14 directors earned between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds
500,000.
The highest paid director, who was not named in the annual report released
yesterday, earned a total package of Pounds 1.28m, of which Pounds 750,000
was a performance-related bonus. The chairman, Sir Michael Richardson,
earned a more modest Pounds 141,000, the same sum as in the previous year
and, as in 1992-93, earned no profit-related pay or pension contributions.
Sir Michael is also an executive vice chairman at merchant bank NM
Rothschild and Sons. He is also a non-executive director of a number of
other companies including Sedgewick Group and the Savoy Hotel and is
chairman of five quoted investment trusts.
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, had earlier said a portion of the bonuses
would be paid in the form of Smith New Court shares. The report does not
disclose how much of the bonus was in the form of shares although it does
show that share options for some directors have increased sharply over the
preceding year.
Mr Marks, for instance, is now the holder of 557,390 'fully paid' share
options, while a year ago, he held 73,134 share options but was granted
additional options following a rights issue last May.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Unilever hit by new allegations in its soap war with Procter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch detergent giant, faced potentially damaging
allegations from across Europe over its revolutionary new soap powder
yesterday, as the soap war with US rival Procter &amp; Gamble appeared to tilt
in Procter's favour.
The Unilever powder, known as Persil Power and Omo Power, has been attacked
by Procter as harming clothes.
In separate developments yesterday:
Unilever refused to comment on allegations in the Dutch weekend press that
Unilever management had ignored advice from its own researchers that the
product should only be used at low temperatures.
Henkel, the German detergents giant, which owns the Persil brand name in
Europe outside the UK and France, said its tests had confirmed Procter's
claims of damage to clothes.
The UK Consumers Association attacked Unilever for launching a modified
version of the powder this week, which is being sold alongside the original
version without distinguishing between the two.
Unilever said it had 'no reaction' to an article in Saturday's edition of
the Dutch daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad, claiming that the row over the
new powder resulted from a 'lack of communication' between Unilever's
research and marketing departments. However, an adviser to Unilever
dismissed the allegation as untrue. 'This is uninformed gossip from junior
research people,' he said.
The Austrian subsidiary of Henkel claimed yesterday that tests carried out
by itself and an independent research institute had confirmed that Omo Power
damaged cotton textiles after 12 washes, with particular damage after 25
washes. Henkel has been at pains to point out that its powder has no
connection with the Unilever version.
In the UK, the assistant director of the Consumers Association, Mr Derek
Prentice, criticised Unilever's failure to distinguish between its new
'rebalanced' version of the powder and the original version. Unilever said
there was no reason to make a distinction as it stood by the original
product.
In Switzerland, the new version carries a recommendation that it should not
be used on dark colours or lightly soiled clothes. According to Procter, it
also contains only 10 per cent as much of the allegedly damaging manganese
catalyst, though Unilever yesterday denied the reduction was so large.
Unilever executives in London reaffirmed their commitment to the new powder,
which they said had enabled them to overtake Procter in the UK detergents
market in the space of six weeks from launch. Mr Andrew Seth, chief
executive of UK detergents, said the new catalyst would be introduced into
other Unilever detergent brands, such as Surf and Radion, in a matter of
weeks.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Fears ease of slide in dollar: Central banks hold back from
renewed intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar showed a slight improvement in US trading yesterday, after
dropping below the key level of Y100 in Tokyo and London.
The firming trend, which came without a repeat of Friday's concerted central
bank intervention, triggered a late rally on Wall Street.
In Tokyo, where the dollar fell to a new postwar low of Y99.50, analysts
estimate the Bank of Japan bought between Dollars 750m (Pounds 493m) and
Dollars 1bn supporting the US currency. One factor behind the dollar's
weakness was the collapse of Japan's Hata administration, which raised fears
that a deal in the long-running US-Japan trade talks was now less likely.
In European trading, there was an atmosphere of 'phoney war' as markets
waited for central bank intervention that never came. Analysts said the
central banks had been chastened by the failure of their efforts last week.
However, fears of a dollar collapse proved unfounded and the US currency
managed to rally above Y100 during the European morning session.
By the London close, the dollar was back down to Y99.865, but later improved
in New York. Late in the session, it was trading at Y100.43. Against the
D-Mark it was quoted at DM1.5835, more than a pfennig below the level at
which Friday's intervention commenced. In Tokyo it opened today at Y100.4.
The dollar's weakness yesterday in Tokyo caused most European stock and bond
markets to open lower, but they rallied later as the US currency held fairly
steady. Analysts said the markets were pausing for breath after taking a
battering on Friday.
The FT-SE 100 Index opened 31.9 points lower at 2,844.7 but steadily rallied
to close at 2,899.9, up 23.3. Gilts were particularly strong, with the
September long gilt future rising 1 1/2 points on rumours of a US hedge fund
buyer and on hopes that the Treasury would today lower its forecast for the
1994-95 public sector borrowing requirement.
German bonds rallied in afternoon trading to close with gains of around 0.4
of a point, and in Frankfurt the Dax index, having closed 16.71 points lower
at 1,988.60, rebounded in after-hours trading to 2,000.48.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 48.56 points higher
at 3,685.50, as fears eased over an early move by the Federal Reserve to
support the dollar with higher US interest rates. The yield on the key
30-year long bond retreated below the 7.50 per cent mark as prices climbed
3/4 of a point.
Earlier Asian equity markets were knocked back by the dollar's weakness. In
Tokyo, the Nikkei average fell 2.2 per cent or 465.79 to 20,300.96, while in
Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 233.52 points to 8,647.48. In
Australia, the Sydney stock market suffered its biggest one-day fall for
nearly three years.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Coffee price soars after Brazil frost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures prices soared by nearly 40 per cent to a 7 1/2 -year high in
London yesterday following reports that frost and cold winds had damaged
about a quarter of the coffee trees in Brazil, the world's largest producer.
Manufacturers warned that consumers faced further price rises in the autumn
if the surge in the coffee market, up 140 per cent so far this year,
continued.
'This current situation of prices going up and up and up cannot prevail for
ever without us having to consider when we pass that on to the consumer,'
said Mr Mick Casey of Nestle.
The price of Nescafe, which has 40 per cent of the UK instant coffee market,
rose 12 1/2 per cent in January, its first increase in four years, but
consumption was not affected, Mr Casey said. 'The price of green beans takes
four to five months to filter through to supermarket prices,' he added.
The weekend frost damage in Brazil, coupled with forecasts of more to come,
sent London robusta futures prices into one of their biggest single-day
rises. The contract for coffee for delivery in September rose to a peak of
Dollars 3,150 a tonne, up 39.7 per cent on Friday's close.
The cold snap, which comes at the start of a six-week period when Brazilian
crops are vulnerable to frost, gave fresh impetus to a bullish market.
Prices have been lifted from last year's low of about Dollars 800 a tonne by
a producers' agreement to withhold exports, which has coincided with a
shortage of coffee supplies and falling consumer stocks.
Yesterday's gains were trimmed by profit-taking, but the contract still
ended Dollars 593 higher at Dollars 2,848 a tonne. The surge was mirrored in
arabica coffee futures in New York where the September contract closed up
33.5 cents a pound at 161.6 cents a pound.
Most of the frost damage was in the Brazil's southern state of Parana, where
up to 70 per cent of coffee trees were affected.

FT  28 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Airtours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be tempting to argue that Airtours deserves a premium rating. The
tour operator boasts an impressive trading history, with its chairman, Mr
David Crossland, showing a commendable obsession with delivering on
seemingly extravagant promises. There still seems plenty of growth to go for
in the travel business, with Airtours' latest expansion into Scandinavia
holding out promise. Moreover, Airtours has been among the best-performing
stocks of recent times; its market value has leapt from Pounds 18m to Pounds
555m in less than four years.
Yet, by themselves, Airtours' interim results do little to bolster the case
for such a rerating. The inherent seasonality of the travel business and the
flurry of recent acquisitions complicate the task of making any meaningful
assessment of the company's financial health at the halfway stage.
Everything must be taken on trust. Even then, it must always be doubted
whether the earnings stream produced by a tour operator should be rated as
highly as those on offer elsewhere. Airtours may have done a good job in
countering the inherent volatility of the holiday business. It is also
persuasive in suggesting that the perennial fears of price wars are much
overdone. But that cannot be guaranteed with Owners Abroad remaining an
industry wild card. The last resort of a struggling holiday company is
price.

All the regional electricity companies now have a clear idea of what Mr
Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, has in mind for the forthcoming
review of distribution prices. It is therefore difficult to interpret
Norweb's continued assertion that it can deliver 6-8 per cent real dividend
growth through to the end of the decade. The obvious conclusion is that the
regulatory line has softened since the spring, when most profits forecasts
were scaled back.
It would be rash to push this argument too far. By promising that one-fifth
of its earnings will come from unregulated business by the end of the
decade, Norweb has shown touching faith in its ability to make money in
areas such as retailing. Neither has the company said how fast dividend
cover will be run down to keep the pay-out racing ahead. Seeboard was
notably less gung-ho about the prospects yesterday.
Even allowing for healthy scepticism about the prospects outside the
regulated business, though, most Recs look well placed to cope with tougher
price controls. Seeboard has promised to cut 250 jobs a year for the next
three years, even though it is among the most efficient in the sector. The
scope for cost savings at the least efficient companies can only be guessed
at. A one-off 20 per cent cut in distribution prices of the type mooted in
April would still hurt. But having underperformed a falling stock market by
almost 10 per cent since then, the bad news may now be in the price.

<TEXT>
The US equity market started the new week in much better mood than it
finished the old. Yesterday's rally must still be taken with a pinch of
salt, though. The prospect of strong earnings growth and continued inflows
from mutual funds - albeit at a markedly slower rate than last year - have
lent the market support this year despite tighter money at the Federal
Reserve. The dollar's weakness could yet undermine both props, leaving Wall
Street prey to the kind of liquidity crunch which has affected other markets
since February.
While some of the heat was off the currency yesterday, it is vulnerable to
speculative attack as long as intervention is not backed up by moves in
interest rates. The snag is that higher rates could slow the recovery to the
point where earnings growth is threatened. A trailing multiple of around 20
times leaves little room for disappointment on that score - witness the
sharp reaction to the recent crop of profits warnings, particularly in the
technology sector. Equities could see some sharp falls if mutual fund
investors then actually started selling.
The more difficult question is how far other equity markets are at risk. A
slide on Wall Street could prove the catalyst for serious selling elsewhere.
But other equity markets have mostly been reacting to movements in bonds.
The chances are that a rise in short term US rates large enough to stabilise
the dollar would prove a tonic for the bond market because it would also
calm inflation fears. Even after last week's slide, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average has fallen by a little under 3 per cent this year, significantly
less than the main European equity markets. It has some catching up to do.

FT  28 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Reshuffle at Reed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was perhaps a backhanded compliment to the transformation that Mr Peter
Davis has wrought at Reed International over the past eight years that the
market reacted with such equanimity to his departure. Had Mr Davis quit in
similar circumstances while Reed was still a sprawling conglomerate, then
the company's shares would have been devastated. But such is the presumed
solidity of the merged Reed Elsevier publishing empire, which Mr Davis was
so instrumental in creating, that the market barely blinked. As the initial
shock wore off, Reed's shares recovered sharply.
Reassurances that there was nothing awry at the trading level clearly
helped. Besides, the company is in a strong financial position. Shareholders
can draw comfort from the collective leadership which is in place at Reed
Elsevier. There is little reason to believe that the board will go wild on
the acquisition front as it sizes up Ziff and Mead.
That said, the loss of Mr Davis is undoubtedly a blow. It had seemed that
Reed Elsevier was doing well in avoiding the political pitfalls that have
bedevilled so many international mergers. The differences at Reed may indeed
have been personal rather than cultural. Mr Davis was certainly not famed
for sitting on his hands. But it is a pity that Reed's complement of
heavyweight non-executive directors could not have helped defuse such
tensions. Shareholders may yet regret the departure of an executive with
strategic vision given the speed of change in the media world and the need
for bold thinking.

Whatever one thinks about the wisdom of Railtrack's dispute with the
country's signalmen, the presentation of its case has been pretty abysmal.
What has been on offer seems to have been chopped and changed at short
notice and Railtrack's explanation of its position has been mind-bogglingly
complex.
It's all the more surprising because Railtrack chairman Bob Horton can be a
pretty forceful communicator himself and had even hired a former Labour
party spin-doctor, Lesley Smith, to be his head of government and public
affairs. If anyone knew how to defuse the opposition, it should have been a
professional like Smith. Indeed, one wonders whether her heart is really in
the job.

How times change. There was a time when Britain's company chairmen and
politicians timed their fact-finding missions to South Africa to escape
Britain's bitter winters.
However, Board of Trade president Michael Heseltine has chosen to forego the
delights of Britain's summer season and spend the week after next in South
Africa. Westminster-watchers believe that this could mean one of two things.
Either the long-rumoured cabinet reshuffle won't take place during that week
or the Prezza has persuaded his boss not to make him take over Sir Norman
Fowler's glorified pr job as Conservative party chairman.
They could be right on both scores. After John Major's strong showing
yesterday, Observer's bet is that the reshuffle will be delayed until just
before the House of Commons breaks up for its summer hols.

Star of the show at Nigeria's constitutional conference just opened in Abuja
was former transport minister Umaru Dikko on his return from exile.
The last time he made such a splash was a decade ago when the Nigerians
attempted to smuggle him back from Britain after Nigeria's ruling generals
had accused him of stealing public money.
He had been kidnapped and was en route to his country of origin when British
Customs uncovered the plot. 'I want to thank the government and people of
Britain for everything they did for me,' Dikko said yesterday.
Not surprising, really; they saved him from a crate worse than death.

First Zulema, now Susana; this new wave of democracy in Latin America has
clearly taken firm hold. Zulema Menem, whose estrangement from husband
Carlos - Argentina's president - has gripped Buenos Aires' media for years,
might be advised to join forces with Peru's first lady, Susana Higuchi.
La Higuchi has criticised her husband, president Alberto Fujimori, for
having an authoritarian manner and neglecting Peru's poor. She gives him
high marks for tackling two big problems - terrorism and inflation  - but
says he accentuates the positive while she sees 'millions of people living
in absolute misery'.
Both Menem and Fujimori are likely to stand for re-election in 1995. Never
mind trade agreements - Zulema and Susana should be getting on the phone to
Hillary Clinton to evolve a co-ordinated pan-American plan to lay siege to
various presidencies.

One World Cup spin-off sales promotion which is unlikely to be repeated is
Heineken's competition to collect bottle tops of its Amstel beer.
The idea was that beer drinkers who collected bottle-tops carrying the flags
of all 24 football participants won a book on the World Cup. Unfortunately,
one of the contestants was that well-known country of teetotallers - Saudi
Arabia.
Popping the Saudi flag on top of a bottle of beer might not damage
Heineken's Middle Eastern beer sales but it caused such a diplomatic stir
that Heineken was summoned to the Saudi embassy in The Hague, and forced to
take out ads in two Dutch newspapers, apologising for the insult.
Indeed, it seemed at one stage that the company might even have to recall
several million bottles of the offending ale.

The spectre of another election defeat has returned to haunt Chris Patten,
Hong Kong's governor who, as Tory party chairman, oversaw the Conservatives'
fourth general election victory in 1992 only to lose his own seat, Bath, in
the process.
Tomorrow, Patten's plans for the development of democracy in Hong Kong come
before the colony's Legislative Council. There he faces concerted opposition
from the Liberal party, a grouping of mainly appointed conservative
politicians, who want to water down his plans in a way they hope China will
like. And guess who is the special adviser helping them with electioneering
techniques and campaign organisation?
Step forward Marian Elsden, a former chair of western counties' Liberal
Democrats. In the run-up to the 1992 election, she was intimately involved
in devising the campaign which ruined Patten's chances of taking higher
office in the UK.

FT  28 JUN 94 / A Real test of commitment: Will political imperatives
overcome economic reality in Brazil's fight against inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's football stars get the glory, but the nation's housewives are the
real heroes. As well as coping with an inflation rate of almost 50 per cent
a month, on Friday they face the introduction of Brazil's fifth new currency
since 1986, the Real. Supermarket shelves are covered in a confusing array
of old and new prices beside signs announcing that certain products have
been withdrawn by the stores because suppliers have tried to force up prices
ahead of the currency switch.
The Real is the final step in a programme the government launched last
December in an attempt to catch up with other Latin American countries which
have successfully tackled high inflation. The programme was originally
welcomed by economists since it addressed the perceived causes of Brazil's
inflation - most importantly, it set balancing the government's budget as a
high priority.
The plan's weakness is political. In October, Brazil holds presidential and
congressional elections, encouraging politicians to push for more spending
rather than a balanced budget. Moreover, its main helmsman, Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, resigned as finance minister in March to run for
president. That has left the initiatives open to criticism that they are
designed to engineer a steep, but temporary, fall in inflation before the
elections.
Mr Cardoso's advisers admit he has little chance of catching the front
runner, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, unless inflation falls
sharply. Although most observers think inflation will drop, there are doubts
about how long it will stay low - and also about Mr Cardoso's chances of
closing the gap with his rival. 'There may not be enough time left for
people to realise the Real's advantages and that their increased purchasing
power (caused by lower inflation) will last,' according to Mr Alexandre
Barros, a political consultant.
Mr Cardoso and the government hope two features of the new currency will
help curb inflation. First, it will be set at parity to the US dollar for an
'undetermined' time, probably until the elections. The Real's value will be
defended using Brazil's accumulated reserves of nearly Dollars 40bn. Second,
the central bank will set tough limits on money supply until the end of
March 1995. In the past, the government has resorted to printing money to
pay its debts, thereby fuelling inflation.
'The exchange rate anchor brings inflation down fast, and then the monetary
anchor starts operating through strict rules on expanding the monetary
base,' according to Mr Winston Fritsch, Brazil's economic policy secretary.
The government has also recalculated public sector wages and most contracts
into the new currency before its introduction, so any inflationary impact
should be absorbed before the Real comes into circulation. This should
further reduce price pressures, and most economists expect inflation to drop
to 3-4 per cent a month by August.
Brazil's anti-inflation programmes have led to sharp falls in inflation
before. But each time, prices have started to accelerate because of flaws in
the plans or through political pressures. This time the main worry is that
the government, lacking support in Congress ahead of the elections, has had
to compromise parts of the programme to make its implementation more
feasible.
It has adopted a temporary link with the dollar, instead of a permanent tie
as used in Argentina's successful price stabilisation initiative in 1991.
Nor has the government removed exchange controls to allow full
convertibility of the Real. 'Convertibility is not an attribute you can
impose on a weak economy. We would like to move more carefully,' says Mr
Pedro Malan, president of the central bank.
One reason why the government may have decided to retain exchange controls
is that it fears the continuing popularity of Mr da Silva may persuade many
Brazilians, who are worried about his radical policies in areas such as land
reform, to switch their Reals into dollars, thus undermining the new
currency.
Another area in which the government risks compromising its anti-inflation
programme is in its control of the money supply. There is growing pressure
for increases in the minimum wage and military pay, which would threaten
this year's forecast balanced budget. Further ahead, observers believe
inflation will not be beaten without constitutional changes to reduce the
government's spending obligations, particularly on welfare. An attempt to
make the necessary constitutional amendments failed in Congress earlier this
year.
The chief political worry is that the plan's fortunes are too closely linked
to those of Mr Cardoso. Mr Fritsch talks of a 'virtuous circle': if the Real
works, it lifts Mr Cardoso's chances of becoming president and maintaining
the anti-inflation fight next year, along with other economic reforms such
as privatisation. 'But if the programme is not seen as a success, that
affects inflation and the opinion polls. In that scenario, we hope we can
muddle through,' he says.
Opinion polls suggest Mr Cardoso has the support of about 20 per cent of
voters compared with 40 per cent for Mr da Silva. This big difference is
slightly misleading. Under Brazilian election rules, unless one candidate
wins more votes than all the others combined, the presidential contest will
go into a second round in November, between the two candidates with the
highest number of votes. At this stage, Mr da Silva looks unlikely to win
outright in the first round.
In a second contest, Mr Cardoso could provide a strong challenge, especially
since voters will have had longer to benefit from the Real. If inflation
stays low, those Brazilians who are not protected against inflation - mainly
the poor - could see a considerable improvement in their living standards.
Salaries, currently undermined by a daily inflation rate of 1.9 per cent,
would retain their purchasing power through the month.
Possibly Mr Cardoso's greatest difficulty in his presidential campaign is
cynicism among voters, who have seen many previous anti-inflation attempts
fail. 'It's very hard to deal with this legacy of failed attempts. It's like
the eighth marriage of Liz Taylor - if the others have foundered, why should
this one succeed?' asks Mr Malan.
An opinion poll earlier this month found that more than half those
questioned would not change their voting intentions if inflation fell
sharply following the Real's introduction. The findings worried Mr Cardoso's
advisers, who suspect that some poorly educated voters will not realise the
part he has played in introducing the new currency.
But it is more likely that Brazil's electorate, with memories of the
downfall of the now disgraced former president Mr Fernando Collor amid
corruption charges, is no longer as easily fooled by campaign promises.
Opinion polls suggest Mr da Silva, who narrowly lost to Mr Collor in 1989,
is gaining support because he is a prominent national figure. In contrast,
Mr Cardoso, a former academic, is not well known outside political circles
and may appear as yet another newcomer making breakable promises.
Mr da Silva's position on the Real is ambiguous. When the programme was
announced, he and his Workers Party (PT) were critical, pointing out that
inflation had nearly doubled during Mr Cardoso's 11 months in office to
almost 35 per cent a month. Recently, the PT has stopped its attacks and is
waiting to see how well the new currency works.
But as the elections approach, Mr da Silva will have to decide whether to
support the anti-inflation fight and the new currency, even though it is the
main plank of his opponent's platform.
If he decides against backing the programme, Mr da Silva could perhaps
announce that his incoming government will scrap parity with the US dollar
or pledge to raise the minimum wage. Assuming Mr da Silva retains his
opinion poll lead, such an announcement would put pressure on exchange and
interest rates, as markets reacted to the prospect of higher government
borrowing.
Mr Eduardo Gianetti da Fonseca, a Sao Paulo-based economist, suspects Mr da
Silva will remain on a moderate path. 'If he continues to show a commitment
to compromise there won't be panicking on a grand scale. But if he
radicalises, then anything is possible,' he says.
Given the political uncertainty few believe an end to inflation is yet in
sight in Brazil. The Real's achievements may lie in keeping the economy free
of hyper-inflation until the elections - possibly allowing for a fresh price
control offensive by the next government. Brazil's housewives might be
learning to use another currency by the time the next World Cup comes
around.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The fog still shrouding Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If proof were needed that the realignment of Japan's political system has
only just begun, it has been abundantly available in recent days. A popular
and capable prime minister has resigned for lack of support in a fractious
parliament. Politicians widely reviled for their remoteness from the
concerns of ordinary voters conspire in smoke-filled rooms. The country is
left leaderless as the yen rises to levels that threaten a sputtering
economic recovery.
More embarrassing still, it looks as if this sorry picture will again be on
international display in 10 days' time, when Japan fields a lame-duck prime
minister at a Group of Seven summit for the second year in a row. What are
Tokyo's international partners to make of all this?
At one level, the latest twist in Japanese politics should not be of
enormous consequence to the world at large. Japan's western trading partners
have long been used to dealing with a changing succession of political
leaders, while recognising that the real power lies elsewhere in the 'iron
triangle' of government, bureaucracy and business. Even the US
administration, with its demands for deregulation and market opening,
appears to have realised that there is little it can do to advance its
agenda while a vacuum persists in Tokyo. In the meantime, the markets
maintain their own form of pressure by bidding up the yen against the
weakening dollar - itself in part an acknowledgement that no government
under current conditions is likely to be able to do much about Japan's trade
and current account surpluses.
Impasse
There is a place for concern, however, at the current impasse - and that is
in Japan itself. For the fate of Mr Tsutomu Hata, whose government fell last
Saturday after just 59 days in office, underlines just how unstable and
incapable of action the entire political system has become. The order that
governed Japan for decades after world war two - dominated by the Liberal
Democratic party - has collapsed, but a new order is not yet in sight.
Instead, small and scarcely distinguishable political fragments from the old
LDP and the traditional opposition, the Social Democrats, manoeuvre
ceaselessly before an increasingly disenchanted public, sometimes splitting,
sometimes fusing to form short-lived coalitions. It is a process that, left
to itself, could continue for months or even years before finally coming to
rest in the form of a stable two- or three-party system.
The problem is that Japan cannot afford to continue on political auto-pilot
for this long. There are too many pressing issues that, in Japan's own
interests, require speedy, effective and consistent government action.
Stymied
Tax reform is one area where action has been frequently promised but stymied
by government divisions in recent months. Another is the much-touted and
badly-needed plan to deregulate the economy, which would have the added
advantage of answering one of the US's current concerns. Yet a third is the
slow-fuse crisis over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. This is a
matter crucial to Japan's security. Yet right up to last Saturday, Mr Hata
was mired in discussions with the Social Democratic party, which was
demanding that he water down plans for sanctions against Pyongyang in return
for joining his coalition.
The most regrettable feature of the current situation is that it is
seriously out of kilter with what the voters themselves seem to want. A year
ago, they voted out the LDP in favour of a coalition committed to creating a
new, more representative electoral system. This the government of Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa eventually produced: a system that should enable
politicians to be chosen more on their policies than on their ability to
pass favours to constituents.
What Japan needs is elections under that system - which should be possible
once new constituency boundaries are in place this autumn. When they come,
the clear-out of the old guard on all sides may well accelerate. In the
meantime, Japan will probably have to settle for another fragile caretaker
government and more muddling through.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Beyond the Corfu thunder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The weekend thunder and lightning on Corfu cast European Union
decision-making in a malevolent light. Yet the storm over the choice of the
next European Commission president could not totally obscure the progress
made at the EU summit in other areas. The responsibility for resolving the
impasse over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors now passes to Germany,
which takes over the EU presidency from July 1. Time to reach accord before
the leaders re-convene in Brussels on July 15 is short, but if the Bonn
government can find the skill to rally support from all 12 capitals behind
an appropriate candidate, the EU could even emerge strengthened from its
midsummer squall.
For all the chaos over the presidential selection, the EU showed at the
weekend that it can maintain momentum on important issues. The summit took a
significant step forward on liberalising telecommunications, now widely seen
as a key to EU competitiveness in the emerging 'information society'.
Overriding opposition from the EU's telecommunications monopolies, the
meeting opened the way to early competition in the supply of infrastructure
as well as services, allowing new operators to build their own networks. An
Anglo-German initiative to try to weed out obstacles to competitiveness was
approved.
The summit also agreed to give priority to 11 trans-European transport
projects, overcoming differences on financing. The German-sponsored
agreement on involving the European parliament in the preparations for the
1996 Maastricht review conference was also welcome. On enlargement, the EU
now has the outlines of a route map - although nothing resembling a driving
schedule - for widening the Union to the north and east.
Clinching agreement
This record of accomplishment will, however, weigh lightly unless the EU
finds a suitable personality to lead it through the challenges of the rest
of the 1990s. Despite the pressures of the timetable, there are three
reasons why the EU can be reasonably confident of clinching agreement on a
successor to Mr Delors during the next 2 1/2 weeks.
First, the German government will channel much more diplomatic energy into
engineering a deal than that employed by the current holder of the EU
presidency, Greece, under its ailing prime minister. The Bonn government is
a long way from admitting that it was mistaken in trying to push through
with France the candidacy of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl
yesterday gave a welcome signal of flexibility by hinting he would now drop
support for the Belgian premier.
UK self-restraint
Second, the British government, having had its way on a point of principle
and substance, can now show a modicum of self-restraint. There must be no
question of Mr John Major employing a second veto. The true test of Mr
Major's mettle will be his readiness to engage in a constructive search for
a solution - even at the risk of Eurosceptic hostility from his own party -
to achieve an agreement on July 15.
Third, even after excluding the candidates courting support at Corfu, there
is no shortage of suitable contenders. Mr Renato Ruggiero, the former
Italian trade minister, and Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the former Danish
foreign minister, would both command wide support. The apparent elimination
of two serving heads of government, Mr Dehaene and Mr Ruud Lubbers of the
Netherlands, is far from an ill omen. It is worth remembering that of the
European Commission's eight presidents so far, only one, the unsuccessful Mr
Gaston Thorn from Luxembourg, was an ex-prime minister.
At a time of recession and post-cold war upheaval, the EU's failure to reach
agreement on its leadership is regrettable, but it is neither a disaster nor
even a surprise. If the weekend confusion increases EU governments'
readiness to correct the shortcomings of the present selection procedures,
then the debacle may even turn out to have positive consequences. Equally,
when they were not squabbling over Mr Delors' succession, EU leaders showed
at Corfu they have an agenda to make Europe stronger, more efficient and
more cohesive. The next president of the European Commission should make
sure they stick to it.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Dark days at the races: The future is an each-way bet at
east Germany's largest race track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If only the Marx Brothers had immortalised Hoppegarten, east Germany's
largest race course, its fame might have guaranteed its future. Instead, the
legacy of Karl Marx is causing headaches for the managers of this
old-fashioned site, redolent of a grander age and less than a 30-minute
train ride east of Berlin.
The race course, which boasts a hurdles, flat and steeplechase track, as
well as stables for 450 horses spread over 1,100 acres is trying to find a
new lease of life in a unified Germany. As it shakes off its communist past,
it is also trying to regain the glory it enjoyed when it was set up in 1866.
Like most former state-owned properties, Hoppegarten was placed under the
Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising east Germany's factories and
shops, land, forests and sports facilities, after unification in 1990. Mr
Artur Boehlke, Hoppegarten's 56-year-old manager, is determined that the
agency will not sell the race track for industrial development.
'We have lost much time since the course was placed under communist control
back in the early 1950s,' he said, sitting in an office decked with
photographs of horses, race meetings and celebrities. 'The managers and
Treuhand are now trying to revive the course's pre-war reputation.'
Until the second world war, Hoppegarten and its race horses had been
honoured by visits from Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, the Aga Khan and
others. The meetings were important social events backed by money from the
Union Club, a select group of aristocrats which owned vast tracts of land
stretching across Prussia, and which bought the course in 1874. This state
of affairs persisted until the east German communists were installed in
power in 1949.
'Racing was no longer exciting under the communists,' said Mr Boehlke.
'There was no chance for private stables or trainers. The state ran
everything, including Hoppegarten.
'I well remember those days,' he added. 'Of course, the races continued to
be held. But the international meetings, such as they were, only involved
the other socialist countries. There was one international meeting a year.
The Russians usually won. Somehow, their horses were faster than ours . . .'
There was little scope for betting. 'You chose a horse, handed in a ticket
and waited ages to get your money if you happened to win,' Mr Boehlke said.
After German unification in 1990, east and west Berliners started returning
to Hoppegarten to attend its 18 annual meetings. By late that year, the
course had been placed under the Treuhand, which is still looking for an
owner. The agency has subsidised the course by about DM1.2m (Pounds 480,000)
a year since then, but the track still has annual losses of DM500,000 to
DM1m.
The Union Club has tried unsuccessfully to get its property back from the
government. As the former owner of land expropriated by the Soviet
authorities, which governed east Germany between 1945 and 1949, it has no
legal right either to restitution or compensation.
The club, which has about 200 members, consists of bankers and prominent
sportsmen as well as landowners. Many members believe that even if they
cannot buy the race course outright from the Treuhand, they will be able to
obtain a long lease on it.
Mr Evert Von Ungern zu Sternberg, 72, a prominent member of the Union Club,
reckons it will be successful. 'If we cannot reclaim the Hoppegarten, we
told the Treuhand that we are prepared to lease it, to invest DM30m over the
next 10 years, and build another 450 stables.'
Mr Von Ungern zu Sternberg, who was born in Estonia, fought on Germany's
side during the second world war, moved to south America after 1945, and
settled back in Germany after 1972, says the race course could be an
instrument through which the club could regain its once-elevated status in a
united Germany.
The future of the course could be decided this week when the Treuhand meets
representatives from the state of Brandenburg, where Hoppegarten is located.
They could set up a Stiftung, or foundation, which could become the new
owner of the course. The Stiftung would then lease the course to the Union
Club. 'This solution means that the Hoppegarten will remain as a race
course. But the Treuhand is insisting that the Union Club must make those
investments, and find ways to get back into the black,' said Mr Wolfgang
Horstmann, the Treuhand's director responsible for privatising land in east
Germany.
Mr Boehlke is looking forward to the time when the Hoppegarten's future will
be more secure. 'Once we really get off the ground, we'll put the other race
courses in west Germany to shame, and we'll be great once again. A day at
the races will really mean something.' Now that is a finale the Marx
Brothers would have really enjoyed. . . .

FT  28 JUN 94 / No, no, no, no way out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is too easy to deride Mr John Major for his performance at Corfu. The
British prime minister found himself in a minority of one out of 12 members
of the European Union, just like his predecessor at earlier summits. He
handbagged the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene to the presidency of the
European Commission, precisely as she might have done. It is said, with
disdain, that Mr Major's motives were self-serving. Sure they were. Worse,
it is claimed that he sought approving headlines in the ever-cheaper
Conservative newspapers published by Mr Conrad Black and Mr Rupert Murdoch.
Anyone in his position would be tempted to do that, although not all would
succumb. It is asserted that his principal aim was the preservation of his
leadership of an increasingly Eurosceptical Conservative party. Of course it
was.
Yet the prime minister had a defensible diplomatic objective. As we all
know, Mr Dehaene was the candidate thrust upon Europe by Mr Helmut Kohl and
Mr Francois Mitterrand. The German chancellor and the French president
appear to have believed the rest of the EU would come round to their way of
thinking, as indeed all but Britain did. If this be so, the veto is not
wholly regrettable. Europe is not France and Germany alone. Bonn and Paris
lead the continent, but they should not take their predominance for granted.
When Mr Major told the House of Commons yesterday that rejection of Mr
Dehaene was a matter of principle he did not mention Mr Kohl or Mr
Mitterrand, but we knew what he meant. He had no need to name names. He was
telling the world his weakness among his own voters should not lead others
to take Britain's compliance for granted. He is not a popular prime
minister, but he would be nothing at all if he did not get that message
across. He seemed to have his party's support.
Sir Edward Heath was wrong to call the outcome of the Corfu meeting a crisis
for Europe. It was not even a disaster, merely a little drama. Mr Dehaene
will survive in politics. He still has his job. Europe will move on. Another
candidate for the presidency of the Commission will be found. The individual
who succeeds will almost certainly not be wedded to the British Conservative
party's views on Europe. Take, for example, the Dutch prime minister, Mr
Ruud Lubbers. He was highly praised by Mr Major yesterday, and not for the
first time. It is reasonable to assume that Britain would support him if
others did.
This is not explicable in simple pro- or anti-Europe terms. It was Mr
Lubbers' government that nearly botched the negotiations leading to the
Maastricht treaty. The infamous Dutch draft of early autumn 1991 was
shamelessly Euro-expansionary in tone. The Commission's powers would have
been enhanced even more than they eventually were. The draft had to be
scrapped for progress to be made. The Dutch prime minister's thinking has
since evolved, but that is another matter. Mr Major's veto of Mr Dehaene
cannot be said to have been cast on anti-federal or anti-Brussels grounds
while there is a possibility of British support for Mr Lubbers.
Sir Edward was more persuasive when he intimated that a Eurosceptical
Britain would be less able to influence the course of events on the
continent. Probably, but Mr Major alone is not to blame for this. He is a
puppet of history. As soon as he became prime minister he said that his
purpose was to place Britain at the heart of Europe. He was highly praised
for that noble aspiration. He adopted a distinctly different tone from the
then just-fallen Mrs Thatcher. The proximate cause of her ejection from
office was a persistently anti-Brussels screech. Mr Major, we all thought,
would do better. The Tories were the party of Europe. That is where he would
make a positive contribution.
He never had a chance. For half a century English nationalism has tugged
Britain backwards when its continental partners have sought to move their
ever-closer union forwards. This streak of scepticism runs through all
parties, although it is at present in the ascendancy among Conservatives.
The prime minister is weak because he has a small majority in the Commons.
He might have tried to tough it out, taking a stand on one side or the
other, but he has preferred the strategy of the whip he once was. This has
given the sceptics their leverage. In consequence there is now a distinct
possibility that the issue of how pro- or anti-European the opposing parties
are will be deployed by Mr Major in the next British general election,
assuming he is still there to do the deploying.
We saw this during the elections to the European Parliament a few weeks ago.
The Conservative manifesto, 'a strong Britain in a strong Europe' was meant
to unite the party. Each wing could read what it chose into the small print.
The tone of the campaign was intermittently anti-European. Yet the
government tells anyone who will listen it has found a formula to placate
all but the extreme Europhobes or Europhiles among the Tories. This was set
out in Mr Major's speech about a multi-speed Europe.
The notion was first given public prominence by Mr Douglas Hurd at the Sejm
in Warsaw on May 6. 'The Europe of Monet and Schuman was right for its
time,' the foreign secretary said, adding that what was now taking shape was
'a multi-speed, multi-track, even multi-faceted Europe'. This could mean
Britain asking for a stronger arrangement on defence and, as indicated by Mr
Major yesterday, anti-drugs policing, but opt-outs elsewhere. 'Multi-speed'
should play better than 'two-speed'. That would imply that Britain is in the
slow lane.
The multi-speed Europe of Mr Hurd is not in itself negative, or not sold as
such. It reflects current reality. It allows new members to take part at
their own pace. The trouble with the formula is that it is deficient in
positive proposals, lacking in enthusiasm for whatever is happening on the
continent. Britain cannot get its own candidate into the Commission
presidency. It merely vetoes others. The chances are that Mr Major, pulled
ever sceptic-wards, will find himself always accentuating the negative - no
to Mr Dehaene, no to rejoining the exchange rate mechanism, no to the single
currency, no to the social chapter; 'no', as his predecessor famously said,
'no, no, no, no.' We know what happened to her.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Structural aid should have right
goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERENCE BENDIXSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Perhaps EU structural aid should be granted only when it promises to
create local jobs and local industrial investment ('Poverty trap with an
exit', June 21).
This might help prevent it being used to create markets for high-tech
products from richer EU countries and have other benefits, too.
Athens, for instance, did not have to build a high-tech Metro. On transport
policy grounds, as was set out in an OECD urban division study to which I
contributed, there was a case for mid-technology tramways and trams.
Compared with a Metro, the effects of trams would have been significantly
different. As far as jobs and investment go there are grounds for believing
that the track and the cars, but not perhaps the drive units or the
signalling, could have been made in Greece - under licence if necessary.
Furthermore, for any given budget, a more extensive transit network could
have been created more quickly - to the considerable benefit of Athenians.
And since the trams would have run down the middle of existing streets on
slightly raised paving, or through pedestrianised streets, they could have
provided a reliable, congestion-free service and reduced the area of road
available to cars.
This might indeed have helped 'turn the traffic-clogged and polluted Greek
capital into a modern city'. If, as your correspondent suggests, a Metro is
capable of doing this for Athens, it has to be asked why it has not already
done it for Milan - or Paris or London. Perhaps structural aid should have
more clearly defined environmental as well as employment goals?

FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: George Michael case highlights
age-old tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The George Michael case highlights an age-old tension in English law
(Lex, June 22). On the one hand, the courts must respect and enforce
contracts freely entered into. On the other hand, certain contracts in
unreasonable restraint of trade are regarded as contrary to public policy
and unenforceable.
Generally, English law does not require that contracts be 'fair' or
'reasonable'. The main exceptions relate to certain categories of exclusion
clause and restrictive (or non-compete) covenants.
This is about to change in a significant way. From January 1 1995 the UK
must have implemented an EC Directive on unfair contract terms in consumer
contracts. This may not help artists in Mr Michael's predicament. However,
businesses issuing terms of business to consumers will have to review these
carefully to ensure that they are worth more than the paper on which they
are often so microscopically printed.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Citizenship in Latvia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JANIS LUSIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article 'Held up on the western Line' (June 23) clearly points out
many of Latvia's concerns regarding the critical demographic situation in
Latvia. However, it incorrectly gives the impression that 'almost one half
of the population' is presently excluded from Latvian citizenship. In fact,
70 per cent of the residents of Latvia - of many ethnic origins - are
presently citizens.
An area of prime contention concerns the fate of a group of about 410,000
persons, of whom an estimated 160,000 are retired Soviet military and KGB
personnel and their families. This latter group, by the internationally
accepted Geneva Convention on Occupied Territory, should not be 'forced
upon' Latvia as potential citizens.
The second important aspect concerns the present demographic situation in
Latvia (52 per cent ethnic Latvians) and the potential effects of rapid
naturalisation of persons who may not be assimilated into the Latvian
culture prior to the impending parliamentary elections of October 1995 and
October 1998. While the recommendations of the Council of Europe and
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have been seriously
considered by the government of Latvia, and many were incorporated into the
law, the critical demographic situation in Latvia precludes a rapid
naturalisation process.
One may ask, would any European country allow such a demographic shift in
its citizenry to occur in such a short period of time?

FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Graduate market forces already
working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GERALDINE KAYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is well known that all published statistics are well out of date. A
further example is evident in your article, 'First fall for five years in
graduate unemployment' (June 20), which states that unemployment rates were
worst for mathematicians (13.4 per cent in 1992-93).
GAAPS is an international search and selection consultancy specialising in
actuaries and therefore not in the graduate recruitment market.
Despite this, we have been contacted by a number of insurance companies,
which are our clients, asking us as a special favour to find good science
graduates who wish to enter the actuarial profession.
We were at first surprised that they had not been able to fill their
vacancies themselves on the 'milk round'. On contacting professors we know
(I have an academic background), we found that most of this year's graduates
have been found 'homes'.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, is worried that
employers are not sending the right signals to the jobs market. I am also
worried. My concern is that these out-of-date statistics will put into force
government policy that will result in a huge increase in the number of
science graduates.
Market forces are already in motion and therefore, instead of creating
equilibrium, a surplus may be created.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Bretton Woods 50 years: Mission statement for a liberal
order - Deepak Lal continues the series on the anniversary of Bretton Woods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEEPAK LAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The twin Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund) were conceived when world capital markets had been virtually
extinguished by the tribulations of the inter-war period. Plaudits on their
50th birthday are justified for their role in creating a new liberal
international economic order, underpinned by an increasingly integrated
world capital market. But this very success poses questions about their
future. Once the universal move to market economics is completed, will there
be any need for the short- and long-term lending of these institutions?
The answer is bleaker for the IMF, which has no ostensible role with the
collapse of the Bretton Woods system.
As far as the World Bank group is concerned, it has moved seemingly
effortlessly from providing long-run capital to the war-devastated economies
of Europe and Japan, to supporting developing countries shut out from the
long-term bond market since their widespread default in the 1930s, and most
recently to the capital-constrained ex-communist 'economies in transition'.
It has also evolved many roles - as a financial intermediary, an aid
institution, a provider of technical assistance, a credit rating agency for
sovereign risk, and a major development research institute.
Financial intermediation through the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development remains the group's major business. It differs from
commercial banks in three ways: first, the assurance provided to its bond
holders by the capital that is callable from member governments; second, the
'gift' represented by its paid-in capital, on which it does not have to pay
a dividend to its shareholders; and, third, its preferred creditor status
with its borrowers, which leads to few arrears on its loans. These features
have given its bonds triple-A rating.
Before the opening of the global capital markets to the developing countries
in the 1970s, these IBRD loans at near commercial interest rates would have
been justified on grounds of global efficiency. But with more countries able
to gain access to world capital markets, is there a financial intermediation
role left for the Bank, whose loans, though cheaper than from private
sources, come with 'conditionality'? This cost could encourage borrowers
with alternatives to reduce their demand for IBRD loans, leaving it mainly
with 'lemons'.
The debt crisis demonstrated that it is the willingness, rather than
ability, of borrowers to pay which determines sovereign risk. The positive
net cash flow historically associated with Bank lending has reinforced the
willingness of borrowing governments to meet their debt service obligations
to the Bank. This growth in net lending can only occur with a continued
growth in the Bank's capital. If it were to cease growing - a political
decision - its intermediation operations might be shown to have been a vast
Ponzi scheme.
With a deterioration of borrowers' expectations of future lending, arrears
could accumulate. This might worsen the rating of Bank bonds, leading to a
rise in the interest rate on its loans, making them even less attractive for
the good borrowers. The only way to avoid this is to keep good borrowers by
giving up conditionality. The bank would then be a true merchant bank,
which, because of its unique advantages and reputation, can raise money more
cheaply for its borrowing governments than they could. It would also have to
be concerned like any other bank by the quality of its borrowers. Its
advantage over commercial rivals would be the implicit subsidy and insurance
elements provided by its intergovernmental owners.
The Bank's role as a financial intermediary has been clouded over the years
by its role as a foreign aid agency through its soft loan window
(International Development Association). Foreign aid remains a contentious
and highly politicised issue. It is debateable whether the Bank has been
wise (since Robert McNamara's tenure) to identify its mission so closely
with the business of aid, rather than with the less contentious and more
viable business of international financial intermediation. A radical
departure in this area is required.
The Bank's objectives in providing foreign aid have changed over the years;
the most recent is to alleviate poverty and the public financing of the
merit goods (education and health). These social policy concerns are
necessarily more contentious than the technical engineering and economic
issues that have been the Bank's bread-and-butter in the past. Moreover,
whereas more general principles govern the latter, the design of effective
social policy is determined much more by local circumstances, culture and
politics. A multilateral bureaucracy is unlikely to have a comparative
advantage in their design or implementation.
Private charities (national or international) with grass roots organisations
can both identify potential beneficiaries, and target and monitor benefits
to them much better than governments. For the heterogeneity of these
beneficiaries makes it difficult to lay down simple bureaucratic guidelines
for the targeted benefits that are required. The alternative of a
universalisation of benefits (as in western welfare states) is fiscally
ruinous and less efficacious, because the middle classes always benefit most
from universalised benefits.
A radical solution would be for the Bank to consider transferring its IDA
funding to audited national and international charities. As a spur to
private charity, such IDA transfers to these charities could be made on a
matching basis.
As regards the role of the Bank in providing technical assistance, credit
ratings, and development research: since the last two are public goods,
their subsidisation through Bank profits would be justified. Technical
assistance provided could be charged for, as by private consultants, with
Bank profits being paid as explicit subsidies to poorer countries, to
purchase Bank consultancy services in competition with their commercial
rivals.
This package of reforms could provide the Bank with a more clear cut and
depoliticised mission in the liberal economic world order it has helped to
recreate.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Case for abolishing banks' floating
charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir MICHAEL GRYLLS MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is encouraging to read (Letters June 22) that a leading banker - Mr
Derek Sach, of the Royal Bank of Scotland - has called for the abolition of
the floating charge in the UK. At the time when the Department of Trade and
Industry is reviewing existing insolvency legislation, it is important to
look at the power which a bank derives from the floating charge and
determine if that power is healthy in a modern highly competitive industrial
economy.
Not only do the powers of an administrative receiver under a floating charge
cause concern and uncertainty to the borrower, but such charges create
serious disadvantage for unsecured trade creditors which supply an
apparently sound company, while unaware of the current extent of its
borrowings and without the level of information about its liquidity which is
available to the bank.
It is the floating charge which underpins the capital gearing approach of
the banks to small and medium enterprise (SME) lending in the UK,
highlighted in the Confederation of British Industry August 1993 report,
Finance for Growth. Reliance is placed on security rather than information
and the income stream indicated by future prospects of the enterprise - an
income-gearing approach. This encourages the provision of short-term
finance. Without the all-embracing safety net of the floating charge for
banks, lending proposals would inevitably be more critically assessed to the
benefit of the banks and the businesses concerned. The elimination of the
floating charge and the removal of the preference it gives to one creditor
whose prime concern is not the continuing viability of the business and the
jobs at stake, would create a more robust lending environment in the UK.
There is no reason to believe that UK bankers, given time, would not match
the performance of bankers in other industrialised countries, including
Germany, Japan and the US, where floating charges are unlawful, in their
lending to the unquoted sector. This would surely be to the benefit of
Britain's SMEs in the medium to longer term. It would also help redirect the
traditional thrust of our corporate insolvency process, moving away from
retribution for the debtor and towards his rehabilitation.

Under the heading 'True and false etymology', Fowler's Modern English Usage
tells us that 'Welsh rabbit is amusing and right, and Welsh rarebit stupid
and wrong'. 'Stupid and wrong' just about sums up Rhodes Around Britain,
which is obsessed with the style and appearance of its presenter and pretty
weak on recipes (8.30 BBC2). At 9.30 on the same channel comes another
misconceived phrase. When Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon it was
intended, the ponderousness of American PR men being what it is, that he
should say: 'That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.'
Poor old Armstrong, with too many other things on his mind, omitted the
indefinite article, destroyed the distinction between the individual and the
species, and delivered 11 words of gibberish. They can never be corrected
because all the television newsreels stand as witness. One Small Step
re-tells the story of the moon landing. Ireland's crucial match against
Norway is shown in World Cup Grandstand (5.25 BBC1) and ITV shows Brazil v
Sweden in World Cup '94 (8.30).

FT  28 JUN 94 / Arts: 'Rage' saved by the acting - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is not much rage in the new play at the Bush, despite its title. No
heavy bombs either, despite the fact that it is set in Slough. Here is
suburban, middlebrow drama, heavily influenced by television. The toast to
the Bush is that they do it so well.
Richard Zajdlic, the author, is currently contributing to the TV soap,
EastEnders. Rage may seem an odd play for the Bush to pick up, but at least
the choice shows the theatre's versatility. The director is Mike Bradwell
who has worked at the Bush, on and off, for years and knows the place
inside-out. He can stage a success even with a text that belongs to another
medium.
Nothing in Rage is particularly surprising. It is the tale of a two parent,
two children family on the verge of a 20th wedding anniversary of a marriage
that has nothing much to celebrate except survival. The husband is a GP long
out of love with his wife, but not much enamoured of anyone else. The wife
still clings to him. Daughter Kate is doing A levels. Son Nicky is a bit of
a drop-out. Kate is on the conventional pill, prescribed by another doctor.
Nicky is on anti-depressants, prescribed by his father.
By the end of the celebration, Nicky has committed suicide, possibly having
stabbed a police woman in the course of an unexplained crime. The rest is
essentially an inquest into how the family got into such a position in the
first place, plus a vignette of a local reverend coming to show sympathy and
a sub-plot about the woman police officer and her detective boyfriend.
If it were the play alone, there would be nothing to write home about. Rage
is redeemed by remarkable acting. Sue Johnston as the wife has few memorable
lines, but she succeeds by her presence and her voice in putting feeling
into cliches. Nicky Henson as the doctor has a slow start, mainly coming
home tired to reach automatically for the whisky and soda. Yet as he stands
on the stage, shoulders hunched, you can see that he might once have been a
medical researcher in America rather than a GP in Slough and does not wholly
regret the decision to stay with the hum-drum, including his wife.
None of the other parts quite match these two. The portrayal of the visiting
cleric at a time of grief is a mixture of the cheap and the insulting. The
sub-plot of the affair between the police officers is plainly indebted to
David Hare's Murmuring Judges and remains pointlessly obscure. Nevertheless,
Bradwell's production demonstrates that it is just about possible to make a
silk purse out of a sow's ear: mediocre play, wonderful playing.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Arts: Pioneer of public taste - William Packer admires
Samuel Courtauld's impressionist collection, now hung in the Great Gallery
of Somerset House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At their former home in Woburn Square, collections in the Courtauld
Institute's galleries were a close-kept secret. Their move in 1989 to
Somerset House, William Chambers' classical masterpiece at the far end of
the Strand, was expected to change all that. But there are still problems.
The Strand is no longer the fashionable thoroughfare it was and, at the
Aldwych end, has long been a forbidding one-way maelstrom. Sign-posting is,
to say the least, discreet and the entrance facade of Somerset House itself
is hardly welcoming, with its barriers and car-park overseers. That the
courtyard beyond, potentially one of the great public spaces not just of
London but of Europe, should be the private car-park of Her Majesty's
Revenue Men is a scandal.
Inside, however, things are looking up. The problems of heating and
air-conditioning appear to have been resolved, albeit in somewhat ad hoc
fashion in the short term, and much of the permanent hang has been rehung,
to advantage. But the most significant change is the recent decision of the
new director, John Murdoch, to return the Great Gallery on the top floor to
its proper purpose as a prime exhibition space.
There, at the top of the vertiginous staircase, where Rowlandson's rakes and
beauties once heaved together at the Royal Academy's private view, we now
have as our first taste of the new policy an exhibition given over to the
eponymous Samuel, collector of French impressionism and pioneer of public
taste. Samuel Courtauld, an industrialist who had made a great fortune out
of the manufacture of rayon, became interested in impressionism on seeing
the Lane Bequest at the National Gallery in 1917. He began to collect on his
own account and by the end of the 1920s had acquired representative works by
all the major impressionists and post-impressionists, and was especially
strong on Cezanne and Seurat. He also endowed a purchase fund at the
National Gallery, by which such things as Cezanne's self-portrait, Degas'
'Young Spartans' and 'Miss La La', Van Gogh's 'Chair' and 'Sunflowers', and
Seurat's huge 'Bathers at Asnieres' came into public hands.
This exhibition presents not just the cream of the paintings and drawings
that comprise the Courtauld Bequest itself, but also brings together some of
the works he gave away or left to friends and family on his death in 1947.
There are three besides, all masterpieces, to represent the National
Gallery's good fortune - Monet's 'Gare St Lazare', Renoir's 'Boating on the
Seine' and Picasso's 'Child with Dove'.
It is astonishing to stand thus surrounded by great paintings, and not a
little envious at what one man was able to get for himself to enjoy - a
pique barely assuaged by his conspicuous philanthropy in passing it all on
to us. I have nothing against great art being held in private hands: I would
only like to get my hands on some of it myself. The serious point is that
true art, I am convinced, is charged up in a curious way, by being privily
held and loved for a period before it moves into public limbo.
How familiar so many of these things, which in the 1920s were a matter still
of some controversy, have become to us. It was Courtauld who bought the Van
Gogh 'Self-Portrait with a Bandaged Ear' for Pounds 10,000 in 1928, and not
the National Gallery. He also bought Cezanne's 'Man with Pipe' for Pounds
7,500 in 1927, and 'Gravelines' by Seurat in 1926 for Pounds 3,100. The
price of the ravishing Modigliani seated nude, bought around 1931, is
unfortunately not known. These were difficult pictures still, at serious
prices no doubt, but by no means exorbitant, even then.
Renoir no doubt was safer (the exquisite 'La Loge', of the girl in black and
white in her theatre box, got for Pounds 24,200 in 1925), and Manet too (his
'Bar at the Folies-Bergere' the prize of the collection, at Pounds 24,100 in
1926). But even so, these were capital works, manifestly museum paintings in
prospect, and so many of them still available. All the prices known are
given, which gives a fascinating gloss to the show.
With the smaller works and drawings, this knowledge is even more piquant -
Pounds 700 or so for a Seurat study of the riverbank; Pounds 282 for an
ink-and-wash drawing by Guys of two fashionable women; Pounds 750 for
Seurat's monumental chiaroscuro nude - but I cannot bear to go on. The
drawings in their way are as well-judged as the paintings - Forain, Lautrec,
Daumier, Cezanne. The dark pastel by Degas, of a seated woman seen from
behind as she fixes her hair, is one of the best drawings that greatest of
draughtsmen ever did.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Arts: An exalted 'Tristan' - David Murray hails the operatic
inauguration performance in the new Edinburgh Festival Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In what are still difficult times, it is extraordinary that the two premier
festivals of Great Britain, Glyndebourne and Edinburgh, should have realised
their matching, long-standing dreams only weeks apart - and not just
successfully, but triumphantly. A month ago Glyndebourne reopened in its
superb new house, with half again as many seats and a real acoustic at last.
On Saturday the new Edinburgh Festival Theatre, half again larger than that,
had its operatic inauguration with Wagner's Tristan und Isolde: a stern test
for any house, but passed here with resounding credit and a truly memorable
performance to boot.
The gods must have smiled upon the project, for few new opera houses since
Bayreuth can have had gala openings of this exalted musical standard. Not
all the gods, as it happened: that afternoon, a large parade in favour of
Jesus disrupted traffic so severely that many Tristan patrons - at Pounds
175 a head - arrived only in time to view Act 1 on the cafe-bar monitor. But
there was no further divine intervention; and to the unlucky latecomers I
can say that nothing in Act 1, admirable though it was, rose to the
wrenching splendours of the later acts.
The EFT is not exactly 'new', for it has retained and refurbished the
entirely satisfactory auditorium of the old Empire (1928, designed by the
Milburn brothers of Sunderland after the previous Frank Matcham theatre
burned down) - broad and unshowily handsome, excellent sight-lines, no seat
much further than 30 yards from the lofty stage. The latter is quite new,
like all the backstage facilities too; it is now the largest in Europe.
Equally the flashy front-of-house, which displays the expansive new foyers
on all three levels through a gigantic glass wall to the world outside.
Nor, despite its name, is the EFT a creature of the Edinburgh Festival; it
is a self-christened 'lyric theatre' which will have to sell itself all year
round, not only as the second home of Scottish Opera and the Scottish
Ballet, but as a showcase for practically anything that will draw a
sufficient audience. For the annual Festival, nonetheless, it will be a
boon, a huge asset and a blessed rescue.
It is no secret - indeed, it is a kind of scandal - that Edinburgh's lack of
an adequate opera-venue has been an unstaunched Tristan- or Amfortas-wound
in the flesh of the Festival these many years, with repeated promises
regularly scotched by civic parsimony and argy-bargy. Very late in the day,
dogged thrift had its unexpected reward when the Moss organisation decided
to give up the Empire, run as a bingo-hall since 1962, for a bargain price.
For a mere Pounds 21m more, much of that private and corporate money,
Edinburgh has made itself an opera-house that should transform the Festival
and the yearly season over a long time to come.
This Scottish Opera Tristan, staged by Yannis Kokkos, is a co-production
with Welsh National Opera. First seen at Cardiff 16 months ago and roundly
acclaimed, it has been partly re-cast (for the better, by all accounts), and
Richard Armstrong now finds himself conducting an orchestra which must be
every bit as musically attentive as its Welsh counterpart. He took most of
Act 1, and especially the great Prelude, at tempi so intensely slow as to
tempt fate, but the players sustained them bravely. The effect was imposing,
if measurably self-conscious: even the young-middle-aged Armstrong, devoted
as he is, cannot just slip into the clothes of old Furtwangler or Goodall.
Tristan's stately declamations exposed the heavy beat in Jeffrey Lawton's
warm, dignified tenor, and Isolde's simmering fury is not a natural vein for
Anne Evans. With the descent of Romantic rapture, however, the earth moved.
In Act 2 Armstrong paced Isolde's impatient longings and the subsequent
love-duet marvellously, with a wealth of fresh, tingling orchestral detail.
With his speaking pianissimi no less than his urgent explosions, the EFT
acoustic seemed to accommodate voices and orchestra alike, with perfect
transparency and balance.
Lawton rose to a throaty, Jon Vickers-ish intimacy that tore at one's heart,
and Evans was luminous with elevated passion. As Brangaene, Kathryn Harries
issued her anxious warnings in haunting depth. Isolde's husband King Marke,
the Norwegian bass Carsten Stabell, capped it all with a reproachful
monologue of sterling moral weight, enough to re-cast all the erotic action
in a new light - as it should do, but rarely does. As for Act 3, I hardly
know whether to praise Lawton's desolate agonies more, or Armstrong's
knife-edge quickness in capturing every turn of his epic self-searchings.
We were gripped and scathed. Kokkos's spare direction, as plain and
economical as his near-abstract sets, let every moment stab cleanly home.
James Johnson's fine Kurwenal came into his own, wracked by loyal
desperation. Iain Paton represented the Shepherd in uncommon sympathetic
depth (abetted by a fine cor anglais), like John Harris's angry Melot. Miss
Evans was visionary and nobly persuasive in the Liebestod - but it was a
mistake to let the lights fade slowly on her statuesque pose after the music
had stopped: Tristan must end with its soft, absolutely final note.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Trademark rules accord with treaty -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National trade-mark rules which allowed imports to be banned because they
might be confused with domestic goods were compatible with Rome treaty
provisions on the free movement of goods, the European Court of Justice said
last week.
The case concerned the importation of heating installations into Germany
from France. The goods, which were made in France, were sold under the
trademark 'Ideal Standard'.
Until 1984, an American company held the rights to 'Ideal Standard' and
marketed sanitary equipment and heating installations under that name
through subsidiaries in Germany and France. But in 1984 the French
subsidiary was forced, due to economic circumstances, to sell its heating
installation business, together with the trademark, to an outside company
with no link to the Ideal Standard group. The trademark rights were later
sold on to another company, also independent of the original grouping.
It was the German subsidiary of this last company which found itself before
the German courts for trademark infringement, having imported heating
installations into Germany from France with the name 'Ideal Standard'.
The plaintiff company still held the right to the trademark 'Ideal Standard'
for both sanitary equipment and heating installations but it had stopped
producing and marketing heating installations in 1976.
The Dusseldorf court found in favour of the plaintiff. It said the French
imports risked confusing consumers. It also found that the relevant EC law
was clear and thus refrained from seeking a preliminary ruling from the ECJ.
The German importer appealed. The Dusseldorf Appeal Court referred the case
to the ECJ, asking whether there was an unlawful restriction on the free
movement of goods under the EC treaty. At the time there were no harmonised
Community rules on trademarks.
The ECJ said it was common ground that the restriction on the German
importer was a measure of equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction
within the meaning of the treaty. The question was whether it could be
justified.
The Court had already ruled in the Hag II case that such restrictions could
be justified, but in that case, not only was the name of the trademark
identical but also the products concerned were identical.
In the present case, although the trademark name was identical, the German
holder of the trademark no longer sold the products being imported.
The Court said that, where a risk of confusion existed for consumers between
two products, it did not matter whether the goods were identical or
sufficiently similar. In the present case, the national court had decided on
the facts before it that a risk of confusion existed. The Court could not
substitute its own findings on the facts; thus, given that a risk of
confusion existed, the position was as if the goods in question had been
identical.
The question that remained was whether the Court's findings in Hag II could
apply not only to the facts of that case - where the trademark rights were
forceably removed from the holders by sequestration - but also to the
present case where there had been a voluntary transfer of trademark rights.
The Court said they could. The determining factor in Hag II had been the
absence of consent by the trademark holder in the country of importation to
the selling in the exporting country of similar products sold by the
trademark holder in that country. In such circumstances, the free movement
of goods would jeopardise the essential function of the trademark; consumers
would not be able to identify with certainty the origin of the marked goods
and the holder of the trademark could be held responsible for the poor
quality of goods for which he was not responsible.
The Court found this reasoning would not have been altered if the transfer
of trademark rights had been made voluntarily rather than by sequestration.
Therefore its findings in Hag II applied.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of UK law firms could go bust over the next three years according
to a survey of law firm performance by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The accountants'
annual survey of Law Firm Financial Management shows a general improvement
in the performance of most firms - almost 60 per cent increased profits per
partner last year. But 25-30 per cent of firms continued to report a further
fall in profits coming on top of poor performances in 1991-92 and 1992-93.
Coopers says these firms have become locked into a cycle of reduced profits,
lower investment and an inability to recruit and retain quality staff. Many
of them would not survive the next few years.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Officials sued over diversion to
reduce deficit - Legal briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
California state officials are being sued for the return of Dollars 700m
allegedly taken illegally from the state's 700 'special funds' to pay off a
deficit in the state's 'general fund'.
The action has been brought by the California State Electronics Association
and others which have contributed to the special funds over the years. Money
in the special funds comes from licensing fees and is earmarked by
California law to be used only to regulate businesses and professions and
provide consumer protection. The action claims the state legislature
illegally authorised the state government to transfer money from the special
funds to the general fund between 1991 and 1994.
Mr Richard Fine, attorney for the plaintiffs, said that, as a result, the
reserves of the special funds had dropped by more than Dollars 720m from
Dollars 1.56bn on June 30 1991 to Dollars 848m on June 30 1994. 'This 46 per
cent reduction will deny Californians the level of consumer protection they
have a right to,' he added.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: A question of costs - Julian Lew says
a Lords' decision could mean fewer arbitrations in England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN LEW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent decision by England's Law Lords may have undermined London's
attraction to the international business community as a venue for
international arbitration.
Concern about unwarranted interference by the English courts in arbitration
proceedings will inevitably make many English and foreign lawyers think very
carefully before choosing London as the place of arbitration in disputes
arising out of international contracts.
English law has long been a significant export from the UK. International
contracts of all kinds involving parties from different countries are often
subjected to English law.
Particularly in the emerging markets of the Far East, English law is chosen
to regulate construction, agency and distribution, intellectual property,
joint venture, investment and finance contracts.
English law is chosen because the parties feel it is intrinsically the most
appropriate system for their particular problem. This may be because the
parties cannot agree to use either of their national legal systems but
accept English law as a neutral body of law.
They choose English law not because it is that much better than many other
national laws, but because it is a commercial, well-developed, tried and
trusted system; because the English language is the main international
trading language; and because there is a large reservoir of experienced and
able English lawyers.
French law, Swiss law and New York law, however, are equally highly regarded
around the world, and are also often considered suitable for regulating
international contracts.
Due to Britain's trading eminence last century and early this century,
London became, and remains, a centre for many forms of arbitration,
particularly those involving maritime and commodity issues.
One of the factors that made England a popular arbitration venue was the
fact that English law and the courts supported arbitration proceedings to a
greater degree than in many other countries.
But whether due to arrogance or conservativeness, English law fell behind
the times and more and more international arbitrations went to other
countries, notably to Switzerland, France and the US.
The movement of arbitration away from England in the 1970s was a direct
result of the interference of the English courts which allowed the parties
to abuse the case-stated procedure, giving the courts an opportunity to
review decisions of arbitrators.
After a clamour from lawyers and some business circles, the 1979 Arbitration
Act was passed. This only partially redressed the situation. The power of
the English courts to review decisions of arbitrators was greatly curtailed
and limited to important questions of law, having wider application than for
any one particular case.
Moreover, in international matters, except in traditional London maritime,
commodity and insurance arbitrations, the parties were permitted to agree in
the arbitration agreement to exclude judicial review of the award.
Nevertheless, English law is now out of step with most other arbitration
systems.
There is one underlying intention behind every arbitration agreement: to
exclude the jurisdiction of national courts in favour of an arbitral
tribunal. While speed and low expenses do not always result from a resort to
arbitration, the ability to have an arbitrator with knowledge and experience
of a particular commercial sector, and a degree of privacy and
confidentiality of the dispute and the procedure, are the main reasons why
parties favour arbitration.
But arbitration cannot occur in a vacuum: the agreement of the parties to
submit to arbitration, support for the procedure, and enforcement of the
award will always be needed from national courts.
The question is the extent to which national courts should, practically,
supervise and control arbitration proceedings.
In many countries, this dividing line has often become blurred. It is
difficult to tell a national court judge that he has and should exercise no
jurisdiction over an arbitration amd expect him to accept that.
Hence, when a cogent argument is made that justice necessitates the
intervention of the court (even though the real aim is to avoid or frustrate
arbitration proceedings), the court will be reluctant not to attempt to
provide the justice sought. When this occurs, it is done with a parochialism
which reflects national law and procedure, and ignores that fact that the
parties come from different systems.
This problem was well illustrated by the recent House of Lords decision in
the Ken-Ren case*. This was a typical international arbitration, between a
Kenyan claimant and defendants from Belgium and Austria.
The claimant was insolvent but the arbitration was being funded by the
Kenyan government. A tactic to avoid litigation in England has always been
to seek security for costs from the foreigner. This is to tie in with the
general rule in England that the loser pays the winner's costs  - a rule
which does not exist in most other countries. In international arbitration
it is a power that is sometimes, but not invariably, exercised by
arbitrators.
English law gives the courts the power to order security for costs in
arbitration; arbitrators only have that power if expressly agreed by the
parties. The House of Lords decided, by a majority of 3:2, that in certain
circumstances, and very exceptionally, the English courts could intervene in
an international arbitration and require a claimant to put up funds as
security for costs merely because that arbitration is taking place in
England.
This decision was based, primarily, on a belief that, if arbitration occurs
in England, it must be subject not only to the supervision and control of
English courts, but ultimately also to English procedural rules.
The particular characteristics of the Ken-Ren case are of secondary
importance. What is crucial is the fact that by their approach the Law Lords
have placed a disincentive to parties to come to arbitration in England.
Why should parties who come to England due to its neutrality, geographic
convenience, and local legal expertise be subject to the inconvenience, and
sometimes idiosyncracies, of certain English procedures.
If arbitration is directed away from London, Britain's invisible earnings
will suffer and the influence of English law on commercial transactions
generally in other corners of the world may be affected.
If security for costs is to be allowed at all (and there are divergent
views) it is the arbitrator rather than the court that should decide the
issue.
This issue will feature prominently over the coming months in the debate
over the development of a new arbitration law in the UK. The international
arbitration community will watch with interest. For the moment it is
probable that the effect of the recent House of Lords' decision will be to
persuade foreign lawyers and parties to locate their arbitrations elsewhere.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Terry Morgan is leaving the driving seat he has occupied at Land Rover
Vehicles for the past three years to become managing director of British
Aerospace's Royal Ordnance division.
The 42-year-old Morgan, who has been with Land Rover in various roles since
1985, forged his first links with Royal Ordnance during BAe's ownership of
Rover Group - not particularly surprising, since Land Rover is almost the
definitive light military vehicle.
He takes up the job on August 1 and for the first time in his career will
not be directly involved in the motor industry. Before joining Land Rover as
production director in 1985 he was with Leyland Bus as manufacturing
director. His career began with an apprenticeship in Lucas' Girling brakes
division.
Replacing him as managing director at Land Rover is 36-year-old Ian
Robertson, who steps up from purchasing director. Robertson is a Rover group
man through and through, joining what was then British Leyland's purchasing
department from university in 1979 and subsequently working his way through
a variety of positions - from logistics to plant director - across the
group.
Meanwhile another Rover veteran - of 37 years - Fred Coultas is taking over
as managing director of British Motor Industry Heritage Trust, which
controls the new motor museum and heritage centre Rover has set up within
its Gaydon, Warwickshire, research and development centre. He succeeds Peter
Mitchell, who is retiring after getting the centre up and running.

FT  28 JUN 94 / People: Daly grasps competitive nettle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alec Daly was a founding member of the Confederation of British Industry's
National Manufacturing Council so it is only fitting that he should now be
asked to run it, following the departure of Mark Radcliffe.
Daly, who is 58, will take over responsibility for the council in September
on his appointment as the CBI's deputy-director general.
A main board director of GKN from 1986, his career at the sharp end of
manufacturing industry includes a spell with International Computers in the
1960s and 14 years with Ford, where he ended up as head of truck
manufacturing operations in the UK and on the continent.
He joined GKN in 1978 as chairman of GKN Sankey and leaves as managing
director of GKN's Engineered and Agricultural Products business.
Daly confesses to having harboured early reservations about the value of a
body formed to help put some competitive bite into British manufacturing but
says he has been enormously encouraged both by the enthusiasm of council
members and by the government's new commitment to the competitiveness issue.
'The political climate is right and there is an absolute need for British
companies to grasp the nettle and establish the highest standards so that
they can compete with the world's best. I hope to help ensure the message is
taken on board and turned into success.'

FT  28 JUN 94 / People: Smith New Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edwin Marks, 68, a US investment banker, has resigned as a non-executive
director of Smith New Court, the UK investment banking group which recently
reported more than doubled profits.
Marks, president of CMCO (formerly Carl Marks &amp; Co), joined the board in
March 1988 when his firm merged its US securities trading, clearing and
custodial business with Smith New Court. CMCO used to be the second biggest
investor in Smith New Court, after the Rothschild group. However, over the
past year it has reduced its stake from 8.05 per cent to 4.15 per cent.
Meanwhile, the group has appointed five new executive directors thereby
increasing the size of the board to 39, including six non-executives. Graham
Meek, 47, a former partner in Wood Mackenzie who joined Smith New Court in
May 1991, has joined the board along with Michael Davids, 40, deputy
managing director of UK agency; Jun Miyazaki, 43, head of operations in
Tokyo; David Smith, 44, who joined the firm as a market maker in 1972; and
Jeremy Tulk-Hart, 47, who runs Smith New Court's syndication desk.

FT  28 JUN 94 / People: Tom Scott jumps ship
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Swan Hunter's shipbuilding manager Tom Scott, the man who has kept
outfitting work on target on the company's last three frigates despite
receivership and mass redundancies, has left for a new job.
Scott, 55, starts work next Monday at Yarrow on the Clyde, where he will be
supervising the outfitting of another three Type 23 frigates, won against
stiff competition from Swans a couple of years ago.
He has spent more than 20 years at Swan Hunter, but continuing uncertainty
over the company's future, and the offer of a plum job as Yarrow's
divisional manager in charge of post launch work, tipped the balance and he
quit the Tyneside shipbuilder on Friday.
Scott is modest about his achievement in motivating Swan's workforce through
such a difficult 13 months since receivership. 'If ever a workforce deserved
success it's Swan's for what they've done.'
The Ministry of Defence has yet to decide on which yard should refit the
landing ship Bedivere; among the competitors for the refit, on which Swan's
future depends, is Yarrow.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): BICs make progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's network of business and innovation centres (BICs) now totals more
than 100, including offices recently established in the new democracies of
central Europe.
Progress of the BICs was celebrated in Seville last week at a 10th
anniversary congress of their Brussels-based umbrella organisation EBN*.
Developed from a pilot project launched in 1984 by the Directorate-General
for regional policies of the European Commission (DG XV1), the centres were
primarily intended to help create or expand innovative businesses in areas
suffering from serious industrial decline.
Financed 50 per cent from Commission funds during their start-up period,
some BICs have struggled to attract adequate funds from the private sector,
government and local authorities. But the success of their avowed selective
approach to small business support has in many of the cases been impressive.
A survey of 51 BICs relating to 1992 indicated that most of the 'client'
companies were in the information technology, electronics and applied
engineering sectors, and that nearly 90 per cent had been in existence for
five years (against a European average of 48 per cent for all types of
company). Other features were a propensity to innovate, to invest, to export
and to employ qualified staff.
EBN claims that today's BICs - whose services range from project detection
and training to marketing advice and shared logistical support - have
between them been responsible for the creation or the development of 4,000
SMEs and 20,000 jobs.
Philip Ellison, chief executive of Greater Manchester Business Innovation
Centre, one of nine in the UK, says the BIC Europe-wide network is also 'a
brilliant one' for exporters, if used correctly.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): A role-play revolution -
A Japanese businessman has found that a western approach to motivation has
helped deliver spectacular results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tetsuo Mizuno has some advice for fellow businessmen struggling to find ways
to make their companies more competitive. Don't follow conventional Japanese
ways.
Mizuno heads Square, a small video game software house in Tokyo that, in
spite of the recession, has seen phenomenal sales of its role-playing games
for Nintendo's electronic game hardware.
Three out of four games it released last year were hits, selling more than
1m per game. The unprecedented craze for Square's games prompted children
and parents to line up outside toy shops, hours before the sixth in its
best-selling series reached the shelves last April. The game sold out within
hours, and Square posted sales of Y25bn (Pounds 160.7m) in a month - almost
equal to what it achieved during the whole of last year.
The company's break from traditional Japanese management of its employees
appears to have been a factor in its ability to develop popular computer
games. Its unconventional hiring policy is one of the underlying factors in
its creative strength.
While most leading companies may be losing out on talent by limiting
themselves to hiring university graduates, especially from top class
schools, Square hires anyone as long as they are inventive and are
competent. Some 80 per cent of Square's staff have held other jobs,
including teaching, playing in rock bands and acting.
Other striking differences are the flexible working hours and the extensive
holiday allocation. 'Our business is entertainment. How can people have fun
playing games made by workers who commute on a crowded train, wear blue
suits and are constantly told what to do by their superiors,' asks Mizuno.
Employees must touch base once a day, but as long as they are productive, do
not need to keep set office hours.
Long holidays are rare in Japanese companies, which usually only allow
employees to take one week off in the summer. Workers may be given a certain
amount of paid annual holiday, but they are not really expected to take
them.
Employees at Square, however, get one month's summer holiday, and an
additional 20 days of paid holiday a year. The company encourages employees
to travel, especially abroad, and from the second year in the company they
can apply for special overseas trips.
Mizuno says he wants his employees to enjoy life and to experience different
cultures in other countries. 'Our games are based on adventures in castles,
forests and caves. We want our staff to go and see what these places are
really like with their own eyes,' he says.
Square evaluates its employees by mixing the western merit approach and the
Japanese life-time employment system. While those who help to create a
popular game will be compensated, those that have not contributed see a pay
rise equal to the cost of inflation.
The salary difference between employees who entered the company in the same
year can amount to Y4m-Y5m. By providing incentives, the company attempts to
increase productivity and morale. Says Mizuno: 'You need to ask what people
want to be doing in five years. How much they want to be earning, where they
want to be living. If workers calculate backwards from such goals, it's
clear what they need to do.'
The company, which employs 250 staff, started as a software division of
Denyusha, an electrical engineering company based in Tokushima in western
Japan. However, the acute differences in management styles between the
traditional Japanese engineering company and its almost radical computer
game division prompted the company to split in two, forming a separate
company based in Tokyo.
It is uncertain whether Square can preserve such a flexible management style
once it grows into a bigger organisation. Mizuno doubts that it will become
too big, because of the cost of games software. A computer game costs about
Y10,000 and consumers seem willing to spend about Y40,000 to Y50,000 a year
on games. He says the chances of the company growing larger than 400 people
is slim.
One problem that the company's management has yet to solve is that its
role-playing games have failed to cross the cultural barriers, and have not
seen good sales in Europe or the US.
'I think we need more people who are multilingual, who know what's
interesting for everyone all over the world. We need to start making games
like Steven Spielberg films,' says Mizuno.

FT  28 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Tall order for small firm
advisers / A look at the uneven progress of Business Link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: the wisdom of Solomon and the diplomatic silkiness of Talleyrand,
allied to rigorous diagnostic skills and plenty of demonstrable management
qualities, all for between Pounds 18,000 and Pounds 30,000 a year.
The search for so-called personal business advisers to spearhead the UK
government's latest drive to help small firms is starting in earnest now
that the Business Link movement is spreading across the country.
Business Link is at the centre of efforts by Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, to overhaul government support services to small
business. The idea is that local and national services to business -
information, training, help with exports and marketing, financial aid,
consultancy and so on - be pulled together in one-stop-shops, branded with
the name Business Link and subject to Department of Trade and Industry
approval.
Training and enterprise councils have been trying to forge local alliances
of councils, chambers of commerce and enterprise agencies to pool these
services. But it can be difficult making the independent interdependent.
'The partners are not automatically natural allies,' said Richard Green,
director of economic development at Birmingham City Council, at a conference
earlier this month to assess progress. 'There's a lot of institutional
ground-beating going on at the moment,' comments Brian Wright, chief
executive of the London Enterprise Agency, on the subject of local turf
wars.
Heseltine has been trying to snuff out such wars, recently telling the
chambers of commerce to 'join with your partners, get fully involved and
don't let sentiment and parochial feelings prevent you from doing what you
know to be right for our businesses.'
Bruce Harris, managing director of Rochdale Enterprises, admits to fears
among enterprise agencies of being submerged - but he has found there is
life after partnership. 'As we began to operate, we found the threat really
wasn't there.'
The evidence so far suggests a greater readiness to bury 'sentiment and
parochial feelings' in the Midlands and north of England than in the south.
Of the 30 Business Link offices and sub-offices which have opened so far,
only three are south of a line drawn from the Severn to the Wash, although
six of the 11 offices opening next month are south of the line.
A further 36 Business Links have been approved by the DTI but of these only
four are in the southern part of England. Six of the 19 proposals awaiting
DTI assessment are in the south.
There is no particular reason why the south is tardier than the north.
Officials surmise that in the north there is a longer standing habit of
co-operation among economic agencies because they have been forced to come
to terms with problems of decline less prevalent in the south.
But where Business Links have been set up, they have evoked a response.
Birmingham has had 12,000 telephone inquiries since it opened last October.
Leicester is receiving 4,500 telephone calls and 1,500 personal visits a
month.
However, DTI officials and Business Link executives believe they can take
the initiative in helping small companies work through management, sales,
financial and production problems. Hence the search for personal business
advisers.
'The personal business adviser is crucial to success. Unless they can make a
practical contribution to business, Business Link will fail,' warned Sarah
Brown, head of the DTI's small firms division.
Manchester Business Link has found 500 small companies with growth
potential, to which it wants to offer its services. 'We want to learn from
the successful. We've also identified a group of triers - the next tranche
on the list for business advisers. We see ourselves starting at the top of
the pyramid and working down,' said John Browne, managing director.
'We've focused on the three sectors of the Walsall economy - automotive
components, plastics and construction products,' reported Bob Baggott,
working to get Walsall Business Link running. The office will target
companies employing between 11 and 50 people. Already it has recruited three
business advisers to go on the staff.
Leicester's main business advice comes from 20 self-employed consultants,
working under contract. 'The average personal business adviser is the
55-year-old executive who wants to put something back in the com-munity,'
said Tony Grice, chief executive of Leicester Business Point.
Certainly the adviser, in Browne's view, must 'have been around the street,'
run a business, have financial skills and two or three years' consultancy
experience. 'Interpersonal skills are the most important because we are
trying to open the minds of people,' declared Sue Cheshire, executive
director of Hertfordshire TEC.
These paragons, actual or aspiring, seem thick on the ground. Walsall put
two advertisements in the regional press for its jobs and had nearly 400
applications.
