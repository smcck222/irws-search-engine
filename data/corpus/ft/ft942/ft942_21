FT  27 MAY 94 / Government to share coal illness liabilities in sell-off:
Bid battle expected in all regions as DTI removes obstacle to privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is backing down from its insistence that coal pit buyers
should shoulder all liabilities for the industrial illness of employees it
takes on from British Coal. The shift may remove one of the remaining
obstacles to privatising the industry.
The retreat came after intense pressure from prospective bidders, who warned
that a continuing hard line by ministers would have deterred bidding. The
government has now agreed in principle to share some the liabilities,
although it is still to work out the exact details.
The dispute over industrial illness is the most serious of several involving
liabilities.
Prospective bidders also want assurances that the government will underwrite
environmental liabilities resulting from water leakage and site pollution.
Ministers believe an accommodation is achievable.
It emerged yesterday that there might be stiff competition for the five
regions to be sold this year.
NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government on coal
privatisation, announced that 33 parties had submitted applications to
qualify for bidding. Some of the applications are for the six stand-alone
pits also on offer. Nevertheless, a bid battle involving at least three
rival companies and consortia is expected in each of the five regions.
Mr Keith Palmer, Rothschild managing director, said he was pleased with the
range and number of applications, but would not say who had made them and
which regions and pits they were for.
However, it is understood that overseas companies, including some from
Australia, are among the applicants. Interest from North America is believed
to be less than had been hoped.
The applicants, who paid Pounds 15,000 to 'pre-qualify' for bidding for each
region and Pounds 6,000 for each stand-alone pit, have until September to
decide whether to bid.
They will welcome the decision on illness liabilities, having warned that
companies would have been uninsurable without it. According to lawyers
acting for Nacods, the pit deputies union, claims from former miners
suffering from work-related sicknesses may exceed Pounds 5bn.
Previously, the government had suggested that private companies would have
to assume responsibility for work-related sickness of employees they take
over from British Coal, even if the causes of the illness related to
pre-privatisation days.
The Department of Trade and Industry would not comment in detail yesterday
on industrial illness liabilities, but stressed that all coal workers, past
and present, would be fully protected.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Pilkington drops licensing policy: Glassmaker bows to
pressure as US steps up anti-trust battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington, the UK glass maker, agreed yesterday to make far-reaching
changes in its technology licensing policy in what is the first application
of an aggressive US anti-trust policy beyond US borders.
The company agreed with the US Justice Department to end restrictions on
licensees for the use of its float glass technology, which has kept
Pilkington at the top of the world plate glass industry for 30 years.
The Justice Department said the agreement, which must still be approved by a
US federal judge, would 'break a licensing stranglehold on glass
manufacturing that kept American companies from designing and building
glassmaking plants overseas'.
Pilkington said the agreement 'would have no material impact', apart from
the potential loss of less than Pounds 1m a year in licensing fees. However,
the case sets a precedent for the ability of the US government to influence
the activities of foreign companies in international markets.
'We are satisfied with this arrangement which protects a large body of
technology developed by the group,' said Sir Robin Nicholson, the company's
technology director.
Pilkington earned pre-tax profits of Pounds 40.7m on sales of Pounds 2.5bn
during the year to March 31 1993. Of that, about Pounds 10m is thought to
have come from licence fees. Pilkington's shares rose 1 1/2 p to 188p
yesterday. According to the company, the agreement means US glass makers
using pre-1983 technology under licence from Pilkington will now be able to
sub-license the technology to any company in a foreign country, subject to
certain confidentiality agreements.
Pilkington said it retains the rights to later technology not subject to
licence agreements with US companies. The deal averts a potentially costly
battle in the US although Pilkington still faces several civil suits.
Justice Department officials said the settlement might enable US companies
to win contracts for as many as half of the estimated 50 plate glass plants
that are expected to be built over the next six years, mostly in eastern
Europe and south-east Asia, and increase US exports by up to Dollars 1.25bn
over the period.
The case represents not only a new aggressiveness in the Clinton
administration's enforcement of anti-trust law but also a new willingness to
pursue claims against foreign companies outside the US.
Under the Reagan administration, the Justice Department said it would pursue
anti-trust cases overseas only if US consumers were affected, but that
policy was reversed in 1992 to allow action if US exports were damaged. The
Pilkington case is the first to be brought under the new policy.
The Justice Department said Pilkington had imposed tough restraints on
companies which bought licences for its technology, including allegedly
limiting them to specific countries and restricting sub-licenses.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to pull the Comcast and General Cable flotations is being
blamed on 'market conditions'. The same excuse will probably be given if
TeleWest is pulled this morning. But it will take more than an improvement
in the market to resuscitate plans to float the cable industry.
Investors who have been burnt on Eurotunnel will need reassuring that
discounted cash flow calculations are more solid this time round. They will
also want to know why the valuations being sought in cable share issues are
much higher than the prices trade buyers have recently paid for franchises.

FT  27 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
High profile management changes at Storehouse have done no service to the
company's share price. This year it has merely level-pegged the sector,
despite the group's evident recovery prospects. The new management needs a
period of stability to deliver the growth of which BHS in particular ought
to be capable. Yesterday's annual results provide a reasonable starting
point even if a lower rental charge flattered BHS's profits by about Pounds
6m. Group profit before exceptional items was up by 48 per cent. Mothercare
is recovering nicely, though there is still plenty of room for higher
margins.
While rivals such as Burton are grappling with the consequences of
extravagant expansion in the 1980's, Storehouse has the room and the
resources to expand the BHS chain. It is both under-represented in British
shopping centres compared with Marks &amp; Spencer and generates about half the
revenue per square foot. Progress admittedly may be slow. Only three new
store openings are planned this year but higher volume should add to the
benefit of much needed group-wide purchasing efficiencies.
The tricky part lies in developing an image of BHS as a store shoppers visit
for more than just casual purchases. That will require marketing flair as
well as disciplined management. If Storehouse can achieve that, it would
deserve to out-perform.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless shareholders will hope that Lord Young, group chairman, has
greater success in the great China telecommunications lottery than he had in
his UK lottery bid. The potential jackpot could be huge: a central role
developing China's exploding telecommunications market. Lord Young was full
of optimism at C&amp;W's preliminary results yesterday. China planned to expand
the number of telephone lines from 40m now to 114m by the end of the
century, he said. It was no longer a question of if but rather of when the
market would be opened to foreigners. C&amp;W had been told it would be China's
preferred partner when that happened.
Still, the jackpot is not in the bag. Though C&amp;W hopes for some opening of
the China market this year, the timing of liberalisation is uncertain.
Though Lord Young continues to hob-nob with top Chinese politicians, the
risk of that good relationship being damaged by the ongoing dispute between
UK and China remains. And even if C&amp;W gets its foot through the door first,
others such as AT&amp;T will be in hot pursuit.
Outside China, the group's prospects are rather dim. Tougher competition and
vigorous price-cutting will prevent profits at Mercury rising much in the
current year. Given C&amp;W's low gearing of 12 per cent, stepped-up investment
in new projects is likely in the next year or two. But C&amp;W still has to
prove that it can earn good returns outside Hong Kong.

FT  27 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel bridges the gap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a miracle of financial as well as civil engineering that Eurotunnel
has come this far. With its third round of funding secured, the project at
least has the chance to be tested against alternative forms of transport in
the open market. But it is too early to hail Eurotunnel as a triumph for
private-sector funding; that would require all capital providers to receive
adequate compensation for their risk. While the banks are earning a healthy
interest margin on their loans, it is not yet clear that shareholders will
see a decent return.
With construction now completed, further disappointment on costs looks
remote. But the revenue Eurotunnel will generate remains a matter for
educated guesswork. The latest financing package includes Pounds 500m leeway
in case revenues fall short of the company's projections. Still, a revenue
shortfall of more than 17 per cent between now and 1998 could leave the
company short of cash. That would push dividends back beyond 2004. Without
hard evidence of the business Eurotunnel can attract, the possibility cannot
be ruled out.
The next 18 months, including the first full summer season, will be
critical. With its enormous fixed costs, Eurotunnel would have little option
but to react if price competition from the ferries left it running well
below capacity. Tourist traffic outside the summer season is especially
price-sensitive. While ferry operators have little incentive to start a
price war, it remains an open question whether Eurotunnel's current pricing
strategy will fill its expensive pipe.
If revenue exceeds expectations in the early years, though, Eurotunnel could
equally lock into a virtuous circle. High borrowing costs are the penalty
for relying on private-sector funding. An average interest cost of over 9
per cent on Pounds 7bn bank debt - and a whopping initial 2.5 per cent
margin over interbank rates on its latest loan - leaves precious little for
shareholders. While Eurotunnel's forecasts already assume a modest reduction
in borrowing costs, a credible cash flow would greatly strengthen its
negotiating position with the banks.
Dividends might then come earlier than expected. With a year or two of solid
cash flow for comfort, institutional investors might also reduce the rate at
which dividends are discounted in their theoretical valuations of the
shares. The combination could have a dramatic impact on the share price. A
victory for Eurotunnel in its tariff dispute with the railways would be
icing on the cake. But having been so sorely disappointed on costs, sceptics
are not inclined to take revenue projections on trust. Institutional
investors cajoled into underwriting the rights issue will see no pressing
need for closer involvement.

A monthly publication out of the Hemington Scott stable, it will analyse

Good food and drink can help the delicate process of negotiation, in
business as in diplomacy - but surely entertaining the warring Bosnian
factions at the famous Pere Bise restaurant in Talloires is going a bit far?
The three Bosnian delegations - Serbs, Croats and Moslems - together with
the five-nation group from the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -
have requisitioned four top hotels in the picturesque resort on Lake Annecy.
None of this comes cheap. Dining out at Pere Bise can cost up to Pounds 100
a head - and that's without wine.
Talloires was chosen ostensibly because the resort can effectively be sealed
off from the disruptive attentions of journalists and camera crews. Even so,
nothing much is expected to come out of the discussions.
Perhaps that's not surprising. If aggression is rewarded so handsomely, why
not go on fighting?

To veterans of the international tin crisis, Bruce Leeming will be a
familiar name. The former managing director of Rudolf Wolff, one of the
London Metal Exchange brokers much mauled in the tin crisis of the
mid-1980s, quit his post in acrimony at the time.
Now he is about to burst on to the world in what he hopes will be a
controversial new guise. His first published work, An Anger Bequeathed, is
due out next week - and pretty steamy stuff it is, too. Billed as 'a novel
of lust and high ideals', it tells of Harriot (sic) Murray, a highly
competitive and sexually voracious woman seeking revenge for past
exploitation by men.
Leeming - who has written several unpublished novels, including a libellous
thriller about the tin crisis, and copious haiku poetry - drew on family
history for his new oeuvre. But he says Harriot is 'wholly imaginary' and
insists that she bears no resemblance to anybody at the LME, past or
present.

Lord Lawson's desire to secure the secretary-generalship of the OECD seems
to have provoked an uncharacteristic outbreak of diplomacy on the part of
the former British chancellor, if his performance yesterday at the Royal
Institute of International Affairs is anything to go by.
Even Walter Eltis, a free-market guru from the DTI, couldn't get him to
blame Europe's high unemployment on its hopeless industrial and social
policies. 'People do have a choice whether to reap the rewards of their
efforts through more generous social provisions, or by having more money in
their own pockets.' Lawson knows he needs the votes of those dreadful
high-taxing, high-spending, interventionist Social-Christian-Democrat
European governments.
Then there is the tricky little matter of the highly unflattering portrait
he paints of the OECD in his memoirs. The strictures were 'perhaps too
harsh, but I believe they contained a kernel of truth'. Anyway, he had been
referring not to the diligent economists, but to the ministerial meetings
(like the one next month that may or may not elect him).
Given half the chance, he would 'find a way of making those meetings more
worthwhile'.

Seve Ballesteros may be miffed that having brought the 1997 Ryder Cup to
Spain, the biennial international golf match staged between Europe and the
US will not be played on his own Sancti Petri course near Cadiz. But Spain's
Foreign Ministry is as pleased as punch.
Valderrama, the chosen venue, is home to one of Spain's secret diplomatic
weapons in its long-running dispute to retake Gibraltar from the Brits.
Sotogrande, the huge Mediterranean luxury estate that surrounds the
Valderrama links, is next door to Gibraltar, and is tempting an increasing
number of golf-crazy Gibraltarians to desert the British fastness.
Moving into a Sotogrande mansion gives immediate access to three golf
courses, including Valderrama, and two polo grounds, as well as rubbing
shoulders with the Cartiers, Hennessy's and with Valderrama owner Jaime
(Jimmy) Ortiz-Patino whose grandfather was the king of Bolivian tin mines.
Shares in Sotogrande shot up to a year's high on news of the Ryder Cup win.
All that is required now is for Madrid and London to settle their historic
squabble and end a ban on domestic flights from Spain to the Rock's airport.
It is not only Seve and his golf-crazy father-in-law, Emilio Botin, chairman
of Banco Santander, who want to avoid a long drive to the Valderrama links.
Expect an early breakthrough on the diplomatic front.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Through a market, darkly: Is the fear that derivatives are a
multi-billion accident waiting to happen justified?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this year Kashima Oil, a Japanese company, found that it had lost
Dollars 1.5bn in foreign exchange derivative trading. Germany's
Metallgesellschaft lost Dollars 1.4bn in oil derivatives, while US consumer
products giant Procter &amp; Gamble lost a more modest Dollars 102m on interest
rate contracts. Hardly a week goes by without another expensive mishap in
the use of derivatives - instruments such as swaps, futures and options
whose value is 'derived' from more conventional financial assets.
Such stories explain the bad press received by derivatives traders. They
appear to strengthen the case of the US General Accounting Office, which
last week called for tougher regulation to address gaps in the system. Nor
do the counter-arguments of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday seem likely to damp the fear in Congress that derivatives are a
multi-billion accident waiting to overwhelm the financial system.
Are the fears justified? And how precisely does the trade in derivatives
change the way the monetary and financial systems operate?
Where monetary policy is concerned, the chief question is whether widespread
hedging deprives interest rate changes of the impact they used to have in a
derivative-free system. Since derivatives trading is, from a macro-economic
perspective, a zero-sum game, the issue would not arise if the trade were
purely domestic. For every trader who hedged, there would be a counterparty
with an equal and opposite exposure.
But the market is global, making it possible that an increase in US interest
rates might, for example, produce a weak response in the US, while
tightening policy in Japan. This would happen if Japanese institutions
proved to be net insurers of their US counterparties against such a rise.
Yet generalisations on this score are fraught with difficulty, not least
because so many other factors affect an economy's sensitivity to interest
rate changes. And in practice no one did predict the global market shake-out
wrought by a mere quarter-point increase in US rates in February.
The speed and extent of the bond market plunge may have been compounded by
the use of derivative instruments, which can be used to assume risk, as well
as to reduce risk. Their unique characteristic is the ability to create
exposure to a market cheaply, for either purpose, in terms of the investor's
cash outlay - leverage, in a word.
But the market crunch in February primarily reflected a misplaced unanimity
of view about market trends, magnified by old-fashioned leverage in the
shape of bank borrowing. Investors experienced what John Heimann, a former
US comptroller of the currency now resident at Merrill Lynch, describes as a
worldwide margin call.
At the micro-economic level the most striking feature of derivatives is that
they have grown like topsy (see charts) because they satisfy a need.
Following the break-up of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system in
the early 1970s and the deregulation of banking, the task of stabilising
markets has, in effect, been privatised. Banks, corporations, investors and
governments have to insure against volatility.
Yet the task of providing insurance to end-users - those who seek to hedge
the risks that volatility poses for their business - has increasingly been
complemented by the explosive growth of proprietary trading, dominated by a
handful of giant commercial and investment banks, a phenomenon explored in
an earlier article*.
The joy, from the banks' point of view, is the sheer extent of the potential
for hedging, especially in the over-the-counter markets where banks offer
customised (and thus high-margin) products to end-users. Scope for growth
outside formal exchanges, says Leo Melamed, a founding father of the Chicago
financial futures markets, 'is limited only by the imagination'.
Derivatives trading thus provides an answer to two of the banks' biggest
problems: the loss of large corporate clients after the third-world debt
crisis and the blow to the profitability of their conventional business
arising from the globalisation of markets, rapid technological change and
financial deregulation. The margins in orthodox financial intermediation -
deposit-taking and lending - are now woefully thin and companies are
increasingly reluctant to pay large fees for investment banking services.
'I invite anyone,' says Salomon Brothers' chairman and chief executive
officer, Deryck Maughan, 'to point to a fee that's gone up in the past 10
years. Fees only decline. If adequate returns to capital are to be
maintained, it will be a trading world.'
In this competitive maelstrom where frenetically mobile capital seeks out
the highest global returns, off-balance sheet derivatives trading is the
equivalent of alchemists' gold. Institutions can offer a pure broking
service. Or, more profitably, they may put the deal on their own books and
look for a counterparty with offsetting risk management needs.
At one end of the proprietary spectrum are those who do low-risk,
high-volume arbitrage business, taking a small margin from balancing the
odds like the bank in a casino. At the other are those who take large
speculative positions, hedged in varying degrees.
The risks are little different from those traditionally run by banks and
insurance companies. They include market risk (vulnerability to fluctuating
prices); counterparty credit risk (the threat of default by the other party
to the contract); liquidity risk (where the financial instrument cannot
quickly be replaced at close to its fundamental value); and operational risk
(failures of internal control, including computer systems or fraud).
Yet many of the larger losses incurred to date, such as those on local
authority swaps in the UK, have stemmed from legal risk, where one party was
not authorised to conduct such business.
The worry about derivatives lies less in the nature of the risks being run,
than the wider market context, which is dangerously opaque. The report of an
internal working group of the Bank of England concluded last year that the
unsupervised status of some of the large players in the system 'does
represent a supervisory hole at the very heart of the derivatives markets'.
That looks prescient in the light of the scale of derivatives dealing by
unsupervised hedge funds that has become apparent this year. Note, too, that
much of the US investment banks' derivatives dealing is conducted through
unsupervised, special-purpose subsidiaries, to which the credit rating
agencies have granted higher ratings than those of the parent bank. Some
central bankers question whether this artificial structure, despite numerous
inbuilt safety devices, would stand up in a financial fire-storm.
Still more striking is the absence of adequate information about
counterparties. Disclosure practice has lagged behind market developments,
with the result that balance sheets have been drained of meaning. The
creditors of Kashima Oil, for example, might have thought that they were
dealing with a company that was exposed to fluctuations in oil prices. Yet
it turned out to be a foreign exchange dealer, running currency risks on a
scale that wiped out its capital.
Nor can published bank balance sheets convey an adequate picture of the
risks being run, since derivative positions change minute by minute in the
markets. Meantime, corporate giants like Procter &amp; Gamble that run
derivative-intensive treasury operations as a profit centre have, in effect,
taken a conglomerate move into marketmaking. Yet it is rarely made apparent
to shareholders or creditors whether derivatives are being used to hedge or
to speculate. All that is clear, says one leading US derivatives trader, is
that the profit-centre mentality always leads to trouble.
An accountancy profession that is increasingly preoccupied with making money
out of consultancy has been slow to respond to the biggest challenge to
historic cost accounting since inflation accelerated in the 1960s. The
problem is that derivatives incorporate big assumptions about the future.
Options, in particular, are difficult to value since, as their name implies,
they are options that may or may not be exercised, not firm commitments to
deal at a fixed future price.
The discipline that the big banks have invented to deal with such problems
is 'marking to market' - writing commitments up or down in line with market
prices. Yet with over-the-counter derivatives, there is no real market.
Instead there are complex computer valuations based on assumptions about
probability, volatility and future costs. William McDonough, president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, worries that market prices may not
fully reflect the illiquidity of the more complex derivatives. Certainly
experience has shown that liquidity in over-the-counter markets can
evaporate in a panic.
In this twilight world everyone depends heavily on the rating agencies. Yet
Moody's, for one, admits that a large proportion of outstanding contracts
are too new for it to feel sure that the risks are low. Balance sheets full
of derivatives appear more liquid than ones full of conventional bank loans.
The credit risk is only a fraction of the notional amount of the derivatives
(see table). But there has to be a question mark over the derivatives
traders' capital adequacy until the business has been tested over a longer
period - and a worry that traders are relying on the presence of a central
bank lender of last resort as they take otherwise excessive risks.
The system of checks and balances within individual organisations is
crucial. The big players, most of whom follow the risk management
recommendations of the Group of 30 banking think-tank, have spent heavily on
systems and skills. The investment appears to have paid off in the upheaval
of the past three months when arithmetical assumptions about correlations
between markets broke down. At Bankers Trust, a derivatives market leader,
more was lost in the cash markets than in derivatives, says vice-chairman
George Vojta.
Most central bankers claim that the probability that the mispricing of risks
in derivatives could lead to a systemic shock is low, but cannot be ignored.
They also worry that lack of information about exposures could exacerbate a
financial crisis; and that complex derivative linkages across global markets
could then make the contagion hard to contain. The General Accounting
Office, meantime, questions whether it is appropriate for heavy proprietary
trading in derivatives to be supported by insured deposits, which may
encourage participants in excessive risk-taking.
The more obvious threat is simply to individual firms, especially those at
one remove from the mainstream. The failure of Kidder Peabody's senior
management, auditors and traders to detect the phoney profits declared by
top trader Joseph Jett was an astonishing collapse of corporate governance.
Such problems are acute where traders' performance is assessed for bonus
purposes over shorter periods than the life of the outstanding derivative
contracts which they have put on their firm's books.
As Martin Mayer at the Brookings Institution think-tank points out,
risk-shifting instruments also have a way of pushing risks on to those least
able to absorb them. This is born out by Douglas Morris, senior policy
adviser to the comptroller of the currency. He points to a US bank with only
Dollars 200m of assets which acquired a structured note carrying an exposure
to the swings of the peseta and D-Mark against the dollar. After adverse
swings, the note yields no income and has lost a fifth of its value.
That is symptomatic of the enormous conflicts of interest built into a
system in which own-account trading is pervasive. As a leading banker in the
Euromarkets puts it, with only mild exaggeration, 90 per cent of the work of
big investment banks is now unprofitable and serves only as a loss-leader
for highly profitable proprietary trading. Caveat emptor is thus a
categorical imperative for end-users.
It would make no sense to protect Procter &amp; Gamble. Handling the banks is a
more difficult matter. Derivatives are a valuable addition to the financial
armoury. The real problems, both for individual banks and the system, are
about opacity, leverage and lack of managerial competence. Central bankers
will have to be on their mettle if that potentially lethal combination is
not to lead to trouble.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Leading Article: India's rupee dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
India is caught in what has become a familiar dilemma for liberalising
developing countries. An unexpected inflow of foreign capital is making it
difficult to hold down the exchange rate. The choice in the short term lies
between resurgent inflation and curtailment of fragile export success. So
far, the government has, in effect, chosen to risk the inflation. It must
find a better solution.
In the financial year ending March 1994, India received some Dollars 4bn in
portfolio capital, along with Dollars 600m in foreign direct investment. It
also registered a small current account surplus, partly because the value of
exports rose 21 per cent in US dollars and partly because imports stagnated.
The inflow helped produce an increase of Dollars 8.7bn in foreign exchange
reserves, as the authorities struggled to keep the rupee at 31 to the US
dollar.
For a country that recently stood on the brink of default, increased foreign
exchange reserves are welcome, but not in excess. Monetary growth has risen
from a recent low of 5 per cent in the year to May 1993, to 18 per cent in
the year to January 1994. This has helped raise inflation to the unpopular
rate of 11 per cent.
Holding down the exchange rate through foreign exchange intervention can
only be a temporary expedient. Unless the monetary effects are sterilised,
the real exchange rate will appreciate through inflation, rather than
through upward adjustment of the nominal value of the rupee. There can be no
enduring advantage in that, particularly given the damage done by inflation
in India.
Imports increase
The dilemma might vanish spontaneously. But provided reforms continue, this
is unlikely to result from rapid dwindling of the capital inflow itself.
Much more desirable would be a substantial increase in imports, as economic
growth accelerates. Faster growth of industrial output was already
observable by late-1993. This should continue. Nevertheless, the ministry of
finance expects the current account deficit this financial year to be only
US Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn, insufficient to offset a capital inflow like
last year's.
Efforts could be made to lower the attractiveness of the capital inflows.
One possibility is to reduce the return on deposits by non-residents;
another is to restrict the access of Indian companies to foreign capital;
yet another would be to restrict inflows of foreign portfolio capital.
All such measures would be undesirable. India's potential as a destination
for foreign capital has, after all, barely been scratched. Vast and poor,
India needs to find ways of using such capital. This is particularly true of
foreign direct investment, actively encouraged by the prime minister himself
earlier this week.
Faster reduction
If the inflows were neither to cease spontaneously nor be stopped, attempts
could be made to curb their effects. One option, currently being tried, is
to curb monetary expansion through changes in cash reserve requirements.
Another is to try to sterilise the inflow through open market operations by
the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank.
Best of all, however, would be to see the inflow as both reward and
opportunity. A faster reduction in the fiscal deficit than that planned by
the finance minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, could help offset the inflationary
effects. Above all, accelerated import liberalisation would directly absorb
foreign exchange. The central government faces a dilemma here, because
customs duties contribute 40 per cent of its revenues. The solution is a
reform designed to increase imports, along with changes to the fiscal
system, to reduce dependence on customs duties.
It would be a massive policy failure for India to be unable to absorb a few
billion dollars, without letting exports be crowded out or suffering from
needless inflation. These resources must be absorbed in a non-inflationary
way, instead. The outside world has become increasingly concerned about the
will of the Indian government to sustain stabilisation and press on with
radical reform. Mr Singh has recently restated both commitments. How the
government copes with the opportunity presented by the present glut of
foreign exchange will help show whether it is to be taken seriously.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Labour looks for a leader
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's leadership contest will be gripping for reasons beyond a sporting
interest in the fate of well-known politicians. The winner will take over a
party well ahead in the opinion polls, following a selection process
democratised to the point that it is rather like the primaries of the United
States. Just as those produce potential presidents, so the Labour primary
will produce a potential prime minister.
It is therefore remarkable that the party has so far conducted itself with
such uncharacteristic restraint. Potential candidates have been asked not to
declare their hands until June 10, the day after the European elections.
That leaves 40 days for open canvassing before the results are announced on
July 21. This has not prevented anyone from campaigning behind the scenes,
but the delay of a few weeks before the contest formally begins may be
salutary. It has encouraged most supporters of the aspirants to conduct
themselves with decorum. The electorate may be spared the dogfights that
attended the selection of Mr James Callaghan and Mr Neil Kinnock.
This is a credit both to the legacy of party unity left by the late Mr John
Smith and to the competence of the acting leader, Mrs Margaret Beckett. Mrs
Beckett has also persuaded the party's national executive to call a
concurrent contest for the deputy leadership, a post she won in tandem with
Mr Smith. She will therefore attract votes for apparently putting party
before self. This should all but guarantee her re-election as deputy leader,
and win her some support for the idea that she herself should be the new
leader, should she enter the fray. The contest, and the debate on the
party's future, is wide open.
Blair ahead
It is a debate that should be pursued with vigour. Various polls have
confirmed that Mr Tony Blair is the most popular of the undeclared
candidates. His lead is deserved, but it would be wrong to arrange a mere
coronation. Mr Blair is insufficiently tested in the heat of close-fought
battle. He has stood his ground for a radical view of trade union law, he
has brought credibility to Labour's stance on crime and he has worked hard
to identify an underpinning theme for Labour, based upon the maximum freedom
for individuals within the framework of shared community interests. Little,
however, is known of his approach to industrial, financial, or economic
policy, not to mention topics such as foreign affairs and defence. Nor has
Mr Blair ever moved into the open with views about the potential for
collaboration between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
True debate
A potential prime minister need not be possessed of detailed prescriptions
for every problem, but he or she does need clear indication of the positions
of principle from which to start every discussion of government action. On
too many issues, it is unclear where Labour stands. Has it resolved its
internal differences? Is it as free of excessive trade union influence as,
say, the German social democrats, or the US Democratic party? What kind of
European vision will it pursue? Where does it define the limits of the
state?
These and other questions must be addressed in the leadership contest.
Labour needs the adrenalin of true policy debate, if it is to excite voters
rather than stand as the passive recipient of their contempt for a divided
Conservative party. The candidates have been listed as of the left or right
persuasion, or the traditionalist or moderniser wing of the party. Such
labels can be useful, but they do not cover the complexity of the
personalities involved. As shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown has sought to
rid the party of its ancient penchant for devaluation, high taxation and
high spending. Yet he still speaks as if he were a traditionalist with roots
in the old left. Mr Robin Cook is a candidate of the left, but his clever
wit and sharp tongue can give his pronouncements a market flavour. Mr John
Prescott is a traditionalist who enjoys mocking the modernisers.
If Mr Blair is to win both the leadership and a subsequent general election
he must demonstrate that he has a substantial, modernising vision, alongside
the courage to take risks. And he must carry the party with him. Labour will
serve no one's interest if it elects only a telegenic front man.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: CAP fraud is too costly to pursue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Like your correspondent Peter Marsh (European News Digest, May 25) I,
too, heard the House of Lords European communities committee question Mr Jo
Carey, former president of the European Court of Auditors.
It was all too clear that the noble Lords do not yet understand the two main
reasons for the escalating Common Agricultural Policy frauds.
First, fraud becomes ever easier given the lax controls, exacerbated by the
May 1992 McSharry (so-called) reforms which have now brought fraud 'down to
the farm'.
But second, and dominantly, there is no incentive for any European
government to expose fraud by its own nationals. The present EU rules mean
that upon exposure of the fraud the government concerned has to make full
reparation to the EU and then try to reclaim this from the fraudster.
Politicians are thus content to believe that CAP fraud amounts to 'only'
Pounds 150m rather than the actual Pounds 6bn as estimated by Mr Carey's
successor as court president.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Putting their house in order: Plans to solve east German
property disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of bitter wrangling and court actions, Germany's
Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, has agreed measures to compensate
former property owners in east Germany.
Approval by the Bundesrat, the upper house, could pave the way for speedier
investment in the east, which has been held up by unresolved questions over
property rights.
Under the terms of the unification treaty of 1990, those whose property was
confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945 or by the communists between
1949 and 1990 are entitled to restitution or compensation. The law caused
havoc. Many east Germans who thought they had legally acquired their homes
after the establishment of the former German Democratic Republic in 1949
were faced with former owners returning and, in some cases, evicting them.
Those claimants who did not want their property back could seek
compensation. Yet for more than three years, the government has been unable
to agree on the levels of payment.
Under the new measures, individuals would be entitled to compensation based
on the value of the property (including houses, shops, farmland) in 1935.
The figure would be multiplied several times, depending on whether the
property in question is simply land, or includes housing or a business. In
addition, compensation would be issued in the form of government bonds, not
redeemable until 2004.
'Dispossessed' property owners may complain that the level of payment
neither reflects the current market value of the property, nor compensates
for the amount of income lost over the past 55 years. But their complaints
pale when compared with those of the ' '45-49ers'.
The ' '45-49ers' comprise property owners whose land was expropriated by the
Soviet authorities which, between 1945 and 1949, administered east Germany.
Many belonged to the Prussian aristocracy and supported Hitler during the
second world war. Others, however, joined the German resistance movement. As
the Russians consolidated their grip on the east, many were either sent to
prison camps, given two days to leave their homes, or banned from within 14
miles of their property. Most of the 14,000 families which were forced to
flee settled in west Germany. Their land was divided and parcelled out to
Germans escaping from Poland and other east European countries.
In a reunited Germany several hundred families now want to come back. But
under the terms of the unification treaty, they have neither the right to
compensation nor restitution.
The West German government, along with Mr Hans Modrow, east Germany's last
Communist party leader, and Mr Lothar de Maiziere, its last prime minister,
refused any right of return or compensation for those dispossessed between
1945 and 1949. They claimed in the Constitutional Court in April 1991 that
the price of Soviet agreement to German unification was Bonn's unquestioning
acceptance of Moscow's 1945-49 administration of east Germany, including its
expropriation policy.
This claim is challenged by former east German property owners. 'There is
simply no evidence of these preconditions (to unification),' said Mr
Albrecht Wendenberg, who is trying to regain his property in the eastern
state of Saxony-Anhalt. The land his family owned is being sold by the
Treuhand privatisation agency.
He is not alone in criticising the government's stance. There is growing
opposition from former landowners in east Germany, many of whom support
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic Union. The proposed
measures may go some way towards meeting their objectives because they may
win the right to buy back a small percentage of their property. But they
will only be allowed to buy back 12 acres out of every 40, for example, or
60 acres out of every 500. As the acreage rises, the percentage of land for
purchase shrinks.
Mr Mortimer von Maltzahn, whose family had owned estates in Mecklenburg, the
northern state of east Germany, since the 14th century, has spent DM4.3m
(Pounds 1.72m) buying back 100 acres of his 7,000-acre estate and repairing
his Schloss, or manor. He had to promise the local council that, in return
for getting back the family's private church, he would repair the
delapidated building at his own expense.
Some have formed limited companies, enabling them to buy back some of their
own land from the Treuhand, provided they invest in the region. Others have
obtained 12-year leases from the Treuhand in the hope they will have the
option to buy after the lease expires.
Some families say the compensation proposals continue to treat property
owners unequally before the law. Ms Anna-Tatiana Bauer said her family did
not even have the right to reclaim the family church, or the graveyard. 'It
is truly a disgrace,' she said.
But the ' '45-49ers' cannot count on public support. The government cannot
afford to compensate them for the loss of their property. Critics oppose the
return of the 'Junker' landowners, as they are pejoratively known. They
argue that their passivity allowed the rise of Hitler. East Germans
generally want nothing to do with them because ideological indoctrination
has taught them that every Junker is a feudal aristocrat or a Nazi
supporter.
Ironically, it is the far-right Republican party in east Germany which is
playing the 'Junker card' in the run-up to the local, state and federal
elections. Mr Lothar Bisky, the head of the social-democratic Party of
Democratic Socialists, the successor to the former east German Communist
party, says it would be dangerous to ignore their actions.
In towns throughout Mecklenburg and Brandenburg, and in Berlin, the
Republicans are dropping leaflets. Their message is clear. They tell east
Germans that their property is threatened and could fall into the hands of
west Germans. The Republicans are opposed to any restitution and the return
of former property owners, blaming unification for this trend. A recent
leaflet proclaimed: 'The Republicans are patriotic. We are the only
patriotic and social German party which stands for full solidarity of the
east Germans and the protection of their property.'
'We don't know how big their support is,' said Mr Bisky. 'But property
rights is one of the planks of their platform. I am afraid of them, because
I feel we have completely messed up the whole question of compensation and
restitution. But it is too late to redress the mistakes of unification.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confucius reigns in Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES EDMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'Changing cultures of capitalism' (May 23), Samuel Brittan endorses
the assertion that 'few Taiwanese entrepreneurs are steeped in the Confucian
classics'.
I beg to differ. On my first day of company visits in Taiwan, as a member of
a party of foreign investors, I met the chairman of Tatung Co  - one of
Taiwan's largest and most progressive corporations. He opened the
proceedings by presenting each of us with a copy of the Analects of
Confucius - with each tract set out in English and Japanese as well as the
original Chinese. This was presented as the best introduction on how to
conduct business in Taiwan. It has certainly been invaluable to me in
providing insights into economic life in Taipei. Tatung also endows its own
high school and university.
Many local investment analysts and economists - whose London counterparts
have been termed 'teenage scribblers' - have impressed me with their
knowledge of the Analects.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Throw the rascals out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world will probably seem pretty gloomy to the government a fortnight
from now. Pause a moment, while we rub our hands in glee. The big day is
Friday June 10. The Tories expect to wake up on that morning to news of the
loss of their formerly safe seat of Eastleigh to the Liberal Democrats.
Better yet, they may find that their candidate, their sacrificial lamb, has
been beaten into third place behind Labour. The weekend papers will be full
of talk about alternative leaders of the Labour party, perhaps spiced by
musings on the future of the prime minister.
The results of the elections to the European Parliament will follow. We will
see the great match taking shape: a revived opposition vs a flagging
government. It may become harder than ever to believe that the Conservatives
can recover sufficient support to win a fifth general election, even in the
nearly three years still available to them.
Good. They deserve to be thrashed. I say this in the electoral rather than
the Singaporean sense, you understand. Those of us who doubt the efficacy of
corporal punishment should not change our principles, not even in the case
of Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Mr Patten's sense of honour may
be measured by his retailing earlier this week of what he said was said to
him in a private conversation in a railway carriage. So much for the
gentleman who preaches to the nation's children about moral standards. This
is the kind of thing that gives hypocrisy a bad name.
It is not, however, a reason for encouraging the Conservatives to leave
office. If the bad manners of one particular minister were the problem, the
solution would be simple. The case for throwing all the rascals out is more
complicated. To appreciate it, step back a bit. After 1979 the gov-ernment
of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher undid much of the damage wrought by the
Labour administration that preceded it. She vanquished the trade unions,
initiated the rolling pri-vatisation of industry, and taught us that simple
book-keeping is a necessary skill in all walks of life and all institutions.
Her successor has curbed inflation, maintained Britain's position at the
Maastricht negotiations on the European Union, and established rapport with
Dublin on the future of Northern Ire-land. These achievements, among others,
deserve recognition. The balance of advantage, however, has turned.
Today the prime minister is struggling to manage an unruly coalition of what
should be separate parties. The government is unable to do very much, beyond
blather. It promises a green paper on this and lists existing policies in a
white paper on that. Here a charter, there an inquiry, everywhere a working
party. It is a ministry of paper initiatives, a taxpayer-financed agency for
self-advertisement. Civil servants are unwilling to propose very much, and
determined not to write down what they do discuss. The urge to further
radicalism may be genuine, but the performance is disappointing.
If that were all, there would be little cause for complaint. The government
could be said to be in a state of do-nothing equilibrium, a minimalist's
ideal. Sadly, that is not all. 'Do-nothing' is often a harmful choice.
Do-something can be worse. Local government has been hobbled. The behaviour
of parliamentarians has brought political life into disrepute. Ministers
spend too much of their time dishing out money and jobs to favoured
individuals, companies or organisations. Fifteen years of continuous office
has resulted in the creation of a patronage state, as described in a report*
published on Monday by a pair of pressure groups, Charter 88 and Democratic
Audit.
The report suggests that there is now one executive quango for every 10,000
population, and that these bodies are responsible for nearly a third of
public spending. It may be right, if not precisely so. Let us halve the
authors' figures to eliminate any chance of exaggeration. The picture that
remains is startling. Britain is replete with opportunities for patronage,
secretive deal-making and good old fashioned corruption. We do not need a
democratic audit to prove this. Just observe. There stands the health
secretary, arms outstretched, guarding every health service trust from
public scrutiny, arousing suspicion by the zealousness with which she
defends the secrets of these spenders of our money.
The Conservatives have torn the heart out of the unwritten British
constitution. The democratic checks on executive power have been replaced in
the name of customer choice. What the latter phrase often means is
placemen's self-preservation. The irony is that the latest evidence of this
comes in a week when all three national parties have published manifestos
for the elections to the European Parliament. Labour and the Liberal
Democrats balance their views on possible reforms of EU institutions with
programmes for the restoration of civic life in Britain. Both summarise
their proposals for domestic constitutional reform in their Europe
manifestos.
Not the Tories. They will have none of it. They talk as if subsidiarity
stops at Calais. They cannot win elections to town halls, so they emasculate
local authorities. They are rejected by the Scots, but will not look at
Scottish self-government. 'A separate Scotland would be relegated to the
lower divisions of Europe,' says their manifesto.
This refusal to contemplate any improvement in our constitutional
arrangements applies to all areas of public life. They shy away from reform
of the House of Lords, although individual Tory peers are more sensible than
that. Simple improvements to House of Commons procedure make little headway.
Several suggestions of reform of the way bills are prepared have been made;
none accepted. The consequence is that more legislation is made in
amendments than in initial bills.
Conservatives need to think these matters through. They have run the country
as if they were in office forever. They govern by ever-increasing
centripetal force. Finding out what an unscrupulous administration of a
different political colour could do with the powers ministers have
accumulated for themselves would teach them a lesson, at our expense. We
must hope that Labour, which is still an unappetising alternative, makes
itself electable before we have to choose.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cost of executive share options
should be assessed on issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID RHOADS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Jack's article on US efforts to regulate executive compensation
provides a resounding wake-up call for UK companies.
Based on the US experience, unanswered calls for the self-regulation of
executive pay invites far more onerous steps by regulators; for example,
poor disclosure practices led the Securities and Exchange Commission to
require quoted companies to present extensive data for the highest-paid
executives. Meanwhile, a perceived lack of connection between executive pay
and performance prompted the Clinton administration to eliminate the tax
deductibility of 'non-performance based' pay in excess of Dollars 1m for top
executives of quoted companies. Finally, a history of inadequate share
scheme disclosure contributed to the US Financial Accounting Standards
Board's current efforts to impose an earnings charge for executive share
options. In the UK steps by the Accounting Standards Board and statements by
the Association of British Insurers/National Association of Pension Funds
are mild by comparison.
Self-regulation through the voluntary enhancement of pay disclosure
represents an attractive way to diffuse growing regulatory pressures.
Subjecting pay practices to 'the light of day' does wonders to limit abuse.
In addition, we have found that shareholders react favourably to the
disclosure of well-designed, performance-based executive pay schemes.
Finally, an earnings charge for share options is a bad idea. Share prices
already incorporate expectations concerning executive share option awards.

<BYLINE>
   From Dr MIKE STAUNTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your statement that 'options defy precise valuation' ('One option they
don't want', May 25) sits uneasily with the rather precise valuations of
London's financial futures and options exchange (Liffe) Equity Options
printed each day in another part of your newspaper. The Black-Scholes option
valuation model has been used for more than 20 years, and can easily be
programmed into a pocket calculator or a simple spreadsheet.
The only element that makes executive share options so difficult to value is
the lack of information regarding the option exercise price, maturity date
and current share price when issued. This means attention is now focused
instead on the information revealed when options are exercised (the large
payouts seen in the cases of BAe and LWT).
Were quoted companies required to provide sufficient information to allow
executive share options to be valued when issued, the cost of granting such
options would then be clear to shareholders.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Latvia an equally good role model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARIS OZOLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Steve Hanke's unqualified praise of Estonia's economic
reforms (Letters, May 23) and his exhortations that they be used as a model
for Russia, cannot be left without comment.
Latvia, Estonia's neighbour has adopted a contrary approach with regard to
the stability of its currency. The lat is free floating, its value having
been set (as was its predecessor's, the Latvian rouble) by the supply of
lats and western currency. For more than a year now, the lat has appreciated
against western currencies because of an oversupply of dollars. At the same
time, Latvia has achieved the lowest inflation in the Baltics (34.2 per
cent, March 1993-March 1994). Conversely, Estonia's inflation rate for March
1994 jumped to 8.9 per cent, higher even than Russia's.
As for the Estonian policy of shadowing another currency, Nigel Lawson, as
UK chancellor, made the mistake of also shadowing the D-Mark for too long
and when Britain joined the ERM, after a strained period, the pound received
its come-uppance on Black Wednesday.
The Estonian economy is the most successful of the former Soviet republics
but, similarly to Latvia at present, it is suffering from an overvalued
currency leading to difficulties with exporting and an increase in imports.
In Latvia's case, when it comes to paying for imports, payment will be in
western currency, the purchase of which will tend to lower the exchange rate
for the lat. Estonia, with its fixed rate, will have less room for
manoeuvre.
As can be seen then, there is more than one way to skin a cat and Estonia's
way will not necessarily bear fruit for Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin and Russia.
One should not forget, either, that both Estonia's and Latvia's decisions to
convert to their own currencies were frowned upon by the International
Monetary Fund at the time but the Balts proved that even holy cows can be
wrong. If Russia has enough confidence in its own policies, it should do
whatever it thinks is right and turn a blind eye to the critics.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID HEPPENSTALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to the problem of late payments to UK companies. I am financial
director of a medium-sized business, and I have also worked in credit
control in large and small companies.
My experience is that the perception that it is large well-established
organisations which hold back payments to small business is by and large
mistaken. This makes good press. But the problem is usually one of the
slow-paying smaller customer, sometimes operating on the margins of
solvency. This being the case, I am sceptical that much would be achieved by
legislation.
Reasonably prompt and regular payment can normally be expected from the
large customer, providing its invoicing requirements are followed. It is in
this area that the small business, having less skilled office staff and
without the help of a computer system, is often deficient.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Arts: Mixed feelings in 'Twelfth Night' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Part of what makes young Emma Fielding, the RSC's new Viola in Twelfth
Night, so captivating is that she is made up of contrasts. She is elfin,
tiny, vulnerable, with vast eyes; and yet she is forthright, living
intensely in the moment, with an inquiring little nose that is a vital part
of her profile, and an eager stance whereby her weight rests keenly on her
toes. This mix of opposites is why she was so heartcatching as Thomasina
when Stoppard's Arcadia was new; and no less so in Jonathan Kent's School
for Wives at the Almeida.
She is heartcatching again in Twelfth Night. Her voice is deep, strong, firm
(though she does not always enter words cleanly enough), until in an instant
some new thought renders it high, clear, light. This sudden illumination
from within is what makes Olivia lose her heart, when in male disguise Viola
tells her that she/he would 'call upon my soul within the house . . . And
make the babbling gossip of the air/ Cry out 'Olivia]'' And it is what halts
Orsino and confuses him when Viola/Cesario tells him that the history of her
father's daughter is 'A blank, my lord. She never told her love . . .'
She is surrounded here by a fine cast, but I am in two minds about the
production that frames them. Ian Judge, the director, tells the play's story
surely and briskly. Sometimes he is alert to its affecting shadows: the way
we see both Viola and her brother Sebastian is potent, as is the moment of
their final reunion. Sometimes, however, he treats it like the merest
artificial farce. The funereal cypress shadows of the text are absent. And
erotic affliction, which so possesses Orsino, Viola and Olivia, is never
serious.
Smiling charm abounds. The ending and the curtain-calls are as sweetly neat
as a chocolate box. John Gunter's Elizabethan scenery is pretty but
needlessly symmetrical and boxy: a tourist view of Olde England. And though
Nigel Hess has written some fair songs, the taped muzak that he has provided
at regular intervals makes Twelfth Night feel like a MGM musical.
That it keeps turning back into a beautiful play, both robust and tender, is
largely due to a superb cast. Desmond Barrit's Malvolio, a sour Welsh
Frankie Howerd of unusual force, is a triumph of comic self-importance.
Liverishly he fantasises about the day-bed 'where I have left Olivia'
(pause, then, with lascivious delicacy) 'sleeping'. Bitterly he sobs out 'I
thank my stars I am happy'. Tony Britton makes a touchingly noble Sir Toby
Belch. The way he gently plants a line like 'She is a beagle' into the still
air has the true Twelfth Night magic.
There are excellent moments too from other players, notably Haydn Gwynne's
elegant and eloquent Olivia. But the production lets her dwindle into an
ignoble silly, and it never lets Bille Brown's Andrew Aguecheek grow from
his hilariously absurd beginning into a three-dimensional study of
perpetually feckless adolescence. Clive Wood is a commanding Orsino, both
virile and narcissistic; but I never believed that either love or music had
overwhelmed his senses. As Feste, Derek Griffiths projects his songs
clearly; but his voice is far from mellifluous, and his manner the least
charming onstage.
I have the same mixed feelings about Ian Judge's Love Labour's Lost,
currently at the Barbican. Truly mixed. In Twelfth Night, I love the way
that, in the final scene, he suddenly beclouds the farce with Malvolio's
fury. Then, after Barrit has hissed 'I'll be revenged on the whole pack of
you,' the way he wipes a long strand of hair back across his bald pate
returns us, ideally, to comedy in an instant.
Just as fine are the thunder and lightning at the end, and the way Maria
turns Feste out of doors - where he sings to us of 'the wind and the rain'.
If Judge can build his understanding of these glorious moments into the
whole fabric of a play, then he will be a great director of Shakespeare
comedy. Right now he is a very good one who is sometimes not good enough.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Arts: User-friendly 'Pygmalion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Bernard Shaw's line 'Walk? Not bloody likely' stopped the original
performance of Pygmalion for a full minute at His Majesty's Theatre in April
1914: shocked silence, then guffaws. But the stalwart Herbert Tree and the
delicious Mrs Patrick Campbell promptly lost control of the last two acts.
Shaw fled home to read Shakespeare to avoid the final curtain and the cries
of 'Author] Author]'
There are no such high moments in Patrick Garland's production at the
Chichester Festival Theatre. But there are no low ones either. Chichester's
first Pygmalion is like reliable TV costume sitcom: speech therapist finds
and treats a patient; their life together and apart is intolerable; she
outgrows him as they fall in love - or do they? Garland offers the sombre
ending. Higgins realises he has blown his chances with Eliza by making her
hate more than need him.
This is the best English play to distinguish between manners (how you treat
others) and etiquette (how you behave in social circles). Shaw reacted
against the Victorian phonetics and elocution movement, and also against the
etiquette guides designed to make the middle classes more genteel. Eliza is
a woman refined out of her class.
The design and costumes (Dierdre Clancy) have a solid air: pre-war styles
and a fine arts and crafts interior for Mrs Higgins' Chelsea flat make the
characters believable, even if the set is cumbersome. The background to
Higgins' phonetic interests features in the voiceovers which cover the
lengthy scene changes.
Peter Bowles' perky performance as Higgins starts off at a ripping pace,
stuffing wax rolls into the phonograph, twirling his glasses, savouring the
situation at every turn: 'She's so deliciously low.' Bowles is a good TV
actor, master of the quiet shrug. But the space on the Chichester stage
draws expansive gestures from him, like a doubles player cajoled into a
lonely singles match - in fact, the quintessential Bowles gesture is a
topspin backhand which starts by his left hip and finishes above his right
shoulder. Since this denotes for him everything from triumph to disaster, he
can now play Wimbledon as well as Chichester.
Fiona Fullerton as Eliza goes boldly into received pronunciation with wit
and verve, shedding her giveaway vowels for a takeaway manner. Her excellent
performance tempers Eliza's dependency with distaste, but never too much to
rule out Higgins as a partner. She carries the serious message of the play
into the last two acts. And she is walking out on Higgins at the end.
Around the two principals, Freddie Jones as Doolittle, the 'undeserving
pauper', is a feast of chopped logic and handles his scenes well enough to
be unpredictable. Dulcie Gray as Higgins' mother develops the over-filial
relation with Higgins and presides in the 'At Homes' with aplomb. Michael
Denison as Higgins' pal, Pickering, gives firm but bewildered support, not
least because the staging still needs to be streamlined so the actors can
talk to each other and the audience.
In repertory at the Chichester Festival Theatre until July 14.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Arts: Raphael's women, work and legacy / Review of the
exhibition at the National Gallery of Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The women Raphael painted, it was observed long ago, were either his
mistress or mother. On a casual look it is the Virgin Mary, image of ideal
motherhood, who dominates Raphael: The Pursuit of Perfection at the National
Gallery of Scotland. This scholarly yet accessible exhibition explores
Raphael's creative process through paintings and drawings. It also shows how
fully he lived up to the moral ideal for a Renaissance painter of passing on
knowledge and skill to younger men.
What is by Raphael, and what by Gianfrancesco Penni, Giulio Romano, or 'the
workshop'? Numerous works in the exhibition raise these questions,
especially the later drawings of figures in the Loggia di Psyche in the
Villa Farnesina. Here, among the nude studies, may well be Raphael's
mistress, if the story is true that the only way he could be kept on the job
was if his mistress stayed. But are the drawings by her admiring lover, or
by assistants eagerly copying their master's wonderful way with the female
form?
At the heart of the exhibition are the three Madonnas on loan from the Duke
of Sutherland: the 'Holy Family with a Palm Tree'; the 'Bridgewater
Madonna'; and the 'Madonna of the Passeggio'. All the preparatory drawings
have been brought together from collections across Europe. Also on show is
the 'Madonna of the Pinks', the Duke of Northumberland's little masterpiece
which has only recently recovered art-historical respectability as being
truly by Raphael.
The Sutherland Raphaels are newly cleaned and conserved. The scientists'
scrutiny has unearthed curious things. It seems clear that Raphael had no
direct hand in the 'Madonna of the Passeggio', long suspected as being by a
talented assistant, perhaps Penni. The composition is anyway less attractive
than the other three Raphaels; St Joseph looks strangely farouche, staring
back from behind a bush at his wife and child who are being humbly greeted
by little St John the Baptist.
There is no discomfort in knowing that the Virgin of the lovely 'Bridgewater
Madonna' was at first placed in a flowery meadow, until Raphael enclosed her
in a room without a view. However, it can be distinctly unsettling to
discover things which an artist never meant us to know. A case in point is
'Holy Family with the Palm Tree'.
In this lovely tondo St Joseph gives Jesus a handful of flowers, watched
intently by Mary who so often has eyes only for her baby. This St Joseph
looks younger than normal, thanks to his thick grey curls. The X-ray
suggests that he was originally bald and that the top-knot was added later -
presumably by Raphael. But why did he add it, and to please whom? This
trichological riddle detracts from enjoyment of the picture and is one
insight into Raphael's creative process I could have done without.
Among the unexpected things in the exhibition is 'Mercury Bearing Psyche to
Olympus', an air-borne confection of figures from the Loggia di Psyche by
Rubens from the Duke of Sutherland's private collection. And how lovely to
find again an enchanting drawing from Chatsworth, recently shown in London.
It shows an ordinary mother holding a fidgety child firmly around the middle
while she reads aloud.
It was a boldly unconventional move to use late copies to flesh out
Raphael's oeuvre. They hang in an anteroom, homage from an age when Raphael
was often talked about as quasi-divine. The copy of the Madrid 'Madonna of
the Fish' is by an restorer called Bonnemaison, alleged by Jacques Louis
David to have scrubbed Raphael altarpieces with turpentine. Anyone who
regrets the modern cleaning of the 'Transfiguration' can compare it with the
sombre hues faithfully rendered in the 1820s by one Grigor Urquhart of
Inverness.
Inevitably, the exhibition conjures up the spectre of absence. Since 1946,
the three Raphaels have been in the gallery as part of the Ellesmere, now
Sutherland, loan. The Sixth Duke is now 79; to lose the loan would be a
devastating blow to the NGS and, if it went overseas, to Britain's national
heritage. The Sutherland pictures are exempt from inheritance tax while they
are on public view. A private treaty sale would therefore avoid the demand
for payment of inheritance tax exempted in the past. If this were allowed to
happen, with an annual acquisition budget of only Pounds 1.2m the NGS would
be in a hopeless position to secure the paintings.
The Raphael exhibition highlights the uncertainty hanging over the residue
of one of the greatest private art collections ever formed in Britain. As
early as 1806, an ancestor of the present duke allowed the public to visit
the huge collection at his London residence on St James's Square. For close
on two centuries, then, these great paintings have been in the public eye,
giving untold pleasure. Who can predict whether the same will be true a
century from now?

FT  27 MAY 94 / Arts: Edward Lam Company - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At two hours and fifteen minutes (no interval), Edward Lam's Scenes from a
Men's Changing Room outstays its welcome to the point where, amid a
background of rumbling stomachs, creaking seats and much indiscreet glancing
at wristwatches, it induces a steady exodus of people who, most probably,
will never again subject themselves to the Lam experience. A pity, because
there is much to admire and enjoy in the work of this Hong Kong-born, but
now London-based, Chinese director and choreographer.
Scenes from a Men's Changing Room, part of the Barclays New Stages season at
The Royal Court, was first created in 1991 for Lam's Hong Kong company. But
like an earlier work entitled How to Love a Man Who Doesn't Love Me, it has
been substantially reworked for a mainly British cast.
Originally inspired by Lam's observations of gay men in the changing rooms,
clubs and saunas of Europe - and by his own experience of these
sexually-charged meeting places - Scenes from a Men's Changing Room is now
set on a blank, open stage. Here, the eight performers (all men) use minimal
props to suggest a catalogue of settings - a cafe, cinema, hospital - but it
is through the patterns and intensity of their physical actions that we
begin to recognise a variety of social situations and the environments in
which they are taking place.
Eschewing linear narrative for a chain of interactive but independent
episodes, Lam presents his audience with an uncompromisingly stripped-back,
bare-boned style of theatre, its focus lodged not in real time but in the
fast-slow, stop-start frames of a collection of open-ended encounters. These
range from the profoundly nightmarish - one man trying to suffocate another
by tightening a towel around his head and face; another man overcome by a
mixture of alarm and disgust as he dabs at his body's excretory orifices -
to the sweetly amusing: a brief, trousers-down, apres-shower towel dance for
a single man, this demure, but naughty routine later repeated by the entire
group; three men arranging their hair in pigtails and behaving like giggly
schoolgirls, leading into a wonderfully energetic parody of Charlie's
Angels.
But Lam also gives us scenes in which sinister events are blended with an
uneasy humour, as when one man fornicates with another - both are fully
dressed and completely expressionless - across the stage. Scenes is an
elegant dissection of fear and guilt, need and rejection. Lam entertains us
as generously as he seeks to disturb, but his brand of sparse yet epic
theatre gradually loses its power to do either of these things as the
evening wears on.
Edward Lam Company is at the Green Room, Manchester on June 10 and 11.

Time was when the sense of release prompted by the ending of the working
week could be expressed by wearing a tie decorated with the letters 'TGIF':
Thank God It's Friday. Now television does the job for us by organising a
Friday night schedule which seems intended to drive us out of our homes. If
you simply have to stay indoors you could always watch comedy repeats such
as Open All Hours with Ronnie Barker playing the la-la-lascivious grocer,
Arkwright, whose mission in life is to bed the buxom Nurse Gladys (8.00
BBC1); or Red Dwarf in which Kryten discovers he has just 24 hours to live
 .well, to exist shall we say, given that he is a robot (9.00 BBC2).
Television's only Friday night treat is Have I Got News For You, a startling
improvement on its radio ancestor, 'The News Quiz'. Guests are now faced
with the virtually impossible task of matching the recent performance of Bob
Monkhouse. He delivered a lesson in topical comedy to team captains Ian
Hislop and Paul Merton who usually have such an easy time dominating the
proceedings (10.00 BBC2).

FT  27 MAY 94 / Technology: Red, white and better all over / A look at the
latest improvements in blood products, in a continuing series on drug
advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The blood products sector used to be a quiet backwater of the healthcare
business. Now, it is a rapidly growing money-spinner. The engine of change
has been biotechnology, and the treating of blood disorders has created the
first superstar of that business, California's Amgen.
Five years ago, blood products meant substances derived from blood. These
would be used in blood transfusions and as supplements in conditions such as
haemophilia (uncontrolled bleeding).
But the business suffered from high costs, owing to the laborious nature of
collecting blood from donors, a lack of patent protection which in turn
limited prices, and periodic scandals over contamination. Few of the big
pharmaceuticals companies bothered to get involved.
What biotechnology did was to make possible the high-volume manufacture of
some of the components of blood, even those that appear in only minute
quantities in the body.
Two big-selling products have been developed so far. The most dramatic sales
have come from erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced naturally by the
body which Amgen has synthesised and commercialised as Epogen.
EPO is used to treat anaemia, a condition which can arise when not enough
EPO is made by the kidneys. EPO travels via the bloodstream to the bone
marrow were it stimulates the production of red blood cells. It is these
cells which carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
For more than 30 years, patients with kidney disease have received dialysis,
a mechanical treatment that mimics much of what the kidney does. But
dialysis machines do not make EPO, so the patients develop anaemia.
In the past these patients have received blood transfusions, an expensive
and laborious procedure that carried risks of infection and other
complications. Today the shortage of natural EPO can be addressed directly
by Epogen. Amgen says that 80 per cent of dialysis patients in the US now
receive the drug.
The second new drug stimulates the development of white blood cells - a
central component of the body's immune system - rather than red. Granulocyte
colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) also works by stimulating the bone marrow,
but this time to produce white blood cells.
G-CSF is sold by Amgen as Neupogen. It is used in the treatment of cancer
patients because chemotherapy damages the bone marrow and with it the body's
defence mechanisms.
Chemotherapy patients are especially vulnerable to infection. Giving them
G-CSF not only allows them to improve their defences against infection but
means that more of the chemotherapy agent can be used to try to deal with
the cancer.
Both Epogen and Neupogen are made by the complicated, but now well-tested,
techniques of genetic engineering. Scientists analyse human EPO and identify
its components. With that knowledge, they can calculate the shape of the
gene that triggers the production of EPO and scan thousands of human genes
to search for it.
Once the correct human gene is identified, it is put in the ovary of a
hamster. The egg that the ovary later releases is capable of making EPO. It
divides many times and a master cell bank is built up.
For large-scale manufacturing, cells from the master bank are nourished in a
fluid. As they grow they secrete EPO. The fluid is periodically removed and
the EPO extracted, purified and bottled.
Amgen received its first patent for this process in October 1987. Less than
two years later, the US Food and Drug Administration approved its use for
kidney patients. Neupogen was approved by the FDA in 1991.
The drugs are among the most effective on the market today because they are
chemically identical to natural products of the body. As natural products
they cannot be patented and cannot easily be improved upon. Amgen protects
its discovery through patents on the manufacturing method and the uses of
the drug.
These patents are effective enough to have shut out competition and allow
high prices to be charged. One course of Neupogen costs about Pounds 800,
for example, and a cancer patient may need several courses.
The pay-off is that patients are far less likely to have to come back into
hospital to be treated for an infection that the white blood cells would
normally have fought off. That saves money on both hospital beds and the
cocktail of antibiotics that would have to be administered.
The combination of high price and potential savings to buyers translates
into big profits for Amgen: the first three months of this year saw pre-tax
profits of Dollars 93.5m (Pounds 62.3m) on sales of Dollars 345.7m.
The success story has barely begun. According to analysts at stockbroker
Lehman Brothers, by 2000 Epogen will be the world's best selling drug with
Neupogen not far behind in third place. Their combined sales will be more
than Dollars 5bn a year, roughly the level of the UK National Health
Service's annual budget today.
The successes of Neupogen and Epogen have now attracted other companies into
research and development programmes. They include Sandoz of Switzerland,
which has signed research agreements with North American biotechnology
research centres Terry Fox Laboratories in Vancouver and Systemix in Palo
Alto, California.
One of the most advanced research programmes is at British Biotechnology, in
Oxford. It is trying to combine the effectiveness of both Epogen and
Neupogen by defending the bone marrow against damage.
This can be done by first recognising that chemotherapy agents kill cancers
by destroying cells that are dividing. Chemotherapy does not distinguish
between cancer cells and others that are dividing, such as hair, which is
why cancer patients often lose their hair.
Bone marrow contains the cells, called stem cells, that divide and develop
into a range of blood cells - red, white and the platelets which cause
clotting.
British Biotechnology's programme is to develop a drug that temporarily
switches off the division of stem cells. The chemotherapy agents will then
leave the stem cells untouched and when the therapy is finished, they can be
switched on again.
'Rather than a treatment for the damage caused by chemotherapy, it is a
prophylaxis or prevention of the effect,' says Peter Lewis, director of
research and development at British Biotechnology.
The company is not the only one developing a stem cell protector. Sandoz,
Sweden's Astra, and T-Cell Sciences, a California biotechnology company, are
close behind. The pharmaceutical industry knows that there is a huge market
to be tapped.
This is a far cry from a decade ago when Epogen and Neupogen found
themselves in virgin markets. There were no products they could compete with
and there were no sales forces or doctors accustomed to selling or buying
treatments.
Amgen established a series of licensing deals and joint ventures with big
drugs companies even though many companies were sceptical. 'It was a
completely novel drug,' explains Paul Hooper, UK marketing director for
Swiss company Roche, now Amgen's joint venture partner in Europe for Epogen.
Another company, one of the largest in the US, turned down the chance to be
a licensee. 'We didn't recognise its potential,' says a former senior
executive. 'Later I felt like the record company man that turned down the
Beatles. I won't be making that mistake again.'
The series continues next month with a look at pain killers.

<TEXT>
Neural networks, which recognise patterns rather than carrying out vastly
complicated calculations, are penetrating into a variety of industrial and
financial areas. Racal, the UK electronics company, has used the technology
for its new vehicle number plate registration system designed to work in the
day or night.
Called Talon, its applications cover traffic monitoring and security
operations. It was developed with Cambridge Neurodynamics, a specialist in
digital signal processing and pattern recognition.
The system works by being 'trained' to recognise a large number of
repetitions of a set of characters. The network builds a statistical model
which adapts to the features that make each character distinctive. Thus it
also works well when number plates are crooked and the numbers are partly
hidden or dirty.

Staircases are a big problem for people in wheelchairs and spiral staircases
present a particular challenge. TGR of Bologna in Italy has developed its
advanced Explorer chair to allow users to tackle complicated stairways -
especially in offices and public buildings - without any help.
It works through a combination of wheels and crawler tracks, with the seat
balancing automatically to produce a level posture even when ascending or
descending. Powered by batteries and controlled by sensors, the Explorer
(costing Pounds 12,000) is easily operated by a joystick.
'It makes a tremendous difference to the disabled,' says Howard Daly, head
of Wheelchair Corporation, distributor for the UK and parts of continental
Europe. Mouth control and voice activation features are also being
developed.

But for those who need access to European Union and UK government policy
announcements, Context, a UK company, has launched a new service in its
series of CD-Rom products called Justis Official Press Releases. It combines
the EU's Rapid database of documents and communiques (from 1985) on
economic, trade, science and technology and other sectors with the Hermes

FT  27 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Elegant speakers make their
entrance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Combining a taste for hi-fi sound with a desire for elegant surroundings is
not always easy - loudspeakers can be bulky and obtrusive.
Dance London, a small UK company, has developed the Mirage speakers to help
overcome this dilemma. Shaped rather like a pair of curved, squat lamp
bases, they are made of durable ceramic and send out what Dance calls 'all
surround sound' at 360' instead of the more limited direction of
conventional speakers.
The 'sweet spot', where the listener sits at an equal distance from each
speaker, is enlarged by the way the Mirage sends the sound on to a
cone-shaped deflector and then out into the room.
Using a Danish-made loudspeaker drive, the speakers are made in the UK; they
will appear in shops later this summer. The basic units priced at Pounds
230; a Pounds 199 sub-woofer (of special resin) for enhanced bass will cost
an extra Pounds 199.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Management: From caterpillar to butterfly - Leading computer
manufacturer Unisys has come back to life after metamorphosis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A piece of seemingly perverse management wisdom is beginning to sink in
among the boardrooms of the world's beleaguered computer giants: 'Doing what
you do best can destroy you.'
More accurately, perhaps, companies can be destroyed by continuing to do
what they do best in the face of evidence that their business environment
has changed.
US manufacturers International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and
Unisys are examples. They are all masters of the art of big computer design
and production, yet their market is in retreat as customers increasingly
look to networks of smaller computers for more cost-effective data
processing. The falling price of technology, which cut one third off the
cost of IBM mainframes last year alone, is a further headache for these
companies.
The consequences are well known. IBM is struggling to recover from three
years of losses and large-scale redundancies while the future of Digital,
once second only to IBM, looks uncertain at best.
But Unisys, which three years ago looked dead in the water, is different.
The product of the 1986 merger of Burroughs and Sperry, it has now been
profitable for two successive years after losing almost Dollars 2.5bn
(Pounds 1.66bn) between 1989 and 1991. Its first-quarter results this year
were encouraging with earnings per share, before special items, of 21 cents
a share against 16 cents the year before.
The man widely credited with the recovery - chairman and chief executive
James Unruh - is not merely content to rescue the company. Unruh, who took
over in 1990 from Michael Blumenthal, is intent on re-establishing Unisys as
a force in global data processing through a fundamental reorientation of its
strategy and management style.
For a start, the new Unisys will be smaller. At its peak, the company
employed some 120,000 people - now the total is less than 50,000. Once
revenues hovered around the Dollars 10bn mark; in 1993 they were Dollars
7.7bn.
Unisys will still make and sell computer hardware - 'We are not going to
become a computerless computer company,' Unruh says - but it will extend its
already catholic attitude to sticking its own logo on other maker's systems.
The processor chips in its next generation of systems will be manufactured
by its old rival IBM, for example.
Unisys aims to become an information management company: in Unruh's words,
'client-driven, technology-based and services-led'. This compares with the
company's earlier attitude which amounted to a kind of technological
fascism: 'We used to develop the next bigger, faster version of what we were
doing and send salespeople out to find customers who could put these things
to use.'
Unruh stopped Unisys concentrating on what it could do best, making
mainframe computers, and shifted the emphasis towards software and services.
This is not new in itself. Every big computer maker is looking for increased
revenues from services as profit margins on mainframes are squeezed.
But Unruh has moved with a speed and conviction which has not been obvious
at other companies. Staff numbers were almost halved in 12 months at a cost
of more than Dollars 1bn. The company pulled out of semiconductor
manufacturing, saving Dollars 100m a year in the process. Payroll and other
services were contracted to outside suppliers.
Contraction at IBM and Digital has been drawn out and painful, leaving
remaining staff anxious and demoralised. Digital is still faced with cutting
a further 20 per cent of its workforce.
The major challenge for Unruh, however, was to transform Unisys rapidly from
hardware manufacturer to services company. It meant a big cultural shift. An
important appointment was Victor Millar, formerly with global advertising
agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, engaged to head the company's consulting side in
November 1992. Millar had earlier been with the accountancy firm Arthur
Andersen for 25 years, where he was widely credited with the growth and
success of its consulting operations.
Earlier this year, Unruh also appointed Malcolm Coster as president of the
company's Europe, Middle East and Africa division. Coster, a software
specialist and management consultant, had been head of international
business development at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Coster bel-ieves Unruh's secret
is a realisable vision of the future: 'He sees the butterfly the caterpillar
can become, not an improved caterpillar.'
The question remains how rapidly to diffuse the knowledge and experience
necessary for successful computer consultancy through a hardware-based
organisation. Unisys's answer is making the best of what you have and buying
in what you lack.
Some of that experience, Unruh says, is locked within the company. Unisys's
size and global reach gives it an enviable window on the business issues
facing its customers. Furthermore, it had a sound technical background in
some of the more difficult computing applications - airline reservation
systems and global funds transfer, for example.
'We were able to build on that,' says Unruh. 'We did not start from zero,
but we are finding our way.'
The fact remains that of the company's 6,000 professional services staff
around the world, most are skilled in technical areas, such as project
mangement and systems integration. 'To a lesser extent, we have people with
the ability to go to a client, understand their environment and determine
what technology is best for them. That is where we have had to learn more.
We have some of that knowledge because historically we used to give it away.
We did a lot of that for clients as part of getting their computer business.
Part of the learning process was understanding how to charge for these
services.'
Today, Unruh says, the company is limited in its growth by human resources.
'We could grow faster if we had more people with this kind of knowledge and
capability. We do not have the time to retrain everybody.'
The evidence that Unruh's strategy is succeeding lies in the financial
results. More tellingly, perhaps, the time it takes customers to pay their
bills is down from 87 days to 47. 'Only satisfied customers pay you,' Unruh
smiles.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Management: Learning to trust others in China - A
Japan-based outdoor training course that is not the usual hell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small cultural revolution is taking place in the shadow of the Great Wall
of China, in hilly country two hours' drive north-east of Beijing.
China's first outdoor management training centre opened there this month
near the remote hamlet of Jin Shan Lin. The centre, which has the
government's blessing but is operated by an independent foreign firm, is a
microcosm of the country's economic liberalisation.
It is run by I Will Not Complain International, a training company based in
Chiba, near Tokyo in Japan. Its mission is to nurture western management
values such as innovation, independence and originality among the
entrepreneurial leaders of China's economic expansion and the staff of
multinationals in the region.
If IWNC's recent experience in helping unthinkingly loyal Japanese
executives to think for themselves is any guide, this latest western idea to
enter China has a good chance of taking root.
IWNC had already worked for a US-Chinese joint venture before opening a base
in China. The first customers at the centre will be Reuter's Japanese sales
team in July followed by the Asia-Pacific regional managers of Smirnoff in
October.
IWNC's founder, Anthony Willoughby, a professional explorer and former
salesman, opened his Japanese outward bound centre five years ago to strike
a civilising challenge to the 'hell camp' style of traditional Japanese
outdoor training centres.
Since start-up, 5,000 staff have been through the IWNC course at Chiba,
mainly from foreign groups such as Du Pont, Reuter and American Telephone
and Telegraph, but also including a handful of Japanese groups such as
Kanematsu, the trading house.
In spite of Japan's deep recession, the number of participants rose 30 per
cent to 1,500 last year, of which four-fifths were repeats or direct
referrals. Willoughby believes the recession may have helped him by
encouraging Japanese companies to question the value of blind obedience,
thereby improving management productivity.
Annual turnover exceeds Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) and a Kenyan centre,
operated under franchise, is to open in July.
Willoughby had the idea of launching a training school five years ago, after
taking part in a Japanese-style course. It included early morning cold
showers and ritual screaming of slogans such as 'to think you will be liked
by your subordinates is wishful thinking'.
He had hoped to sharpen his own talents as a leather goods salesman. But the
experience also suggested that there might be a Japanese market for a more
creative kind of training, along western lines.
Japan's hierarchical management tradition demands loyalty, but it does not
always breed trust, observes Willoughby. The subordination of individual
needs to those of the company, as embodied in hell camp training, can also
stifle original thought, preventing executives from fulfilling their
potential, he argues.
Accordingly, the physical tasks Willoughby has chosen for his three-day
course are light enough to make the experience fun, but demanding enough
courage to reinforce participants' trust in themselves and each other.
While the Chinese have never been noted for lack of self-confidence, they
could benefit from another of IWNC's aims - to break down social barriers
between different nationalities in the same management team.
In one task, for example, team members must climb an 8m pole and leap from
the top to catch a trapeze, while colleagues hold their safety harness. In
another, members take it in turns to fall backwards off a 2m platform into
colleagues' arms.
At the end of the day, participants gather for a large and liquid meal in
the courtyard of an old farmhouse with a view of the Great Wall. The
discussions that take place at these events, as formerly reticent
participants relax, can be the most valuable part of the course, says
Willoughby.
Equally, senior managers can retire for a board meeting in an open 17th
century stone turret with a commanding view of the Great Wall and
surrounding hills.
The course strives for an un-Japanese light-hearted tone, embodied in the
company's name. This comes from the promise not to grumble that Willoughby
has extracted from members of his various exploration expeditions since a
trip to Papua New Guinea was spoilt by someone who griped when food ran low.
One clause is: 'I will not complain if I get eaten or trodden on by
animals.' Another is: 'I will not complain if two porters/camels/ horses are
employed with the sole responsibility of carrying wine.'
Joking apart, the IWNC name is supposed to underline self- reliance, a theme
that parallels the Japanese admiration of uncomplaining perseverance.
Indeed, one Japanese businessman has praised the expedition rules as a
philosophy of life.
As in Japan, IWNC's main customers in China are likely to be foreign
companies or joint ventures seeking to instill team spirit into teams of
mixed nationalities and backgrounds.
Its first, last year, was an alliance between SmithKline Beecham, the US
pharmaceuticals group, and the Chinese government. The group asked IWNC to
run an outward bound course for 70 Chinese salesmen at its own headquarters
in Tianjin.
Their response was mixed; some thought the course taught them to achieve
higher goals, but others, mainly older members, would have preferred to
spend the money on buying presents for customers.
True to the contract, however, they did not complain.

FT  27 MAY 94 / People: Matthews - possible reunion with Beazer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Matthews, 49, has resigned as chief executive of Indosuez Capital, the
London merchant banking arm of France's Banque Indosuez. His departure
increases speculation that he is preparing to help his old boss, Brian
Beazer, make a stock market comeback.
Matthews joined Indosuez in October 1991 a few months after quitting Beazer,
the fast expanding construction group. Banque Indosuez said that it was
'very much an amicable parting'. Matthews is reluctant to elaborate on his
reasons for leaving save to say that Indosuez's ambitions for London
differed from his own both in terms of size and capital.
Matthews, who worked for County NatWest for 17 years, made his name as the
merchant banker who helped Brian Beazer transform his small West Country
building firm into one of Britain's biggest construction companies in less
than a decade. When Matthews brought Beazer his first deal, the company was
capitalised at Pounds 4m. At its peak, Beazer was capitalised at over Pounds
800m and at the end of 1988 Matthews moved across from County to be Beazer's
deputy chief executive.
However, Beazer expanded too rapidly, fell out of favour with the stock
market and Matthews stepped down from a heavily-indebted Beazer a few months
before it fell into the hands of Hanson in September 1991.
Matthews is taking the summer off to ponder his next move. He does not rule
out teaming up once again with his old boss, Brian Beazer, 58, who has been
spending most of his time in the US where he is a partner in Louis Nicoud, a
New York stock broker, and chairman of Beazer Homes USA, a Georgia-based
housebuilder, which was floated off by Hanson earlier this year.
'Brian and I see ourselves as investors, getting involved when needs be,
rather than full-time partners,' says Matthews. At the moment they are
talking about backing the stock market ambitions of another ex-Beazer
executive, Chris Pople, but are open to ideas, says Matthews. Indeed, he's
prepared to offer a magnum of champagne for the best idea.

investments down in April
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rate of return from commercial property investments fell in April,
according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group.
The All-Property Total Return fell from 3.1 per cent to 1.7 per cent, while
capital values increased by 1.0 per cent, compared with 2.4 per cent in
March. But there was an improvement in the year-on-year movement in capital
values, which rose to 25.9 per cent from 24.5 per cent for the 12 months to
March.
Total returns slowed across the board in April, as the rate of capital
growth declined across all three sectors. Retail property produced a total
return of 1.8 per cent for the month, down from 3 per cent, while office and
industrial property both returned 1.6 per cent, a fall of 1.5 points and 1.9
points respectively.
The year-on-year figures for total returns continue to improve. In the
retail sector, total returns rose to 26.6 per cent for the year to April,
compared with 25.3 per cent for the year to March. Over the year, capital
values rose by 17.4 per cent and rents declined by 1.7 per cent.
In the office sector, total returns rose to 24.7 per cent, a 1.3 percentage
point increase on the year to March. This stemmed from improved capital and
rental performances which moved by 13.4 per cent and -10.5 per cent,
respectively. Industrial property's year-on-year total returns rose by 1.6
percentage points to 25.8 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Property: User unfriendly - An industry accused of being at
odds with its customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'At present, the property industry bears analogy to the old discredited
economies of east Europe, where customers were provided with what the
factories found most convenient to produce.'
Sir James Blyth,
chief executive of Boots
The property industry may have escaped the scrutiny in the UK Department of
Trade and Industry's white paper on competitiveness, but as the above
comment demonstrates, it has no grounds for complacency.
Speaking at a conference on Property in the Economy in Cardiff on Monday,
Sir James Blyth attacked the property industry's lack of regard for the
needs of its customers.
At a time when the rest of the commercial world is becoming more flexible
and responsive to customer needs, the property industry has become more
rigid and uniform, Sir James said. The industry has allowed itself to be
dominated by the needs of its financiers, leading to a lack of flexibility
and innovation in the leases it offers tenants.
The traditional institutional lease, with its 25-year duration and
five-yearly, upward-only rent reviews, has led to distortions in the market,
he said
'In the UK much of the economic success of the past decade has come from
freeing up the supply-side of the economy, and from recognising the
pre-eminence of the customer. It is important that property, too, responds
to these imperatives if the UK economy is to expand further,' Sir James
added.
It is a familiar theme. The possibility that the workings of the commercial
property market damage the wider economy has been raised repeatedly over the
past couple of years, by academics, businesses, lobby groups, the Bank of
England and the government.
The Department of the Environment has consulted widely on the case for
reforming a number of the industry's practices, including outlawing
upward-only rent reviews and confidentiality clauses, which restrict the
available information on rent reviews. The Treasury is also thought to be
concerned that upward-only rent reviews may be at odds with its
anti-inflationary policies.
The government has already accepted the case for reforming the current law
on privity of contract, under which a tenant bears the responsibility of
paying rent if a lease has been passed on to another tenant who subsequently
defaults.
Property investors oppose government intervention in the industry. Many
investors fear that legislation could scare away institutions. There is a
precedent: in 1965, institutions virtually abandoned the residential
property market following pro-tenant legislation. Developers and investors
require a reasonable return over a sufficiently long period to justify
capital investment; restrictive legislation could deter many developers from
making long-term investments.
The government may be dissuaded from enacting restrictive legislation if it
can be persuaded that the industry can sort out its own problems.
Landlords and tenants, for instance, may be able to reach a compromise over
the length of leases. Most institutions are content with 15-year leases and
would even accept 10-year ones. The 1980s property glut has given tenants a
strong bargaining position, forcing landlords to agree to short leases, with
regular break-options.
Even if landlords and tenants reach a compromise, the sector remains open to
attack, as its problems extend beyond lease structures.
Its past mistakes are all too visible: the glut of offices in central London
is evidence of that.
The UK arguably invested too much on new buildings in the second half of the
1980s, at the expense of other forms of investment. Britain had the highest
increase in non-residential building investment of any of the Group of Seven
economies and the lowest rise in investment in plant and machinery.
Yet many argue that a far greater problem facing the industry is the time
lag between planning and completing a speculative development. The risk that
economic conditions can change radically in the time a building is under
construction makes the industry highly cyclical, prone, for example, to
periods of over-supply.
A recent report on property cycles published by the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors, recommended that the industry should consider how 'the
speed of the development responses could be accelerated, how market signals
could be read with greater circumspection and how other ways of meeting
occupier requirements, such as custom building, could be encouraged'.
Responding to these suggestions would help introduce more stability and
might also deflect charges that the industry undermines the health of the
economy as a whole.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Ex-wife's right to money upheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of Appeal yesterday paved the way to dividing personal pension
rights on divorce when it rejected an appeal brought by a husband, Mr
Brooks, to prevent some of his pension being transferred to his former wife.
Mr Norman Russell of Paisner &amp; Co, solicitors acting for the ex-wife, said
that the decision went further than a High Court judgment in April 1993
which upheld a district judge's order to vary Mr Brooks' pension fund as a
result of his divorce after 12 years of marriage.
The High Court judgment maintained that Mr Brooks' pension fund fell within
the definition of a 'post-nuptial settlement'. Divorce law gives courts the
power to vary the terms of a post-nuptial settlement, therefore allowing Mr
Brooks' pension to be varied in his ex-wife's favour.
The High Court decision was widely regarded as applicable only in
circumstances similar to those of the case, which involved a
self-administered pension scheme with a surplus.
Yesterday's decision appeared to have much wider application, although the
Court of Appeal's ruling that a pension could not be varied if a third party
is involved eliminates application of the judgment to company schemes.
The appeal was rejected in a 2-1 decision in which Lord Justices Neill and
Waite rejected the appeal while Lord Justice Hoffmann upheld it. Lord Waite
said that, because private pensions 'are too numerous and too varied to be
treated empirically as a class', courts should examine arrangements to
decide whether the act of a spouse joining a scheme involved creation of a
post-nuptial settlement and whether the scheme should be varied by the
court.
No one at Girling, Mr Brooks' solicitors, was available for comment but an
appeal to the House of Lords is thought likely.
Mr Robin Ellison of Hammond Suddards, pension solicitors, and a member of
the pensions and divorce working group of the Pensions Management Institute,
said: 'If it is upheld in the House of Lords it will make personal pensions
a less attractive bet for husbands than company schemes.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / CBI expects recovery to be broader-based
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery will become broad-based this year, with investment and trade
playing a greater role in economic growth and inflation kept below
government targets, the Confederation of British Industry says today in its
economic forecast.
The recovery has largely weathered April's tax rises, the CBI says in its
forecast which is more optimistic than its last one in February. It also
calls for a period of stable interest rates.
Although consumer spending is expected to slow slightly as a result of the
tax rises, predictions for consumer spending for the year have been revised
up to 2.5 per cent from 1.9 per cent in February.
The recovery is expected to become broader-based, with investment and trade
predicted to play a greater role after months of consumer-led growth.
Investment is predicted to rise 2 per cent this year and exports 4.6 per
cent. Overall, the economy is expected to grow 2.4 per cent this year and
2.5 per cent next year.
Partly as a result of this, the CBI has abandoned its call for lower
interest rates. Although it believes that inflation and growth in average
earnings are likely to remain low, it assumes that interest rates will
remain flat this year before rising to 6 per cent at the end of next year.
The optimistic forecast was backed yesterday by strong data from its monthly
industrial trends survey, conducted in the second half of April and first
half of May among 1,190 companies who account for roughly half of UK
manufacturing.
More than half of the companies reported that their total order books were
normal, with 22 per cent saying they are above normal and 25 per cent saying
order books are below normal. This negative balance of 3 per cent compares
with negative balances of 17 per cent in April and 13 per cent in March, and
is the most optimistic since 1989.
Export order books were also at their best levels since 1990. The proportion
of companies reporting below-normal levels compared to above-normal levels
was a negative balance of 2 per cent compared with negative balances of 9
per cent in April.
The companies faring best are medium-sized, with those employing between 200
and 499 people reporting the best export orders. Companies employing fewer
than 200 were the only ones to report export orders below normal.
Meanwhile, the intermediate goods industry, which supplies raw materials and
components to manufacturers, was markedly more optimistic about output than
the capital and consumer goods industries.
A total of 86 per cent of shipbuilders said their domestic order books were
above normal, while 87 per cent of aerospace manufacturers said they were
below normal. However, most car and food manufacturers reported normal
sales.
Meanwhile, the metals and manufacturing sector as a whole reported
above-normal sales, but less encouraging exports, suggesting their growth is
domestic-led.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Lecturers set to adopt new stance in contracts dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual conference of the Natfhe lecturers' union, which starts tomorrow,
could signal a turning point in the union's long and disruptive dispute over
new contracts.
Earlier this week the union announced that members had voted decisively
against re-electing the general secretary, Mr Geoff Woolf, in a result that
was widely interpreted as a rejection of his handling of the contracts
dispute.
The eventual winner, Mr John Akker, built his campaign around opposition to
what he saw as poor handling of the dispute.
He said the union would make a 'new start' to the contract negotiations
under his leadership. Natfhe changed its negotiating tactics from national
to local bargaining after the High Court ruled earlier this year that its
ballot of members over a national strike had been unlawful.
At its conference, it is expected to unveil an agreement with one large
college to introduce contracts which the union considers acceptable.
However, other principals believe the college's contract could fall foul of
government regulations and lead to a reduction in its grant.
The Department for Education yesterday said the introduction of new
contracts was going well. Further education minister Mr Tim Boswell said: 'I
hope that Natfhe will now reconsider their campaign of industrial action and
return to constructive dialogue with the Colleges' Employers' Forum.'
The new contracts, which employers have been trying to introduce for more
than 12 months to allow greater flexibility after the removal of further
education colleges from local authority control last year, are fiercely
opposed by lecturers. They would cut annual holiday entitlement in half and
add an hour to the working day.
Two smaller unions, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, and the
Association of College Management, have signed national agreements to the
contracts.
The conference takes place in Southport, Merseyside, and ends on Monday.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Farming land investment brings higher returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment in agricultural land last year generated the highest returns for
fund managers in 14 years, according to a survey by Savills land agents.
Institutional investors saw a 16.3 per cent return from agricultural
holdings, which includes profits from the sale of land.
Mr Jim Ward, head of agricultural research at Savills, said the rate of
investment income from agricultural land had outperformed commercial
property by 5 percentage points over the past six years. However, property
returns are still well below those in the equity market, where pension funds
earned 28 per cent last year.
About 30 per cent of Britain's farmland is owned by large landowners such as
the Church of England, the National Trust and the Queen, with financial
institutions holding about 1 per cent.
Financial institutions moved heavily into farmland investments in the 1970s
when inflation was high and farm incomes were rising rapidly. But most have
since been seeking to reduce their holdings.
Most fund managers are concerned that land values will drop over the long
term as a result of Common Agricultural Policy reforms which will cut farm
produce prices. Savills believes institutions sold 45,000 acres of farmland
last year.
The survey is drawn from a sample of 49 financial institutions which between
them own 202,000 acres of agricultural land - down from a peak of 550,000
acres in 1984.
Mr John Clamp of Combined Actuarial Performance Services said: 'A fair
number of funds are seeking to reduce their exposure to property.'
The small significance of farmland in many institutional portfolios can mean
that fund managers devote little time to improving its value, Mr Ward said.
Mr Henry Richards, director at the Land Improvement group, a company
specialising in rural investment which owns 24,000 acres of farmland,
believes that the way to make the investments profitable is to spend a lot
of time boosting land values by gaining planning consents.
'A lot of institutions see agricultural land as an income stream, but you
must look at it in a more imaginative, creative way to make it pay a
dividend,' he said.
Land prices are 20 per cent lower in real terms than they were in 1980, but
land values rose slightly last year with the upturn in farmers' earnings.
Institutional purchases of farmland dried up last year and fund managers
bought only 2 per cent of farm properties compared with 38 per cent in 1992.
'The improvement in farm incomes means that tenant farmers are now very keen
to buy farmland, and over 40 per cent of sales were to tenants last year,'
said Mr Ward.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Commercial property funding falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of new money flowing into the commercial property industry has
fallen significantly since last year, Savills, a leading firm of surveyors,
has calculated.
In the first four months of 1994 a total of Pounds 1.4bn was raised through
loans, bonds and rights issues, Savills says. That is in line with the
amount of new finance raised in 1990 and 1991, but well down on 1993 when a
total of Pounds 5.7bn was raised in the year.
The decline in property share values this year has reduced the attraction of
raising money through rights issues. In the first four months of the year a
total of Pounds 414m was generated by rights issues compared with Pounds
2.4bn last year. Bank lending to the property sector has continued to fall
from its peak of Pounds 40.6bn in May 1991.
In the first three months of this year, it fell from Pounds 34.2bn to Pounds
33.6bn.
The office market in most of the south-east's main office centres is likely
to undergo a pronounced recovery this year, according to research by
chartered surveyors Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
Property development, which has been almost non-existent for the past two to
three years, will increase sharply on the back of increased demand, a
shortage of good-quality property and selective support from investors,it
says.
It estimates that the take-up of new space in the offices centres
surrounding the M25 motorway will return to pre-recession levels of about 3m
sq ft this year.

FT  27 MAY 94 / MPs call for tougher pension law reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure for an overhaul of occupational pension law intensified yesterday
as a MPs urged changes beyond those being considered by the government.
A report by the Tory-dominated Commons social security committee said the
proposals the government was expected to put forward on reforming pension
law would not do enough to protect workers' pensions.
While endorsing many of the proposals put forward by the government's
pension law review committee, it urged that schemes be required to give more
generous pensions to those who changed jobs, and said individuals should be
able to challenge trustees in court.
The government has signalled its intention to water down the review
committee's proposals, arguing they would impose too great a burden on
employers.
Mr Frank Field MP, select committee chairman, said the group voted
unanimously against continuing the present 'voluntary' system of pension
scheme regulation.
The committee also felt the review committee's proposals did not go far
enough.
A central recommendation of the committee calls for a 'well-resourced'
pensions regulator financed by tax revenues.
Government officials have said privately they favour asking industry to
finance the regulator, which would limit the resources available to it.
The select committee also strongly endorsed the review committee's
recommendation that scheme members be allowed to elect representatives to
trustee boards. The Confederation of British Industry, the largest
employers' body, opposes this measure.
Almost all occupational schemes could meet modified standards of minimum
solvency proposed by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries as part of a
pension law reform package, the social security department said yesterday.
The pension law review committee had recommended schemes be required to have
enough assets to buy the 'cash equivalent' of each member's benefit if it
were suddenly wound up.
Employers had argued that because calculation of cash equivalents is based
on gilts yields while an average of 80 per cent of pension funds is invested
in equities, the new rule would require them to dump equities and buy bonds.
A modified proposal from the actuaries' professional body altered the
calculation of cash equivalents to take more account of equity yields.
The DSS concluded that on the modified basis, 95 per cent of the 500 schemes
it surveyed were 100 per cent solvent.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Council for City snubbed by PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has rejected a request from the Corporation of London, the
local authority for the City, for legislation that would allow an extension
of the electoral franchise in the Square Mile.
The corporation, which is locked in an electoral feud with Smithfield Market
tenants, has been told there is no prospect in the foreseeable future of a
parliamentary bill to give limited companies a voice in the way the City is
run.
Mr Major wants to avoid potentially controversial legislation because of his
small Commons majority. Tory MPs who have suffered heavily as a result of
the recent losses in the Lloyd's insurance market may be unsympathetic to a
City-sponsored bill.
The decision, relayed to the corporation by Mr Graham Bright, the prime
minister's parliamentary private secretary, confirms that there has been a
significant cooling in relations between the government and the City since
the 1992 general election.
The two sides have resolved disputes over the corporation's anti-terrorism
strategy - traffic control measures are almost certain to become a permanent
fixture after the withdrawal of a formal objection by neighbouring Tower
Hamlets - and over the proposed CrossRail underground rail link.
But leading City figures believe Mr Major is generally unsympathetic to the
role the Square Mile plays in promoting London as a world financial centre
and providing substantial assistance to other local authorities.
The City has been seeking a change in its constitution to prevent the
Smithfield traders manipulating its archaic voting arrangements to win seats
on the corporation's general council. It also believes that the City's
limited companies - by far the largest contributors to the Pounds 700m it
collects each year in rates - can no longer be reasonably denied a say in
the way the Square Mile is run.
In January the Smithfield traders, who are fighting a sharp increase in
rents to help pay for a Pounds 60m refurbishment of the market, won two
seats on the council. Only residents, partnerships and sole traders are
allowed to vote in City elections. The meat traders believe that low
turnouts in individual wards - the number of votes cast can be as low as 100
 -mean that they can win many more seats on the general council simply by
establishing offices in more wards.

FT  27 MAY 94 / All-seat stadiums delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday backed down on its regulations for eliminating
standing accommodation in football stadiums when it granted five English
first-division clubs an extension of a year on the all-seat deadline of
August 1.
Derby County, Grimsby Town, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and Sunderland will
now be allowed until August next year to comply with regulations on stadium
safety, established after Lord Justice Taylor's report on the Hillsborough
stadium disaster in 1989.
Eleven clubs applied to the Football Licensing Authority, which regulates
ground safety, for more time to install seats.
The authority consulted local authorities and the clubs themselves before
making a recommendation to the national heritage department.
The five clubs which won extensions are seeking planning permission to move
grounds. The cases presented by Barnsley, Chelsea, Manchester City,
Newcastle United, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town were not deemed
'sufficiently strong' to warrant a government deferral.
The authority said clubs needed to prove their cases were 'exceptional' and
that failure to meet the deadline could not have been foreseen.
The government said the clubs denied extensions had a further three weeks to
show that meeting the deadline would be impossible. If the government is not
satisfied with their reasons, they may be ordered to close their standing
accommodation.
The Football League, which represents all divisions except the Premiership,
said: 'This is a decision we very much welcome. We have always argued that
spending money on a ground that a club will leave in a few years is a waste
of time.'
The league said the clubs who were denied an extension would be
disappointed, but it said: 'We believe the football clubs have had a fair
hearing.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Lecturers to alter stance on dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual conference of the Natfhe lecturers' union, which starts tomorrow,
could signal a turning point in the union's long and disruptive dispute over
new contracts.
Earlier this week the union announced that members had voted decisively
against re-electing the general secretary, Mr Geoff Woolf, in a result which
was widely interpreted as a rejection of his handling of the contracts
dispute.
In the first round of voting Mr Woolf received 2,709 votes compared with
4,879 for the eventual winner, Mr John Akker. Mr Woolf eventually finished
fourth.
Mr Akker is deputy general secretary of the Association of University
Teachers, which last year formed a confederation with Natfhe. He built his
campaign around opposition to what he regarded as poor handling of the
dispute. He will move to Natfhe next month.
He said he wanted to emphasise that the union would make a 'new start' in
the contract negotiations under his leadership.
Natfhe gave up national bargaining earlier this year after the High Court
ruled that its ballot of members over a national strike had been unlawful.
It is now attempting to bargain locally.
The contracts, which employers have been trying to introduce for more than
12 months to allow greater flexibility after the removal of further
education colleges from local authority control last year, are fiercely
opposed by lecturers. They would cut annual holiday entitlement by half and
add an hour to the working day.
However, two smaller unions in the sector, the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, and the Association of College Management, have signed national
agreements over the contracts.
The conference takes place in Southport, Merseyside, and ends on Monday.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Whitehall agency to oversee offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new Whitehall agency is to be created to advise on the management of civil
service office accommodation and ensure that government bodies do not
inadvertently compete against each other for prime properties.
The agency will take over many of the responsibilities for co-ordinating
government office management from Property Holdings, the arm of the
environment department that manages the Common User Estate. The estate
provides 7.5m sq m of office space across Great Britain for government
departments, agencies and quangos.
The 3,267 offices in the estate are to be handed over to the bodies that
occupy them. They will take over responsibility for the rent, repairs and
maintenance - and for the cost of property they no longer need and which
cannot be re-let.
The demise of Property Holdings, which was created out of the Property
Services Agency in 1990, follows an investigation of the management of the
government's civil estate by the Cabinet Office efficiency unit.
This concluded that making departments directly responsible for their
offices would improve accountability and encourage them to make better use
of their accommodation.
The new agency will help smaller departments to manage their new
responsibilities and help to find new tenants for empty offices.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Carlton quality turns off ITC: Attracting large audiences,
even among ABC1s, will not always win praise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bitter row which broke out yesterday over the Independent Television
Commission's severe criticisms of the largest ITV company, Carlton
Television, can be symbolised by its attitude to two Carlton programmes.
One, Hollywood Wives, the commission denounced as 'essentially glib and
superficial' and the other, the documentary Thoi Noi, was described as 'an
excellent picture of present-day Vietnam'.
The Hollywood Wives series, which Carlton says won a higher proportion of
ABC1 viewers than the South Bank Show arts programme, attracted an average
of 10m viewers and a rating for one programme of 11.5m.
Thoi Noi, which was shown in prime time, was watched by 3m people.
A Carlton executive, who did not wish to be named, yesterday accused the ITC
of being like King Canute in trying to hold back the tide of commercialism
unleased by the Broadcasting Act 1990 with middle-class ideas of what
constituted quality programming.
The row over Hollywood Wives - the ITC did not like the editing into very
short sequences - is likely to grow.
The ITV Network Centre, also criticised by implication, has commissioned a
four-part follow-up series called Hollywood Kids which has already been
filmed at a cost of Pounds 1m and is due to be shown this autumn.
The ITC gave Carlton considerable credit for its regional programmes and
acknowledged that, after an uncertain start, its London News Network
operation had had a successful first year.
The commission reserved its main criticism for Carlton's network performance
which was described as 'well below expectations'. It added the stinging
verdict that, with some exceptions, the nationally shown programmes that
appeared under the Carlton Television name were neither distinctive nor of
noticeably high quality.
The commission noted that Carlton had proposed supplying a total of 521
hours to the national ITV network in 1993 and only about 128 hours of new
programmes had actually been transmitted.
This had been partly because the Network Centre, rather than any individual
company, decides what goes out on the network, and also because Thames
Television, which lost its licence to Carlton, continues to make so many
programmes for ITV as an independent producer.
The ITC did praise Frank Stubbs Promotes and Carlton's Good Sex Guide, and
children's programmes such as Old Bear Stories, though it noted that Dave
Allen had caused concern on taste and decency grounds and said that The Big
Story had been variable in quality and had covered no significant foreign
stories.
Overall the ITC said it wanted to see 'a significant improvement in 1994 and
beyond' - a judgment not nearly so severe as the formal warning given to
GMTV, the commercial breakfast station.
Under the Broadcasting Act, the ITC lost its responsibilities as a
broadcaster. It still has a legal duty to make sure ITV companies fulfil
their licence obligations - one of which is to broadcast a range of
high-quality programmes.
The commission attack on Carlton makes clear it is prepared to criticise the
quality of individual programmes. Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC,
said yesterday it would otherwise be very hard to define quality.
The ITC has a variety of sanctions to back up its idea of quality and
performance. It can fine an ITV company a maximum of 3 per cent of its
annual revenue for a first offence and up to 5 per cent for a subsequent
transgression. This could cost one of the bigger companies millions of
pounds.
The ITC can also shorten the licence held by any company and in extreme
cases actually take it away and readvertise the franchise - though there was
no sign yesterday of that being considered.
There was turmoil at Carlton yesterday, and disagreement about how the
company - which buys in most of its programmes from independent producers -
should respond.
Mr Paul Jackson, director of programmes in 1993 and now managing director of
Carlton Television, said yesterday he had no intention of resigning.
It is believed Mr Nigel Walmsley, the chairman, wanted to issue a
conciliatory statement. In the event, the company's response was couched in
more defiant terms.
'While we do not shy away from criticism, we regret that the ITC's review
did not acknowledge the quality of the four films in Desmond Wilcox's series
The Visit,' Carlton said.
At last night's annual programme awards of the Royal Television Society,
Margi Clark won the best female presenter's award for The Good Sex Guide and
Old Bear Stories picked up the children's entertainment award for Carlton.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Radio licence sale rules slated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The system which allowed the sale of London's AM and FM licences by a
merchant bank consortium four months before broadcasting was to start was
yesterday criticised by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP who chairs the
Commons heritage committee.
Reuters, the financial information and news group, is buying London News
Radio - the consortium backed by Guinness Mahon - which will start
broadcasting in October. Last September the LNR team won the battle for the
AM and FM licences then held by LBC.
Mr Kaufman said: 'This is the outcome of the broadcasting Act. Reuters is a
reputable company, so I am not too concerned about them, but the system is
deplorable.'
Guinness Mahon yesterday said: 'We were gearing up from day one to deliver a
real live broadcasting station.'
The Radio Authority, which approved the transfer, said there was no question
of unqualified parties being awarded licences and then selling them on
without safeguards.
LNR had produced the best broadcasting proposal, and Reuters would be
obliged to abide by the conditions on which the licence was awarded. These
lasted for the full eight-year term of the licence, and would apply to any
purchaser.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the sale of a national radio licence must
be approved in advance by the Radio Authority for the first year after the
licence is awarded, but local radio licences can be sold at any time.
The Guinness Mahon consortium is thought to have received up to Pounds 5m
for the LNR licence, which is Reuters' first move into radio. The merchant
bank described the Reuters approach as 'an offer we couldn't refuse'.
The consortium also spent an undisclosed amount last month to buy LBC, which
went into receivership after it lost its two London licences and was then
outbid for the third national commercial radio licence. LNR was anxious to
prevent a damaging gap before it began broadcasting.
Apart from Guinness Mahon, the principal beneficiary of the transaction will
be Mr Bruce Fireman, a corporate financier and media expert with Guinness
Mahon who became managing director of LNR but will now return.

The Insolvency Act was among measures which received royal assent before

It was introduced as an emergency measure to modify the obligations of
receivers to avoid the wholesale sacking of employees of financially
troubled companies.
Mr Neil Hamilton, junior trade minister, again called for the views of
interested parties on whether it would be appropriate to extend to other
receivers and managers the restrictions introduced by the act on liability
under contracts of employment adopted by administrators and administrative
receivers.
Representations should reach the insolvency service policy unit by August
15.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Corrupt ex-MoD official is jailed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A former director of the Ministry of Defence munitions procurement
department - who was paid Pounds 1.3m in illegal backhanders by foreign arms
companies - was jailed for a total of four years yesterday.
In Britain's biggest cash corruption case, Mr Gordon Foxley, 69, also had
assets worth more than Pounds 1.5m confiscated at Snaresbrook Crown Court in
east London.
Judge Andrew Brooks said various factors had prevented him from passing a
six-year sentence, including Mr Foxley's work record and the fact that he
was likely to lose his MoD pension.
Mr Foxley was found guilty last November of 12 counts of corruption between
1979 and 1984. His ill-health forced repeated sentence adjournments.
The judge said he was satisfied that, when inflation was taken into account,
Mr Foxley's benefit from his crimes was just over Pounds 2,092,500.
Mr Foxley was given 18 months to meet the confiscation order or serve a
further three years in prison.

FT  27 MAY 94 / BBC TV in Hong Kong deal
</HEADLINE>

   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC World Service Television will return next month to Hong Kong on a
limited basis.
The BBC last month lost its ability to reach the region after the
corporation agreed to take its channel off the Star Television satellite
system, now controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The move was
part of a deal to extend its time broadcasting to the Indian subcontinent.
Wharf Cable, Hong Kong's cable network, is to carry four hours a day of BBC
World Service Television news and information programming, with six hours
daily at the weekend.
Earlier this week the BBC announced that its news and information channel
would be available in New Zealand early next year on a new network of
regional stations.
Programmes will also be carried on the TVNZ national channel, TV1.
Talks aimed at averting further strikes on BBC television and radio were
adjourned last night and will resume today. A strike planned for today over
performance pay and hours was called off because of the talks.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Road costs 'overrun by 27%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Final payments for many roadworks have cost the Department of Transport an
average of 27 per cent more than the amount agreed in the original
contracts, says a confidential study commissioned by the department.
The findings provide further evidence that the department is failing to gain
the full benefit from lower construction contract prices won during the
recession.
Higher-than-expected settlements could create problems for the road
programme if more money than planned has to be found from current budgets to
pay for previous projects.
Announcing spending cuts on roads in the November Budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, said that falling construction prices would enable the
programme to be sustained at lower cost to the taxpayer.
The study by EC Harris, construction cost consultants, found that 50 road
contracts, completed between the financial years 1989-90 and 1992-93 for
more than Pounds 1bn, had cost the department on average 27 per cent more
than had been agreed.
Settlements also were 27 per cent higher than original cost estimates made
by the department's own engineers.
If this average cost overrun had applied to the department's Pounds 2.1bn
budget in 1993-94, it would have cost an additional Pounds 570m, the report
says. It found that claims for extra payments from contractors, mainly to
cover unforeseen ground conditions, were the biggest cause of overruns.
The gap between engineers' estimates, contract prices and actual payments
has been a continuing cause of concern to the department.
A report published in November by the National Audit Office, the
public-spending watchdog, into the spiralling cost of motorway widening
found that the first 10 schemes completed by the department had cost more
than double their original esti-mates.
The transport department, which recently launched the Highways Agency to
mastermind and improve road construction, commissioned the study by EC
Harris as part of its effort to reduce cost overruns.
The consultants recommend that more thorough geological and site
investigation should take place during design.
Variations to programmes once work has started should be kept to a minimum
as these often provide grounds for claims for additional payments by
contractors.
The consultants suggest that there should also be sufficient flexibility in
contracts to cover unforeseen delays.

FT  27 MAY 94 / BAe opposes US successor for Hercules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace stepped up pressure on the government yesterday to replace
the Royal Air Force's ageing Hercules transport aircraft with European
rather than US planes.
If Britain ordered the US aircraft, said BAe, the UK could lose its place in
a large European project and risked losing its leading position in aircraft
wing design.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, said the Ministry of Defence should
order the European Future Large Aircraft, which BAe is helping to develop,
rather than the latest generation of Lockheed Hercules, the C-130J.
The company has been lobbying the government directly, but concern that the
wider industrial impact of the decision may be overshadowed by departmental
budgetary issues has prompted companies including Rolls-Royce and Shorts of
Belfast, to raise the subject in public.
The MoD is deciding whether to replace half of its Hercules fleet with the
new C-130J from 1997, or refurbish them while it waits for the FLA to become
available around the year 2000.
A decision is expected by the end of this year.
Industry sources suggested that an early decision would favour Lockheed, and
that if the FLA lost the order British involvement in the project would have
to be scaled back.
BAe called on the government to defer an immediate decision. The company
said the FLA would have a much greater airlift capacity at a lower
fleet-ownership cost.
Mr Evans said the FLA would be able to carry 20 per cent more types of army
equipment than the C-130J.
Potential sales of the FLA are estimated by BAe at 400 to 700 aircraft,
which would provide Pounds 5.5bn to Pounds 12.8bn worth of work to the UK.
By comparison, BAe says that the C-130J would bring work estimated at Pounds
1.2bn to Pounds 2.2bn.
Development costs of the FLA are thought to be about Pounds 2bn over a
10-year period, with 20 per cent being funded by the UK if it took a full
part in the programme.
Lockheed said the C-130J would meet fully the specification laid down by the
MoD, and that the Commons defence committee had endorsed the idea of buying
them.

Mr Bob Phillis, BBC deputy director-general and chairman of BBC Worldwide,
which oversees the corporation's international activity, said yesterday in
Hong Kong that the deal was only a beginning: 'This is the first step
towards our goal of resuming 24-hour transmission of BBC World Service
Television to the peoples of the Far East.'
He said the BBC knew many Star viewers had been disappointed when the BBC
agreed to go off the northern beam of the Star satellite system before the
end of its contract in a deal to extend its time on the southern beam, which
covers the Indian subcontinent.

FT  27 MAY 94 / West country holds key for Lib Dems: A vital election
battleground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Clement-Jones, the Liberal Democrat campaign director, makes no bones
about it. The name of the game for his party in next month's European
elections is to topple Tory incumbents in the west country and southern
England.
The Liberal Democrats have never won a European seat, but local Liberal
Democrat campaigners say openly it would be a 'disaster' if the party failed
to win at least two - the best bets being Cornwall and West Plymouth, and
Somerset and Devon North.
But the party knows the potential is there for a much bigger haul. Last
year, the party captured Cornwall County Council, previously run by
independents, and took Somerset and Dorset county councils from the Tories.
It also became the largest party on Devon County Council.
To build on this, it must secure the votes of as many disaffected
Conservatives as possible in its key areas, squeeze the Labour vote and
secure the support of as many as possible of the people - between 15 per
cent and 25 per cent of the electorate - who voted Green in 1989.
'We are campaigning as much on the government's record as on Europe,' says
Mr Clement-Jones. If there are emotive local issues - as with water in the
west country - the party will change the emphasis of its message.
Mr Clement-Jones says environmental sustainability is one of the 'strands'
in all key Liberal Democrat policies. 'We are a fairly natural repository
for the Green vote,' he says. 'An awful lot of former Greens have joined the
party, including former councillors.'
The strategy for winning Labour supporters combines demonstrating that the
Liberal Democrats are an effective critic of government policy, and
highlighting figures in particular constituencies that encourage tactical
voting.
Mr Clement-Jones thinks the party's strong performance in recent local
elections will help. 'You have to be the local champion,' says Mr Clement
Jones. 'All across the south we are in control of county councils or the
largest party.'
The Liberal Democrats will pour the largest chunk of their Pounds 260,000
national election budget into their target areas.
'The key thing about any targeting strategy is to take nothing for granted,'
says Mr Clement-Jones. 'We do have discipline about targeting. I get very
little complaint from candidates because we are used to doing it on a local
level.'
The upshot is that the party has framed its national campaign around the
south-west. Mr Paddy Ashdown plans four visits to each of Devon and Cornwall
before polling. The Liberal Democrat leader played the starring role this
week in the first campaign rally in the Somerset market town of Taunton. The
aim is for a Liberal Democrat MP to visit these seats 'at least two days out
of three'.
Local party strategies follow the same blueprint. The party's election
literature for Cornwall says the election is 'your opportunity to send a
message to the government'. It also seeks to encourage tactical voting,
claiming that only the Liberal Democrat or the Conservative can win - 'no
other result is possible'.
But the biggest issue of the campaign so far is the exclusively regional
concern of water charges. South West Water, responsible for cleaning up the
area's long coastline, levies the highest charges in the country amid bitter
local resentment.
Local Conservatives ruefully agree with the Liberal Democrat assessment that
water charges are 'the south-west's poll tax'. Anger at European Union
policies on agriculture, fisheries and tourism give the campaign a further
distinctly regional flavour. This tends to back Tory claims that the region
is unusual, and that success there could not be repeated elsewhere in
England.
But will the breakthrough happen? Figures produced by the polling
organisation MORI for The Times from surveys carried out in March and April
suggest that the Liberal Democrats should win eight seats - all but one of
them in the south-west. Of those questioned in the south-west 38 per cent
backed the Liberal Democrats, 32 per cent the Tories and 28 per cent Labour
 -mostly concentrated in the Bristol seat, which Labour holds and expects to
retain.
Apart from their two strongest seats, on these figures the Liberal Democrats
should also take Devon and East Plymouth, Dorset and East Devon, Wiltshire
and Bath, Wight and Hampshire South, Hampshire North and Oxford, and East
Sussex and Kent South.
Another element has been boundary changes, in particular the split of
Plymouth where the city council is controlled by Labour. The city has been
divided into two Euro seats. The Liberal Democrat Euro-candidates in both
sides of the city can now tell Labour voters that they have been grouped
with a large rural area - so the Lib Dems offer the only chance to oust the
Tories.
One said to a Labour waverer: 'Just loan us your vote for the day to kick
the Tories out.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Campaign Diary: Unions delighted by a traditionalist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Prescott's 'back to 1945' speech yesterday went down well with his
union audience. But glowing references to traditionalist icons such as
nationalisation and Clement Attlee are one thing; getting them into party
policy is something else. Hard-headed Prescott watchers will be combing
through the party's response - due to be published today, if it arrives from
the printers on time - to Jacques Delors's employment white paper. It will
show that Prescott's first draft has been sanitised by the removal of
traditionalist rallying calls on issues such as government intervention in
industry and minimum incomes. Senior shadow cabinet members are making clear
privately that the paper is a joint effort - not a Prescott solo. Which goes
to show just how tight the modernist grip on Labour's top echelons really
is. Still, Prescott loves a good scrap.
Gordon Brown is keeping his sense of humour in spite of the leadership
tensions. Quizzed about opinion polls putting him well down the list of
candidates, he said voters were probably confusing him with George Brown,
Labour's tired and emotional deputy prime minister in the 1960s. George, a
right-winger, was beaten to the leadership by his great enemy Harold Wilson,
a nominal left-winger. Gordon is on rather bad terms with Robin Cook and
John Prescott, two of the likely leftwing contenders this time round. But
relations have yet to reach the depths of Attlee's cabinet, in which foreign
secretary Ernie Bevin, told that chancellor Hugh Dalton was his own worst
enemy, snapped back: 'Not while I'm alive, he ain't'
                       *      *      *
Philip Treleaven is pulling no punches as Conservative Euro candidate for
London South West, the UK's most marginal seat, where Labour has a 518
majority. Treleaven, a computing professor at University College, London,
says he is the Conservatives' most Eurosceptic candidate. He may be right.
No cabinet ministers are lined up to speak for him - however, Lord Tebbit
will be on the stump on Wednesday for his only intervention in the campaign.
Sir James Goldsmith was coming too, but he's busy running his own campaign
in France. The seat looks winnable on the basis of council results, but
Treleaven would stick out like a sore thumb among Tory crypto-federalist
Euro MPs.
                       *      *      *
If you really want a federal Europe, vote Green. The British Greens have
been bashing the Tories for playing the 'tired old nationalist card' and
accusing Labour and the Liberal Democrats of hiding their centralist
leanings behind domestic issues. There is no such equivocation in the common
manifesto of the European Union's 12 Green parties, published today. It
calls on the European parliament to draw up a constitution covering
legislative, executive and judicial powers. Doesn't leave much for poor old
Westminster, does it?
                       *      *      *
The Green party was traduced in this column on Monday by the suggestion that
it forgot to invite Fleet Street's political editors to the launch of its
manifesto. Actually, they did send the invitations, but no-one noticed.
Are the Liberal Democrats preparing their revenge on one of the centre
party's past benefactors? Launching a rural affairs policy paper this week,
Paul Tyler had much to say about the raw deal farmers were getting as a
result of the market power of a small number of food processors and
supermarket chains. Farm prices had 'bumped along the bottom' during 15
years of Tory rule, but supermarket prices had risen by 50 per cent, Tyler
complained, leaving the distinct impression that the Liberal Democrats would
try to do something about it. Lord Sainsbury, the former SDP benefactor, is
unlikely to be amused.
                       *      *      *
Not much in the Scottish National party's manifesto about defence - which is
odd given the SNP's agitation about the future of the closure-threatened
Rosyth naval base in Fife. The manifesto re-affirms the party's commitment
to eliminate nuclear weapons, which implies closure of the Faslane base on
the Clyde, suitable only for Trident submarines. But Faslane is Scotland's
only other naval base, so if Rosyth is closed that leaves the SNP without a
naval base. Bit awkward for a party committed to maintaining a surface navy.

FT  27 MAY 94 / SNP calls for vote blow to Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A big vote for the Scottish National party would strike panic into the
Conservative government and show the rest of Europe that Scotland was
serious about becoming 'a full and equal member of the European family', the
party said yesterday, James Buxton writes.
Launching the SNP's manifesto in Glasgow, Mr Alex Salmond, the party leader,
said Scotland was not getting the full benefit of the European Union because
it had no direct vote in EU institutions.
The SNP holds the only one of the eight Scottish seats in the European
parliament not held by Labour - Highlands and Islands, represented by Mrs
Winnie Ewing since 1979. But it believes it has a good chance of winning
North-East Scotland, taken by Labour in 1989 from the Conservatives by Mr
Henry McCubbin, who beat Mr Allan Macartney of the SNP by 2,615 votes. Both
are standing on June 9.
The SNP believes its strong performance in this month's regional council
elections shows that its support is growing. It won 27 per cent of the
Scottish vote in the regional elections, took control of Tayside and now
controls Grampian in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.
The SNP manifesto says its MEPs would work for a fairer distribution of EU
jobs and press for a leading European institution to be brought to Scotland.
EU policy must be co-ordinated to create jobs and speed up Europe's move out
of recession, it adds.
The SNP argues that independence would transform Scotland from 'a powerless
province in an unequal British union to a powerful partner in the new
European Union of equal member states'. Mr Salmond said landlocked
Luxembourg 'has more say about Scotland's fishing industry than we do'.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Howard sparks race row: European veto issue heightens
tensions in campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, KEVIN BROWN, ROLAND RUDD and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives yesterday accused Labour and the Liberal Democrats of
seeking to undermine Britain's immigration controls, as the row over the
UK's ability to block decisions made in Brussels gained pace.
Raising the race issue for the first time in the increasingly ill-tempered
European campaign, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said it was vital that
Britain kept its European Union veto over immigration and asylum matters.
This was because firm immigration controls were 'the foundation of good race
relations'. By espousing policies that would 'fatally undermine' Britain's
veto, both opposition parties were putting at risk 'our immigration controls
and our race relations legislation'. Mr Howard added: 'They would make race
relations in this country significantly worse.'
The two opposition parties hit back strongly, with Labour saying it had
asked the Campaign for Racial Equality to investigate the Conservative 'race
scares'.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour campaign manager, said his party had repeatedly
made clear it would retain the British veto on justice and immigration
issues as well as on taxation, defence and security matters. 'The Tories go
on telling lies about us, and I go on saying that they lied their way
through the 1992 general election,' he said. 'We are not going to let them
get away with lying their way through this one.'
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, said it was 'distasteful'
for the Conservatives to 'play this card at this stage in the campaign'. It
was 'not at all appealing to see this sort of jingoism.'
Meanwhile, Mr Paddy Ashdown used a visit to Eastleigh, where the Liberal
Democrats are hoping to sweep to victory in a parliamentary by-election next
month, to attempt to tackle suggestions that the party's policy on Britain's
veto was in disarray.
Mr Ashdown drew a distinction between the legislative and executive
decisions in the European Union. He said the Liberal Democrats supported the
retention of the national veto in executive decisions but not in the
legislative.
National issues, such as defence, finance and immigration would also be
subject to an effective national veto because of the party's support for
double qualified majority voting. Mr Ashdown also made clear that any change
in the national veto would be the subject of a referendum.
However, Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said Mr Ashdown's distinction
between legislative and executive decisions was far too blurred to be of any
meaningful use. Mr Ashdown's commitment to turn the Council of Ministers
into a 'Euro-cabinet' showed he would settle for 'nothing less than a
centralised European superstate'.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, also campaigning in Eastleigh
yesterday, accused the Tories of dishonestly pretending they were the true
defenders of Britain's sovereignty against European legislation.
She said that the government had surrendered Britain's veto in Europe eight
years ago when it signed the Single European Act - and that this was being
conveniently forgotten in the Conservatives' European election campaign. She
added that the Tories were insisting that a Labour government would
surrender Britain's veto in Europe in spite of repeated denials by
opposition MPs.
'We have refuted this silly lie, but repeatedly they allege it and
repeatedly it resurfaces,' she said.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Major puts animals on agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tories yesterday attempted to soften their 'hunting-and-shooting' image
 -making animal welfare a central policy in their European campaign
alongside farming, fishing and the countryside.
They launched a dossier, Animal Welfare - The Conservative Record, listing
government action on animal experiments, whaling, elephants, wildlife,
dangerous and stray dogs and farm animals.
In the foreword, Mr John Major, the prime minister, writes: 'The welfare of
animals is no longer a fringe issue.
'Most people feel that there is room to improve the way animals are treated.
No other government - in Britain or abroad - can match the record of this

'We have taken comprehensive steps to strengthen the protection of animals
in the wild, on the farm and in laboratories.'
At a news conference at Conservative Central Office, Mr Nicholas Soames,
junior agriculture minister, said: 'Historically, we in the British Isles
have taken pride on our efforts to protect animals from cruelty and
neglect.'
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, attacked Labour for seeing the
countryside as 'an urban playground', and the Liberal Democrats for failing
to mention animal welfare in their manifesto.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Premiers offer Sinn Fein more time on peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments said last night they were prepared to give
republican leaders more time to decide whether to embrace the Northern
Ireland peace process, provided they end sectarian violence immediately.
But Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds insisted after a 90-minute meeting
at Downing Street that they would press ahead with efforts to forge a
durable political settlement in the province in advance of the next full
Anglo-Irish summit in July.
The two prime ministers said good progress had been made on a framework
document 'grounded in' last December's Downing Street Declaration designed
to instil new momentum into political talks involving Ulster's main
constitutional parties.
But they would give no guarantee that the framework document would be
completed in time for the planned summit.
Yesterday's wide-ranging but informal talks came after Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, pledged to give a
'definitive' response on the question of what part the UK-Irish declaration
would play in the overall peace process.
Mr Adams also signalled that republicans were now satisfied with the
clarification London had given of the joint statement's meaning.
He said: 'We are committed to building the peace process regardless of how
significant a part that declaration plays. We may have some other questions.
But I doubt it.'
In remarks interpreted by some as an attempt to win support for Sinn Fein
candidates in next months European elections, Mr Adams said he was 'quite
convinced' that a settlement was going to come out of the peace process. He
said Sinn Fein would meet after polling day on June 9 to 'work out a
timetable and discuss it with our leaderships'.
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist party security spokesman, said Mr Adams was
preparing to announce a 'cynical and very temporary ceasefire' to maximise
the Sinn Fein vote in the European elections.
Emerging from a 'very useful' meeting at which matters of mutual interest
were discussed, Mr Reynolds counselled patience, saying if the 'internal
debate' among the republican movement took 'another few weeks, so be it' -
as long as the violence ended at once.
In carefully balanced remarks, he emphasised that neither republican or
loyalist paramilitaries would gain anything by continuing their armed
campaigns. He added: 'We are waiting for a decision by both organisations to
desist from violence.'
Mr Major praised the 'dramatic' improvement in cross-border security
co-operation. He said few people would have imagined how much progress had
been made in addressing the province's problems over the past 12 months.

FT  27 MAY 94 / OFT probes bus service rivalries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fierce rivalries between bus companies prompted the competition authorities
to intervene in Darlington and Kent yesterday.
The Office of Fair Trading has begun an investigation into United Automobile
Services of Darlington after a complaint from Your Bus that United was
running uneconomic services to force its rival to withdraw its services.
The probe is expected to take six months.
In Kent, meanwhile, Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services and its parent
company, Einkhorn, face the threat of proceedings after failing to give the
OFT satisfactory undertakings about bus services.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, said he was considering
issuing an order after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report found that
Maidstone was operating a monopoly against the public interest in mid and
west Kent.
Mr Hamilton said the order might require M&amp;D to give its competitors access
to Pentagon bus station in Maidstone, to maintain services and fares
introduced in response to competing services after these had been withdrawn,
and to rescind selective reductions in fares on journeys which preceded or
followed those of a competitor.

FT  27 MAY 94 / City fears unwelcome Budget changes to dividend tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern is growing in the City that unfavourable changes in dividend
taxation in the next Budget may emerge from the Treasury's review of savings
and investment.
The National Association of Pension Funds will soon send a report to Mr
Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury who is conducting
the review, arguing that there is no evidence to suggest that high dividend
payouts restrict corporate investment.
Mr Dorrell said in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry council
last week that dividend payouts, which have risen substantially since 1979,
may have become too high and inflexible.
The issue was also raised in the context of this week's white paper on
competitiveness, when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the new
cabinet committee on competitiveness would look closely at dividend payouts.
City analysts have already started to respond to the government's arguments.
Mr Mark Brown of Hoare Govett has published an eight-page note arguing that
excessive target rates of return - rather than high dividends - have
restricted corporate investment.
Mr Geoff Lindey, chairman of the association's investment committee, also
points out that the rise in payouts after 1979 partly reflected a response
to the lifting of dividend controls imposed in the 1970s.
Government statements on the dividend issue have increased nervousness in
the equity market when traders are already concerned about trends in
European interest rates. Any change in dividend taxation could hit income
received by pension funds, the largest group of investors in UK equities.
Mr Norman Lamont's 1993 Budget cut the rate of advance corporation tax from
25 per cent to 20 per cent which reduced the tax credit available to pension
funds and other non-taxpayers by 6.25 per cent.
Some in the City fear the next Budget might see a further cut in the credit
to, say, 15 per cent. 'When Lamont made the change, it was in the context of
a move towards a 20 per cent basic rate of income tax. Any move below 20 per
cent would be seen as a step on the road to total abolition,' said Mr Adrian
Cooper, UK economist at James Capel.
Such a move might badly affect the equity market. Mr Edmond Warner, head of
strategy and economics at Kleinwort Benson said: 'When Norman Lamont changed
dividend taxation, the market mood was positive as Britain emerged from
recession. Now the market is in a different stage, and valuations are quite
full.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / MP urges probe of utility regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, has
called for a royal commission to examine the performance of utility
regulators and the effectiveness of different regulatory regimes.
Mr Caborn, a Labour MP, said regulation had become 'a substitute for
policymaking, with crucial decisions left in the hands of unelected and
unaccountable regulators'.
He said areas which needed to be covered included the accountability of
regulators; the feasibility of streamlining the various agencies,
particularly in the energy sector; the role of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission and the Office of Fair Trading; and the case for widening the
regulatory role to include the right to review spending on research and
development.
Fierce competition will remain in world coal markets until well into the
next century, Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, said yesterday.
However by the mid to late 1990s, prices agreed in contracts with generators
will be truly competitive with contract prices of imported coal delivered to
inland power stations.

It is alleged the company failed to take all reasonably practicable steps to

FT  27 MAY 94 / Monks calls for union change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for full employment requires unions to change their behaviour, Mr
John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said yesterday.
He told the Royal Society of Arts that unions had given too little attention
to job security. 'All too often pay is at the top of the bargaining agenda
and job security effectively at the bottom,' he said.
'Some of the excessive rigidities in our labour market such as systematic
overtime, predominantly a male phenomenon, are as much the result of
employer preferences as trade union demands, but nevertheless we share the
blame.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / US sued in airbase pollution claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglian Water is suing the US government for allegedly polluting its water
supply in a legal action which tests the findings of a recent landmark case
in the UK on pollution liability, Peggy Hollinger writes.
Friends of the Earth, the environment campaign group, revealed yesterday
that Anglian is alleging in the High Court that a water supply was polluted
by a US military petrol station at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk. Anglian is
suing the US government for more than Pounds 500,000, which it claims is the
cost of treating the water and installing protective systems to prevent
further pollution.
The action comes just six months after Cambridge Water lost a similar suit
against Eastern Counties Leather, the tanning company, although it was ruled
that some polluters could be liable if they could reasonably have foreseen
the effects of their actions.
Anglian's writ alleges that the US military authorities were negligent in
allowing petrol to escape into the soil and for failing to check for leaks.
Friends of the Earth said yesterday that several other military bases were
polluters.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Record sales of fleet cars forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is on course for record fleet car sales of more than 800,000 this
year in a total market for new cars which may top 2m for the first time
since 1990, a senior Vauxhall executive said yesterday.
The assessment of the market prospects, the most optimistic from a leading
industry source this year, was made by Mr Michael Banner, Vauxhall's fleet
sales director.
Total fleet car sales were up 17 per cent on a year-on-year basis during the
first four months of the year and the trend is expected to continue, Mr
Banner said.
He was commenting on the results of an eight-month investigation into the
structure and future of the company car sector by Henley Management College.
The research, commissioned by Vauxhall, indicates conclusively that 'the
company car is here to stay', said Mr Peter Cooke, director of the college's
Centre for Automotive Management Research.
The college questioned 2,000 fleet operators, dealers, contract hire,
finance and daily rental companies for what it claims is the most
comprehensive study undertaken into the future of the market.
It concludes there will be no decline in the number of company cars but
there will be significant changes in the methods of provision, funding and
management. Mr Cooke said: 'The recession brought us leaner, meaner fleet
managers who are demanding greater added value, often expressed in terms of
known costs and reliability to reduce the risk on the business.'
One identified change with implications for manufacturers is the rapid
growth in the number of women managers. By the end of the decade 38 per cent
of managers are forecast to be women, many of them likely to have a partner
also running a company vehicle.
Mr Cooke said one partner was likely to require a 'lifestyle' vehicle such
as a four-wheel-drive, rather than the household having two similar cars.
A surge in the number of self-employed people, reaching 25 per cent to 30
per cent of the working population by the end of the decade, is expected to
create a boom in small business cars.

FT  27 MAY 94 / British Gas hits at constraints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas yesterday called for the early lifting of regulations that
restrict its activities in the commercial market of consumers who use more
than 2,500 therms a year.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, told an energy conference in London that
government efforts designed to promote competition were now
'anti-competitive, because they tilt the playing field in favour of other
companies'.
British Gas has to reduce its share of the market for users of more than
2,500 therms to 55 per cent by 1995. However Mr Brown said market share
constraints had already resulted in competitors capturing 45 per cent of the
market.
Mr Brown also complained that British Gas was subsidising independent gas
marketers that used the gas pipeline system. 'It makes a nonsense of free
market forces . . . and is sending false signals to end users of gas.'
He rejected competitors' allegations that British Gas had overvalued its
transportation system.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, will announce early next month the formula
which will govern the prices that British Gas will be able to charge for
transportation, and the rate of return it can earn on its transportation
assets.
Mr Brown warned that the phased opening of the domestic market, due to begin
in 1996, was a 'massive experiment' affecting 18m households, and that there
was 'precious little time to work out potential problems'.
Mr Jonathan Stern, a fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs,
also warned about possible problems of adhering to the government's
ambitious timetable. He suggested that it might be best if legislation to
open up the domestic sector slipped by a year to give the industry more time
to work out potential problems.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, conceded that de-regulation
on such a scale had not been attempted elsewhere. She said Ofgas was aware
that a number of problems needed to be solved before competition was
introduced'.
Ms Spottiswoode, who has been caught up in a political controversy over her
refusal to pass on to consumers the costs of energy savings schemes, said
Ofgas will publish a paper on the subject in July.
She hoped it would spark off 'an extensive debate in parliament'.
Ms Spottiswoode said British Gas and Ofgas were looking at ways in which
they could promote energy efficiency without having to tax consumers.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Openness pledged on Bank meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Labour government would continue the practice of publishing the minutes of
the monthly monetary policy discussions between the chancellor and the Bank
of England, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said yesterday.
Mr Brown said he had no plans to stop publication of the minutes in spite of
the political difficulties that could follow the disclosure of differences
with the Bank.
His pledge, given at an election press conference, could be an important
step in Labour's battle to convince the financial markets of the credibility
of its economic policies and its commitment to low inflation.
The danger of an open clash with the Bank over inflation prospects might,
however, inhibit the pace at which Labour could implement an expansionary
policy aimed at creating full employment.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank, told the Commons Treasury committee
this week that publication would contribute to financial market stability by
showing that blatant political manipulation of interest rates was not
possible.
Mr Brown said the publication of minutes showed that tensions between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the Bank were increasing because Mr
Clarke was unable to convince Mr George of the credibility of his policy.
'With lower productivity, a bigger trade deficit, a smaller manufacturing
sector, the slowest rate of growth of exports of any European Union member .
. . Britain now desperately needs a growth strategy that gives sustainable
long-term growth,' he said.
Aides said Mr Brown believed that Labour's plans for greater spending on
education and training would reduce inflationary pressures by removing
capacity bottlenecks from the economy.
They said this would substantially reduce the danger of politically damaging
clashes with the Bank over the pace of economic growth.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Ban on arms sales to Israel lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is to lift its 12-year embargo on arms sales to Israel and will
consider similar action on Syria if further progress is made towards a
comprehensive Middle East peace settlement, it was announced yesterday.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said in a Commons written answer
that the decision to resume arms sales to Israel had been taken 'in the
light of favourable developments in the Middle East peace process, in
particular the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho'.
Israel has long pressed the UK government to lift the embargo, which was
imposed in 1982 in response to Israel's invasion of Lebanon.
Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, welcomed the move and, in
an interview on Israel Radio, said the decision would make it easier for
Israel to sell arms to the UK. 'It has been very difficult for us to sell
Israeli weapons in Britain because, in many cases, there was a formal or
informal condition that some of the components had to be British,' he said.
Mr Moshe Raviv, Israel's ambassador to the UK, also welcomed the move,
saying it would help to improve relations between the two countries.
The decision brings Britain into line with the rest of the European Union,
but is not expected to yield quick results for UK defence industries. The US
is Israel's largest arms supplier, offering substantial military aid and
soft loans as part of its commitment to maintaining that country's arms
superiority in the region.
Mr Hurd said applications for arms sales to Israel would be considered
within established international guidelines.
No early decision is expected on an end to the eight-year embargo on arms
sales to Syria.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Accountant fails in appeal over censure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading accountant yesterday lost his appeal against a finding that he
failed adequately to supervise an employee who was convicted of forgery and
deception.
Mr Brian Worth, a former head of the investigation committee of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, was 'admonished' by
its disciplinary committee last November. The action was over his
supervisory action while chairman of Clark Kenneth Levanthal, an
international network of accountancy firms including Clark Whitehill in the
UK.
The institute investigation was triggered in late 1991 after the conviction
of Mr Nicholas Young, a former executive director of CKL. Mr Worth resigned
from the investigation committee later in 1991.
The appeal committee yesterday said it found the complaint proved and
ordered Mr Worth to pay Pounds 1,000 costs.
Mr Young used CKL's address and stationery to attract investors and claimed
their money would be invested in offshore trusts. In fact it was used to bet
on horse races.
Clark Whitehill said: 'We are entirely clear that we have no legal
liability.' Mr Worth's solicitors said the institute had found he had no
connection with or knowledge of the fraud, and he had received the mildest
punishment possible.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Prescott sets out agenda for leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for a return to the socialist values of the 1945 Labour government
was urged yesterday by Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, as
he launched his campaign for the Labour leadership.
Speaking to the Prison Officers' Association conference in Portsmouth, Mr
Prescott sketched out a traditionalist agenda for a government-led return to
economic prosperity.
But as leadership speculation raged at Westminster, it emerged that Mr
Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, and Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader,
have discussed the prospects for a joint ticket for the leadership and
deputy leadership.
Such a 'balanced ticket' between the modernist Mr Brown and the
traditionalist Mrs Beckett would be potentially attractive to Labour voters
seeking a continuation of the ideologically tolerant atmosphere established
by John Smith.
Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary and leading modernist, is also said
to be considering the merits of a joint candidacy with Mr Prescott or Mr
Robin Cook, the traditionalist shadow trade and industry secretary.
Mr Blair, who set out his vision of Labour's future on Wednesday, used an
address to the CMA post office managers' union conference in Southport,
Merseyside, to urge the government to sign the social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty.
Mr Blair's campaign will be given a significant boost today by a MORI poll
in The Times which shows that he is much more popular than Mr Prescott among
trade unionists and working-class voters.
The poll gives Mr Blair 32 per cent support among Labour supporters,
compared with 21 per cent for Mr Prescott, 12 per cent for Mrs Beckett and
Mr Brown and 7 per cent for Mr Cook. It says Labour's lead over the
Conservatives among unskilled workers would rise 10 percentage points if Mr
Blair became leader.
In a speech stocked with references to traditionalist icons, Mr Prescott
attacked the government's privatisation programme and pledged that a future
Labour government would renationalise British Rail and private prisons.
In a passionate attack on the government he contrasted Labour's support for
public service and accountability with Conservative support for 'private
greed and sleaze'.
After 15 years of Conservative government, the UK had witnessed a return to
the five evils of idleness, want, squalor, disease and ignorance identified
in the wartime coalition government's 1944 white paper on full employment.
Mr Prescott's prospects would be substantially improved if he could win the
endorsement of senior union leaders. However, many leaders are unwilling to
endorse a candidate because they believe Mr Blair, whose modernist policies
many find uncongenial, is unbeatable.

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: China liberalises in drive to join world
trade body - Gatt chief welcomes MFN renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China launched a determined drive yesterday for admission to the World Trade
Organisation, the successor body to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, by removing import licences and quotas on 195 items. It pledged
further liberalisation.
The move came before President Bill Clinton announced renewal of China's
trading status as a Most Favoured Nation, an announcement welcomed in
advance by Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, in Hong Kong
yesterday.
China has stated its desire to be a founder member of the WTO, expected to
be established on January 1 to replace the Gatt.
In spite of yesterday's liberalisation package, quotas and licensing
restrictions still apply to more than 700 products, but China says it would
phase out half of those restrictions under an existing accord with the US.
Mr Long Yongtu, China's chief Gatt negotiator, is due to visit Europe and
the US for Gatt discussions next week. He will go first to Brussels, then to
Washington, where Gatt talks are scheduled on June 3, the deadline for US
renewal of China's MFN status.
'Gatt has no responsibility in the area of political issues which underly
the issue of MFN status, but the MFN decision has an indirect effect on the
negotiations because MFN policy is relevant to Gatt members,' Mr Sutherland
said.
To secure Gatt membership, he said, China had to improve the transparency of
its existing trade regime, demonstrate uniformity in applying those laws,
clarify how its trading companies operate, and elucidate tariff and
non-tariff barriers.
But Mr Sutherland emphasised that significant steps had already been taken
in both trade and foreign exchange regimes. While questioning China's
ability to become a member by January 1, he was confident that the WTO
itself would be in place on schedule.
'I believe it's very important that the US as a leading trading country with
an absolute interest in the development of the multilateral system should
provide leadership in this area, and it seems it is determined to do so,' he
said, adding: 'I would consider it inconceivable that the US would retard
the progress of something not just desirable for the world as a whole, but
for the US itself.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, who opposed the North American Free
Trade Agreement, has endorsed ratification of the Gatt world trade
agreement, saying it will raise America's living standards, AP reports from
Washington.
Mr Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, was joined at a Capitol Hill news
conference by six other House Democrats who had voted against Nafta when it
was approved last year.
Mr Gephardt said he hoped the US Congress would ratify the Gatt accord this
year, but it would make little difference if it was delayed until 1995.
'We ought to do it when we're ready to do it,' he said.
US trade representative Mickey Kantor, meanwhile, said Mr Gephardt's
endorsement was a sign that Congress would pass the Uruguay Round agreement.
Mr Kantor said he was optimistic that Congress would ratify Gatt by August.
The main issue still to be resolved was whether to make up lost tax revenue
from tariff cuts or get a budget waiver from Congress.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has moved to lower the temperature in its acrimonious farm-trade
dispute with Canada. Mr Jim Blanchard, US ambassador in Ottawa, made an
unusual appearance on Canadian television to attack the increasingly
aggressive tactics of Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, writes Bernard
Simon in Toronto.
'I don't think he had authority from the president and I don't agree with
him,' Mr Blanchard said, referring to recent efforts by Mr Espy to secure
Brazil's support for Washington's case against Canada. Mr Blanchard is a
former governor of Michigan. According to diplomats, his TV appearance had
Washington's blessing. Mr Espy claimed on a recent trip to Latin America
that Canada was dumping wheat in Brazil. He offered to provide the
Brazilians with evidence of unfair trade practices by Canada.
US and Canadian agriculture and trade ministers will meet in June in another
effort to resolve their dispute, which centres on a surge in US purchases of
Canadian durum wheat, used mainly for pasta.
The US plans to impose a punitive tariff on imports of Canadian wheat, flour
and barley above a specified level if agreement is not reached by July 1.
The action would be taken under Gatt Article 28, which allows a country to
impose new trade curbs in cases where existing duties are considered too low
to provide adequate protection for domestic producers. But it also permits
the target country to seek compensation through tariff increases of its own.
Canada has threatened to retaliate against a wide range of US products.
Washington charges that Canadian rail subsidies and the Canadian Wheat
Board's secretive pricing practices give Canadian wheat an unfair advantage.
However, a number of investigations in recent years have dismissed these
arguments.
Despite his criticism of Mr Espy's hardline tactics, Mr Blanchard reiterated
Washington's demand for Ottawa to liberalise bilateral trade in agriculture,
notably Canadian imports of dairy products, eggs and poultry.

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Nafta accord back on Chile's agenda -
Environment and labour issues are expected to dominate talks with the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was with more than a touch of bravado that Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's
finance minister, announced earlier this month that a deal to join the North
American Free Trade Agreement could be wrapped up by next March.
'What I did, on purpose, was to put Nafta on the front page again ..to start
the discussion,' he says.
It worked: a Nafta deal, or at least a bilateral accord with the US - an
issue largely dormant during the final period of the administration of
President Patricio Aylwin - has reappeared at the top of Chile's
international agenda.
Mr Aninat's crusade has been much helped by the publication in the US of a
draft bill - sponsored by Mr Richard Gephardt, the Democratic House leader -
seeking to initiate free-trade talks with Chile under 'fast-track'
procedures.
The bill seeks to bind provisions on workers' rights and environmental
protection into the accord, rather than negotiating side agreements, as was
done with Mexico.
Although this could imply tougher criteria for Chile, the initiative from Mr
Gephardt, who opposed Nafta, is seen as a sign of potential cross-party
support. No one doubts the oft-repeated promise that Chile will be next.
None of this means, however, that informal talks, due to begin in Washington
next month will be straightforward. 'Negotiations will be much more
difficult than people think,' says a US official.
The environment is likely to prove the biggest sticking point. Chile's
mining, fishing, forestry and fruit industries - backbone of the export
sector - have been criticised on environmental grounds. Many older mines
fall far short of international standards on disposal of hazardous
by-products, while Chile still exports 100-year-old trees in the form of
woodchips.
Mr Aninat recognises that the environment is an issue on which 'frankly
speaking, we do have some problems'.
On labour, he is more sanguine. Workers' rights were greatly strengthened
under President Aylwin, after years of repression under military rule, and
are now more protected than anywhere on the continent, he says.
But other difficulties are likely to emerge as talks proceed, such as
Chile's price-band system of surcharges on agricultural imports. Washington
will also push for stringent measures to protect investments.
More tricky still may be the issue of intellectual property rights,
particularly on pharmaceuticals. Although Chile has recently tightened up
its patent laws, it has not introduced protection for pharmaceuticals being
developed.
'There are quite significant differences (over patents) which it will be
very difficult for Chile to address in the short-to-medium term,' says the
US official. Mr Aninat is aware that negotiations on this topic will be
'hard'.
Mr Jose Antonio Guzman, president of the CPC, Chile's main business
organisation, said recently: 'We are only prepared to make an agreement with
the US if it is beneficial for the country and if it doesn't impose
environmental and labour clauses beyond our capacity.' The CPC would oppose
any deal damaging Chile's ability to compete, he said.
Farmers insist protective barriers cannot be dismantled until the US
government stops subsidising its own farmers.
For Mr Aninat, locking into the world's biggest economy has strategic
implications. 'We feel that Chile, because of its size and dependence on
foreign trade and investment, cannot remain isolated . . . . The world is
walking away from multilateral Gatt rules, unfortunately, and more into
regional trading blocs,' he says. 'We need to get hooked into intelligent
alliances.'
The US has wider objectives than the purely commercial. It is keen that
Chile, which it regards as one of Latin America's most open and modern
economies, should be rewarded for its progress.
But it has yet to decide whether it favours a bilateral accord or Chile's
joining Nafta. Until that issue is resolved and fast-track authorised, all
talk of timetables is premature.
Indeed, Mr Aninat confides that his March 1995 target is 'very optimistic'
and 'more a signalling device than a real bet'. However, he believes that,
once formal talks start, negotiations should be much quicker than those with
Mexico, which took two years.
Before this can happen, Washington must resolve to turn fine words into
action. 'This process is like a tango, and you need both parties to dance,'
says Mr Aninat. 'We cannot start dancing on our own.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gatt 'would welcome renewal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, would welcome a decision by President Clinton to renew China's
trade privileges.
This would have an indirect bearing on China's bid for re-entry to the world
trade system. 'Gatt has no responsibility in the area of political issues
which underly the issue of Most Favoured Nation status, but the MFN decision
has an indirect effect on the negotiations because MFN policy is relevant to
Gatt members,' he said.
China has stated its desire to be a founder member of the World Trade
Organisation which - subject to international ratification - comes into
being on January 1. The country was a Gatt founder member but quit after the
communists came to power in 1949.
Mr Sutherland recently returned from Beijing, where he found a great
willingness to re-enter Gatt and meet its entry requirements. The prospects
for resolving outstanding issues must be assisted by a satisfactory
conclusion to any issues outstanding with one of the world's biggest
traders, he said.
To secure membership, China had to improve the transparency of its existing
trade regime, demonstrate uniformity in applying those laws, clarify how its
trading companies operate, and elucidate tariff and non-tariff barriers. But
Mr Sutherland stressed that significant steps had already been taken in both
trade and foreign exchange regimes.
While questioning China's ability to become a member by January 1, Mr
Sutherland has every confidence in the WTO itself being in place by then.
'I believe Mr Clinton is absolutely committed to the January 1 date, and I
believe it's very important that the US as a leading trading country with an
absolute interest in the development of the multilateral system should
provide leadership in this area, and it seems it is determined to do so.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US alters China MFN stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition to President Bill Clinton's decision to extend Most Favoured
Nation trading status to China may depend on what non-human rights
conditions are attached.
An actual announcement, the presentation of which will be closely watched,
was expected either later yesterday or today. The president ducked all
questions on the subject during his early morning jog, but administration
officials have made it clear that the central decision to de-link MFN and
human rights had already been reached earlier this week.
The likeliest target for modest sanctions are Chinese-made guns and
ammunition, specifically the SKS rifle, once in standard use by the Chinese
army and throughout the former eastern bloc. The ban on sales of Chinese
weapons in the US was lifted in 1987.
Nearly 1m SKS guns were imported into the US last year by two Chinese
trading companies with close ties to the Red Army, making it the fourth most
popular weapon in the country, after three cheap handguns.
SKS rifles were described in an article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday
by a US government official as 'high tech firearms at Saturday Night Special
prices'. A ban could, therefore, be portrayed as part of the anti-crime
drive.
An embargo on an easily identifiable product would be easier to enforce than
a broader proscription on goods made by Chinese state industries and prison
camps, as demanded by some in Congress and as considered recently by the
government. Congressman David Bonior, Democrat whip, warned yesterday Mr
Clinton could face a big fight in congress if he were not 'tough enough'
with China.
The administration is resigned to the fact that it is certain to come under
attack in Congress and human rights organisations for backing away from the
president's executive order of last June tying renewal of MFN to
improvements in seven areas of Chinese human rights policies. Measurable
progress has only been made in two areas.
Some of that sting may be drawn by the prospect of large US commercial
contracts with China. Yesterday, for example, Boeing was obliged to deny
comment on reports it was close to landing a Chinese order for over 50
airliners valued at over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4m).

'It's a dialogue of the deaf,' sighed one European trade official yesterday,
referring to the outraged reaction of US environmental groups to the news
that a Gatt panel has once again ruled against US trade measures intended to
protect dolphins.
The panel report, circulated to the parties involved last Friday, says the
US is not entitled under Gatt to use trade measures to force other countries
to adopt its own domestic policies, environmental or otherwise. This, the
report argues, would undermine the whole basis of the multilateral trading
system.
The US operates an embargo on tuna imported from countries which catch too
many dolphins in tuna fishing nets. A secondary embargo applies to countries
which import and process tuna from the offending countries. But to satisfy
the terms of the US law, it is not enough to kill fewer dolphins; a country
also has to adopt fishing methods which conform to those used by US fishing
fleets.
The latest panel report, which relates to the secondary tuna embargo, adopts
somewhat different reasoning from its predecessor. The three-man panel says
Gatt rules do not in principle disbar countries from using trade measures to
protect 'the global commons' or environmental resources outside their own
jurisdictions.
However, the panel argues, these measures have to be designed directly to
protect the resource in question and need to satisfy the criterion that no
other more Gatt-consistent measure is available. On both counts, it says,
the US embargo fails.
Independently of the embargo, measures to protect dolphins have resulted in
a steep drop in kills in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, where dolphins swim
with tuna shoals, from over 100,000 a year in the mid-1980s to fewer than
5,000 last year.

FT  27 MAY 94 / ECGD restores cover for Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Export Credits Guarantee Department said yesterday it had
resumed export credit insurance cover for Brazil, after a gap of 11 years,
Reuter reports.
The decision followed a successful restructuring of Brazil's commercial bank
debt and 'encouraging progress with its economic stabilisation programme',
an ECGD statement said.
'ECGD's restoration of cover for Brazil will represent a whole new area of
opportunity for British business,' said Mr Michael Heseltine, UK Trade and
Industry Secretary. 'Brazil is the ninth largest economy in the world and
will be opening up even more now that the effects of the debt crisis are
receding,' he said.
Cover was withdrawn in 1983 after substantial payment delays. Limited cover
was resumed in 1989 but was suspended almost immediately when Brazil again
stopped honouring its debts.
ECGD said cover would concentrate on business with the Brazilian private
sector. Some public sector organisations will be eligible if they can show
their receipts of foreign exchange will cover payments.
The ECGD activities will be concentrated on business which promotes Brazil's
economic rehabilitation.
'Brazil is the 14th country for which ECGD has resumed cover over the last
two years. The significant increase in the number of markets on cover,
together with increased availability of cover for major markets and
reductions in premium, is giving British exporters greater opportunities to
compete for business overseas, and demonstrates this government's commitment
to support UK companies in their export efforts', the UK minister said.
In Sao Paulo: Brazil's inflation fell to 44.66 per cent in May, compared to
last month, an official at the Economic Research Institute said. The index,
calculated by the University of Sao Paulo, measures inflation at weekly
intervals.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Washington's new anti-trust vigour: George Graham reflects
on the American initiative against a British glassmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US justice department's anti-trust order yesterday against Pilkington,
the British glassmaker, marks one of the first concrete results of the new
vigour in anti-trust enforcement promised by the Clinton administration.
The Pilkington suit - as a result of which the British company has agreed to
end the restrictions it has imposed on licensees for its float glass
technology - is the first big anti-trust suit brought in the US against a
foreign company since 1992, when the department reinstated an old policy
which had allowed it to undertake broad actions against overseas
companies.
In 1988, the Reagan administration's justice department had announced that
it would pursue anti-competitive conduct in foreign markets only when there
was seen to be direct harm to US consumers. The 1992 reversal allowed the US
also to pursue conduct that had harmed US exports.
Besides marking a new aggressiveness - which has otherwise been symbolised
mostly by the present justice department's determination to tackle the
domination of the computer software industry by Microsoft - the Pilkington
suit also carries echoes of the Clinton administration's broader goals on
industrial and competitiveness policy.
The principal goal of the suit, the department said, was to allow US
companies to compete freely in overseas markets, not so much for sales of
plate glass itself but rather for the construction of an estimated 50 float
glass plants which are expected to be built in regions such as eastern
Europe and south-east Asia over the next decade.
'Before this case was filed, US firms basically would have been locked out
of this market entirely. Now that this consent decree has been filed, and
hopefully after it is approved, we think that as many as half of these
plants could be built by US firms,' said Mr Robert Litan, deputy assistant
attorney-general in the department's anti-trust division.
Mr Litan said that the department had also challenged Pilkington's licensing
agreements because they were impeding innovation by US companies, since they
restricted the benefits a licensee could reap from any improvements to the
technology it had developed itself.
As a sign that the Clinton administration sees anti-trust enforcement as a
legitimate policy tool for improving the efficiency of the US economy,
rather than just a last resort against truly egregious examples of business
collusion, the Pilkington suit could herald a number of new cases against
both foreign and US companies.
Ms Diane Wood, who heads the international anti-trust division at the
justice department, said yesterday that the case would be regarded abroad as
'a broad assertion of jurisdiction' by the US.
'We won't bring these cases unless there is a big impact in the US market
and the company is present here in the US,' she said.
Anti-trust enforcement in general, under the Reagan administration of
1981-89, was reduced to a bare minimum, with the number of justice
department investigations initiated under the major US monopoly, merger and
restraint of trade acts dropping by half to two thirds of the rate during
the Carter administration of 1977-81.
Under the Bush administration, which ended early last year, the number of
enforcement actions dropped even further, although Mr William Barr, then the
attorney-general, took some steps to swing anti-trust policy back to earlier
principles.
Those steps included the 1992 reversal of the policy on the overseas reach
of US action, a measure seen at the time mostly as a vehicle for attacking
the cartel-like practices of Japan's keiretsu groupings, but now implemented
for the first time against a UK company.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Pilkington emerges with advantages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington estimated yesterday that the agreement reached with the US
Justice Department may cost it just under Pounds 1m (Dollars 1.5m) a year in
lost licensing fees.
However, the UK glassmaker said that it might save considerably more in
legal fees. A recent legal action in the UK, brought by Pilkington against
PPG Industries, the large US glass group, resulted in the British company
receiving Pounds 16m, representing 80 per cent of its legal costs, plus
Pounds 5m damages.
At issue, according to Pilkington, was whether PPG had the right to pass on
to a Chinese plant technology developed by the British company which PPG was
using under licence in the US.
However, the British glassmaker still faces two US civil suits which could
end in financial penalties as well as costs, if Pilkington were to lose. A
separate anti-trust action is being brought by PPG, and there is an action
by ITC, a smaller US glass company with which Pilkington has no licensing
agreement.
The consent decree announced yesterday is not expected to affect these
actions.
Sir Robin Nicholson, Pilkington's technology director, said that the accord
reached with the Justice Department had the advantage of setting out
Pilkington's legal rights to the float glass technology originally developed
by the company's president, Sir Alastair Pilkington.
It meant that US companies licensed to use pre-1983 technology developed by
Pilkington would now be able to sub-
license that technology to companies in foreign countries, subject to
certain confidentiality agreements, said Sir Robin.
Pilkington would retain the rights to later technology which was not subject
to licence agreements with US companies.
'The decision has been reached after a two-year investigation by the Justice
Department,' Sir Robin said.
'We have got what we wanted, in that we retain a substantial amount of
proprietorial knowledge which we can license in the normal way.'
Pilkington was only a British glass company of modest size when, in 1959,
Sir Alastair invented float glass - reported to be an idea which came to him
while he was in the bath. Instead of rolling or drawing glass, he devised a
system of floating it on molten tin to produce a product of consistently
high quality and thickness, with minimal wastage.
Plate glass, which was rolled, by comparison required extensive finishing
and polishing, involving waste of up to 20 per cent.
Pilkington quickly realised that, in spite of its technological lead, it was
not rich enough to build plants or mount legal actions to prevent companies
from abusing patents in all the countries which wanted to take advantage of
the new process.
Instead, it decided to license the technique in agreements running for up to
30 years, from which Pilkington was able to earn substantial fees.
At its peak, fee income was running at Pounds 35m-Pounds 45m a year. This
has been reduced to about Pounds 10m now.
The process developed by Sir Alastair is now used in 30 countries at 174
plants.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Gradual freeing of capital by Chile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chile will liberalise capital movements by the end of the decade, allowing
much greater flows in and out of the country, according to Mr Eduardo
Aninat, the new finance minister.
Mr Aninat said in an interview that Chile was not looking for 'hot money' -
or short-term money looking for the highest return - to enter the stock
exchange. At present, funds coming into Chile cannot be repatriated for a
year.
'If you want to see why we don't move more rapidly, look at the Merval
(share) index in Argentina. It is incredible - up, down, up, down - triples
its value, halves its value. I think that is horrible for domestic personal
savings.'
The one-year repatriation period has not put off long-term direct investors,
inflows from whom last year accounted for 4.5 per cent of Chile's gross
domestic product. Many had not repatriated profits after a year but put them
back into new investments locally, he said.
Mr Aninat was also wary of allowing too many outflows. Private pension
funds, which command the equivalent of Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11.2bn) in
savings, would only be allowed very gradually to expand their foreign
portfolios, he said.
But in the long run, Mr Aninat said, 'the only direction is towards
liberalisation' because Chile had to continue to integrate with the world
economy. The next step would be to reduce distinctions between the formal
and informal exchange markets - a process begun tentatively last month -
allowing Chilean exporters greater scope to leave earnings abroad.
On inflation, which some fear has become stuck at about 12 per cent a year,
Mr Aninat said 'harsh medicine', in the form of tight fiscal policy, might
be needed. Bringing inflation down to single digits was more important than
sustaining the 6 per cent growth rate of last year, he said.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Patten sees a new Manchester in the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten last night forecast a 'spectacular future' for Hong Kong
provided that the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, under which the
territory will return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, is fully implemented.
Speaking in Manchester's Great Hall, he said: 'It will play the role in
relation to the Chinese economy which Manchester played in the British
industrial revolution and which New York played in the opening up of the
American continent.'
But if the 1984 accord was not fully implemented, he said, the
characteristics which made Hong Kong special would be in jeopardy. These, he
said, were 'the rule of law, a free press, a high level of resistance to
corruption'.
'Hong Kong will no longer be special and the potential offered by the
historic 'one country, two systems' concept will have been squandered.'
Mounting a spirited defence of his proposals for electoral reform, he poured
scorn on suggestions - made by British businessmen and former diplomats -
that Britain should opt for a 'quiet life' since its longer-term interest
was in having good relations with China.
Britain, he said, had huge investments in Hong Kong and large exports.
'Securing Hong Kong's future, which is dependent on its special nature
enduring indefinitely, is a clear national interest.' Moreover, he said,
there was 'a place for integrity as well as interests in foreign policy'.
Hong Kong - like Manchester, the governor said - had grown on the basis of
free trade and open markets. But he detected growing protectionism in Europe
and the US. Some in Europe sought to justify protectionism on the grounds
that poorer countries did not have the same social infrastructure as Europe.
'This amounts to the absurd and callous proposition that to be poor is
somehow to have an unfair trade advantage.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Algeria to hear price of debt rescheduling: Francis Ghiles
previews talks next week with the Paris Club of official creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algeria will meet its chief western creditors in Paris next Tuesday to
discuss the terms under which it will reschedule the Dollars 14.5bn of its
foreign debt that it owes to foreign governments.
The principal debt repayments to be covered fall due between April 1 this
year and March 31 next, the period covered by the standby agreement Algeria
reached with the International Monetary Fund last month, due to be approved
by its board today.
The repayments amount to an estimated Dollars 3.4bn, to which the Algerians
might wish to add Dollars 800m in interest payments due over the next year.
Repayments would be spread over 15 years with eight years' grace.
Algeria last reached agreement with the IMF three years ago. But
circumstances have changed. The country's economy has deteriorated sharply
as a result of the bloody civil strife which followed the suspension of
elections the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win in January 1992, the
decline in the price of oil and the government's decision to reverse gear on
reforms aimed at liberalising the economy launched in 1989 and suspended
late in 1991.
The new IMF agreement envisages a standby loan of Dollars 625m and
contingency financing of Dollars 375m, extended because of the decline in
the price of oil. Hydrocarbon exports account for more than 95 per cent of
Algeria's foreign income.
Among the measures included in the agreement and already implemented are:
A devaluation of the dinar. It is not clear whether further devaluations are
required beyond the 40 per cent devaluation against the US dollar on April
10, the date the IMF received Algeria's letter of intent.
Dismantling the state monopoly on foreign trade. This has already led to the
abolition of the ad hoc ministerial committee which, since July 1992, has
alone been entitled to decide on all requests for imports. Discrimination
against imports by the private sector, which have been such a feature of the
past two years, have been abolished. Exporters will be allowed to retain 50
per cent of their foreign earnings, in foreign currency accounts in Algeria.
Adjustments in the price of food and energy prices which were raised by 40
per cent before the dinar was devalued. Three key foodstuffs, semolina,
flour and milk, have been exempted.
Liberalisation of prices of farm inputs and fertilisers. Foodstuffs imports
accounted for 25 per cent of last year's total import bill of Dollars 9.5bn.
The stabilisation programme aims to reduce the budget deficit as a
percentage of gross domestic product from last year's figure of 9.2 per cent
to 3.3 per cent. One third of last year's budget deficit was accounted for
by funds aimed at recapitalising loss-making state enterprises which were
not restructured.
The agreement also includes measures aimed at reducing monetary growth from
21.2 per cent last year to 14 per cent, and at containing salary increases,
a sensitive issue because the support of the trades union movement is seen
as crucial in the battle against radical Moslem groups.
Overall, the aim is to contain inflation to 30 per cent. Last year,
inflation was officially measured at 20.8 per cent, a figure widely
considered an underestimate, and was worsened by constant shortages and
siphoning off into the black market of basic products.
In a broader sense, the agreement with the IMF aims to turn a real decline
in gross domestic product of 2 per cent last year into a rise of 3 per cent
in 1994 and 6 per cent in 1995, thus increasing capacity utilisation in
industry which was 50 per cent since 1990.
Servicing its Dollars 24.7bn foreign debt, virtually all of which is medium-
and long-term, last year represented 86 per cent of Algeria's export
earnings, a figure it hopes to bring down to less than 30 per cent.
After the talks with its Paris Club creditors, the Algerians will ask to
meet their commercial bank creditors. Japanese banks, which hold more than
half Algeria's commercial bank paper, are known to be unhappy about the
prospect of a rescheduling but are playing their cards close to the chest.
Overall, the restructuring should bring in Dollars 3.7bn from official
creditors and Dollars 600m from the commercial banks. The Algerians hope
that the level of export credits does not fall far short of Dollars 3bn.
Mr Ahmed Benbitour, the Algerian minister of finance, insisted, in an
interview, that 'quick disbursement was vital to ensure that the
liberalisation of foreign trade proceeds smoothly and that the exchange rate
is kept steady.' He expressed confidence that Dollars 1bn would be disbursed
by the IMF, the World Bank and the EU before the end of June.
The attitude of the French government to Algeria's debt problems has, over
the past three years undergone a remarkable transformation. In 1991, Paris
showed little enthusiasm, let alone consistent support, for the government
of Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, which brokered the boldest economic and political
reforms ever witnessed in Algeria. Today, leading French ministers spare no
effort in their support for the Algerian regime. The French foreign
minister, Mr Alain Juppe, brought up the issue when he met US President Bill
Clinton recently.
French policy however is driven as much by fear as by any hope that the IMF
package can be implemented.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Japan household spending slips 4.3% in March
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Household spending in Japan slipped 4.3 per cent in March, the worst
year-on-year decline since 1981, the government's management and
co-ordination agency announced yesterday.
This is the second month of spending decline, a worrying reversal of a
four-month run of increases in household spending to the end of January.
It is likely to cast doubt on Japan's chances of an imminent consumer-led
recovery and increase pressure on the Bank of Japan to reduce its official
discount rate to give the flagging economy a psychological lift, economic
analysts said.
The official rate, at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, has
stood at a record low of 1.75 per cent since last September. Yesterday, it
stood a mere 0.3 percentage points below the overnight money market rate, at
which commercial banks lend to each other. This leaves the Bank of Japan
little room to guide short-term money market rates - already at a record low
 -down further, unless it cuts the official rate.
Agency officials argued that part of the March spending decline was caused
by delays in car purchases, ahead of a fall in car sales tax in April.
Its own survey also shows a 0.4 per cent decline in wage-earners' real
incomes in the year to the end of March, the first such drop for 13 years.
Bonuses (a large part of annual wages) and wives' income from part-time work
both declined, the agency said. Spending on food, furniture and clothing
fell; households spent more on housing, utility charges and medical care.
Household spending for the year to March fell by 0.6 per cent in real terms,
in line with calendar-year figures released two months ago. This was the
first time in 30 years spending fell for two fiscal years running. A slight
pick-up in the third quarter evaporated in the final three months of the
year.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Sanctuary for whales in Antarctica agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PUERTO VALLARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Whaling Commission yesterday approved a whale sanctuary
around Antarctica that will protect the vast majority of the world's whales
from commercial hunting for the indefinite future.
The sanctuary will stretch from Antarctica to between 40 and 60 degrees
south of the equator. It was first proposed by France two years ago, and
after modifications, was backed by the necessary three-quarters of countries
in the Whaling Commission. Japan had led opposition to the plan.
There were 23 votes in favour, one vote against (Japan) and six abstentions,
including Norway. 'Today is a great day for people who love whales and above
all for the whales themselves,' said Mr Homero Aridjis, head of Grupo de los
Cien, an environmental group in Mexico.
Initially the sanctuary will have only a symbolic impact, since commercial
whale hunting is currently prohibited by an international moratorium.
However environmentalists worry that the International Whaling Commission
may eventually replace the moratorium with hunting quotas for whales that
are not in short supply. If adopted, quotas would have let Japan kill an
estimated 2,000 minke whales a year in the Antarctic region.
Antarctica is home to some 760,000 minke whales, the only whales of
commercial interest in the ocean. Japan has argued that since minke whales
are not endangered, there is no scientific justification for a blanket
sanctuary.
The sanctuary could conceivably make the lifting of the moratorium easier,
since whaling countries can now argue that the vast majority of whales will
be protected from hunters. Japan would like to hunt for minke whales off its
coast, while Norway, in defiance of the moratorium, has already resumed
commercial minke whaling off its shores.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa hopes to double arms exports over the next year following the
lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, which spurred previous
governments to develop a sophisticated arms manufacturing industry.
Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms
procurement agency, told a news conference yesterday the company could boost
defence exports by more than R1bn (Pounds 180m) in the current fiscal year.
His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the
defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President
Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen
to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South
Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which
are globally competitive.
Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial
government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of
moral arguments against arms exports. However South Africa's urgent need for
foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy
spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably
combine to protect Armscor's activities in future.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Peace talks unlikely to heal Cambodia's wounds: Many think
neither Phnom Penh nor Khmer Rouge wants a solution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One year ago this week, the UN effort to bring peace to Cambodia reached its
climax as more than 4m Cambodians braved monsoon rains and the threat of
Khmer Rouge violence to vote in the country's first free election.
Today, despite widespread optimism among voters that they were casting their
ballots for peace, the government is still fighting a low-intensity war
against Khmer Rouge guerrillas who show no sign of giving up their struggle
to retake power.
The three top government leaders are due to arrive in Pyongyang, the North
Korean capital, today for peace talks with the Khmer Rouge. It will be the
first time the two sides have met for almost six months, but few in Phnom
Penh expect the talks will bring much change.
As preparations for the talks go on, sporadic fighting continues in western
Cambodia, where 50,000 people have been forced out of their homes by
artillery barrages from both the Khmer Rouge and the government.
Aid workers say the future now looks bleak for many whose homes are in what
is now a combat zone, whose prospects of returning to their villages in time
to plough their fields for this year's rice crop are slim.
Many Cambodians believe neither the government nor the Khmer Rouge is
seriously interested in the search for peace. For the government, an end to
war would bring new problems if it finally faced up to the need to
demobilise almost half its armed forces.
While they are fighting, the government can justify spending more than 35
per cent of its budget on defence. Once the fighting stops, the figures are
likely to be scrutinised more carefully by multilateral donors such as the
IMF, which has just approved a new Dollars 120m (Pounds 79.4m) soft loan.
For the Khmer Rouge, any peace settlement would have to include giving up
its guerrilla army and the territory it controls, which would be tantamount
to giving up the struggle. Some analysts believe the guerrillas are fighting
only to improve their bargaining position before talks; others say they aim
to take complete control of Cambodia again.
In recent fighting, the Khmer Rouge has shown it can defeat government
forces with apparent ease. Military officials say the reason for the
guerrillas' successes was the national army's incompetence, rather than the
strength of the Khmer Rouge.
Even during that recent run of victories, the Khmer Rouge did not manage to
capture the town of Battambang. With a strength of 10,000-12,000, the
faction is unlikely to be able to capture, far less hold, any significant
towns.
Ministers are still trying to persuade their allies in the west and in
south-east Asian countries to provide them with lethal military aid,
fuelling the suspicion they have no interest in reaching a peace settlement
with the Khmer Rouge.
Some diplomats believe King Norodom Sihanouk, head of state, is alone in
pushing for talks and a deal to bring the Khmer Rouge into the government,
in exchange for a ceasefire and relinquishing the 10-15 per cent of the
country the guerrillas control.
Mr Hun Sen, junior prime minister, said he was 'less than 0.1 per cent
optimistic' about any progress during the five days of talks. On the
government side, Mr Hun Sen is the main stumbling block to a deal with the
Khmer Rouge. Prince Ranariddh, senior prime minister and the son of King
Sihanouk, has shown he is willing to make peace with the Maoist guerrillas.
Late last year, Prince Ranariddh twice flew to Bangkok for talks with the
nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan. During these meetings, the
two men discussed terms for a ceasefire. But, each time, Prince Ranariddh
returned empty-handed. Few in Cambodia believe he will be any more
successful this time.

Mr Alan Bond, the Australian businessman, was back in hospital yesterday
after a near-collapse during a brief appearance in Perth magistrates' court,
Nikki Tait reports from Sydney.
According to Mr Bond's solicitor, doctors suggested that the former tycoon,
whose empire started to collapse under a pile of debts in the late 1980s and
who filed for personal bankruptcy in 1992, was showing signs of the
beginning of a stroke. His lawyers had applied to suspend a hearing over
four art fraud charges.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Gabon is first to reschedule debts
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gabon has become the first member of the African franc zone to reschedule
its commercial debt with all its external creditors, Peter John reports. The
final piece of its FFr17bn (Pounds 2bn) restructuring programme was put in
place yesterday when Mr Marcel Doupamby Matoka, finance minister, signed an
agreement in Paris with the London club of commercial bank creditors.
The deal, repayable over 10 years, represents some Dollars 170m (Pounds
113m) of debt. Gabon has already signed agreements with the Paris Club of
sovereign creditors and the International Monetary Fund. Mr Thierry
Desjardins of BNP, the French bank, said the move would boost the country's
credit rating. It should ease Gabon's ability to borrow while adjusting to
the 50 per cent devaluation of the African franc against the French franc.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong property developers yesterday got together to arrange low bids at
a public land auction, challenging the colony's government, which has
pledged to intervene in the property market to bring down soaring prices.
One analyst described the government auction, which saw bidders rushing
around the hall to reach agreement with those proposing higher bids, as a
'blatant display' of a property developers' cartel.
The inability of many families to afford their own homes prompted Mr Chris
Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to launch a task force in March, which has
been instructed to come up with means of cooling prices.
Prices of small flats have risen by 200 per cent in the past three years,
but industry opposition to the government's planned intervention has
coincided with growing concerns that the market has passed its peak.
The government took a small step last month by slightly increasing the
supply of residential land it will sell off this year. Analysts expect these
measures will lead to a 10 to 20 per cent fall in prices.
It is understood a consortium of up to 12 developers bought yesterday one
plot, with 10 joining to purchase another lot. The companies involved
included some of the colony's biggest developers, and the Hong Kong stock
market reacted badly to news of the low prices.
The Hang Seng index was up about 120 to 130 points in the afternoon but
slipped after reports spread of the auction, ending down 39.66 points to
close at 9,481.71, against the day's high of 9,656.15.
The first site, of 20,780 square metres went for HKDollars 2.04bn (Pounds
171m) in spite of market expectations that the price would reach HKDollars
3bn to HKDollars 4bn. The second, smaller plot went under the hammer for
HKDollars 510m, though it was expected to bring as much as HKDollars 800m.
These prices were regarded more as a warning to the government than a sign
that the Hong Kong market has turned, but the stock market's response was an
indication of some jitteriness about the fate of the colony's property
market.
According to Mr Michael Green, director of SG Warburg in Hong Kong, the
larger site splits into 12 plots, so each of the 12 developers will be able
to assume a portion while spreading the risk.
But he added: 'It is a reality that the developers formed a consortium. It
clearly is a message to the government not to interfere with the free market
mechanism.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / S Yemen in push to reclaim territory

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Yemeni military officers have launched a counter-offensive to reclaim
territory lost to northern forces during the past three weeks' fighting,
they said yesterday. Caught unprepared for war, they claimed the south was
now ready to break out of its defensive posture.
The southerners were yesterday clearly in control of the region surrounding
the key airbase of al-Anad, some 45 miles north of Aden, as they continued
to pound the base. Southern officers said there was no return artillery fire
and claimed the northerners were in retreat.
Apparently frustrated by the failed advance on Aden, northern leader Gen Ali
Abdullah Saleh has opened up a new front in Shabwa Province, 240 miles
north-east of Aden.
His aim, southern leaders say, is to capture their oil fields at Wadi
Masila, about 280 miles to the east. Run by Canadian Occidental Petroleum,
the Masila Fields produce 150,000 barrels a day, the south's economic
mainstay.
Southern leaders were apparently unruffled by the new challenge, saying
northern forces are over-extended and vulnerable to a counter-thrust.
Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh's southern leadership is starting to fill positions
for the new cabinet. Prime minister-designate is Mr Haider Abu-Bakr
al-Attas, prime minister of the former united Yemen before the south
declared secession at the end of last week. Defence minister is expected to
be Gen Haithem Qassem Taha, chief of staff of the southern army.
New or confirmed appointments for provincial governors include Mr Ahmed
Farid, owner of a Muscat-based contracting company, Desert Line Projects.
Members of the presidential council, apart from Mr al-Beidh, include Mr
Salem Saleh Mohammed; the head of the Sons of Yemen League, Mr Abdul Rahman
Ali al-Jifri; the former head of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied
South Yemen, Mr Abdul Kawi Makawi; and Mr Suleiman Nasser Masoud.
Mr al-Jifri was an adviser to the former Sultan of Lahej before the British
withdrew in 1967. Mr al-Jifri has spent the past 24 years managing a
construction company in Saudi Arabia.

Hong Kong property developers yesterday got together to secure prices at a
land auction that were sharply lower than market expectations, in
retaliation against government efforts to bring down soaring prices for
housing.
One analyst described the government auction, which saw bidders rushing
around the hall to round up those proposing higher bids, as 'the most
blatant display of property developers' cartel in anyone's recent memory'.
The inability of many families to afford their own homes prompted Mr Chris
Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to launch a task force in March, which has
been instructed to come up with means of cooling prices.
The government took a small step in this direction last month by slightly
increasing the supply of residential land it will sell off this year.
It is understood a consortium of up to 12 bought the biggest plot, with 10
teaming up for the smaller one. Those joining forces included some of the
colony's biggest developers.
The first site, of 20,780 square metres in the New Territories' Fanling
area, went for HKDollars 2.04bn (Pounds 171m) against market expectations of
HKDollars 3bn to HKDollars 4bn, while the smaller Yuen Long plot, of about
5,889 square metres, went under the hammer for HKDollars 510m. It was
expected to reach as much as HKDollars 800m.
These prices do not appear to signal the start of a big slide in prices.
Three external factors stood to depress the final prices secured: the
government's pledge, which has already pruned asking prices on finished
flats, a clutch of other quality sites coming on line at the same time, and
further sites in the pipeline.
Both the plots sold off yesterday are slightly inconvenient for transport,
and both towns are an hour's commuting from the central business district.
According to Mr Michael Green, director of SG Warburg in Hong Kong, the
Fanling site splits into 12 plots, so each developer will be able to assume
his own portion while spreading any risk.
But he added: 'It is a reality that the developers formed a consortium. It
clearly is a message to the government not to interfere with the free market
mechanism.'
Property prices have been on an upward track since 1990; the price of small
flats has risen by some 200 per cent in the past three years. New apartments
yielding little more space than the average suburban two-up-two-down were
sold last month for between HKDollars 10m and HKDollars 15m.

South Africa hopes to double arms exports over the next year following the
lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, which spurred previous
governments to develop a sophisticated arms manufacturing industry.
Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms
procurement agency, told a news conference yesterday the company could boost
defence exports by more than R1bn (Pounds 180m) in the current fiscal year.
His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the
defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President
Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen
to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South
Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which
are globally competitive.
Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial
government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of
moral arguments against arms exports. However South Africa's urgent need for
foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy
spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably
combine to protect Armscor's activities in future.
Selling more of its respected military hardware is the key to Armscor's
survival, Mr de Waal said, noting that the company currently exports over
R800m of arms per year, which he said represented less than 0.5 per cent of
the international arms market.
He identified Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe as potential markets.
This will be eased by Tuesday's UN Security Council decision to lift a
mandatory ban on the sale of arms to South Africa and the voluntary boycott
of purchases from South Africa.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Bank threatens to seize Tapie's furniture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the French politician and entrepreneur, yesterday came
under mounting financial pressure when Credit Lyonnais, his bank, threatened
to seize his furniture and Paris townhouse unless he repays FFr450m (Pounds
52.4m) of his FFr1.22bn debts.
The threat follows a farcical sequence of events last week after the bank
announced it was terminating its five-year debt repayment agreement with Mr
Tapie, a member of parliament whose political star has risen with the
success of Energie Radicale, his populist left-wing movement, in the
European election campaign.
Credit Lyonnais last Friday sent a bailiff to make an inventory of the
contents of Mr Tapie's townhouse, only to be informed by its own private
detectives that some of the most valuable objects had been removed the
previous day. Mr Tapie claimed that he had lent his mother-in-law a few
favourite pieces of furniture.
However Mr Tapie's problems mounted this week when a Paris court asked for
his parliamentary immunity to be lifted so he can be investigated for tax
fraud concerning the purchase of his luxury yacht, the Phocea. The tax
investigation was the final straw for Credit Lyonnais, which said it feared
that its claim on Mr Tapie's assets could be weakened by calls from other
creditors, notably the tax authorities.
The bank demanded that Mr Tapie by next Thursday repay FFr450m of his debts,
FFr100m of which was lent to him to buy the Phocea.
If he fails to pay, Credit Lyonnais will on the following day start legal
proceedings to seize his furniture and to order the sale of his opulent
townhouse off Boulevard Saint-Germain.
Mr Tapie has described Credit Lyonnais's threats as part of an establishment
plot against him. He said yesterday he had instructed his lawyers to 'do
everything possible to protect my legal rights'.
So far Mr Tapie's financial and legal problems have helped, rather than
hindered, his progress in the opinion polls. Energie Radicale has continued
to gain ground from the established left-wing parties and now commands 10
per cent support.

FT  27 MAY 94 / A fox among the Socialist pussycats: Gyula Horn, a one-time
hardline communist heading for power in Hungary and espousing orthodox
economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So smiling, youthful and unthreatening are Hungary's Socialist party leaders
that a liberal weekly catchlined its cover picture of them with the phrase
'Pink pussycats'.
That was after the former communists took a commanding lead with 33 per cent
of the vote in the first round of this month's parliamentary elections. Now
the Hungarian Socialist party is poised for a landslide in the run-off vote
this Sunday. The Socialists are sure to be the largest party. The only
question is whether they will have an absolute majority.
Socialist politicians, although emboldened by their success, are still
purring soothingly. They reject a return to the past, revenge against the
conservatives who have governed Hungary since 1990, and reversal of
conservative policies such as compensation for property expropriated by the
former regime.
There is little socialism in the party programme, let alone red-toothed
communism. Socialists largely share the broad political consensus favouring
membership of the European Union and Nato. A westerner commented to Mr
Laszlo Bekesi, the left's economic expert, that the Socialist orthodox
economic programme could have been that of a right-wing party in western
Europe. 'Thank you,' Mr Bekesi replied.
The revamp of the Socialist party encompasses more than policy
pronouncements. Mr Attila Agh, a political scientist and founder of the
party in 1989, says the average age of Socialist party members is 40 and
only about half of them were formerly communists. It gives the Socialists
some right to be irritated by the label of 'former communists' that sticks
to them so persistently.
But one, rather distinguished, Socialist cannot escape the description so
easily: Mr Gyula Horn, 61-year-old party leader and most likely the next
prime minister or at very least the power behind the premiership.
Mr Horn was not in the photo of the 'pink pussycats' because he was in bed
in hospital at the time, his neck in a brace, recovering from a car accident
on the eve of the first round of voting. But the caption does not suit him
anyhow.
The chain-smoking Socialist leader's age and demeanour are in sharp contrast
not only to those of the younger vice-presidents of the party. His Polish
counterpart, Mr Aleksander Kwasnieski, 40-year-old leader of Poland's SLD,
wields a mobile phone and is more of a yuppie than a reconstructed
communist.
Mr Horn went to college in Rostov in the former Soviet Union and speaks
Russian rather than English at international conferences. More
embarrassingly, he wore the trademark 'padded jacket' of the volunteer
militia which helped put down the 1956 uprising against communist rule.
'You've got blood on your padded jacket,' charges the graffiti on his
election posters and a conservative newspaper editor called Mr Horn a
'potential killer'. Government-run state television was more specific,
accusing the Socialist leader, without firm evidence, of kicking in the
teeth of a counter-revolutionary prisoner.
Those who knew Mr Horn later, in the early 1980s, when he was number two at
the foreign department of the central committee remember a 'typical product
of the party system'. 'I wouldn't say he has changed very much,' says one.
Mr Horn certainly still has the toughness of a hardened veteran of Communist
party infighting. He is notorious for cutting interviews short if he does
not like the line of questioning. He doffs his hat to no one. At a recent
speech to foreign investors in Budapest, the Socialist leader seemed close
to boredom, looking out of the window as he was speaking.
Socialists prefer to skip quickly over Mr Horn's early career to linger on
his achievements as foreign minister in the last communist government in
1989. He was the man who went to the western frontier with Austria and took
the wire-cutters to the Iron Curtain; Mr Horn, in biblical fashion, set the
east Germans free, allowing them to escape to the west through Hungary; and
he began negotiations with Moscow on the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
So which is the real Gyula Horn? He himself offers few clues. The Socialist
leader says he has traversed the political spectrum from communist to reform
communist to socialist but avoids any more precise expression of his
political beliefs. 'I view ideology as a private matter for people and it
should not play a part in politics,' he says. It is statements like these
which lead the Socialists' opponents to describe them, not as communists,
but as nihilists, believers in nothing.
A western diplomat gives another slant to Mr Horn's pragmatism. 'He is not
philosophical at all. Obtaining and exercising power is what he likes. He's
very bright, he's quick and he sees all the angles on things. The question
is whether he loves democracy or not.'
It may not be a question of love. Mr Horn adapted successfully to Stalinist
oppression, reform communism and the upheavals of 1989 and 1990. He is just
as skilful an operator in democracy: opinion polls consistently judge him
Hungary's most popular party leader. Mr Laszlo Lengyel, a leading political
commentator describes him, not as a pussycat, but as a fox.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Kozyrev cool to European stability pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's latest exercise in preventative diplomacy, a French-inspired
stability pact designed to defuse ethnic and territorial disputes among
aspiring members of the European Union, received a cool response from Russia
at its conference launch yesterday.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, welcomed what he called
'yet another attempt' to come to grips with 'signs of aggressive
nationalism, xenophobia and ethnic and religious intolerance.' But he then
underlined that 'the decisive role' in constructing a new Europe with
Russian participation should be played by the 52-Nation Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and Nato's 'Partnership for Peace
(PFP)'.
In a speech which reinforced the call for a new European security order by
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister at this week's Nato
meeting in Brussels, Mr Kozyrev said: 'Enhancing the effectiveness of the
CSCE, making it the supreme political organisation on the continent, is the
key element in our proposed concept of European partnership.'
The three former Soviet Baltic states were looking for a clear Russian
commitment to the withdrawal of the remaining Russian troops and equipment
from Estonia and Latvia. But Mr Kozyrev merely left open the possibility of
Russian participation in the proposed Baltic 'round table'. This is designed
as a forum to facilitate an equitable solution to the protection of the
rights of Russian and other minorities in the Baltic states and the total
withdrawal of Russian forces.
The Russian minister described the stability conference as a 'unique'
process but noted that it involved the 12 current and nine aspiring members
of the EU but did 'not create additional obligations for states which are
not directly involved in it.' Russia, which this week agreed to join the
Partnership for Peace, is not an applicant for EU membership.
For Russia to participate in the round table's work he made clear that it
should not dwell on the military aspects but 'concentrate on specific steps
to improve inter-ethnic relations and to ensure the rights of national
minorities .. especially in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.'
The military and political dimensions of Europe's security, he said 'should
find its place within a framework of broader efforts' than the EU-sponsored
security pact conference. 'We attach serious significance to the forthcoming
Istanbul ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council
(NACC),' he added.
The main focus of the proposed security pact, as outlined by Mr Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister, in his opening statement is to resolve
contentious ethnic and border issues and prevent future Yugoslav-style
eruptions. But the foreign ministers of Poland, the Czech republic and other
central European and Baltic participants rejected suggestions that eastern
European countries that want to join the EU be subjected to special
treatment with regard to minority rights but be subject to what Mr Andrzej
Olechowski, Poland's foreign minister, described as 'accepted pan-European
standards.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Delors makes impassioned defence of social system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday called on
Europe to lift its sights towards a 'democratic Utopia', capable of
providing minimum social rights for all.
He warned that attempts to use recession, Europe's competitiveness problems
and the jobs crisis as an excuse to dismantle 'the European model' of social
protection would destroy centuries of striving towards 'a balanced society'.
However, in an elliptical speech which centred as much on public morality as
on policy, Mr Delors was also dismissive of those opposed to any reform of
Europe's social and welfare arrangements. 'We have to get away from the
battle between those who don't want to change anything simply because of
tradition, and those who want to do away with 150 years of social progress,'
he said.
Mr Delors' unscripted remarks - made to a public seminar before the
publication of the Commission's White Paper on the future of EU social
policy, expected in July - were expressed with a force not used since before
the December 1991 summit which agreed the Maastricht treaty.
The Commission president, who ends his turbulent 10-year tenure in Brussels
next January, said those who claimed Europe's welfare system was holding
back growth had forgotten that the three recessions of the past 20 years
could have degenerated into a 1930s-type depression if such protection had
not protected minimum incomes and demand.
'Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater,' he said.
Neither was protectionism a feasible or defensible way of preserving
European standards from lower-wage competitors in Asia and Latin America.
'How would they buy from us?' Mr Delors asked, arguing that: 'Trade is not a
one-way street, it is a two-way motorway.'
He revived the idea raised after last year's chaos in European currency
markets for a UN-style 'security council for the economy', to manage
economic and monetary shocks, and even manage cross-border problems like
sudden surges in emigration.
Mr Delors said Europe was struggling to adapt to technological progress in
terms of job creation and organisation of working time. It was failing to
get to grips with problems ranging from an ageing population and healthcare
costs, to youth unemployment, racism, the disintegration of the family and
loneliness.
All this, Mr Delors said, was 'a problem of society's soul'.
But, he said: 'There is a European model of society.' It had to be
developed, more into 'a system balancing obligations and rights'. He implied
that some payment of unemployment benefit could be linked to the provision
of services which meet public needs. 'We have to rehabilitate the idea of
public service,' he said. 'We have to enrich our social system.'
Mr Delors insisted: 'It is not by backtracking on social policy that we will
resolve our problems. I would call what I am suggesting a democratic Utopia,
but it is not unattainable.'

FT  27 MAY 94 / Balladur and Kohl call for wider Euro-summits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday
proposed that leaders of east European countries, once they have applied to
join the European Union, should hold a joint summit with their EU
counterparts once a year, writes David Buchan.
The proposal, contained in a jointly signed article in yesterday's Le Monde
newspaper, was timed to coincide with the opening in Paris yesterday of the
French-sponsored 'conference on stability in Europe' and to identify Germany
closely with it. The need for wider annual European summits and the
stability conference initiative stem, according to the two men, from 'a
realisation that political stability is an essential condition for economic
and social progress' in eastern Europe. 'What would be the value of the free
trade and association agreements with central and eastern Europe, even their
future membership of the European Union, if serious political crises,
notably provoked by frontier and minority problems, were to put this
progress in question?' ask the two leaders.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Failure in steel crisis undermines Van Miert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Once he was acclaimed as the rising star of the European Commission. But
less than a week after his surprise announcement that the Commission's
18-month-old rescue plan for the steel industry was 'dead', questions are
mounting about the political judgment of Mr Karel Van Miert, Belgian
commissioner responsible for competition policy.
Senior officials and fellow commissioners are confused by Mr Van Miert's
decision to wash his hands of the steel crisis, and irritated that he
remains unwilling to consider a new compromise.
In Brussels yesterday, Mr Van Miert offered little hint that he is ready to
resume his role as co-architect of the steel plan, along with Mr Martin
Bangemann, industry commissioner.
Privately, he is said to be still fuming over his defeat at a meeting of the
Commission last Wednesday.
Insiders say there were few signs of trouble when Mr Van Miert started with
an appeal to allow the Italian government to provide state aid for the
restructuring of the privately-owned Bresciani steel mills in northern
Italy. In his view, the Italian reductions were the last hope of approaching
the rescue plan's target of a 19m tonne cut in capacity.
However, Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator and a former
competition commmissioner, said that the deal would be difficult to
reconcile with European law. A second significant intervention came from Mr
Peter Schmidhuber, the German budget commissioner.
Mr Schmidhuber, a lawyer who usually votes with Mr Van Miert on competition
matters, asked questions over Italian government funding, which Mr Van Miert
was unable to answer. The competition commissioner was outvoted 11-4.
What followed was either a tantrum or a tactic aimed at pressuring industry
to come up with fresh cuts in capacity. 'The plan is dead,' Mr Van Miert
declared, 'it is obvious we are not going to get near the target. But don't
blame us. We tried.'
In retrospect, officials say Mr Van Miert made several errors. First, he
underestimated the legal difficulties of the Italian case, while
overestimating how far he could push his (often successful) pragmatic
approach to competition policy.
Second, he (and Mr Bangemann) failed to grasp the risks of a high-profile
Commission intervention to tackle the steel industry crisis.
Third, Mr Van Miert may have not been flexible enough about the 19m capacity
target. Some officials believe that an improving steel market may have
rendered the figure obsolete - particularly in the light of the private
sector's continued reservations about the rescue plan. On the other hand,
any move to abandon the 19m target would call into question the entire plan.
What is to be done? One approach would be to proceed under Article 95 of the
European Steel and Coal treaty which would allow state subsidies to be paid
to companies. But this would require unanimous support from the Council of
Ministers, a long process with a dubious outcome.
Whether Mr Van Miert changes course once again will depend on his own state
of mind. Colleagues say they are baffled by his recent outburst, though one
explanation is that he fears Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister,
will succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the next European Commission
 -an appointment which would cost him his job.

The German parliament yesterday narrowly approved a law which proposes
prison sentences of up to two years for people who encourage an abortion.
The 264-260 vote in the lower house of parliament marks the latest chapter
in the bitter feud about how to reconcile differing abortion regimes in east
and west Germany. The new law, which will be debated in the Bundesrat on
July 8, allows abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy if the mother has
been to a series of legal, social and medical consultations laid down by the
constitutional court last year.

Pressure on the Portuguese escudo eased yesterday after the central bank
intervened on the foreign exchange market to protect the currency from a
second attack by speculators in less than two months. The currency fell to a
low of Es104.5 to the D-Mark on Wednesday from Es103.2 and rallied yesterday
to close at Es104.0. Overnight money market rates rose from 11 per cent
before the attack to 30 per cent yesterday but fell back to 12 per cent as
speculation against the currency subsided. After announcing large purchases
of escudos on Wednesday, the central bank changed tactics yesterday by
suspending its money market intervention and emergency lending rates.

Estonia has become the first of the former Soviet states to introduce
electronic banking. Economic reform throughout the region has been hobbled
by its antiquated banking system. Transactions can take more than three
months, forcing many businesses and individuals to resort to cash and barter
deals. Estonia, which in 1991 launched the most radical market reform
programme in the region, has now entered the electronic banking era. Four
automatic teller machines operating 24 hours a day were opened last week and
tens of thousands of citizens have been invited to apply for credit cards
which are already accepted by more than 250 Estonian merchants. Credit cards
are commonplace among the Soviet Union's lavishly wealthy but tiny elite.
However, Estonia is the first former Soviet republic to bring credit cards
and cash machines to the masses.

International mediators yesterday ended two days of talks with Bosnia's
warring factions with no apparent agreement on the future division of the
former Yugoslav republic. However, sources close to the talks in France said
leaders of a new Moslem-Croatian federation and rebel Bosnian Serbs had
agreed to meet again with a 'contact group' from the US Russia and the
European Union in a week to 10 days' time. They said the talks, at which the
factions did not meet face-to-face, focused on the carve-up of territory
between the federation and the heavily-armed Serbs, who currently control 70
per cent. Earlier the Croatian news agency reported that the Croats and
Moslems had 'partly accepted' a mediators' proposal giving them 51 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Swedish interest rate switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday revised its system for steering short-term interest rates
in an effort to achieve greater flexibility in monetary policy. The move,
which brings Swedish practice in line with that of other European central
banks, coincided with a marginal reduction in the country's main interest
rate, which fell from 7 per cent to 6.95 per cent. Under the new system, the
Riksbank, the central bank, will replace its key marginal rate with a
repurchase (repo) rate as its main interest rate policy instrument. The repo
will lie between a lending rate and a deposit rate following the German
practice where the discount rate acts as a floor and the Lombard as a
ceiling for interest rates. The Riksbank has fixed the lending rate at 7.5
per cent and the discount at 6 per cent, with effect from June 1. The repo
rate will be 6.95 per cent. Markets reacted positively to the news, marking
bond yields lower and the krona higher.

<TEXT>
Finland yesterday decided to hold its referendum on European Union
membership on October 16, making it the first of the three Nordic applicants
to hold a vote on the issue. Sweden holds its referendum on November 13 and
Norway on November 28. The east-west voting sequence is seen as the best way
of getting all three countries into the EU because support for membership is
strongest in Finland and weakest in Norway. Public opinion in both Sweden
and Norway remains against membership, although polls show the 'yes' vote
increasing if neighbours vote in favour. The three Nordic states and Austria
are aiming to join the union next January.
The choice of October 16 represents a setback for Mr Esko Aho, Finland's
prime minister, who had wanted the referendum to be on the same day as
Sweden's. But he was opposed by President Martti Ahtisaari and the
Conservative party, the second largest in the coalition government. They
both wanted September or early October. Mr Aho's Centre party is split over
Europe as much of its support comes from the farming community; agriculture
has become the main issue in the debate because farmers face overnight
adjustment to EU price levels. The government yesterday tried to soften the
blow by announcing a support package for the farming and food processing
industries.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Rexrodt outlines EU presidency plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany will seek to extend its own campaign for international
competitiveness to the whole of the European Union this year, including
promotion of more flexibility in labour markets, and a concerted push for
deregulation.
That was the strategy outlined yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics
minister, for the forthcoming six-month German presidency of the EU.
He set out a five-point economic programme focused primarily on free-market
policies to stimulate growth and counter unemployment, including a
controversial proposal for an independent team of business experts to test
all EU regulations for unnecessary burdens on companies and consumers.
The idea for an independent working group, sharply criticised by Mr Jacques
Delors, European commission president, is the main plank of Mr Rexrodt's
deregulation initiative intended to slim the Brussels bureaucracy.
At the same time he is proposing a concerted push to implement the EU action
plan for job creation and growth, concentrating on promoting more
flexibility in labour markets, and improved tax incentives for job creation.
He promised a push to remove national barriers to a single energy market in
the 12 member states, both for gas and electricity, intended to give
consumers and distributors access to competitive energy sources.
He proposed steps to speed the creation of an integrated information network
in the EU, reducing legal barriers to the exchange of data and information,
and encouragement for private initiatives to extend information networks on
the basis of private financing.
The fifth element in his presidency strategy is to provide greater market
opening for the states of central and eastern Europe.
That would include the conclusion of free trade agreements with the Baltic
republics during the second half of the year, and a Europe agreement with
Slovenia.
Mr Rexrodt said that formal EU membership negotiations with Poland and
Hungary, the two central European states to submit formal applications,
could only begin once the EU itself had agreed on the next round of
institutional reforms scheduled for 1996.
In the meantime, further market-opening measures were needed, and restraint
on the part of the EU in instituting anti-dumping and other protection
measures against the central and east Europeans.
Mr Rexrodt's strategy is one element of a concerted German presidency
programme still being finalised by the various German ministries, before
Bonn takes over the EU presidency on July 1.
The six-month period will involve the installation of a new European
parliament and the approval of a new European Commission, including a
redistribution of Commission portfolios - all matters of acute political
sensitivity.
Apart from the economic strategy, the presidency will focus on developing
common foreign and security policies, and preparing the ground for the 1996
inter-governmental conference on institutional reform.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Renewed drachma pressure expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek drachma may come under heavy pressure today as speculation mounts
that the government will be forced to trim interest rates next week.
It declined against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at Dr150.1, against
Dr147.5 the previous day. It was also down against the US dollar, closing at
Dr246.4 (Dr244.4). Dealers said the central bank spent about Dollars 300m to
support the currency yesterday, its first large intervention this week. The
bank is estimated to have lost around 15 per cent of its foreign exchange
reserves during the two-week battle to defend the drachma.
However, yesterday's decline indicated the government intends to abandon its
'hard drachma' policy and allow the currency to depreciate at a faster rate
than the 7-8 per cent projected for this year.
This would relieve pressure which has shown no sign of abating since the
government lifted capital controls on May 16. At the same time, it would
enable the governing Socialists to avoid the heavy political cost of a
formal devaluation just before the European parliament elections.
One dealer said: 'It's clear that short-term interest rates of over 100 per
cent have been asphyxiating the banking system and faster depreciation is
one way to bring them down.'
Short-term rates have been fluctuating between 70 and 500 per cent. The
overnight borrowing rate this week reached 300 per cent, creating serious
liquidity problems for smaller banks.
In an effort to inject some liquidity into the system, the central bank is
to hold a swap auction today for the first time in more than two years. This
will allow banks to borrow drachmas against foreign currency from the
central bank at lower rates than those prevailing on the inter-bank market.
The liquidity squeeze, which has forced banks to raise corporate lending
rates above 40 per cent, is also threatening government revenues, as
companies are preparing to postpone VAT payments due at the end of the month
in order to maintain cash-flow.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: W German inflation below 3%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The inflation rate in west Germany sank below 3 per cent in May for the
first time in more than three years, the federal statistics office reported
yesterday. The provisional figure of 2.9 per cent for the annual rate of
increase in consumer prices in the west confirms a steady trend which has
seen the rate come down from 3.4 per cent in January and February, to 3.2
per cent in March and 3.1 per cent in April. The figure is the lowest since
April 1991, when it was 2.8 per cent. Since then it has been fuelled by a
series of high wage rises, reaching an average of 4.2 per cent for 1993 as a
whole, the highest rate since 1982. Economists now expect a continuing
decline during the year, thanks to a series of moderate wage increases in
the latest pay round. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, has forecast
that it will fall below 2 per cent early in 1995. Quentin Peel, Bonn
Finland's central bank yesterday adjusted its tender rate, the key rate
governing commercial banks' borrowing with the central bank, to 5.1 per cent
from 4.92 per cent. The rate was last changed on May 9, when it was lowered
to from 4.95 per cent.
Italian wage inflation stood at an annual 2.5 per cent in April after 2.4
per cent in March, the national statistics office said. The April rise
compares with an annual growth of 4.1 per cent in consumer prices the same
month.
Norway's registered unemployment rate fell to 4.8 per cent in late May from
5.1 per cent at the end of April, the country's labour directorate reported.

FT  27 MAY 94 / PC screen text fails the test of readability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you find it hard to read words on a personal computer screen, you are in
good company.
A leading US-based computer scientist warned last night that even the best
of today's personal computer screens could not display extended text, such
as newspaper articles or encyclopaedia entries, so they can be read in
comfort.
The better a reader you are, he said, the more difficulty you will
experience in reading from a screen.
Mr Alan Kay, widely credited as the inspiration behind many of the
best-known features of personal computers, including screen 'windows' and
the 'mouse' pointing device, said the discovery called into question the use
of computers in schools for teaching reading.
He said: 'It is almost a crime to put computers into schools to teach
reading because nothing is more antagonistic to the act of reading than a
conventional computer screen.'
It also raises questions about the suitability of personal computer
technology for on-line text retrieval and other information and
entertainment services.
Mr Kay, formerly a top scientist for Xerox and now research fellow at Apple
Computer, was giving the sixth Charles Read Memorial lecture in London. He
is now studying the use of computers in educating children.
Mr Kay's conclusions were based on experiments carried out using equipment
built for the US space programme and capable of detecting minute eye
movements. They show that, close to a screen, the eye is capable of
detecting minute changes in light intensity as the image is refreshed, and
these are unconsciously recorded by the viewer.
The brain interprets them as warning signals in a throwback to the days when
humans had to be alert to the possibility of sudden charges by sabre-toothed
tigers and the like. The eyes, in consequence, wander continually to the
edges of the screen to try to identify the danger.
Mr Kay said it was technically possible to build a screen suitable for
reading text. It would have 6.3m picture elements (pixels) compared with the
300,000 on a typical PC screen.
It would have a contrast ratio similar to white paper of 100:1 compared to
30:1 for a computer screen; and it would refresh the screen at more than 100
frames a second.
Such a screen, built at Xerox's research headquarters, had cost Dollars
200,000 (Pounds 133,333). Screens of equivalent quality might be available
at an economic price in five years, he thought.

preferences should be linked to improvements in China's human rights record.
'I believe we are far more likely to have human rights advances when it is
not under the cloud of the annual renewal of MFN,' the president said,
referring to the most favoured nation trading status, which allows Chinese
goods into the US at low tariffs.
Mr Clinton offered some consolation to those in Congress and elsewhere who
have demanded sustained pressure on Chinese human rights. He announced a ban
on imports of Chinese guns and ammunition, mainly the SKS rifle popular in
the US, as well as committing himself to 'aggressive' efforts on the human
rights front.
But he freely conceded that his executive order of last summer linking trade
and human rights, setting a deadline of June 3 for MFN renewal, had not
produced the desired dividends, in spite of improvements in areas such as
emigration from China, prison labour and a better accounting of dissidents
in Tibet and throughout China.
The president thought that even his critics had come round to the view that
a different approach was necessary.
That may not stop some in Congress from introducing legislation either
maintaining the human rights linkage or demanding tougher sanctions than
implied by the guns and ammunition ban, which affects only an estimated
Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m (Pounds 10m-Pounds 13.3m) in Chinese sales out of
total Chinese exports last year of more than Dollars 31bn.
Mr Clinton placed his decision in the context of overall US policies in
Asia, as well as its 'significant interests' with China itself. He cited
this week's progress in trade negotiations with Japan and the 'possible
progress' in resolving the impasse over North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
His decision was one of the most difficult of his presidency. In the 1992
campaign he had accused President George Bush of 'coddling' the Chinese
dictatorship and had seemed to live up to that promise last summer with the
order linking MFN and human rights.
That action was commended at the time as politically astute, but it depended
on the co-operation of China. That was never seriously forthcoming.

FT  27 MAY 94 / ITV companies told to improve programme quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ITV network was yesterday accused of showing a lack of courage and
adventure, and two new commercial television franchise holders, Carlton
Television and Good Morning Television, were severely criticised for their
programme performance.
The attack came in a review by the Independent Television Commission, the
industry watchdog, of programme standards in 1993, the first year of the new
licences awarded under the 1990 Broadcasting Act.
Carlton Television, the largest ITV company and a subsidiary of Mr Michael
Green's Carlton Communications, was told that its national network
performance was 'well below expectations' and that most of its national
programmes were neither distinctive nor of notably high quality.
The commission said it wanted to see 'a significant improvement in 1994 and
beyond' in the performance of Carlton, which outbid Thames Television to
take the London weekday franchise.
GMTV, which outbid TV-am for the breakfast TV franchise, was given a formal
warning in view of 'its unsatisfactory performance over 1993 as a whole.'
There were significant shortfalls in the required amount of news, current
affairs and children's programming and there was general concern about
quality. The commission said it would review GMTV's performance in September
and would consider sanctions unless improvements had been made.
For a first offence, the commission can impose a fine of up to 3 per cent of
revenue, which in GMTV's case would be about Pounds 2m.
Mr Nigel Walmsley, chairman of Carlton Television, said the criticism of his
company had to be seen in the light of its achievements, such as the launch
of 43 series and 20 single programmes. Mr Green was travelling in Germany
and unavailable for comment.
Mr Walmsley, who also recently became chairman of GMTV - Carlton is a 20 per
cent shareholder - said continuing progress was being made.
He added: 'I am confident that we can build on the standards and audience
loyalty we are now achieving.'
The commission gave relatively clean bills of health to most of the rest of
commercial television, with star reviews for Channel 4 and to a lesser
extent for Granada Television and newcomer Meridian, holder of the south of
England franchise.
Sir George Russell, the chairman of the ITC, praised ITV for keeping its 10
per cent lead over BBC 1 in a period of disruption and change.
'The ratings performance was undoubtedly satisfactory but we are looking for
more adventure and courage in 1994,' said Sir George. He warned that because
advertising revenues were rising in real terms there was 'no excuse for
failing to improve services during 1994.'
Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Council, said the most important judges
of ITV's programmes were the viewers and the network's share of total
viewing was 43 per cent.
Anglia Television, which the ITC praised, announced 171 redundancies
following a reorganisation.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Biggest UK cable TV group set to delay float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TeleWest, the largest cable television operator in the UK, is expected to
announce today that it intends to postpone a flotation that would have
valued the company at Pounds 1.7bn.
The reassessment, which is expected to be blamed on deteriorating stock
market conditions, came as General Cable, one of the largest UK cable
communications groups, decided to postpone its flotation plans. It was the
second cable company to delay such plans in as many days.
General Cable, a subsidiary of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, said yesterday
it had decided to defer its proposed London listing 'in the light of market
conditions'.
On Wednesday, Comcast UK Partners, which was planning to raise funds through
a secondary share issue in the US, postponed the sale because of poor
conditions in the market.
Comcast UK, part of Comcast the Philadelphia-based cable communications
company, had planned to sell 11.75m shares for up to Dollars 18 each.
However, when investors showed little interest at a floor level of Dollars
14 a share, the offering was postponed.
Last night, TeleWest, a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest
cable operator in the US, and US West, the American telephone company, would
only say it was assessing its options with advisers Goldman Sachs and
Kleinwort Benson.
The decision by TeleWest, which was planning a listing on the London Stock
Exchange and a registration of American depository shares on Nasdaq, will
have considerable influence on other cable companies planning to come to
market.
As recently as Wednesday Mr Alan Michels, TeleWest chief executive,
suggested the flotation would go ahead.
General Cable holds cable franchises in the UK covering some 1.6m homes in
areas including Windsor in Berkshire, Hillingdon and Hounslow in west
London, and Birmingham, one of the most successful franchises in the UK.
General Cable said yesterday that it remained committed 'to providing an
opportunity for UK and international investors to participate in the
development of the UK cable industry'.
The company said it would go ahead with a listing in the UK and
internationally when market conditions were favourable.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Order books at five-year high, CBI survey finds: Money
supply figures fuel inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies reported the highest monthly level of factory orders for
five years in May, providing fresh evidence that the economic recovery is
feeding through to the manufacturing sector.
In a further sign of growing business confidence, a Confederation of British
Industry survey also found that manufacturers expect a strong increase in
output over the coming months.
But this upbeat picture of economic recovery was slightly marred by new
money supply statistics that hint at possible inflationary pressures. The
latest figures for notes in circulation, released by the Bank of England
yesterday, suggested next week's statistics would show dramatic growth in
M0, the narrowest measure of money supply.
The total value of British bank notes in circulation in the week to May 25
was 6.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Using those statistics, and numbers
from previous weeks, Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi
International (Europe), estimates that annual M0 growth in May will jump to
7.1 per cent in May, from 6.2 per cent in April. The government's monitoring
range is 0-4 per cent.
Any such rise is likely to fuel concern that inflationary pressure could
potentially undermine recovery, and increase speculation about a rise in
interest rates. Earlier this month the Bank of England expressed some
concern about rapid M0 growth in its latest inflation report.
Although the report said the acceleration in M0 growth had been prompted by
low interest rates, which encourage consumers to hold cash, it noted that
'the longer M0 grows at well above the top of its monitoring range, the
greater the concern about the implications for future inflation'.
These inflationary concerns were yesterday played down by the CBI. Its
latest economic forecast, released today, predicts steady, low inflation,
economic recovery during this year and next, and says there is little
evidence yet of any pick-up in wage earnings.
Meanwhile, the CBI's industrial trends survey, also released today, suggests
that price pressures remained fairly weak in manufacturing in spite of the
pick-up in output.
Although slightly more companies now expect to be able to increase prices
over the next four months than reduce them, this proportion is lower than a
year ago, and only fractionally higher than in previous months. The survey
covers companies accounting for about half of the total UK manufacturing
output.
Elsewhere, the survey suggests that overseas demand is contributing to the
improvement in company order books. Although export order books are still
running at levels companies consider below normal, they are at their best
levels since 1990, the survey said.
Medium-sized companies, which employ between 200 and 500 people, reported
the best levels of output and export, especially those supplying components
and raw materials.
But business confidence was high across most sectors, with 36 per cent of
companies expecting to see an increase in output volume over the coming
months.

FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Universal Ceramic to float valued at Pounds
20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small ceramic materials company is hoping to defy the market's recent
aversion to new issues with a flotation this summer expected to value the
group at up to Pounds 20m.
Universal Ceramic Materials is aiming to come to the market through a
placing which is likely to raise about Pounds 10m.
Mr Bill Hughes, chief executive, was confident the float would succeed.
'We are a small company and have never made a loss,' he said. Also the
amount of cash we are looking for is relatively small.'
UCM intends to use the proceeds to invest in equipment and increase
capacity. The company has changed hands four times since 1980. In 1993 Mr
Hughes led a Pounds 10.6m management buy-out.
Profits for 1993 rose 40 per cent to Pounds 1.7m on sales of about Pounds
26m. Mr Hughes said he expected profits to improve further in 1994.
UCM, which manufactures products used in refractories and heating elements,
operates in several mature markets in the UK, US and continental Europe.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Founders cede control of French
advertising firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit (BDDP), the French advertising group, yesterday ended
a long struggle to retain its independence. Its four founders announced they
were ceding control of the company to a consortium of institutional
investors in a FFr700m (Dollars 124.1m) rescue package.
BDDP, which has expanded rapidly to become one of France's largest
advertising agencies since its creation 10 years ago, has come under intense
pressure during the recession. It has been searching for capital to reduce
its debt for some time.
The deal means the four founders, led by Mr Jean-Claude Boulet, chairman,
will now own 15 per cent of the group, rather than their current combined
share of 55 per cent. The rest of the equity will be divided between ESI, an
investment fund, and a group of banks including Banque Nationale de Paris
and Credit Lyonnais.
After the restructuring, BDDP's debt will be reduced to FFr300m from FFr1bn.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Euris gets go-ahead to take
stake in Moulinex

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moulinex, the ailing French household appliances group, yesterday took a
step towards completing its financial restructuring when its shareholders
voted to allow Euris, an investment consortium, to take a stake in the
company.
The shareholders, who are dominated by Moulinex's employees and founders,
were presented with offers from two prospective shareholders - Euris, a
group of French investors led by Mr Jean-Charles Naouri, a financier, and
Glen Dimplex, an Irish business which is one of Moulinex's closest
competitors with the Morphy Richards brand.
Euris had long been the favourite. Moulinex's workforce voiced concern
earlier this year at a stake being sold to Glen Dimplex, on the grounds that
it could lead to redundancies.
However, last Tuesday shareholders postponed the meeting at which they were
scheduled to vote on the two offers. Despite this delay the Euris bid
carried the day when the shareholders eventually met yesterday afternoon.
Moulinex now intends to finalise a FFr1bn rights issue.
Moulinex warned earlier this week that its losses had deepened in its last
financial year to March 31. Moulinex then sustained a net deficit of around
FFr550m (including provisions of FFr500m) against a net loss of FFr115m on
FFr8.22bn (Dollars 1.43bn) sales in the previous year.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Rights groups warn on Hong Kong refugees: Tension worsens as
the time approaches for Vietnamese repatriation talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Children of Vietnamese asylum seekers held in detention centres in Hong Kong
may know little of life beyond the heavy iron gates, but in recent weeks
they have seen some horrific things around them: adults tearing open their
own flesh with sharpened spears of bamboo and knives, self-immolation and
the emaciated figures of hunger strikers.
In the past week 65 cases of self-wounding have been reported at the
detention centres, and emotions are set to escalate before a key meeting
next week in Bangkok to discuss strategies for resettlement and repatriation
of the Vietnamese asylum seekers remaining in Asia. Pressure groups are
urging the Hong Kong government to move fast to defuse a potentially
explosive situation.
The government's recent track record is not encouraging. Last month, the
Correctional Services Department despatched 1,200 officers in riot gear to
move 1,500 Vietnamese from Whitehead Detention Centre, in Hong Kong's New
Territories, to High Island Camp, half an hour's bus ride away.
The storming of Whitehead was crude, violent and excessive, according to
lawyers and rights groups. Buddhist shrines were torn down, women and
children kicked and punched, mace sprayed in detainees' faces and teargas
fired liberally, they say. These claims, and others, are being investigated
by an independent inquiry set up by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor.
Human rights groups say at least 270 people were treated by doctors after
the storming during which, they say, 557 teargas shells were fired, along
with a pepper-fog teargas machine. The government at first admitted to 250
rounds of teargas and 30 casualties.
Just over half the 52,000 Vietnamese refugees in camps throughout Asia are
held in Hong Kong detention centres. Hong Kong itself already has one of the
world's highest population densities at 5,390 people a sq km, and the 1992
agreement struck with Hanoi to repatriate non-refugees seemed a fair
solution.
However, repatriation is proving a double-edged sword: government figures
show it has brought the annual flood of asylum seekers down to a trickle,
but the plight of men and women being forcibly returned to a country where
they say they would be at risk has provoked indignation in the US and
elsewhere.
There is little local sympathy. In an economy where the onus for welfare has
traditionally been put upon the family, it goes against the grain to see the
governments of Hong Kong and Britain together with the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees shell out funds on the Vietnamese' upkeep (the total
bill for the current financial year is expected to be HKDollars 998m
(USDollars 129m).
When one youngster, en route to the US after a last-minute reprieve, said he
never wanted to see Hong Kong again, an outraged reader wrote to the local
daily, the South China Morning Post: 'His remark instils a feeling of guilt
among the people of Hong Kong who have been doing more than any other people
in the world for the Vietnamese refugees. As for this young man, we provided
food, shelter and, not least, the opportunity to seek a new home elsewhere.'
Most of those awaiting screening will be rejected as lacking a well-founded
fear of persecution in Vietnam: of the 58,491 people already screened, 89
per cent were screened out.
Government officials refer to them as 'economic refugees,' despite the fact
that Hong Kong is full of maids from the Philippines, sandwich boys from the
UK, MBAs from the US and barmaids from Australia.
Most of the asylum seekers are packed within the confines of rude bunkers in
Whitehead Detention Centre, whose walls are topped with massive loops of
barbed wire. In summer the huts are sweltering, in winter freezing.
Whitehead faces the sea, but affords no more of a view than Alcatraz.
'They are isolated and insulated,' says Ms Pam Baker, a lawyer who chairs
Refugee Concern. 'No independent body goes in there. The UNHCR and the Hong
Kong government are in cahoots and have the whole thing tied up. It is
pretty claustrophobic, and they don't really know what's going on in there
so they make up rumours which go around and spread like wildfire.'
Mr Jahanshah Assadi, the Hong Kong chief of mission at the UNHCR, says the
recent spate of self-mutilation in the camps is 'quite regrettable.' But
what more can he do, he asks.
What the UNHCR does is provide counselling. This, it believes, is sufficient
and has quashed certain requests by Refugee Concern for lawyers' visits on
these grounds alone.
Refugee Concern wants it to grant access to concerned individuals,
non-governmental organisations and lawyers. It could also sanction the
installation of payphones, and it could allow a free flow of information, it
says.
In short, it says, it could provide some of the amenities already offered to
inmates at Hong Kong's Victoria Prison.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (14): Dynamic Swiss
approach - Lombard Odier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss private bankers are reputed to be low-risk, conservative investors.
All the more remarkable then, that one of the country's oldest banks,
Lombard Odier, should have a fixed-income investment arm that is
consistently outperforming market indices with the help of innovative
investment strategies and a dynamic trading approach.
'Markets are inefficient, and we are very active managers - our investment
philosophy is to try to discover the inefficiencies and ensure the portfolio
will benefit,' says Paul Abberley, director and head of fixed income at
Lombard Odier in London. He adds that 'inefficiencies are dynamic, they
constantly change. It's not realistic to build a model - you need human
judgment to evaluate them.'
Lombard Odier London was set up in 1978 to provide specialist fund
management services to institutional investors in separate bond and equity
funds. The total amount of funds under management has grown to Dollars 7.2bn
(of which Dollars 4.5bn are invested in fixed income) from around Dollars
2.5bn in December 1990.
The fund invests in about 20 OECD bond markets; including their currencies -
which are managed as a separate asset class to enhance total return - that's
40 variables.
To cover all this ground, Lombard Odier set up a team of 10 investment
professionals specialising in three areas. Paul Abberley sets long-term
strategy on a six- to nine-month fundamental view. A tactical group of four
fine-tunes the long-term strategy and carries out microwork: picking
sectors, carrying out yield-curve analyses, issue selection, and executing
trades. The remaining five are members of the portfolio management group,
who, taking into account long-term strategy, input from the tactical group
and client parameters, build efficient portfolios to ensure investment
performance.
The bond team uses a multistrategy approach, consisting of 'top-down'
analysis of macroeconomic and political trends, supplemented through
'bottom-up' sector- and security-selection. They place a heavy emphasis on
fine-tuning which helps damp volatility and boost returns. Thus, while its
overall long-term strategy remains constant, Lombard Odier's bond managers
do a substantial amount of short-term trading within the overall long-term
strategy, to optimise the portfolio's performance. In 1992, for example,
their turnover for a UK pension fund was 325 per cent, including currency
trading.
'This may appear high, but the level of turnover was not generated by
inconsistent long-term strategy or by constant issue trading,' says Mr
Abberley. 'Our commitment of resources in the tactical investment group
simply allows portfolios to move quickly in times of short-term market
instability.'
Short-term trades might include a switch from gilts to eurosterling bonds of
a similar maturity, or going short on one part of the yield curve and long
on other sectors. This contrasts with more conventional bond fund managers,
who might buy paper and sit on it for several months; while both houses
might have the same long-term strategy, Lombard Odier may generate three
times the turnover. 'The fine-tuning adds to the turnover, but it also adds
value,' Mr Abberley says.
Amid the recent turmoil in world bond markets, he admits that 'the first
quarter of 1994 has been a very challenging period; we've had to deal with
high volatility and a sharp correction in most markets - it's been a period
where one is best off being defensive, rather than adding value.'
To cope with these conditions, his team has moved away from directional
bets, and has sought to shorten duration to reduce risk.
But protecting one's downside does not promote index outperformance. That's
why they are increasingly looking to exploit relative, not absolute, value.
This might involve spread plays between different markets. 'It doesn't
matter if yields are going up or down, as long as the spreads move your
way,' says Mr Abberley.
Derivatives form an intrinsic part of Lombard Odier's portfolio
construction, where client guidelines permit. They can be used to replicate
cash market strategies more cheaply than using conventional securities, and
to hedge cash positions. Moreover, fund managers might use options to
achieve risk-return configurations which are impossible to achieve in the
cash market.
Ultimately, 'fund managers are constantly driven by the twin forces of hope
and fear: hope that their losses will abate, and fear that their gains will
will be eroded,' says Mr Abberley. This too often leads them to take profits
earlier than they should, or to hold on to loss-making positions longer than
they should. Fund managers 'should train themselves to fear the losses and
to run with the gains'.
Lombard Odier's bond funds have consistently outperformed market indices
recently. In 1993, its US dollar-based Global Fixed Income Fund posted a
return of 22.08 per cent, compared with a 12.26 per cent rise in J P
Morgan's global government bond index (traded). This compares with the
industry average of 14.65 per cent, according to data from HSW, a fund
performance measurement company. In the three years to December 1993,
Lombard Odier's global bond fund posted a 49.40 per cent return versus 35.52
per cent on J P Morgan's index; over the past seven years it gained 147.58
per cent, against 93.25 per cent on the index.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (15): Crucial
transition period - Abbey National
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The company treasurer, once a rather marginal figure within an organisation,
has grown in status in recent years. The growing complexity of the financial
markets and the increasing range of sophisticated instruments available have
made his task more difficult and more highly valued, while a series of
well-publicised losses on derivatives by treasury departments have also
resulted in closer scrutiny of the treasury operation.
This is particularly true of bank treasurers, whose activities are even more
central to the wellbeing of their institutions than those of corporate
treasurers.
Gareth Jones, Abbey National's treasurer since the building society acquired
bank status in 1989, has seen his department through a crucial transition
period. Since becoming a bank, Abbey has been more active in using
international capital markets. Its treasury is considered one of the more
aggressive and professional operations in the financial markets, in its
activities as an issuer and as an investor.
Last year, it raised Dollars 5.5bn in the international bond markets. So far
this year the total is Dollars 5bn, of which Dollars 4bn was completed in
January, before the markets turned sour. In addition, Abbey also has a
Dollars 4bn US commercial paper programme, of which Dollars 2.5bn is drawn,
and a Dollars 10bn medium-term note programme, of which Dollars 8.5bn is
drawn.
Part of the challenge has been to raise the international profile of the
company. 'We have had a pretty good reception in the long-term debt market -
we have achieved quite good rates in lira,' said Mr Jones. Nevertheless, in
a market where perception often lags change, it has been a battle to convey
the message abroad that Abbey is now a bank, rated AA by Standard &amp; Poor's
and AA2 by Moody's, rather than a building society, considered a more
esoteric breed by overseas investors. Abbey National has therefore held a
series of roadshows in Europe, aimed at the banks which manage local retail
distribution.
As well as tapping retail demand, Abbey has also built a stronger
institutional base, by issuing large liquid transactions. So far this year,
Abbey has launched Dollars 1bn offerings of fixed and floating-rate bonds.
Last year, Abbey issued a 10-year eurobond in the sterling market which,
after the second tranche was launched, totalled Pounds 1bn, equalling in
size the largest deal in the sector.
As well as being a sizeable issuer, Abbey National's treasury is also active
as an investor - it is the largest investor in the sterling mortgage-backed
bond market, but it runs investment books in a number of currencies, the
largest of which are sterling and dollars. Abbey has also bought bonds in
the US mortgage-backed market, and is keeping track of developments in the
European asset-backed market.
In a radical departure, Abbey has also set up a joint venture in derivatives
with Baring Brothers. Abbey National Baring Derivatives was set up last year
as a branch of Abbey National Treasury Services - a move which caused
concern about the potential risks of derivatives business, although Abbey
insists its strategy is conservative. Unlike most corporate treasuries,
Abbey National Treasury Services is run as a profit centre: pre-tax profits
in 1993 reached almost Pounds 200m, having shown consistent growth since
1989.
The arguments against running a treasury department as a profit centre are
strong for industrial companies, where the treasury is mainly designed to
service other business areas. But a bank treasury is an integral part of the
main business.
Nevertheless, despite the strong performance of Abbey National Treasury
Services, Mr Jones believes that a purely profit-oriented approach is
potentially dangerous for a treasury operation. 'We are a profit centre but
the chief executive is not pushing for additional profits from treasury,' he
said. 'If things go wrong in treasury it will have a disproportionate effect
on the public perception of the business.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (13): Impressive
placing power - Merrill Lynch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some months ago, news that a veteran Merrill Lynch investment banker had
flown in from New York to call on London clients sent shivers down the
spines of the locals. Was he about to snatch a big deal from under their
noses? asked worried eurobond syndicate managers at the London-based houses.
His arrival was given further importance because it coincided with market
rumours that Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, was about to launch a
large global bond offering. The Hanson deal has yet to surface, but
nevertheless the episode serves to illustrate the strong presence which
Merrill has built in the international capital markets.
As the biggest US securities house with a market capitalisation of Dollars
8bn and an enviable distribution system to institutional and retail
investors, one expects Merrill to have a dominant position in the US and in
the international arena. According to Securities Data, Merrill was the
leading underwriter of worldwide public new issues of debt and equity in
1993 with business worth Dollars 193bn. It also maintained its market share
of just over 13 per cent.
Merrill's placing power, its wide range of services and its ability to
execute currency swaps are some of the strengths which attract borrowers.
Officials at a European sovereign borrower which has been active in the
eurobond market in recent years say that although Merrill tends to be more
anonymous than its competitors, it has strong ideas on derivatives, swaps
and other structured products.
The perception that the company 'transcends individuals' also appeals to the
treasurer of a UK bank who regards Merrill as one of the best dealers in
medium-term notes, a facility which is increasingly popular with borrowers.
However, another UK corporate treasurer feels rather neglected by Merrill
with respect to primary issues now that the yield spreads on his bonds have
tightened substantially. 'They get more bang for their bucks by working with
medium-range credits,' he says.
Indeed, Merrill has been closely involved with issuers, sovereign borrowers
in particular, which are seen to be improving credits. It has arranged
issues for Portugal, Argentina and is widely expected to lead-manage the
first eurobond offering for Lebanon later this year.
Although Merrill is seen as a powerful fixed-income house, it has also made
rapid strides in the international equity market in recent years. According
to IFR Securities Data, Merrill raised Dollars 4.64bn in international
equity issuance in 1993, putting it second in the book runners' table behind
Goldman Sachs. Although it only moved up just one place from the previous
year, it almost doubled the amount raised in equity issuance compared with
1992.
By contrast, Merrill only achieved fifth position in the widely-watched
eurobond league table last year when it raised Dollars 17.9bn out of total
eurobond issuance of Dollars 400bn, putting it behind Goldman Sachs,
Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston.
Syndicate managers at other London-based eurobond houses offer several
reasons why Merrill's profile in the eurobond market is not as high as it
could be. Some say it is because the London operation tends to report back
more to New York whereas other US houses in London have more autonomy.
Others put it down to Merrill's dependence on eurodollar issuance. 'It has
virtually no penetration in sterling or D-Marks,' says one syndicate
manager.
However, Merrill has been taking steps to broaden its range of currencies
which should enable it to underwrite more business in the eurobond market.
It has built up a presence in yen and French francs and its return to
dealing in UK government bonds earlier this year should help it to win more
primary eurosterling mandates. Heavy losses had prompted Merrill to pull out
of gilts in 1989.
Expertise in money markets and floating-rate notes have also enabled Merrill
to make the most of the change for the worse in market sentiment which has
prompted investors to opt for short-dated maturities and for floating-rate
as opposed to fixed-rate bonds.
These developments already appear to be producing results. According to IFR
Securities Data, by early May Merrill had clawed its way to second position
in the 1994 eurobond league table with just under Dollars 10bn worth of new
issue business or 6.5 per cent of the total.
However, Merrill has exposed itself and its new issues to potentially harsh
scrutiny by the market following its rather arrogant contribution to a
recent debate on whether the eurobond market's fixed-price re-offer
mechanism needed to be amended.
In a letter to IFR magazine, which acted as a forum for the debate, Merrill
said: 'Difficulties clearly arise with the fixed price re-offer mechanism
with respect to transactions which are clearly mispriced and/or poorly
mis-timed. It is our policy to avoid such transactions and hence are not in
a position to make an informed comment.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (15): Quiet revolution under way - Minas
Gerais has become the most active state in global financial markets / Three
states tackle economic and social problems with a variety of approaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its own quiet way, the state of Minas Gerais is undergoing a revolution.
As well as being set to challenge Rio de Janeiro as Brazil's second biggest
economy, it has become the most active state in global financial markets
following a pioneering Eurobond issue earlier this year.
Development officials portray the state, which is larger than France in
area, as a haven for businesses from the overcrowding, high costs and strong
union organisation of neighbouring Sao Paulo.
In the 16th century it was gold that attracted settlers to the state. Gold
mining was largely replaced by iron ore but the colonial towns built by the
settlers, such as Ouro Preto and Tiradentes, remain, and have become an
important tourist attraction.
State officials boast that Minas' share of national gross domestic product
increased by three percentage points to 11.4 per cent between 1970 and 1990,
while Brazil's other three largest economies - those of Sao Paulo, Rio de
Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul - saw their shares shrink. During the 1980s,
Minas exports increased by an average 10 per cent a year.
This growth was sparked in the 1970s by the arrival of big industrial
companies such as Fiat and by a strategy to attract manufacturing and high
technology companies, many from overcrowded Sao Paulo, by offering fiscal
incentives and lower costs.
The policy has been promoted by the state's development bank, BDMG, and its
Industrial Development Institute. In the 1990s, the state has targeted
companies in sectors such as vehicle parts, electronics and agribusiness.
Nevertheless, iron ore still makes up about a quarter of Minas's Dollars 5bn
in exports.
With a GDP of about Dollars 42bn, the state is home to a large chunk of
Brazil's newly-privatised, and profitable, steel industry as well as mining,
aluminium and car production. Industrial giants with operations in Minas
include the steel company Usiminas, the government-controlled mining company
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium
producer.
The economy has been helped by finance from the World Bank and
Inter-American Development Bank for infrastructure projects.
The state government has also been active in international financial
markets. In February it raised Dollars 200m through a Eurobond issue that
offered options to buy stock in its electricity company Cemig.
Despite the complexity of the operation and the fact that no other state had
attempted a bond with equity warrant issue, the offer was successful and has
opened the door to similar operations in the future, say state officials.
They add that the state's conservative financial management has led to a
balanced budget for the past three years.
However, Minas Gerais also suffers from serious social problems, including
shanty towns and an estimated 2m people or more living in poverty. Problems
are particularly acute in the north of the state in areas such as
Jequitinhonha.
Mr Marcus Flora, general secretary in Minas for the left- wing Workers Party
(PT), criticises the state government's policies. He says that investment
has been over-concentrated in large civil construction schemes to benefit
contractors and other political allies of the state government.
'Education, health and public sanitation have suffered and while the state
produces 20m tonnes of cereals a year, 2m people are going hungry,' says Mr
Flora.
The state government and its agencies deny that social problems have been
ignored. Officials point to schemes such as the Jaiba irrigation project for
fruit farmers in the poor north of the state, and education projects such as
the Curumim programme for children from low income backgrounds.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (16): Austerity and common sense - Ceara is
becoming the envy of reformists and winning plaudits from international
agencies / Three states tackle economic and social problems with a variety
of approaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's backward and usually corrupt north-east is an unlikely place to
encounter balanced budgets and good government. But thanks to both these
factors and a bit of luck, the state of Ceara is becoming the envy of
reformists in the region and winning plaudits from international agencies.
Ceara's fortunes started to turn with the 1987 election as governor of a
young businessman, Mr Tasso Jereissati, who decided to confront the cosy
system of patron-and-client politics responsible for much of the
north-east's poverty and problems.
His main achievement was to balance the state's previously anarchic budget
with a mixture of austerity and common sense. About 40,000 public employees,
political appointments under previous regimes, were sacked. Tax collection
was tightened and corruption attacked. These ideas, fundamental to most
governments, are still controversial in much of Brazil and Mr Jereissati was
ostracised by much of the state's elite.
With the budget balanced, and corruption under wraps, businessmen started to
invest and the economy began to prosper. Growth in gross domestic product
has outstripped Brazil's by a factor of five. Per capita income rose 30 per
cent to a still very low Dollars 1,300 while in the rest of the country it
remained stagnant.
Mr Jereissati, who had joined the centrist Brazilian Social Democrats (PSDB)
of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister, was followed
as governor by his chosen successor Mr Ciro Gomes, who took over in 1991.
Both men sought to attract Brazilian and foreign investment. Textiles
company Grupo Vicunha is building two new factories in the state at a cost
of Dollars 450m. These could create 5,000 new jobs by 1997.
Other companies, such as shoemaker Grendene and plastics company Petropar
are also investing smaller amounts. A consortium of Taiwanese businessmen is
investing as much as Dollars 32m in various light industry ventures in the
interior of the state, attracted by low labour costs and government
incentives.
Ceara is a long way from being a paradise and still faces huge problems,
including areas of extreme poverty, rapid urbanisation and an overlooked
rural sector. Illiteracy remains stubbornly close to 40 per cent of the
population above 14 years old. Infant mortality has been cut dramatically by
an internationally praised health scheme, but in rural areas it remains
unacceptably high.
Even critics welcome the cleaning out of public accounts and say the
government's new credibility has brought investment from business and
multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, pleased to see money reaching
desired targets rather then syphoned off to corrupt politicians.
But there is concern about who has gained from eight years of PSDB rule. Ms
Maria Cleide Bernal, a local union leader, says there has been a lack of
investment and good policies in areas such as agriculture and the urban
shanty towns, the favelas. 'The benefits haven't gone to the majority of the
people, but to the elites,' she says. Other critics say both governors have
made expert use of public relations to take credit for schemes which
communities have started themselves.
Dr Adalberto Barreto, a psychiatrist who works in the giant shanty town of
Pirambu, says most health and welfare services are still provided by
residents. 'The government is capitalising on this. It is the communities
who are making the changes,' he says.
Mr Jereissati, who is likely to stand for governor again in this year's
elections, admits that much remains to be done, and that achievements so far
are building the base for future reforms. 'We need to jump forward,
especially with social development. We need to start integrating the poor
into society,' he says.

The state of Sao Paulo is Brazil's economic giant and the biggest consumer
market in South America. With less than a quarter of Brazil's population it
accounts for more than 40 per cent of industrial production and 37 per cent
of gross domestic product.
Paulistas, as its inhabitants are called, put that success down to one main
factor: hard work. The more arrogant look down on what they regard as the
decadent and workshy Rio de Janeiro as well as the under-developed and
poverty-stricken north-east of Brazil.
Sao Paulo's wealth was built on the 19th century coffee boom and the influx
of immigrants from Europe, Japan and the Middle East. That was followed by a
wave of immigration by job-hungry Brazilians from the north-east, who have
helped swell the state's population to 35m. The city, at 17m, is the biggest
in South America.
In the 1950s, the economy's axis moved from agriculture to industry, with
the arrival of car production, chemicals and other manufacturing to take
advantage of the state's large population and enterprising workforce. The
economy is today highly diversified, ranging from the manufacture of
satellites to food processing.
Sao Paulo's growing economic supremacy mirrored the decline in importance of
Rio de Janeiro, which was partly caused by Rio's loss of the capital to
Brasilia in 1960. 'Sao Paulo is the centre of gravity for Brazilian
capitalism,' says Mr Pedro Paulo Branco, head of Seade, the state's research
institute.
But Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, the state governor, complains that part of
Sao Paulo's wealth subsidises the federal government.
'We contribute 52 per cent of federal taxes while only getting 2 per cent
back,' he says. Analysts put Sao Paulo's continued industrial success down
to a good road and energy infrastructure, impressive universities and
research groups and a strong business culture, founded on the dynamism of
its immigrants.
But there are problems. Sao Paulo's share of Brazil's GDP has fallen from 41
per cent in 1980 to 37 per cent in 1992, according to Seade, and there have
been doubts about whether the state can continue its role as the engine
driving the national economy.
Part of the reduction in Sao Paulo's importance has been caused by
neighbouring states such as Minas Gerais offering tax and land incentives to
attract companies tired of Sao Paulo's over-saturated infrastructure and
higher costs.
However, Mr Branco says these companies are often in the agro-industrial or
intermediate goods sectors and that capital-intensive and high-tech
companies are still choosing Sao Paulo.
Some business people say militant unions, particularly in the car industry,
have contributed to companies moving out.
Mr Jose Lopez Feijoo, president of the CUT union confederation in Sao Paulo,
says the number of companies leaving the state because of strong unions is
'very small' and that for most companies the benefits of being close to Sao
Paulo's huge consumer market are overwhelming.
This point is echoed by Mr Robert Rennard, chief operating officer of
Autolatina, the holding company for the combined operations of Ford and
Volkswagen in Brazil. Mr Rennard adds that he expects higher labour costs in
Sao Paulo to be offset by a reduction in regional wage differences in the
car industry and that relations with the unions 'are maturing.'
Large sectors of Sao Paulo's economy are not unionised, however, and
unemployment stands at 15 per cent; about 1.2m workers. Some analysts
believe that the state's social problems, particularly unemployment, will
not be relieved significantly by economic growth because of a move towards
more specialisation in industry.
Outside the industrial sector, the city of Sao Paulo has consolidated its
hegemony over Rio de Janeiro in financial services. The Sao Paulo stock
exchange accounts for about 85 per cent of Brazilian share trading. The
city's futures and commodities exchange had trading volume of more than
Dollars 500bn in 1993.
Since the 1970s, when Sao Paulo's stock market expanded after carefully
targeting the growing new capital issues, there has been a trek of financial
executives from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo. Mr Ronaldo Nogueira, a director
of the Brazil Fund investment trust who lives in Rio de Janeiro, says: 'Not
being in Sao Paulo requires a certain effort and I find myself travelling
there at least once a week on average.' The future for Sao Paulo clearly
depends on the national perspective. If the Brazilian economy can be
stabilised then Sao Paulo could become an even more important hub, analysts
believe. They see the state as the anchor of a large industrial and trading
region, helped by by the Mercosul trading bloc.
The axis linking Sao Paulo with Buenos Aires, South America's two biggest
markets, is regarded as a key part of this development. 'Other Brazilian
states and countries like Paraguay and Bolivia will act as satellites,
linking their growth to that of Sao Paulo,' Mr Branco says.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (12): Market stopped
in its tracks - Securitisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and ANTONIA SHARPE

<TEXT>
The rise in US interest rates in recent months has clouded the outlook for
the asset securitisation business in the US.
While the volume of asset-backed securities grew by 9 per cent to Dollars
56.8bn in 1993, the market has stopped in its tracks this year. By April,
Dollars 15.4bn in asset-backed securities had been issued, down from Dollars
15.7bn in the first four months of 1993.
The larger mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market has also experienced a
reversal but when it came it was later in the year, and more severe. While
first quarter MBS new issue volume grew by about 6 per cent to a record
Dollars 108.8bn, it plunged 75 per cent in April when only Dollars 7bn of
securities were issued.
The downturn in the asset-backed and MBS markets also reflected the increase
in bond market volatility. As Ms Patricia Bonan, head of asset-backed
finance at Chase Securities in New York, explains: 'It is not the absolute
level of interest rates, but interest rate volatility that has kept
investors on the sidelines.'
Nevertheless, the business of securitising assets remains in a healthy
condition, and innovation is still a feature. Last year, car loans and
receipts were the most heavily securitised form of asset (volume totalled
Dollars 24.9bn), followed by credit and card charge receivables (Dollars
19.1bn). However, many other types of assets are being securitised in
greater numbers as issuers seek a cheaper way to finance their asset growth.
Recent innovations include securitised automobile dealers' loans (the money
vehicle manufacturers lend to their dealers to purchase new cars and
trucks), agricultural equipment loans, automobile leases, and loans granted
to companies by Eximbank, the government body which provides export credit
guarantees.
Innovation in the MBS market has been hit by the turmoil and volatility of
recent months which left participants reeling - particularly those active in
the MBS derivatives market, where volatility destroyed their assumptions
about prepayment levels and made the pricing of securities such as
collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs) extremely difficult. As prices
fell and liquidity dried up, some leveraged funds which had taken big
positions in CMOs came unstuck. Askin Capital Management was forced into
bankruptcy in April because of its huge CMO-related losses.
Those seeking security in the MBS market were attracted by the launch of
collateralised mortgage obligations by Ginnie Mae (the Government National
Mortgage Association). Although existing CMOs issued by other government
mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association)
are popular because the underlying mortgages are supported by an inferred
federal guarantee, Ginnie Mae's mortgages enjoy an explicit federal backing.
Thus, its CMOs will carry a zero risk weighting - a big attraction for
conservative investors.
Although securitisation is a huge market in the US, its development in the
UK is at an early stage. Banks and building societies seeking to diversify
their funding sources have started to experiment with this financing
technique. In the past year, Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank
have launched mortgage and personal loan securitisations.
Regulatory constraints have hampered the use of securitisation by building
societies which last year had just under 60 per cent of the UK mortgage
market. The tradition of lending through floating-rate mortgages as opposed
to fixed-rate mortgages also puts the UK at a disadvantage because
variable-rate assets are more difficult to match.
The Building Society Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, is due to
publish guidelines in the next two months on how building societies can
securitise their assets.
Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth-largest, is close to
becoming the first society to fund its mortgage lending business through
securitisation. Nationwide and Skipton have also carried out similar
studies.
Leeds has spent the past two years setting up a system to securitise its
mortgages so that it can handle higher mortgage volumes. Leeds plans shortly
to test the system by using a pool of its mortgages as collateral to raise
up to Pounds 100m from a small group of banks rather than through selling
securities in the public market.
The form of securitisation which the Leeds plans to undertake offers
societies another way of gaining access to wholesale markets. If more
societies approach the regulatory limits on their wholesale funding, this
might prove an attractive alternative form of funding.
By comparison, Germany and Denmark have long-established mortgage bond
markets through which mortgage banks can raise funds by issuing bonds which
are backed by their assets. In Germany, the Pfandbrief dates back to a
special decree by Frederick the Great in 1769, while in Denmark, the first
mortgage credit institutions were set up at the end of the 18th century to
meet the large financing needs after the great fire in Copenhagen in 1789.
Dr Helmut Scholz, management board member of Bayerische Vereinsbank, a
leading Bavarian mortgage bank, says Pfandbriefe are much safer than
mortgage-backed securities because they are issued on the basis of the
German mortgage bank act which ensures investor protection through a system
of stringent regulations.
Danish mortgage banks are also subject to strict regulations, says Lars
Rohde, management board member of Realkredit Danmark. For example, banks are
required to balance their lending and borrowing and they are not allowed to
take foreign exchange or interest rate risks.
Despite the high degree of investor protection and liquid secondary markets,
both German and Danish mortgage bonds trade at a fairly wide yield spread to
government bonds. The differential is thought to reflect the low take-up by
foreign investors and mortgage banks in both countries have recently been
publicising their bonds abroad in a bid to attract more foreign investment.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (11): Banks chase
new business - Syndicated loans, Tracy Corrigan sees signs of greater
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN

<TEXT>
The rapid evolution of the international bond markets in recent years has
encouraged more and more borrowers to tap the capital markets directly for
their core financing, forsaking the syndicated loans market.
However, after a decline in the volume of conventional syndicated credits
over a period of years, there are signs this decline is being reversed.
In 1993, international syndicated loans volume reached some Dollars 130bn,
according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's
Financial Market Trends, about Dollars 12bn higher than the previous year.
However, more than Dollars 60bn of that total consisted of refinancing of
existing debt, particularly by US companies, so the total volume of new
loans was Dollars 70bn, the lowest since 1986.
But the international bond markets place certain demands on borrowers: they
must generally have a relatively high credit rating, they cannot repay the
debt as and when they want to, and they must rely on the receptiveness of a
given market at a given time. For these and other reasons, direct bank
lending, syndicated or otherwise, still performs a number of vital
functions.
In addition, after suffering a squeeze on their capital, commercial banks
have shored up their balance sheets in the last few years, and are again
willing to commit capital to lending. Their capital/assets ratios have
improved, as levels of bad debt has declined and as old debt has matured.
Bond market weakness this year could help boost activity in the syndicated
loans market. In a bull market, it tends to be easier for lower-rated
borrowers to tap the market. In a bear market, they may be forced to return
to their banks for funding.
Other types of bank financing have been buoyant, in particular project
financing, which is often for large and risky infrastructure projects. This
allows companies, perhaps able to raise money in their own right, to isolate
themselves from liability to the debt, by securing the financing on the cash
flows created by the particular project.
For example, in the case of the Rayong refinery in Thailand, the key sponsor
was the Royal Dutch/Shell group with a 64 per cent stake, while the
Petroleum Authority of Thailand had a 36 per cent stake. Shell could easily
have tapped the international markets, but was able to obtain non-recourse
financing so it would not have to risk its balance sheet. The debt financing
of the Dollars 2.4bn project was made up of a Dollars 1.1bn facility. The
structure allowed the joint venture to take advantage of export credit
guarantees.
The dividing line between bank credit and bonds, as between so many other
markets, has become increasingly thin. For example, some bankers argue that
since many floating-rate note issues launched in Asia are placed directly
with banks, they are loans rather than bonds. The difference between a
floating rate note issue bought and barely traded by a number of banks and a
loan syndicated among the same banks, they say, is technical rather than
material. Increasingly, a knowledge of the bond and loan markets is needed.
'You need to know at what level the companies' bonds can be asset-swapped,
when you are pricing loans,' said Mr Alby Cator, head of syndicated loans at
NatWest Markets.
Although there is little sign of a net increase in volume, the greater
enthusiasm of banks for lending is revealed by a tightening of the spreads
over the London interbank offered rate at which loans are being agreed. Mr
Cator says the spread for a top-rate corporate borrower has tightened from
3/8 point over Libor a year ago to  1/4 point over Libor. 'We haven't yet
seen how low spread will go,' he warns.
Eighteen months ago, companies were borrowing at 45-50 basis points over
Libor. However, in April 1993, Reuters signed a Pounds 160m five-year
revolving credit with a margin of  3/8 point over Libor. Despite the
aggressive pricing, the deal was heavily oversubscribed, and increased from
its original size of Pounds 100m.
That deal was followed by a Pounds 150m revolving credit in May for Northern
Foods, with the same margin, which also was increased. Last month, W H Smith
raised Pounds 140m through a Pounds 140m revolving credit on the same terms
 -again oversubscribed. Bankers say that bilateral loans have been agreed at
tighter margins.
In March, Allied-Lyons raised Dollars 250m over six years at a margin of 30
basis points - but that was for a guarantee facility rather than a revolving
credit. In February, BTR Dunlop Finance agreed a three-year revolving credit
facility with a margin of 25 basis points. There is anecdotal evidence a
number of corporate treasurers are waiting to see if margins have further to
fall before coming to the market.
'There have been fewer big corporate deals than we would have expected,'
according to Mr Stan Hern, a director of Samuel Montagu. 'Some have held
off, expecting pricing to go down.' Generally, companies appear to be
borrowing less than in the last cycle, he added.
Meanwhile, there has been a resurgence of sovereign business. Most notably,
Spain signed a three-year revolving credit facility in September for Ecu5bn,
at a margin of just 7.5 basis points. The facility, designed to replace
lines from the central bank to the treasury, was heavily oversubscribed.
Because of the zero risk weighting of sovereign credits, which means that
whatever their credit rating banks do not have to put aside capital to meet
guidelines, the banks can afford slimmer margins.
While the syndicated loans market has yet to show a marked increase in
volume, the good news for borrowers is that banks are chasing what business
there is more aggressively. 'There are a lot of foreign banks with
operations in London that have to be paid for,' said one banker. 'The
maturity of asset portfolios means loss of income, so some banks are
desperate for assets, and that is pushing down prices.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (12): Drive and energy - Sao Paulo / Guide
for business visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo may not be the capital of Brazil, but it has all the swagger of
the country's most important industrial and financial centre, writes David
Pilling. Cosmopolitan, chic, frenzied and sometimes violent, Sao Paulo has
the hum of New York and the skyscrapers to match.
Outside Brazil, this city of 17m people does not enjoy the grand reputation
of Rio de Janeiro, and it certainly lacks the sea air and the fabulous
setting. But for many visitors, Sao Paulo has a drive and energy they find
appealing.
For all its immensity, Sao Paulo is not an unfriendly place. Non-Portuguese
speakers armed with a phrase book, a little Spanish or a knack for
gesticulation will find most Paulistas ready to help.
Because of the city's size and traffic snarl-ups, it can take considerable
time to get between appointments. Midnight traffic jams are not unknown. Try
to schedule meetings close to one another, bearing in mind that the city has
several centres.
Sao Paulo has a great night-life with bars, restaurants, music venues,
theatres and cinemas showing English-language films.
Without being paranoid, be on your guard and do not walk around aimlessly
after dark.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (13): Relaxed attitudes - Rio de Janeiro /
Guide for business visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Cariocas, as Rio de Janeiro residents are called, the beach is the soul
of the city, writes Patrick McCurry. Each beach has its own personality and
'crowd'. A swim before dusk, surrounded by Rio's spectacular scenery, is an
unforgettable experience.
But visitors should remember that those romantic sparkling lights coming
from the hills pinpoint the city's notorious favela shanty towns  - and that
robbing tourists, particularly in the Copacabana district, is a popular
beach activity.
Valuables such as cameras should not be displayed in the street, on the
beach or on buses. Taxis are generally safe but they often take the longest
route possible and at speeds usually not permitted outside Formula 1 racing
circuits. The tube system is reliable and secure.
Business visitors should not be surprised when meetings start late or
executives are informally dressed. This sometimes relaxed attitude is
counterbalanced by the Cariocas' strengths: quick and creative thinking.
Away from the beach, visitors can take an electric train to the Corcovado
peak, site of the famous statue of Christ, or a cable car to Sugar Loaf
Mountain for an aerial view of the city's beauty.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (10): A new farming elite is emerging - The
agriculture sector has been transformed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian agriculture is learning to support itself. Despite cuts in
government aid, lower import tariffs and general economic instability, the
1993-94 cereals harvest is expected by the Ministry of Agriculture to be a
record 74m tonnes.
Part of the reason for the success has been a number of impressive
productivity gains in the past decade, mainly on the back of government
investment in the 1970s.
Now that the government has largely withdrawn from the sector a new farming
elite is emerging, often represented by large agro-industrial companies or
export-oriented producers that can compete in world markets.
However, some economists worry that the free market shake-up is leading to
smaller and less efficient producers being condemned to subsistence farming
and that more workers are being forced to abandon the land and end up
swelling Brazil's shanty towns.
'Only the highly efficient producers will survive,' declares Mr Jose Carlos
Duarte da Conceicao, president of the Coplan co-operative in Campinas, 60
miles from Sao Paulo.
The co-operative, which represents 538 coffee and cotton producers and has
annual gross sales of Dollars 18m, encourages the use of fertilisers,
high-yielding seeds and automation to increase its members' productivity.
Coffee yields are 20 bags (60kg each) a hectare, compared with a national
average of eight bags, says Mr Conceicao.
The transformation during the past decade is striking, he says, recalling
his arrival at the co-operative 10 years ago when government subsidies were
still flowing: 'It was ridiculously corrupt. People were taking the money
and spending it on anything except farming. Today, the industry has become
much more professional.'
This growing professionalism largely began in the 1980s with the phasing out
of government subsidies.
It was followed by a general reduction of other government support to
farmers - sparked by Brazil's financial crisis - which included cuts in
agricultural loans and purchases of excess stocks.
One of the most outstanding examples of improved productivity concerns soya.
While the planted area of soya in the past decade has increased only
slightly, to about 10m hectares, production has soared from 15m to 23m
tonnes, reports Conab, a government agricultural agency.
The productivity gains, according to Professor Guilherme Leite, an
agricultural economist, were made possible by government investment in the
1970s in new seeds and agricultural technology tailored to a semi-tropical
climate, and by the opening up of the vast terrains of the central and
western states such as Mato Grosso.
Today, Brazil is the world's second-largest soya exporter after the US and
the leading exporter of orange juice, another crop that was hardly
cultivated 25 years ago. This crop evolution continues a historic pattern.
The Portuguese colonisers planted sugar cane in the north-east, which was
later supplanted by coffee in the state of Sao Paulo. Soya has now become by
far the most important crop in Brazil.
Soya earns Brazil more than Dollars 3bn a year and accounts for some 40 per
cent of agricultural exports, with coffee and orange juice earning about
Dollars 1bn each. While Brazil is still the world's biggest coffee exporter,
its importance, however, has declined significantly since the early 1950s
when it represented the vast majority of agricultural exports. Last year,
coffee accounted for just 16 per cent.
Similarly, because of Brazil's industrialisation, agriculture has declined
dramatically in its importance to the economy, shrinking from about half of
gross domestic product 40 years ago to 13 per cent today, according to Mr
Leite.
But today's agricultural sector is often highly competitive thanks to low
production costs, says Mr Andre Pessoa of consultants MB Associados. He
highlights the growth in exports of processed chickens, which benefit from
low costs for land, labour and feed.
'Californian chickens receive large subsidies and we get none and yet we are
still competitive in world markets,' says Mr Pessoa.
But some other products are less competitive. With the lowering of tariffs,
Brazil has become an importer of crops such as wheat. Economists say this is
because wheat is highly subsidised by the US and European Union and also
because countries such as Argentina have better soils for wheat production.
Mr Pedro de Camargo, president of the Brazilian Rural Society, a producers'
association, complains that while Brazil has lowered or eliminated import
tariffs and subsidies, the rest of the world has not. 'We are being taken
for a ride and we don't have the political clout to insist on changes by the
US and Europe,' he says, claiming that the Uruguay round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks will not benefit Brazilian agriculture.
The losers under Brazil's move to a more professional system are those
producers left behind by the technological advances, which includes large
parts of the poor north-east of Brazil as well as sugar cane workers in the
state of Sao Paulo. This process has sparked a strong migration of rural
workers to the shanty towns in the past decade.
Mr Lus Inacio, presidential candidate Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers
Party, intends to institute a thorough agricultural reform and find land for
up to three million landless families. But any changes will first have to
overcome the powerful landowners' lobby in Congress.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (9): Faded at the edges - Brasilia / Guide
for business visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's futuristic capital, laid out in the shape of a giant aeroplane and
symbolically placed at the country's centre, is beginning to look a little
faded at the edges, writes Angus Foster. The seat of government since 1960,
Brasilia is merging in with the surrounding plateau, but it is still a city
without a past and with very shallow roots.
Most visitors only go to Brasilia for work - nearly all government
departments and foreign embassies are here - and as a working environment it
is pleasant. There are few traffic jams and it is usually easy to arrange
meetings with government departments quickly.
There are regular flights from Sao Paulo and Rio although they can get
booked up on Fridays - when many people leave Brasilia - and on Mondays,
when they return.
The Congress building at the end of the 'esplanade' of government ministries
dominates the city and when Congress is sitting it is invariably being
lobbied by an interest group of some sort.
At night, Brasilia often appears very quiet. In fact, it contains some
reasonable restaurants and bars, but they are often a long way from the
hotel district in residential areas.
For those caught in the city over a weekend, Brasilia can be a soulless
place. One option is to hire a car and drive two hours west to the sleepy
historical town of Pirenopolis.
Alternatively, over a long weekend, visit the River Araguaia region further
west.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (8): Privatisation
the driving force - Some record offerings are likely to come to the market
in a year or so / International equities, Tracy Corrigan says business is
holding up well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business in the international equities market has held up well this year, in
the face of weaker domestic stock markets and volatile interest rate
conditions.
In the first quarter, the volume of new international equity issues reached
Dollars 11.6bn, according to Euromoney, well above last year's first quarter
total of just over Dollars 5bn.
However, last year's bumper volume of Dollars 36.5bn was weighted towards
the second half of the year, as the strong performance of stock markets
encouraged a number of governments to push ahead with privatisation
programmes.
This year, although the types of new issues remain diverse - ranging from
secondary offerings of common stock, to global depositary receipts and
initial public offerings - privatisation is the driving force, particularly
in Europe.
The poor performance of emerging markets in Asia and Latin America this year
has hit business in those areas hardest, though some analysts believe issues
from these regions now offer better value.
The increase in volume also reflects a growing trend towards structuring
equity offerings as international rather than domestic deals, as
institutional investors continue to increase their allocation of assets
overseas.
'We still have a bigger pipeline of business than we did this time last
year,' said Mr John St John, a director of Kleinwort Benson.
However, the worsening of conditions in the stock market has made investors
much more sensitive to pricing: increasingly, issuers are being told to
price their deals attractively or stay out of the market.
Despite the need to price new issues more cheaply the flow of deals has not
abated. This is because many governments which have embarked upon
privatisation programmes are not in a position to wait for conditions to
improve.
'Basically, governments around the the world are burdened with a big debt
problem, an ageing population and a social services superstructure which
they can no longer pay for out of taxes,' says Mr St John. 'It's not just
that they want to make their companies more efficient: they have to sell off
assets to pay for it all.'
As a result, some record offerings are likely to come to the market in the
next year or so, for example from Germany, where Deutsche Telekom and
Lufthansa are expected to be put on the block.
The Deutsche Telekom deal, which is likely to take more than a year to come
to market, is expected to be the largest equity offering to date, with
estimates in the range of DM25bn.
The Swedish government recently announced its largest privatisation
offering: it is selling SKr 10bn of shares in Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals
group - or 32.5 per cent of the company.
Other European countries which still have slates full of privatisation
issues include Italy, Austria and Spain.
'There is, waiting in the wings, an enormous amount of privatisation
business,' which will not be halted by the more demanding market conditions,
according to Mr David Freud, vice-chairman of Warburg International. 'There
is too much political goodwill invested in the programmes.'
At the same time as governments are privatising state companies, they are
acting to relax capital raising controls on non-state companies.
In Austria, where the privatisation programme is being accelerated, the
taxation rules have been changed to make it more attractive for companies to
issue paper. For example, Mayer Melnhof, a private company, recently brought
a Dollars 300m offering.
Liberalisation of controls has been particularly evident in some Asian
countries, such as India, where business has been particularly active. The
strength of Asian stock markets helped issues from the area to soar last
year, but the market has since become far more selective.
Deals now have to be priced attractively to attract institutional investors.
The postponement of a planned Dollars 1bn issue for Videsh Sanchar Nigam
(VSNL), the state-controlled international telecommunications monopoly by
the Indian government, which would not lower a price considered too high by
fund managers, reflects the new mood. But many governments are likely to
decide that they would rather accept a slightly lower price for their assets
than wait for the market to turn.
Deals which are attractively priced can still be oversubscribed: Tele
Danmark, the Danish state monopoly telecommunications operator, met strong
demand for its sale of 48.3 per cent of its shares yesterday, worth around
Dollars 3bn.
But US investors are proving particularly selective: several underwriters
reported poor US demand for the French privatisation issue for UAP, the
insurance company, blaming the pricing and the surplus of financial services
deals.
Meanwhile, the pace of issuance by US companies - both initial public
offerings and secondary offerings - has slackened somewhat.
'I would characterise it as a buyer's market rather than a seller's market,'
said Mr Ludovico del Balzo, a managing director of Lehman Brothers.
Meanwhile, as the long-term trend towards greater diversification of assets
is set to continue, the use of international equity offerings is likely to
become increasingly important. In countries such as China, India, and
Brazil, the rash of deals launched last year has barely scratched the
surface of these huge markets.
But in the short term, bankers are learning to tone down their promises to
potential issuers.
'In terms of supply, it will be pretty sustained - the key is to make sure
that deals come to market at reasonable levels,' Mr del Balzo warns. 'I
don't think there is a frenzy of irrationality. In general, people are
becoming more realistic.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (9): The tail still
wags the dog - Derivatives, Tracy Corrigan discusses one bright patch in the
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While conditions have worsened significantly in most markets this year,
there is at least one bright patch: the derivatives market. The growth of
the exchange-traded market in futures and options and the over-the-counter
market in swaps and options shows no sign of abating. In fact, the world's
futures exchanges experienced record volume in the first quarter, as
dealers, treasurers and investors used futures to try to hedge or reposition
themselves, after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates.
The reason for the continued activity in the derivatives market, while
activity in some other areas has dropped off, is partly that derivative
instruments can be used to take bearish as well as bullish positions, so
there is no logical reason why activity should slide in a bear market. Also,
derivatives can be used to trade volatility, so volume tends to rise when
market conditions are volatile.
However, the high level of activity in derivatives this year has had some
negative impact, most notably by re-arousing fears that the world's
financial markets are now driven by derivative rather than cash market
trading - or, as is often said, the tail is wagging the dog. These fears
were repeatedly voiced in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, when
stock index futures were blamed by some observers for precipitating or
exacerbating declines.
However, the fact that bond losses in the first quarter of 1994 were first
seen in the futures markets can also be explained by the greater liquidity
of futures, relative to cash markets. Some investors and traders, though,
undoubtedly had their fingers burnt, having taken aggressive positions in
the futures markets.
'Overall, the amount of business in derivatives markets continues to grow at
a healthy rate,' said Steve Smith, an executive director of Swiss Bank
Corporation. 'Unfortunately, towards the end of last year a number of
proprietary institutions - banks and hedge funds and some traditional
investors - had built up large speculative positions, mainly in bonds, to a
level which the market place had never seen before. The unwinding of these
positions led to a short-term diminution in some areas of activity. However,
the ongoing use of derivatives for traditional fund management and for risk
management on the treasury side is growing in leaps and bounds.'
According to the International Swaps Dealers Association, the notional
amount of over-the-counter swaps outstanding is about Dollars 4,500bn. The
OTC market has generally been the forum for greatest innovation, developing
exotic options such as knock-out options, which reduce the cost to the end
user. Some futures exchanges are trying to adapt products from the
over-the-counter market, so that they can offer standardised contracts which
have some of the flexibility of the OTC market. For example, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange has introduced Flex options, which allow standard
contracts to be adjusted to individual needs.
The swap market used to be closely linked to the new-issues market, but is
now increasingly used by companies on an ongoing basis, for treasury
management.
However, some heavy losses by corporate treasury departments using
derivatives has turned off some companies, and could create a more difficult
environment for banks marketing these instruments. Germany's
Metallgesellschaft had to be rescued by its banks when a trading subsidiary
incurred estimated losses of Dollars 1bn on oil derivatives, the largest in
a series of losses by companies such as Allied Lyons and Showa Shell.
Perhaps even more worrying for banks, Procter &amp; Gamble recently threatened
legal action against Bankers Trust, after it took an after-tax loss of
Dollars 100m on swaps sold by Bankers Trust. While the legal grounds for
such a claim remains shaky, the floating of the notion that banks are
irresponsibly marketing risky instruments is damaging, even if it cannot be
made to stick.
Such developments are likely to attract further scrutiny from regulators,
many of whom have already expressed concern about the potential knock-on
effects of problems in the derivatives market. Although a number of reports
by regulatory authorities such as the Bank of England have adopted a fairly
conciliatory tone, there are still calls for regulators to tighten up on
derivatives use, or at least to force greater disclosure.
The latest warnings have come from the US General Accounting Office, which
said in a report that inadequate regulation of the derivatives markets poses
a threat to the US and international financial system. The report is
expected to increase pressure for legislation to control the markets.
The industry has made some efforts to put its house in order, by tightening
control standards. The Group of Thirty report on derivatives in 1993 set
strict guidelines. Further, US banks such as Citibank have led the way in
giving fuller details of their derivatives exposure.
Closer scrutiny by regulators and a spate of losses due to poor controls
have undoubtedly succeeded in concentrating the minds of bankers at board
level, some of whom had risen through the ranks in a pre-derivatives era.
The rapid expansion of the derivatives market has forged stronger links
between markets. The notional amount of futures contracts traded annually on
world exchanges is around Dollars 140,000bn. In many cases, futures markets,
with standardised contracts and centralised clearing, are more liquid than
the underlying cash markets, and tend to drive cash prices up and down. For
example, volume in FT-SE 100 index futures on the London International
Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) is two and a half times the
stock market's turnover.
The most active futures contracts are traded in the dealing pits of
exchanges, but some contracts, particularly options contracts, have
successfully shifted to electronic trading. The battle between traditional
open-outcry trading and electronic screen-based trading is likely to take
some time to resolve.
However, Globex, the 24-hour futures trading system jointly developed by
Reuters, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, has
achieved disappointing volume.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (10): Cash haven
lures investors - Commercial paper, the ECP market is thriving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The volatility which has plagued the government bond markets across the
world since the US Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in
February has increased the attraction of the Euro commercial paper (ECP)
market.
The prospect of higher interest rates in the US, and uncertainty over the
long-term direction of UK rates, has prompted fixed-income investors to
shift the balance of their portfolios away from long-dated instruments to
the very short end of the yield curve, analysts say.
The short maturities available in the ECP market, from one day to 364 days,
appeal in particular to investors who are looking for a safe haven to
deposit their cash until the conditions in the bond and equity markets
improve. This defensive investment strategy is expected to keep outstandings
in the ECP market at their present high levels for most of this year.
'The ECP market is looking healthy and there is strong demand from investors
for good-quality paper,' says Ms Julie Joe, CP product manager at Lehman
Brothers.
According to Lehman Brothers, the total combined ECP and Euronote market
outstandings increased Dollars 2bn during the first quarter of 1994 from
Dollars 110bn in the last quarter of 1993 to Dollars 112bn, of which the
total ECP outstandings account for Dollars 81bn. In the same period, the
USCP outstandings increased by the same proportion from Dollars 560bn to
Dollars 570bn.
Although the ECP market is much smaller than the USCP market, its
competitive rates are attracting a growing number of US issuers. Mr David
Knight, managing director of CP operations at BZW, says that rates in the
two markets have been coming closer together and that in recent months ECP
rates have consistently been five basis points cheaper than in the USCP
market. He adds that the ECP market also offers US issuers a tax-efficient
way of funding their European operations.
Another factor which is increasing the attraction of the ECP market is
renewed confidence in its ability to provide quick access to short-term
liquidity. Question marks over its liquidity and efficiency were eliminated
last June when Denmark raised as much as Dollars 1.5bn in a matter of days
to support the Danish krone when it came under attack from foreign exchange
speculators.
Since then, the size of ECP programmes has increased steadily. Ford Credit
Europe, Hanson and Guinness have been able to raise funds of more than
Dollars 1bn, amounts which have previously been the sole domain of sovereign
borrowers. Other high-profile ECP programmes include Dollars 1bn for Bankers
Trust New Zealand and Dollars 500m for PowerGen, the UK's second largest
electricity generation company.
'Now corporates are able to access the market in excess of Dollars 1bn,'
says Mr Knight. He adds that this development will facilitate any needs in
the corporate sector to fund short-term working capital requirements,
especially now that inhospitable conditions in the primary markets
discourage the launch of bond issues.
Six or seven large programmes are expected to emerge over the next few
months from a variety of European and US borrowers, including corporates,
banks and quasi-sovereign entities, analysts say. The inroads which the ECP
market has made into the German and Swiss domestic markets as a result of
deregulation in the two countries have also contributed to the increased
volume. Issuers can now issue in D-Marks and Swiss francs directly under
their ECP programmes.
There are also signs that European issuers are looking to raise funds in the
US. In April, the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, the second largest
pension scheme in the UK, became the first one outside the US to obtain
credit ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, the two leading
international ratings agencies, in order to access the USCP market.
Mr Brian Matthews, finance director of ESN Pension Management Group, said
that one of the main benefits of the rating was that the scheme's US
investment property company, Eastern Realty Investment Corporation, was able
to raise Dollars 105m in the USCP market at an average interest rate of less
than 3.5 per cent.
This financing route provided two advantages to the scheme, he said. First,
it was tax-efficient because the scheme did not have tax-exempt status in
the US. Second, if the scheme had lent the funds to the US subsidiary, it
would have had to give up a return which was much higher than the interest
rate which the US company was paying.
Despite the higher profile the ECP market enjoys, several factors could
hinder progress. The need to have a high-quality rating is the main obstacle
facing potential issuers. At present investors tend to be conservative and
restrict themselves to the best-rated paper.
As a result of this black-and-white attitude to credit ratings, many issuers
with mediocre ratings have difficulty raising significant sums in the ECP
market. By contrast, they have good access to the US domestic market.
Mr Knight points to another negative development - the largest ECP investor
segment, the French Sicav money market funds, have been reducing their
holdings of ECP to comply with regulations laid down by the Commission des
Operations de Bourse, the French stock market authorities, that Sicavs can
hold only a maximum of 10 per cent of assets in unregulated instruments such
as ECP.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (8): Roller-coaster - The stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Sao Paulo brokers attribute a 10 per cent fall on the stock exchange to
sadness over the death of Ayrton Senna, Brazil's much-loved racing-car
driver, one knows one is dealing with a volatile market.
Indeed, investors - who saw real gains of more than 100 per cent last year -
have had a rough ride in 1994. Sao Paulo's Bovespa index, after climbing by
a real 50 per cent in January, has since nosedived. By the second week of
May, gains had been wiped out and the index was down 9 per cent on the 1993
close.
Even the chairman of Bovespa, Mr Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, cannot disguise the
market's roller-coaster nature. 'We will have a very volatile year. I
probably shouldn't say that, but I have to be honest,' he says.
An inflation rate edging above 45 per cent a month is the prime culprit,
exaggerating sentiment and distorting indexes. 'When you have inflation like
this, you lose the focus of the exact value of things,' says Mr Vidigal.
In addition, 1994 is an election year, never a particularly stable time in
Brazil, and investors - particularly foreigners - are nervous about the
prospect of presidential victory for Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, the
left-wing front-runner.
Conclusion of a Brady-style debt restructuring deal in April was not enough
to calm markets, particularly as it came when US interest rates were nosing
upwards. Optimism over a plan to crack inflation has been dulled by
political wrangling in Congress.
None of this had stemmed foreign inflows, which last year reached a record
net Dollars 5.5bn, and were at Dollars 1.54bn by the end of March, the
latest figures available. Foreign investors in Brazilian equities, entering
under recently liberalised legislation, face no withholding tax on capital
gains and no minimum repatriation period. There is a 15 per cent tax on
dividends. According to Mr Vidigal, capital stays in Brazil for an average
five months.
Relative to the size of the economy, the stock exchange is still small with
a market capitalisation of around Dollars 80bn - it had peaked at Dollars
130bn - about 18 per cent of gross domestic product. Brazilian markets have
a daily turnover of more than Dollars 200m, of which 18 per cent represents
foreign participation against less than 8 per cent in 1992. Sao Paulo's
exchange accounts for 85-90 per cent of trading, with Rio being the
second-biggest market.
Three-quarters of trading in 541 listed stocks is concentrated in just 10,
mainly state-controlled, stocks. Telebras, the state telephone company,
accounts for nearly 40 per cent.
Mr Julius Haupt Buchenrode, director of investments at Banco Chase
Manhattan, expects foreign flows to continue, regardless of the outcome of
elections. 'The main reason for inflows is the perception that the country
will do what all the other Latin American countries have done already -
restructure the economy, reduce inflation and set the preconditions for
sustained growth,' he says.
Mr Isaac Michaan, managing partner of Brazilian broker Vertice, is also
optimistic. He points to price earnings ratios of about 12 times, much lower
than most other Latin American exchanges, and to prices at an average book
value of 70 per cent. Some well-managed companies are traded at only a
quarter of book value, he says.
Very cheap shares may provide bargains for investors, but do little to
persuade new companies to come to market. 'With very high inflation and
cheap prices, there have been very few new issues,' says Mr Vidigal.
In any case, few companies are in need of fresh capital. A decade of
economic stagnation has left idle industrial capacity of about 30 per cent,
according to Mr Buchenrode. Those companies that do want cash have found it
more convenient to look abroad; last year there were Dollars 7.6bn in
Eurobond issues, against Dollars 4.8bn the year before.
The long-term success of Brazil's equity markets depends on the crushing of
inflation, according to Mr Vidigal. As well as reducing volatility, the
resulting sharp drop in real interest rates would mean billions of dollars
currently invested in fixed-income funds would be switched to equities.
Further privatisations will also be important. Mr Vidigal says Dollars 7bn
has so far been raised and he estimates there is another Dollars 40bn in
potential state sell-offs, but he does not expect any 'very exciting
progress' until after the elections.
Presidential candidate Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso is committed to further
privatisations, but Mr da Silva is far more equivocal. Even if Mr Cardoso is
elected, Mr Vidigal does not foresee rapid movement on politically sensitive
companies such as Telebras.
Mr Buchenrode of Chase prefers to look further ahead. 'Short-term
predictions are very dangerous,' he says. But, in the long-term, he is
bullish.
'We are betting on restructuring. We don't know how long it will take, or
when the gains will come.' When it does happen, though, he is confident that
those who have weathered the storm will not regret their tenacity.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (7): Motor to recovery - The car industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian car sales are booming, but domestic producers and importers of
foreign models are bickering over how to share the spoils.
The industry, dominated by Brazilian subsidiaries of the world's leading
carmakers, was the motor to general economic recovery last year. It was
kick-started by a price-cutting pact between government, manufacturers and
unions, and by opening up the long-protected sector to foreign competition.
Domestic output, which was floundering at 914,000 units in 1990, has
recovered strongly, growing 30 per cent last year to reach a record 1.39m
units. First quarter output this year rose a further 34 per cent to 368,000
units. Brazil, now the world's tenth-biggest vehicle manufacturer, has
recaptured from Mexico the position of top Latin American producer.
The threat of imports, combined with better market conditions, has led to
big improvements in productivity. At Autolatina, a joint venture between
Volkswagen and Ford, productivity in terms of man-hours per car has jumped
50 per cent since 1990, matching similar gains at the other two domestic
manufacturers, Fiat and General Motors. However, analysts say the industry
is still a long way behind productivity in more advanced industrial
countries.
Meanwhile, car imports, for years blocked by prohibitive tariffs, have risen
from virtually zero in 1990 to 67,000 units last year, nearly 6 per cent of
market share. Over that period, import tariffs have fallen from 85 to 35 per
cent and are due to drop to 20 per cent later this year. Domestic carmakers,
fearful of a potential onslaught of imports, have called for quotas aimed at
restricting vehicle imports for seven years to percentages ranging from 3.5
to 7. 'Quotas would be a temporary measure to give us time to face
international competition,' says Mr Ivan Fonseca e Silva, vice-president for
business and legal affairs at Autolatina.
Mr Jose Carlos da Pinheiro Neto, corporate affairs director at General
Motors do Brasil, says it is not feasible to leap directly from full
protection to taking on imports from more competitive countries, some of
which he accuses of dumping cheap cars on the Brazilian market. 'It's like a
kid. You keep it locked in a room and then you open the door with no kind of
restrictions,' he says.
Brazilian carmakers also argue that foreign competition has not been the
crucial element in revving up the industry. They point to price-cutting
agreements in which the government slashed vehicle sales tax, unions curbed
wage demands and industry cut profit margins as the main factors behind
steeply rising sales.
The tripartite pact has cut average car prices by 30 per cent in real terms
and those of the so-called 'popular' car (with engines of less than 1000cc)
by 46 per cent. The price of Autolatina's basic Gol, for example, has come
down to Dollars 7,200 from Dollars 13,000 two years ago.
Increased sales have prompted big investment projects. General Motors will
have spent Dollars 1bn on adding new production lines in the five years to
1995 and is considering starting a third plant. Autolatina intends to spend
Dollars 2.2bn in the next three years, modernising its production lines.
Both companies are taking advantage of the proposed Mercosul common market
to rationalise production between their Brazilian and Argentine plants.
Some foreign manufacturers, attracted by Brazil's huge growth potential, are
also contemplating direct investments. Nissan do Brasil is weighing up the
possibility of building a Dollars 3bn fully-automated plant to produce
popular cars and possibly pick-ups, according to Mr Luiz Carlos Sollitto de
Oliveira, general manager. A final decision will await the outcome of
October's presidential elections and signs of greater government policy
consistency, he says.
Nissan has identified Brazil as potentially one of the world's most
lucrative markets. There are 11.4 Brazilians per vehicle, compared with 5.7
Argentines, 2.3 Japanese and 1.3 North Americans. Sustained growth, or
access to credit - almost impossible with near hyperinflation - could send
sales spiralling. Nissan expects total sales to reach 165,000, with a
potential foreign share of 13 per cent, next year.
Importers reject industry arguments that they threaten Brazilian jobs. The
vehicle industry employs 120,000 workers, with knock-on benefits for
thousands of others. Foreign manufacturers say imports have created more
jobs than they have destroyed as well as contributing Dollars 700m in taxes
last year.
Rivalry is bound to continue, something to which domestic manufacturers are
reconciled. 'We will have more competition,' says Mr Robert Rennard, chief
operating officer at Autolatina. 'I'm not particularly concerned as long as
they play by the same rules: as long as there's a level playing field,' he
says.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (6): Cruel contrasts - Social affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil is a country of cruel social contrasts: from the Manhattan-style
skyscrapers of Sao Paulo's financial district to the poverty of parts of the
north-east, which can rival sub-Saharan Africa.
While the country is one of the world's largest agricultural exporters, many
millions of people are thought to go hungry. While developing a first world
banking system to cope with the country's chronic inflation, more than half
the population earns too little to open an account. 'Capitalism in Brazil
only works for 20 per cent of the population, the rest live on the margins,'
says Mr Herbert de Souza, a sociologist and the driving force behind a
successful anti-hunger campaign.
The 'Citizen's Action' campaign led by Mr de Souza won the support of
millions of Brazilians, from managing directors to shop assistants, in
providing basic foodstuffs to the extremely poor. Now, he wants to broaden
the campaign, which is administered by local volunteer committees, to fight
for jobs, health, education and land reform.
It is a tough challenge. Brazil has one of the most unequal wealth
distributions in the world - the poorest fifth of the population receive
about 2 per cent of the income. Brazil has not even experienced the limited
land reforms of countries such as Mexico.
The plight of the rural poor has led to massive urbanisation since the 1950s
and the springing up of 'favela' shanty towns around cities.
Taquaril is a favela on the eastern outskirts of Belo Horizonte, a city of
2m in the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais. Taquaril was originally built
by the local council to house 1,800 families in 1987. That number has now
more than doubled following unofficial occupation of nearby land by
desperate newcomers. Some of the homes are built of cardboard and tarpaulin
and perch precariously on geologically unsafe hillsides. Many lack
electricity and most are without proper sanitation.
Before a regular bus service was introduced, residents who worked in the
city centre often faced a four-hour walk home. Youngsters ended up sleeping
in the centre and drifting into crime, says Mr Walter Gomes de Sanson,
leader of a recently-created community association.
Another resident, Mr Paulo Roberto Martins, arrived in Taquaril with his
family six years ago because, he says, he could not survive on the
agricultural wages paid in the Gov Valadares area, 450km north-east of Belo
Horizonte. He now works as a concierge, earning about Dollars 100 a month.
'I'm lucky I have a job,' he says.
Shanty town residents are among the most extreme signs of Brazil's
marginalised population; a huge underclass with little access to proper
health care, education or other public services.
They are victims of a state that tries to do too much and ends up doing too
little, according to Dr Antonio Carlos Gomes da Silva, superintendent of Sao
Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas, the largest hospital in Latin America with
nearly 2,000 beds.
Mr da Silva criticises the 1988 constitution, drawn up after more than two
decades of military governments. The constitution places heavy
responsibilities on the federal government for provision of services but
does not say where the resources will come from.
Mr da Silva, along with many business leaders, believes Brazil's low tax
base should be widened and the tax system simplified. He also wants measures
taken to reduce fraud in the health service as well as productivity
contracts with employees.
Funding problems for public health are made worse by a complicated system,
involving transfers of revenues from the federal government to the states
and municipalities and by a shortage of hospital beds in some regions. This
means the government must pay private hospitals to treat public sector
patients, creating rich territory for overcharging and corruption.
Analysts say the underfunding of the public health service is a critical
problem and government spending per capita fell from Dollars 80 in 1989 to
Dollars 44 in 1992, according to the Ministry of Health.
In public education, funding is also a problem and the sector is, like
health, dominated by low salaries and frequent strikes.
However, Brazil has made large progress in providing basic education in
recent decades.
In 1950, about a third of seven- to 14-year-olds had access to public
education. By 1990, that had risen to 88 per cent. However, the problem has
been that many pupils do not complete primary education and, as with all
Brazilian social indicators, regional differences are extremely marked. For
example, in Alagoas state in the north-east, the illiteracy rate is 45 per
cent, compared with 9 per cent for the wealthy south eastern state of Rio
Grande do Sul.
Mr Jose Goldemberg, an academic and former education minister, notes that
the state spends an average Dollars 300 a pupil in basic education, compared
to several thousand dollars per student in public universities. 'In every
country the elite takes care of its own,' he says.
Brazil's fragmented political system means that no single party can control
Congress and that strong economic interests, ranging from landowners to
government-owned companies, have entrenched positions in Congress and can
block reforms.
But Mr de Souza, while admitting he is often dismayed by the antics of
politicians, believes that there has been a new awareness of the country's
problems, as shown by the reaction to the anti-hunger campaign.
'The elite has not yet noticed this change but it exists, and is being
expressed through non-governmental organisations, grass roots groups and
progressive local councils,' he says.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (7): The fire has
been doused - Are dragon bonds doomed to obscurity?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dragon bonds set south-east Asia's debt markets alight last year: issuers as
diverse as Abbey National and China launched some USDollars 3bn worth of
bonds and some bankers found the paper easy to place.
Now, the fire appears to have been doused. Mandates languish in bankers'
desks and investors holding the once coveted Beijing issue have seen spreads
widen to 125 basis points over US treasuries from 88 basis points at launch.
Some argue that bad timing and lack of liquidity will consign dragon bonds
to the mythical status of the creatures after which they are named. Others
say it is a lull, predicting that China will be able to tap investors again
for capital.
'We believe the dragon bond market is about to balloon. It has been held up
because of the US treasury markets,' says Mr Chris Nicholas, senior
vice-president with Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong.
The US investment bank has been by far the most active bookrunner in a
league table dominated by American banks.
Since the Asian Development Bank's first issue in December 1991 some
USDollars 4.6bn has been raised through dragon bonds, which are priced,
launched and syndicated in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) and listed in at
least two of the three centres - Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan.
Some landmarks stand out - the USDollars 300m five-year dragon bond launched
by General Electric Capital Corporation, the first corporate to test the
waters, and the 10-year money raised by China.
By issuing dragon bonds issuers can tap a healthy vein of demand that was
previously frustrated at being left with the crumbs of eurobond issues:
successful deals were fully taken up in London by the time Asian investors
awoke, leaving them just the less popular issues.
Not all bankers share Lehman's enthusiasm for dragon bonds. One syndicate
manager notes: 'Coming to Asia to extract five basis points over and above
what a fair market price would be in Europe is irresponsible tourism.'
He offers a more regional role for the market: a forum for local investors
to meet local borrowers, where a single A rating (or no rating at all) is
not the leper's bell it might be in Frankfurt or London.
Economic conditions in Asia - fast growth and big demand for financing
(total costs of upgrading basic infrastructure have been estimated at
USDollars 1,000bn) - support the call for a specific Asian bond market.
'When the time comes that Asian currencies or targeted transactions offer
the best funding, that's the time when the dragon market will really shine,'
says one banker.
For its proponents, the existence of an Asian market is part of the
globalisation of capital markets, rather than an alternative to global
issues. It is the natural market for borrowers who may not have a presence
in Europe, for example, but who wish to tap American and Asian investors.
Mr Nicholas says: 'A lot of people are advocates of global markets, which
have definitely started and increased quite dramatically in the last six
months or so, but not every institution needs to come to the market and
borrow USDollars 1bn. We have many projects right now in Asia where they
need financing of US200m to USDollars 300m. That's a perfect fit for the
dragon bond market.'
However, the market has been shunned by local corporates. Companies in Hong
Kong (traditionally cash-rich and without credit ratings) have steered
clear, preferring to issue eurobonds and convertible bonds.
That Hong Kong corporates will continue to tap international investors is
signalled by ambitious expansion plans (chiefly in China) and by the fact
that companies such as Wharf Holdings and Swire Pacific have secured credit
agency ratings.
Wharf, the conglomerate with interests spanning property, ports, cable TV
and telecommunications, became the first to secure a rating earlier this
year. The company was also among the first to raise money overseas in a bond
issue in June last year.
The triple-A-rated GECC has returned to the dragon bond market twice since
its 1992 debut, raising a further USDollars 350m in three-year paper; and
Intelsat has followed China to become the second issuer of a 10-year issue.
By far the bulk of offerings has been on a fixed-rate basis, although in the
first quarter this year the sums raised in floating-rate bonds exceeded that
in fixed rate issues.
If more companies and sovereign borrowers take up the baton as bond markets
revive, bankers say new fire will be breathed into the dragon bond market.
But as an embryonic market it still has far to go.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (6): Caution the
watchword after wake-up call - 'Some levels of asset prices during 1993 were
based on a hope and a prayer' / Investors in the secondary debt market need
to be more discerning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During last year's raging bull run, you could buy almost any emerging market
debt instrument and make a substantial profit. However, amid the uncertain
US interest rate outlook and with general elections in several developing
nations looming, that performance will be hard to match this year, and
investors will need to be a great deal more discerning if they are to ride
the secondary debt market successfully.
Prices for emerging market debt were driven to dizzy heights in 1993 on a
wave of foreign capital attracted by double-digit returns and improving
domestic conditions in many developing countries, where political and
economic reforms were beginning to pay off. The rally soon attracted
increasingly indiscriminate buyers - including highly leveraged speculators
 -who helped push price levels that proved unsustainable.
'Some of the gains were purely liquidity-driven,' says Marc Wenhammar, head
of fixed income at Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets. Especially in some
of the non-performing debt markets, 'the price appreciation didn't really
correspond with fundamentals - it was pure speculation,' he says.
'To be honest, some levels of asset prices last year were based on a hope
and a prayer,' echoes Peter West, economic adviser at West Merchant Bank in
London.
J P Morgan's Brady bond index surged 44.17 per cent last year. West Merchant
Bank's secondary debt index, which, besides Brady bonds, includes the
commercial debt of countries which have not yet completed the Brady
restructuring process, rose by 63.6 per cent.
When the inevitable wake-up call came - in the form of US interest rate
tightening in February - it sent emerging bond markets plunging in a
sell-off exacerbated by panic-selling from hedge funds and other leveraged
players.
Domestic woes, including the assassination in late March of Mexican
presidential candidate Donaldo Colosio, put further downward pressure on
prices. In the first four months of 1994, WMB's index shed about 23.5 per
cent.
While the slump was across-the-board in nature, it varied in magnitude, with
the non-performing assets particularly badly hit. This is a mirror image of
last year's developments, when the prices of such instruments were driven up
sharply in anticipation of debt restructuring deals, says Mr West. With
little or no current yield, these assets had no support during the market
sell-off, as exemplified by Peru, Russia and Panama. In the first four
months of the year, the price of Peru's Citibank loans plunged by 41.7 per
cent, Russian Vneshekonombank debt sagged by 45.5 per cent and Panama's US
dollar loans fell by 32.7 per cent.
'Both the surge in inflows in 1992 and 1993 and the sudden contraction in
early 1994 reflected a herd mentality,' Charles Dallara, managing director
of the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, said in a recent
speech.
Most specialists feel the sell-off has been overdone and say many markets
have begun to offer good value. 'The correction has now put markets into
cheap territory versus their fundamental credit quality,' says Aidan Freyne,
head of emerging market sales for Salomon Brothers Europe.
Many also feel the shake-out may prove beneficial for the markets
longer-term. 'The correction will ultimately be good for the secondary
market - it got rid of the speculative money, and is making people look at
fundamentals, analysing which markets really provide value,' says Elizabeth
Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants in
Washington.
According to Salomon Brothers, outstanding emerging market debt at the end
of the first quarter consisted of some Dollars 127bn in Brady bonds; Dollars
221bn in medium- and short-term bank debt (including pre-Brady bank debt);
and some Dollars 112bn in eurobonds, globals and Yankees. In addition, there
is about Dollars 255bn in local-currency, domestic market instruments, only
some of which foreigners can buy. Although the market includes eastern
European, African and Asian debt, the lion's share of turnover is in Latin
American paper.
New external investment and lending to principal developing countries, which
fell from Dollars 102.7bn in 1981 to Dollars 27.5bn in 1987, surged to
Dollars 180.8bn last year, according to numbers published by the IIF. Equity
and bond purchases dominated last year's flows, each accounting for more
than Dollars 60bn, with commercial banks providing another Dollars 24bn.
This contrasts with the heavy reliance on commercial banks in 1981, when
they provided about 60 per cent of the total flows.
Heavy private external financing to developing nations bears the risk of
'inducing a mood of complacency' among policy makers, Mr Dallara warns,
urging that developing nations' governments keep up their reform policies if
they want to maintain a stable flow of funds to their economies.
He also said investors need more information on emerging markets: both on
their economic performance and prospects, as well as the risks involved -
sovereign, liquidity, counterparty and market risks. This could contribute
to greater discrimination by investors, and thus reduce volatility 'by
acting as a counterweight to both bullish and bearish swings in sentiment,'
he says.
Discerning investors will have to watch out for several potentially
market-moving developments this year.
On the political front, several Latin American countries will hold general
elections in the coming months, with Mexico's polls in August and Brazil's
October elections particularly closely watched.
Moreover, investors should keep an eye on the ongoing debt restructuring
process. Bulgaria, Ecuador and Poland are next in line for Brady deals,
having reached agreements in principle with their creditors. Panama, where
restructuring proposals have already been exchanged, and Peru are expected
to reach agreements late this year or early 1995.
Russia is expected to restructure its commercial bank debt this year but
there will be no write-off of either principal or interest. Lastly, Cote
d'Ivoire has a growing chance of negotiating a deal in 1995 and is the most
attractive exotic asset, notes Alexander Mitcheson-Smith, emerging markets
analyst at UBS.
As long as US interest rate uncertainty continues to cloud the horizon,
emerging bond markets could be prone to unpredictable mood swings. Many
observers do not expect to see a sustained market recovery until late this
year, when the peak in US rates has passed, the elections are out of the way
and growth in the region picks up.
However, some traders are reporting a cautious return by investors seeking
exposure to some of the more heavily sold sectors. 'We are starting to see
investors looking for cheap paper,' says one trader. 'The market has
deteriorated along with Treasuries but its fundamentals haven't - for a lot
of people, these levels offer great value for the longer term.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (4): A change of direction is needed - The
economy is drifting along on an old course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's economy, the tenth-largest in the world, is the supertanker of
Latin America's fleet. As such it is the hardest to turn around. For years
steered towards import substitution, tariff protection and state
intervention, it is still largely drifting on its old course, even though
its helmsman long ago sought to change direction.
Part of the problem is that the helmsman, disgraced former president
Fernando Collor, has been removed and replaced by President Itamar Franco,
who has seemed incapable of steering Brazil through choppy seas.
More fundamentally, there is resistance to overhauling an economic model
which, however flawed, has produced a Dollars 432bn economy and average
annual growth of 7 per cent in the 40 years to 1980. There are also some
very powerful interest groups.
The aftermath of the debt crisis in the early 1980s, when growth stopped,
spelt out the need for change. 'We had an import-substitution model of
state-led growth. But this is seen as gone for good,' says Mr Eduardo
Gianetti da Fonseca, a leading economist.
Nonetheless, he says, Brazil is 'lagging behind' as Latin America shifts
towards fiscal responsibility and market liberalisation. 'A clear indication
of this is inflation, a symptom of the inability to solve these problems.'
Brazil has managed to cope with inflation, which last year reached 2,500 per
cent, with a highly complex system of indexation, termed 'perverse
adaptation' by Mr Gianetti.
Indexation creates an inflationary inertia which, unless interrupted,
assures the continued escalation of prices.
It is precisely to interrupt that cycle that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
who resigned in March as finance minister, last December launched the most
realistic attempt yet to crack inflation.
The plan, partly designed to tackle the budgetary indiscipline which fuels
price rises, and to remove the safety net of indexation, is judged by most
economists to be technically adept. Mr Cardoso's three-stage scheme, which
also launched his campaign for election as president, seeks to use public
spending cuts and emergency taxes to remove the 1994 budget deficit,
originally estimated at Dollars 22.2bn. If the budget is truly balanced -
and uncertainty remains over whether it will be, particularly in an election
year - then this would reduce the government's need to engage in
high-interest, short-term borrowing which expands the money supply.
Stage two, begun in March, introduced a transitional index and accounting
unit, the Unidade Real de Valor (URV), a daily general price index based on
a measure of current inflation which is anchored to the dollar through
Brazil's foreign exchange reserves of more than Dollars 30bn. Salaries, new
contracts and large purchases are now quoted in URVs, paving the way for the
conversion of the index to a new currency, the Real.
The Real, the fifth currency in a decade, is due to be launched on July 1
when analysts predict that inflation will drop from 45 per cent a month to
less than 10 per cent. The question is, how long it will stay there?
At best, Mr Gianetti says, the scheme will build a low-inflationary 'bridge'
between now and presidential elections to be held in October. 'But, if
things go badly wrong and indexation is disrupted, I don't discount
hyperinflation. It's full indexation and then no indexation. . . It's a big
gamble.'
Mr Tullo Vigevani, professor of political science at Sao Paulo University,
says the plan 'lacks the political base to take hold'. It cannot work in the
long run, he says, without fundamental constitutional changes that would
permit the routine balancing of the federal budget.
The 1988 constitution obliges the federal government to hand over most of
its tax revenue to state and municipal administrations without releasing it
from spending obligations.
The constitution thus virtually guarantees inflation-fuelling budget
deficits by earmarking more than 90 per cent of revenue before a single
spending decision is made.
Brazil has adjusted to the illogical world of near-hyperinflation - last
year, gross domestic product grew by 4.9 per cent - but its economy has been
warped.
Very high interest rates (more than 20 per cent a year in real terms) divert
investment into government paper rather than productive capacity and add to
the burden of public-sector debt.
Investment last year was 16 per cent of GDP, compared with 27 per cent in
Chile. Millions of poor Brazilians, without access to indexed bank accounts,
are unprotected from rocketing prices.
Even if Mr Cardoso's plan is initially successful, monetary policy will have
to be kept tight to rein in consumer demand as prices stabilise. This could
tip the economy into recession, threatening hoped-for growth in 1994 of 3-4
per cent.
Notwithstanding the risks, Mr Joao Geraldo Ribeiro Filho of Banco de Boston,
says: 'We have never had an opportunity like this and we don't know when we
will have another one.' He points to high international reserves and April's
conclusion of a Brady-style debt rescheduling agreement - named after a 1989
initiative by the then US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady - for the
country's foreign debt - admittedly without IMF blessing.
Most analysts agree that, largely as a result of reforms started under
Collor, the economy has taken significant steps. Privatisations and reduced
tariffs have stimulated exports, which grew by 8 per cent last year, and
improved productivity. Foreign investment in the capital markets reached
Dollars 5.5bn last year against Dollars 1.3bn in 1992, and multinational
interest has been reawakened in Brazil as Latin America's potentially most
dynamic economy.
It is not clear whether a newly-elected government will continue in the same
direction. Mr Gianetti fears that strong interest groups, such as state
monopolies, will prevent further restructuring. To reform in the context of
splintered political parties and a burdensome constitution will not be easy,
he says. 'We have had the feast of democracy before the blood, sweat and
tears of market reform.'
There is uncertainty, especially among foreign investors, about what would
happen if election front-runner Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the
left-wing Workers' Party should become president. Many analysts feel,
however, that his reservations about economic reforms would be cooled by the
reality of government and the need to build coalitions.
'In the long term - independently of who becomes president - Brazil has no
other way out,' says Mr Julius Haupt Buchenrode, director of investments at
Banco Chase Manhattan. 'It needs to reduce inflation; to balance its budget;
to adjust its constitution; and probably to continue privatisations. There's
no magic solution.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (5): International role denied - Foreign
relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's foreign ministry holds a privileged place in the country's capital,
Brasilia - overlooking the Congress building and opposite the Palace of
Justice. The location is deserved because the ministry, known as Itamaraty,
is one of the country's most able and important.
But it is a cruel punishment for the diplomats, who are forced each day to
look at the cause of their frustration - politicians. Despite Brazil's size
and potential, it is unable to play the international role many in Itamaraty
seek. Instead, its importance and negotiating strength are compromised by
the political failure to stabilise the economy and bring down inflation.
Brazil's economic instability is also acting as a brake on the development
of Mercosul - the free-trade zone formed between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay
and Paraguay which is due to come into force on January 1 - and plans for a
wider free trade area to incorporate most of South America. Mercosul has
progressed much faster than cynics first suggested. But longer-term
questions remain unanswered, and it would not be surprising if key partners
such as Argentina chose to link with the US-led North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) grouping, rather than remain tied to Brazil's bumpy ride.
Brazil's cultural and trading ties have traditionally been with Europe,
original home to much of the country's population, and the US, which emerged
as Brazil's biggest foreign investor early this century.
But the relationship with the US is complicated, and often troubled.
Itamaraty is itself sometimes accused of being anti-American, although this
partly reflects the broad range of subjects where the two countries'
interests do not coincide. Brazil's concerns about a proposed linkage by the
US between social and environmental issues and trade is the latest example
of underlying tension.
Relations have improved this year, however, with the Brazilian Senate's
approval of a treaty to allow inspections of some of its nuclear
installations and Brazil's acceptance of US demands on patents and
copyrights. Last month's completion of Brazil's foreign bank debt
restructuring, achieved without IMF blessing, also removed another stumbling
block.
But it is Mercosul, and Brazil's future within South America, where most
change is occuring. The Mercosul treaty, signed in March 1991, calls for a
customs union to be ready by next year through the implementation of a
common external tariff.
Tariffs have already been reduced on many goods, and trade within the group
has grown extremely rapidly - more than doubling since 1990 to about Dollars
8bn last year.
This partly reflects the complementary nature of the two biggest economies,
Brazil's industrial strength being offset by Argentina's competitiveness as
a producer of primary products such as foodstuffs and oil.
Difficulties remain - for example, Brazil's desire to retain high tariffs to
protect its computer and telecommunications industries. As a result, the
common external tariff is likely to apply to only about 85 per cent of
products. Remaining goods will only be harmonised from 2001.
Brazil is now proposing to use Mercosul as the base for a wider trade
agreement among all South American countries. This would be a simple free
trade agreement rather than a customs union, and would be jointly negotiated
by the Mercosul nations.
'We hope to use Mercosul as a platform for further trade liberalisation
throughout South America,' says Ambassador Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros, in
charge of Mercosul issues at Itamaraty.
Brazil's economic dominance of the continent means that most countries will
be interested in joining, although Chile's priority clearly lies in gaining
entry to Nafta. Even if countries do not formally join, there is an
increasing move towards lower tariff barriers and more open trade.
Argentina's position is more complicated, and at times the country
commitment to Mercosul has appeared in doubt as it contemplated its chances
of entry to Nafta. Complaints by senior Argentine leaders about Brazil's
economic instability have also angered the Brazilian side. Argentine claims
of dumping against Brazilian companies are rebuffed by Brazil's suggestion
that the Argentine currency is overvalued.
Teething problems and tensions are hardly surprising, but they hide a
longer-term problem. Brazil's big industrial economy is far from ready to
compete within a US-led trade area such as Nafta, suggesting that an
Americas-wide agreement is still many years away. But if more countries such
as Chile opt for the North America model, there is a chance Brazil will be
isolated.
Back at Itamaraty, the diplomats must hope the politicians sort out Brazil's
many other problems in time.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (3): Rates rise
takes its toll - In April, there was a sharp drop in issuance by US
companies / Patrick Harverson looks at the US corporate and junk bond
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years after steep declines in interest rates sparked a prolonged boom
in debt issuance by US companies, the recent turnaround in interest rates
has begun to take its toll on the corporate bond market.
The latest figures from Securities Data, the New Jersey-based financial
information firm, show that in April, US companies issued Dollars 10.8bn of
debt (both investment grade and junk). That was almost half the Dollars
20.8bn they issued in April 1993, and well below the average Dollars 24bn
issued over the first quarter of the year. It was also the lowest monthly
total since January 1991. Yet, no one on Wall Street was particularly
surprised by the sharp drop in issuance during April.
Between early February and mid-April, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary
policy three times, in the process pushing up short-term interest rates
three quarters of a percentage point to 3.75 per cent. The rate increases -
which the Fed hoped would prevent the rapidly-growing economy feeding a
revival of inflation - sparked heavy selling of government bonds. Investors
were selling bonds because they feared that, in spite of the Fed's actions,
inflation would rear its ugly head again and undermine the value of their
fixed-income assets.
The end result was a sharp rise in bond market yields, and - after a brief
lag - a slowdown in corporate bond issuance. Having feasted for three years
on cheap credit, companies quickly became wary of selling their bonds in a
less favourable interest rate environment. Similarly, investors were wary
about buying corporate paper if interest rates were going to keep on rising.
Although the April data confirmed that the new issues market was weakening,
the first signs of a reversal were evident in the opening quarter of the
year, when companies sold Dollars 72.1bn of new debt, down from Dollars
97.9bn in the same period of 1993. While the totals were still impressive by
historical standards, investment bankers noted a deterioration in market
sentiment in the latter half of the three-month period, and on into April.
Mr James Forese, the head of the fixed-income syndicate desk at Salomon
Brothers in New York described market conditions during April and early May
as extremely volatile. 'Sentiment has been very fickle. One day markets are
rallying, and people feel good about long rates. The next day, markets are
selling off, and people are pessimistic on rates.'
The deterioration in market conditions manifested itself in a widening of
spreads, and a drop in demand from investors, which quickly scared many
issuers away. Investment bankers say that whereas they could offer issuers
tight spreads over 6 per cent Treasury rates last year, by the end of the
first quarter they were talking about significantly wider spreads over 7 per
cent Treasuries. It was the kind of talk that issuers did not want to hear.
Once the market began to decline, demand quickly shrank, although interest
in high quality paper held up reasonably well. 'Investors have been going to
higher quality, but for the most part they are going to the sidelines,' said
Mr Forese. 'They are not buying much of anything, and are keeping their
money in short-term and other defensive instruments.' The one product that
was in demand was floating-rate debt, which always appeals to investors
looking to protect the value of their capital in a market where interest
rates are rising.
As for junk bonds, they have generally fared better than their investment
grade counterparts during the recent turmoil afflicting fixed-income
markets. This is partly because the accelerating pace of economic activity
is good for junk bonds because it reduces the risk that low-rated issuers
will default. In times of economic growth, junk bonds traditionally do well.
Also, the phenomenon that has sustained the junk bond market for the past
few years - low interest rates chasing yield-hungry investors into higher
interest-bearing assets such as junk bonds - did not begin to be seriously
undermined by the rise in interest rates until relatively recently,
primarily because rates remained low by historical standards. Thus, until
April, the motivation to invest in junk was still quite strong. With
sufficient demand from investors to mop up the new supply, junk bond
issuance in the first quarter was 4 per cent higher than the year before at
Dollars 14.7bn.
After March, however, there was a noticeable fall off in demand, so much so
that in April, only Dollars 2.2bn of junk bonds were issued in the US, down
from Dollars 3.6bn in the same month a year ago and well below the average
monthly volume of Dollars 4.9bn recorded during the first quarter.
Issuance dropped sharply after March because investors became more choosy
about which paper to buy, and began searching for ever-higher yields as
interest rates on government and investment grade bonds climbed. As one junk
bond analyst at a large US bank explained: 'It's become a buyer's market.
With new issues, prices had to be increased by 100 basis points, 150 basis
points, sometimes even more, to induce the buyers to come in.' It was not
long before companies started refusing to pay the yields investors were
asking.
Companies were also reluctant to come to the market because junk bond mutual
funds - traditionally a large source of demand for low-rated issuers - were
confronted with suddenly high rates of redemptions as investors chose to
move their money elsewhere while the storm in the bond markets was raging.
For both the investment grade and junk bond markets, the outlook for the
rest of the year depends greatly on what happens to US interest rates. As of
early May, the Fed had raised rates three times, and most analysts were
predicting that there was more to come, especially with the weakening dollar
requiring support.
Yet, what the corporate bond market needs above all now is some certainty
about the outlook for interest rates. Investors need to be confident about
where rates will be in the next three, six and 12 months, before they can
start making reasoned judgments about where to put their money.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (4): Patience is
running out - How Japan's corporate bond market is being undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese way of doing things gradually, in an orderly manner with a
long-term perspective, has long been considered by outsiders to be the
reason for its success in becoming an industrialised power.
However, in the world of finance, this rule does not apply. The piecemeal
reforms under way in Japan's financial markets today, are undermining
Tokyo's chance of becoming a truly international financial market.
The country's financial markets have been tightly regulated by the powerful
ministry of finance, and closed to outside influences until the 1980s.
However, the stock market boom of the late 1980s and the rise in the
financial power of Japanese financial institutions led to calls for
deregulation both from home and abroad.
However, financial authorities, who feared losing their power over the
industry, financial markets and capital flows, have been reluctant to
implement fully-fledged reform, claiming that it would bring 'confusion' to
the markets and investors.
Such dragging of feet, say market participants, will lead to a decline in
Japan's position as an international capital market, even though it may be
among the world's largest. 'Japan's capital and foreign exchange market is
facing a severe case of hollowing out,' says Mr Mikio Fujii at Nomura
Securities' bond division. He says issuers and investors are shifting their
activities to less regulated offshore markets such as Hong Kong.
Restrictions on the types of investment products which can be issued,
difficulty in bringing market prices into fund-raising activity, the lack of
a proper secondary bond market, the lack of hedging tools for straight bond
trading are frustrating foreign investment houses which hoped for a
lucrative market following deregulation.
Officials at foreign securities houses now also warn that their patience
will not last forever.
'If things haven't changed by April next year, we will have to reconsider
our Tokyo operations,' says a leading US investment house.
Since the mid-1980s, the ministry of finance has been promising deregulated
financial markets. So far, on the corporate bond market, they have managed
to lift various regulations and bring in the mechanism for the primary
market.
Over the past year, the limit on the maximum amount of new issues has been
lifted, and the market has been opened to a wider range of issuers, with the
minimum credit rating for issuing foreign and domestic yen bonds by Japanese
companies lowered from single A to triple B.
Restrictions on floating rate notes has been lifted, while companies issued
domestic dual currency bonds for the first time in March.
The entrance of banks' subsidiaries into the securities business, the
initial step for the ministry's partial easing of the barrier between the
securities and banking industries, has also helped bring in competitive
pricing and increase the number of companies issuing corporate bonds.
Ten trust banks and long-term credit banks were allowed last April to
establish securities subsidiaries, and city banks, or the large commercial
banks, will follow suit this summer.
However, products such as junk bonds and index-linked bonds are still
barred, and the ministry of finance is hesitant about innovative instruments
tailored for the issuers' needs - an area in which foreign investment houses
excel.
Asset securitisation, which many foreign securities companies are eager to
promote, has also failed to take off domestically due to the ambiguous
status of asset-backed securities as an investment instrument, and various
procedural barriers.
And although the corporate bond primary market has grown to Y2,900bn, a
secondary market remains virtually non-existent due to an archaic bond
registration law, and the lack of an efficient clearing system.
Because the Japanese legislative system treats bonds in the way in which
they were treated before the second world war when such instruments were
considered unmovable assets, investors are required to register their bonds
with designated banks.
Such procedures can sometimes take up to a month, hampering smooth trading.
A centralised clearing system similar to Euroclear would solve such
problems, boosting secondary trading. This would require a change in
legislation but strong opposition from banks, which receive a registration
fee, and the cost of setting up such a system are obvious barriers.
However, foreign investment house officials say such fundamental problems
need to be solved if Japan is to become an international financial centre.
Along with such structural problems, large Japanese institutional investors
still remain reluctant to diversify investments and balance risks with
returns. Here again, much of this is due to rigid investment guidelines set
by the ministry of finance.
But brokers say the mentality of the Japanese fund manager, who is not
evaluated on the basis of his investment returns, has been partly
responsible for the slow pace of the country's financial revolution.
Since performance does not affect the salaries or the amount returned to the
beneficiary, investors tend to be satisfied with low risk, low return
products and do not feel the need to trade bonds or to buy asset-backed
securities.
Mr Fujii at Nomura likens the Japanese capital market to someone with the
'moratorium syndrome' - common among Japanese university students, who
refuse to go out into the real world after graduation. 'It's like a spoiled
child, who suddenly realises he's become an adult physically, but doesn't
really want to grow up,' he says.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (5): Issuance slows
to a trickle - The uncertain political outlook will affect emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After surging to record levels last year, the issuance of international
bonds by emerging market borrowers has become a trickle in recent months.
This follows the sell-off in global bond markets, triggered by the US
Federal Reserve's decision in early February to tighten US interest rates.
Since then, most bond markets have shed a large portion of last year's
gains, with the emerging markets falling most steeply.
As long as US interest rate uncertainty persists, emerging bond markets will
be caught in the thrall of the US Treasury market, where yields have risen
sharply in recent months in volatile trading. Moreover, the uncertain
political outlook ahead of Mexico's and Brazil's elections later this year
will also make investors reluctant to increase their emerging-market
holdings.
However, once US rates are perceived to have peaked and the political
picture clears, investors are expected to venture back along the yield curve
into longer-dated, fixed-rate assets. Until then, they are likely to stick
to less volatile short-term or floating-rate instruments which offer a
sizeable yield pick-up over most OECD markets at relatively low risk.
Moreover, some sectors of the secondary eurobond market are now so cheap
that they have begun to attract cautious buying, traders say. 'No one
regards this market as fundamentally overvalued,' says Mr Paul Luke,
economist at Morgan Grenfell, adding that the market offers significant
capital-gains potential.
Latin American borrowers - sovereign and corporate - had a spectacular run
in the international bond markets in the past two years. After issuing 99
deals totalling some Dollars 9.7bn in 1992, they raised a total of Dollars
24bn in 206 new issues last year, data compiled by IFR Securities Data show.
Total emerging market issuance, including Asia and eastern Europe, nearly
tripled from Dollars 17.4bn in 1992 to 50.1bn in 1993.
In the first four months of this year, issuance fell to 44 deals worth
Dollars 6.6bn in Latin America and to Dollars 16.6bn overall, according to
IFR.
During the boom, the yield premiums issuers paid over underlying government
bonds were rapidly eroded by strong investor demand. This allowed borrowers
to raise money at increasingly advantageous levels - and well below the
interest rates they would have had to pay in their domestic markets, where
inflation pressures were keeping rates high.
However, the market correction has sent emerging market eurobonds' yield
spreads ballooning back out. For example, Mexico's Banco Nacional de
Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) in January issued Dollars 1bn of 7 1/4 per
cent 10-year global bonds yielding 163 basis points above the US Treasury
note; the spread widened to about 385 basis points, but narrowed to around
280 by mid-May.
During the bull run, many private sector borrowers joined sovereign and
public-sector names; some issuers, including the Republic of Argentina and
Mexico's Cemex, launched large global bond deals providing investors with
more liquid paper; and borrowers lengthened the maturities and broadened the
currency range of their bonds to appeal to a wider investor base.
Many of these trends have been reversed in recent months: the bulk of
issuance has been in US dollars; private sector borrowers have largely ceded
the stage to the handful of public-sector entities still brave enough to tap
the market; some of the liquid, global issues have taken a particularly
heavy pounding; and maturities have shortened significantly, with most
business now taking place at the very short end of the yield curve.
'A lot of the action has been in the money market,' says Miles Protter, in
charge of emerging markets origination at Swiss Bank Corporation in London.
Institutional investors seeking a lucrative home for their cash have been
piling into corporate commercial paper and certificates of deposit which
Mexican, Brazilian and Argentine banks have been issuing heavily in recent
months, he says. They offer returns well above investors' own domestic money
markets while minimising the volatility of longer-dated paper.
Some of the Mexican government agencies, such as Bancomext and Nafinsa, have
been particularly active issuers of Euro commercial paper and medium-term
notes ranging between six months and three years, traders say. One dealer
estimates they have issued well over Dollars 1bn of such paper since the
beginning of the year, including public floating-rate note issues and
privately placed deals.
It is no surprise that in an environment of rising interest rates, a growing
proportion of new issues consists of floating rate notes. Of this year's
Latin eurobond issues, 23.4 per cent have been FRNs, far greater than the
6.6 per cent of issues represented by floaters in 1993 and 3.5 per cent in
1992, notes Peter West, economic adviser at West Merchant Bank.
'The trend towards FRNs is likely to intensify, in the light of their
attractiveness to investors in a rising interest-rate environment,' he
predicts, while adding that issuers reluctant to face the risk of a floating
rate structure may instead prefer to pay the premium to swap then into a
fixed rate.
Meanwhile, some say investors' cautious return to the secondary market may
herald a pick-up in new issuance. 'Some bottom fishers are coming back to
the market and are buying away the cheap, good-quality assets. This is a
positive sign, as it creates an environment where new issues could be
welcomed,' says Vincent Keith, head of emerging market syndicate at Bankers
Trust in London.
His is one of several underwriting houses poised to lead an issue from an
emerging market borrower; traders say Bankers Trust has the mandate to issue
Dollars 250m of 10-year fixed bonds yielding around 350 bps over for the
Philippine Long-Distance Telephone Company.
Also in the pipeline are two shorter deals for two Indian borrowers: the
Industrial Development Bank of India, with Citibank tipped as lead manager,
and the Indian Oil Corporation, said to come via Chase Investment Bank.
Elsewhere, the Province of Buenos Aires is planning a bond issue of its
Dollars 450m Euro medium-term note programme via Salomon Brothers. The deal
was originally supposed to come in the wake of Argentina's global bond
offering last December but was then postponed due to a deterioration of
market conditions.
Eastern European borrowers are also limbering up for new issuance. Poland
plans to raise more than Dollars 1bn on the international capital markets
once its London Club negotiations for a reduction of up to 45 per cent in
its Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt have been concluded. More supply is
also expected from borrowers in the the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
As long as US interest rate uncertainty continues, most issuers will have to
pay larger yield premiums than they did last year, to compensate investors
for increased volatility. 'Most issuers understand they have to pay up -
they realise the market environment has changed,' says Mr Keith at Bankers
Trust.
'Initially, we will have to have generous spreads,' agrees Graham Marshall,
head of corporate finance at ING Bank in London. 'But once US rates aren't
seen rising any further, spreads could contract,' he predicts. Once interest
rate and election jitters are out of the way, he expects issuance to pick
up. 'I think we could have a good fourth quarter.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (2): Change will be slow - Whoever wins the
elections in October will inherit one of the most complicated political
systems in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Thanks to a succession of mishaps and 21 years of military government,
Brazil has been ruled by an elected president for only 30 months in the past
30 years.
Former President Fernando Collor, who resigned amid corruption allegations
in September 1992, was the latest elected president to fail to serve his
full term. Mr Itamar Franco, Mr Collor's successor, has lacked a popular
mandate or support in Congress and his government has often been only
capable of crisis management rather than implementing policy.
Brazil's fragile democracy should therefore emerge considerably strengthened
from this year's presidential, congressional and gubernatorial elections,
due in October.
Whichever of the two front runners wins the presidential race, they will
have at least a chance to build a popular alliance in congress and tackle
some of the country's problems. However, structural weaknesses in Brazil's
political system, and a recent cut in the presidential mandate from five to
four years, means change will be slow and often erratic.
Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-of-centre Workers Party (PT)
candidate, is front runner in the polls with a steady 30-35 per cent of the
vote. Mr da Silva, a former metalworker and union leader, combines populist
appeal with good oratory. As loser in the 1989 elections, he also draws
support from Brazilians who feel betrayed by Mr Collor.
The PT's roots lie in radical protest politics, but it has become
increasingly moderate in the past few years. The far left of the party,
known as the Shia wing, remains visible and vocal but the advisers close to
Mr da Silva are moderates who have spent the years since the last election
preparing for government. According to Mr Aloizio Mercadente, one of the key
advisers, a PT government would concentrate on the fight against hunger and
unemployment and on education and rural reform. 'Four years is not a lot of
time, but it's enough to start making irreversible changes,' he says.
The PT's biggest drawback, apart from a largely hostile media, is its lack
of experience in national government. The party has been making progress in
local government, but remains poorly represented in Congress. According to
polls, many Brazilians are personally drawn to Mr da Silva, but worry about
his lack of a track record. 'There is still a perception that the PT is
great for opposition, but not good to govern,' according to Mr Mario Mamede,
a PT state deputy.
This perception will be exploited by Mr da Silva's likely main competitor,
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who resigned as finance minister in March to
run for the presidency. A former academic with left-of-centre views which
often found him on the same stage as Mr da Silva under the military, Mr
Cardoso has also mellowed. His views are today centrist, with emphasis on
social issues. He is also more economically liberal than Mr da Silva, and is
likely to favour an accelerated privatisation programme and market reforms.
Mr Cardoso's problem is that, during his period as finance minister, monthly
inflation rose from under 30 per cent to more than 40 per cent. The
government's anti-inflation plan, which Mr Cardoso negotiated through
Congress, is therefore extremely important to his campaign. If inflation
falls following introduction of the new currency in July, Mr Cardoso hopes
his poll ratings will increase from the present 15-20 per cent.
He will also be helped by an election alliance between his party, the
Brazilian Social Democrats (PSDB), and the right-of-centre Liberal Front
(PFL), which is strong and well organised in the north-east of Brazil,
exactly where Mr Cardoso is weakest.
With four months left to the elections, it is still very difficult to assess
the likely outcome. Under Brazilian law, the two candidates with most votes
go through to a second round in November. If inflation falls, Mr Cardoso and
Mr da Silva could be neck and neck in the second round. If it does not, or
only falls briefly, Mr Cardoso could be beaten in the first round by an
outsider, such as former Sao Paulo state governor Orestes Quercia.
Whoever wins will inherit one of the most complicated, and some say most
difficult to reform, political systems in Latin America. With 20 political
parties in Congress, often bound by individual loyalties rather than
ideology, governments are forced to build alliances of strange bed-fellows.
Congressmen often pursue regional rather than national interests, and
corruption remains a serious problem.
But, since Congress is the guardian of the constitution and reform would
deprive Congressmen of power and privilege, adequate political change will
take a long time.
PROFILES OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CANDIDATES
Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, candidate for the Workers Party (PT):
Mr da Silva, 46, is campaigning to become Brazil's first socialist
president.
Born in the poor north-eastern state of Pernambuco, he rose to prominence in
the late 1970s as the union leader of metalworkers opposed to the military
government.
He co-founded the PT and gained 31m votes in the second round of the 1989
elections, but lost by 44 per cent to 50 per cent to Fernando Collor. Has
spent much of the time since on 'caravans' around the country, building
support in rural areas.
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, candidate for the Brazilian Social Democrats
(PSDB) and Liberal Front (PFL) alliance:
A respected sociologist and opponent of the military regime, Mr Cardoso (63)
entered politics in 1984, was defeated in elections for mayor of Sao Paulo,
but won a seat in the Senate two years later.
He co-founded the PSDB after growing disillusioned with the main opposition
party, the PMDB.
In the present government, Mr Cardoso served as foreign minister before
becoming finance minister last year and launching a widely praised but still
unproven anti-inflation plan.
Roberto Marinho, boss of TV Globo and O Globo newspaper:
Most Brazilians rely on television for their news coverage and TV Globo has
a virtual monopoly, attracting more than 60 per cent of viewers for its
nightly news programme. Globo was widely seen as critical to the election
campaign of Mr Collor, who was Mr Marinho's favoured candidate.
This time, Mr Marinho, 89, is expected to back Mr Cardoso, but bias against
Mr da Silva will probably be less visible. Nevertheless, with the PT intent
on attacking Globo's power-base if it wins the elections, Mr Marinho's views
will be very important.
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, former governor of Bahia state:
One of the most powerful men in Brazil because of political and family ties,
Mr Magalhaes was largely responsible for persuading his party, the PFL, to
back Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
Fearing that the party did not have a viable candidate of its own, and
determined to block Mr da Silva, Mr Magalhaes will now be one of the most
important figures in the campaign, especially in the north of the country.
However, his right-wing views and liking of traditional-style politics makes
him unappealing to many in Mr Cardoso's party.
President Itamar Franco: a possible king maker.
Although he is dismissed as an ineffectual leader by many politicians,
President Franco can significantly affect the outcome of the elections. The
office of the presidency wields extensive executive power and can also
confer status on its preferred candidate.
President Franco is backing his former finance minister, Mr Cardoso.
However, the president's unpredictable and populist character could lead to
surprises, especially if the anti-inflation plan does not succeed.
As its chosen candidate, Mr Cardoso will also be unable to attack an
otherwise unpopular government.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (3): Shrinking trade share is likely to
reverse - Export and import links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil is still one of the world's most hermetic economies. In spite of the
reforms of disgraced president Fernando Collor, which aimed to prise open
the country after years of import substitution, Brazil's trade with the
outside world is less, proportionally, than a decade ago.
In 1983, total trade constituted 16.6 per cent of gross domestic product, an
already small proportion that slipped to 15.5 per cent last year when
combined imports and exports reached Dollars 64bn. Chile trades about 60 per
cent of its GDP.
'Brazil's presence in the world market is smaller than it was 10 years ago.
We are shrinking,' says Mr Eduardo Gianetti da Fonseca, an economist at the
University of Sao Paulo. This trend is, however, likely to reverse as
Collor's reforms dig in, domestic demand picks up and industry - deprived of
its once captive, highly protected market - looks abroad for opportunity.
'There is a consensus in Brazil that the country must participate more in
international trade,' says Mr Tullo Vigevani, professor of political science
at Sao Paulo university.
Last year, exports rose by 7.7 per cent against 1992, a creditable
performance given weak international demand. Imports surged by nearly a
quarter in response to domestic growth of 4.9 per cent. In 1993, Brazil ran
a trade surplus of Dollars 13.3bn, down on the Dollars 15.5bn of the
previous year, but still one of the largest in the world.
Average tariffs, at 14 per cent, are now near Latin American norms, allowing
a rapid rise in imports of intermediary and capital goods. Many economists
say manufacturers are importing machinery in order to raise productivity,
which should feed into future exports.
Imports of consumer goods, on which tariffs are still relatively high, grew
less rapidly, although there were sharp increases in imported cars and
electronic equipment. In the medium term, consumer imports are likely to
rise significantly, but Brazil's diversified production base is fairly
well-equipped to compete and has made important productivity gains in recent
years.
'Tariffs have gone down substantially and yet industrial output is growing,'
says Mr Guilherme Leite da Silva Dias, director of the Institute of Economic
Research. Domestic manufacturers, he says, are holding their own against
foreign producers in contrast with some less-sophisticated Latin American
economies whose industries have struggled to compete.
Even so, Brazil's huge surpluses - necessary for financing foreign
obligations following the debt crisis of 1982 - are likely to shrink
further. In 1994, the first-quarter surplus was down by nearly a third on
1993, and is likely to be around Dollars 10bn by year-end; about half its
1988 peak.
Mr Simao Davi Silber, a Sao Paulo trade specialist, says it is both
desirable and feasible for Brazil to double the amount of its international
trade relative to GDP. Mr Gianetti agrees that successful domestic
restructuring requires far greater commercial interchange than today's
'ridiculously low' levels.
The North American Free Trade Agreement and the economic integration of
Europe may limit access to Brazil's traditionally strongest export markets.
Mr Silber says there is further room for expanding trade with Latin America
which now accounts for 20 per cent of Brazilian commerce against 14 per cent
in 1985. Brazil has proposed a South American free trade bloc.
Argentina, fellow member of the Mercosul free trade zone with Brazil,
Uruguay and Paraguay, accounts for much of that increase in continental
trade; Brazilian shipments there soared from 2.9 per cent of total exports
in 1988 to 9.4 per cent last year. However, Mr Silber says that, given
different exchange rate policies and concern in Buenos Aires over
consistently high trade deficits with Brazil, there may be restraints to
further big increases.
Another way to accelerate commercial integration, he says, lies with rapidly
expanding Asian markets where Brazil is under-represented. Greater Latin
American co-operation should facilitate better access to Pacific ports.
Before Brazil can launch itself upon the world in earnest, Mr Silber says,
it must tackle the plethora of indirect taxes which bloat the price of
exports by up to 15 per cent. 'At the moment we are exporting taxes,' he
says.
As nations begin to huddle into trading blocs, some Brazilian industrialists
fear they will be isolated. It seems likely, for example, that Nafta will
diminish access to the US of Brazilian orange juice concentrate and pulp,
both of which can be produced in Mexico.
Mr Silber says that Brazilian exports - metallurgical products, vehicles and
chemicals, as well as commodities such as soya, coffee and mineral ores -
are sufficiently diversified to withstand isolated difficulties in
particular markets.
Of more concern to many analysts is the possibility of fresh efforts within
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to exclude exports from countries
such as Brazil under environmental or social dumping provisions.
'I think this is really a potential menace,' says Mr Silber. 'It's a strong
instrument that you could use against everything. We will have to see what
happens.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (1): Mood is sombre
as bears spoil the fun - In February, the bull run ended when the US Federal
Reserve raised interest rates. Tracy Corrigan discusses the painful change
of fortunes for traders and investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When bankers and traders gather for the annual meeting of the International
Securities Market Association (ISMA) in New Orleans on June 1, their mood is
likely to be somewhat less festive than it was a year ago.
The contrast between 1993 and 1994 in the international capital markets
could hardly be starker. Last year, declining interest rates led to an
unprecedented bull run in the world's government bond markets, which
encouraged record issuance of Dollars 400bn in the eurobond market. The
strong upward trend encouraged a surge of investment by mainstream fund
managers, financial institutions and hedge funds.
In February, the bull run rapidly turned into a bear market, when the US
Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in five years. The
market's reversal was particularly painful, because most traders and
investors held long positions in bonds, expecting the rally to continue. The
reversal of fortune of the US bond market and the spillover into European
markets were exacerbated because many traders and investors held positions
through the futures markets, and were forced to liquidate positions as
prices fell, to cover margin calls on their positions.
'What we saw in 1992 and 1993 was a trending market,' said Manfred Schepers,
an executive director of Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'Globally, many
investors were taking large positions in terms of credit and interest rate
risk, which led to a dramatic expansion of emerging markets and of bond
markets generally.'
At the peak of the market, two emerging market borrowers, China and
Argentina, were able to issue large global bond offerings. 'People lost
touch with the fact that emerging markets are a credit game and that the
market liquidity is not always reliable,' said Mr Schepers.
As a result, when the Fed's rise came, the emerging markets were hit
particularly hard. New issues of both bonds and equities from these regions
have suffered as a result.
The greater appetite for risk was also shown by investors' willingness to
buy very long-dated bonds. For example, Germany issued 30-year government
bonds for the first time last year. Although the amount of funding through
fixed income bonds has dropped off this year, this has been partially
balanced by the increase in issuance of floating-rate notes. Dealers also
report record volume in the Euro commercial paper market, and there are
early signs of a revival in bank lending.
Since there is little sign that debt requirements are falling, it is likely
that funding will simply shift away from the mainstream fixed income
eurobond market, where the flow of new issues has suffered as a result of
weakness and volatility in government bond prices.
'The US bond market has had a predominant effect on attitude well beyond the
fundamentals,' said Ludovico del Balzo, a managing director of Lehman
Brothers. 'There is no reason why the long end of the European bond market
should be as weak as it has been except for sentiment.'
Nevertheless, the fact is that for most of the year so far, the markets have
defied analysts' insistence on market fundamentals. Many bond investors who
held on to inventory during the first wave of selling were forced to
liquidate on the second or third wave instead.
The impact on stock market investment has been somewhat less pronounced. Mr
del Balzo notes that while US mutuals investing in bonds have seen a high
level of redemptions this year, there has been little shrinkage of equity
funds.
The volume of new issues in the international equities market remains firm,
although there is now a greater sensitivity to pricing, particularly of
emerging market transactions. But volume in this market is being buoyed by
the heavy slate of privatisation issues, especially in Europe.
However, the huge volume of funding in the bond market last year cannot be
switched to the smaller international equities market.
The net result of the turnaround in the market is bound to be lower profits
for the financial institutions which dominate the international capital
markets. First of all, their trading income, a one-way bet for almost all of
last year, is bound to suffer. On the fee-earning side, while some of the
fixed income eurobond business has been replaced by floating-rate notes and
commercial paper issuance, the commissions earned are substantially lower,
owing to the lower level of underwriting risk.
To some extent, the market is better positioned to cope with the cyclical
turnaround than it has been in the past. The last shake-out of the eurobond
market, in the late 1980s, came when competition had become so cut-throat
that profitability even for market leaders was being eradicated. A number of
casualties pulled out or cut back, but the market did manage to impose some
discipline. The introduction of the fixed price re-offer system for pricing
deals, while not an unqualified success, has at least managed to rid the
market of some of the worst excesses.
Market participants can also comfort themselves with the knowledge that most
of their institutions enjoyed record trading profits last year, have
reasonably strong capital bases, and so should be able to weather a few
storms.
But the relentless institutionalisation of the market has also made it more
difficult to squeeze extra profits out of clients. Institutional investors
themselves have become much more sophisticated, and are demanding - and
getting - a more competitive service from trading houses.
One symptom of this is the top item on the agenda at the ISMA meeting in New
Orleans - a shift in market practice from seven-day to three-day settlement
of bonds. A proposal will go to the ISMA board in New Orleans, asking for a
change in rules effective June 1, 1994. The reduction to three business days
will apply to all ISMA members. While it is not likely to suit retail
investors, some of whom like to hold eurobonds because of their bearer form,
their interests are being sacrificed because they now make up only a small
portion of the market.
'The main benefit will be the reduction in systemic risk, because the period
of counterparty risk will go down from seven to three days,' said John
Langton, ISMA's chief executive.
Mr Langton said the change is needed as a result of the huge growth in
secondary market volume: four years ago, the total annual turnover in Cedel
and Euroclear, Europe's two international clearing houses, was Dollars
6,500bn; it is now Dollars 30,000bn. 'What was acceptable five or six years
ago is no longer. You are now looking at a different magnitude of business,'
as well as substantial changes in market practice, such as the growth of the
repo market, he added.
While trading conditions have been disappointing so far this year, one area
of the market has continued to furnish lucrative business. Activity in the
derivatives market has if anything accelerated, particularly in the first
quarter of the year, when many traders and investors were active in the
futures markets as they tried to hedge risk and offload positions.
Although margins in the futures broking business are extremely thin, heavy
volume has made the business attractive for larger market participants.
Meanwhile, the over-the-counter market, where more exotic options and swaps
are designed to suit individual clients' needs, has become more competitive,
due to the advent of new participants. However, the highly specialised
nature of the business means that banks still find the OTC market a
lucrative area.
The continued growth of the derivative markets, despite some bad publicity
from heavy corporate losses, is widely expected to continue throughout 1994.
However, even a partial recovery in bond prices at this point in the year is
highly unlikely to allow new issue volume to recover to last year's level. A
shift of emphasis towards international equities, floating-rate notes and
possibly bank lending is likely to help fill demand from borrowers.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (2): Search for
yield over - Eurobonds, down to earth with a bump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing could have prepared eurobond syndicate managers for the rapid
deterioration in market conditions in 1994. Riding high after a record year
of new issue volume and happily thinking about how to spend their hefty
profit-related bonuses, the sudden collapse in bond markets around the world
in February had the same effect on them as a bucket of ice-cold water on
sun-warmed skin.
'It is no longer a bull market for new issues,' says Simon Meadows, joint
head of syndicate at CS First Boston. He notes that the opportunities which
were available last year in so many currencies and structures are no longer
there, mainly because evidence that US interest rates are rising again has
wiped out the need among investors to take risks to enhance their returns.
'The search for yield is over, that extra pick-up is not needed any more,'
says Mr Meadows.
After soaring 45 per cent to Dollars 400bn last year, new issue volume from
the start of 1994 to May 15 stood at Dollars 164bn, down from Dollars 171bn
in the same period last year, according to IFR Securities Data. At the same
time, the proportion of fixed-rate issuance has declined in favour of
floating-rate note (FRN) issuance, reflecting the shift in investor demand
to make the most of any rise in rates.
From January 1 to May 15 this year, borrowers launched the equivalent of
Dollars 43bn in FRNs, corresponding to 26 per cent of total new issues (and
mainly denominated in US dollars), compared with a total of Dollars 24bn in
the year-ago period (or 14 per cent of total new issues).
Emerging market borrowers which tapped the eurobond market with such success
last year have also suffered as a result of the more defensive stance being
adopted by investors. Yield spreads on their paper have widened
substantially in the secondary market, eroding the progress which they made
last year with respect to pricing. Syndicate managers say while the market
is still open to them, they will have to pay what investors want to raise
funds.
John McNiven, managing director at Merrill Lynch in London, says that the
new issues market is still available to a whole range of issuers but that
the process has become more focused. 'You have to manage the new issue
process more pro-actively,' he says, 'Underwriters have to differentiate
between the credits to get secondary market support.'
Whereas last year the bull market conditions made it possible for syndicate
managers to stick their necks out on pricing to win a mandate, this year
they are under pressure to get their pricing right or risk being left with
the entire deal on their books.
The market volatility and a reluctance among banks to tie up their capital
to support other people's deals has unmasked one of the less gentlemanly
practices in the eurobond market when members of a syndicate sell their
allocation of the new issue back to the lead manager rather then keep it on
their books in the hope of selling it on to investors.
Recent instances of 'bond-dumping' have prompted a debate in the eurobond
market about the viability of the fixed-price re-offer mechanism which was
devised in 1989 by Morgan Stanley to instal some discipline among
underwriters during the offering process.
CS First Boston recently called for a revision of eurobond new issue
practice to stamp out bond-dumping. It proposed a modified fixed price
re-offer mechanism whereby the lead manager would be able to retain control
of its issue by inviting the underwriting group to request paper according
to end-investor demand, but not guaranteeing to allot these firms any bonds.
By only allocating bonds to underwriters whose demands are credible, the
lead manager could limit the flowback of bonds and downward pressure on
prices.
However, other leading eurobond houses have stood by the existing re-offer
system. In a letter to the International Financing Review, which has been
the forum for the debate, Robert Gray, chairman of the market practices
committee of the International Primary Market Association, notes that since
its introduction the re-offer system has been used to raise the equivalent
of more than Dollars 800bn in 15 different currencies in more than 3,300
issues, approximately two-thirds of total eurobond issuance during this
period.
On the topic of bond-dumping, he adds: 'Responsible lead managers should
factor that possibility into their pricing and syndication strategy for any
transaction.'
Syndicate managers expect a slight improvement in trading conditions this
year but they say that the main task will be to encourage investors back
into the market. One positive development is that investors are now more
comfortable with medium-term note (MTN) programmes which enable issuers to
achieve cost-effective financing through relatively small transactions.
Paul Abberley, head of fixed-income investment at the London arm of Lombard
Odier, the privately-owned Swiss investment management company, says that
the growing liquidity in the MTN market is helping to blur the distinctions
with the eurobond market.
'In some ways MTNs are more attractive than eurobonds because MTNs are
structured to suit you while a eurobond has a fixed maturity,' says Mr
Abberley. He adds that when it comes to the secondary market, MTNs are
sometimes easier to sell than euro-bonds because issuers are often willing
to buy back their paper. By contrast it is rare to find an issuer of
eurobonds who will buy them back.
Bim Hundal, head of the MTN desk at Goldman Sachs, says that while issuers
often use the programme's master documentation to streamline eurobond
execution, the main use is for structured (derivative-linked) products sold
directly to investors.
Several leading names in the eurobond market have set up MTN programmes in
the past year, most notably the World Bank whose programme is designed to
increase secondary market liquidity and enhance price transparency. A more
recent recruit is British Columbia in Canada which signed a Dollars 2bn Euro
medium-term note programme (EMTN) in early May as part of an ongoing process
of diversifying its borrowing sources and broadening its investor base.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (1): Critical year ahead on path to reform
 -While government and the economy lurch from one mini-crisis to the next,
underlying changes within Brazil will ensure the country's slow advance
towards modernity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Reforming Brazil often seems like mountaineering. Each peak that is
conquered simply reveals another, bigger problem ahead. Although the country
has made considerable progress in opening its economy and political system
in the past five years, the scale of what remains to be done is still
daunting.
This year will be critical. Presidential and general elections in October
offer the chance to renew the impetus for change. The government of
President Itamar Franco, who took office following the resignation amid
corruption charges of Mr Fernando Collor in 1992, lacks congressional
support and is increasingly having to act as a caretaker regime.
A package of reforms to tackle inflation, now close to 50 per cent a month,
is due to lead to a new currency from July 1. Inflation is likely to fall
sharply, at least to begin with. But spending pressures on the government in
an election year are intense, and there are mounting fears that inflation
will creep into the new currency, Brazil's fifth since 1986.
Mr Collor, the first democratically elected president since the military
takeover in 1964, left a mixed legacy. He is now extremely unpopular, but
most Brazilians agree that his removal strengthened the political system
because it showed that institutional checks and balances could work, and
that public opinion is increasingly important. Likewise, although his
economic policies contributed to a deep recession, his moves to open the
economy forced the private sector to compete, and are now showing
substantial benefits.
After zero or negative growth since 1989, the economy last year grew at
about 5 per cent to take gross domestic product to Dollars 432bn - slightly
behind China but ahead of Russia in US dollar terms. Most of the increase
came from the industrial sector, especially carmakers, where there have been
marked improvements in productivity. In the first half of last year, private
sector manufacturing productivity indices increased 18 per cent, reflecting
the strength of companies which survived the recession, and the reductions
in their payrolls.
Growth this year is forecast to reach 3-4 per cent, but is extremely
uncertain owing to the introduction of the new currency. Growth rates pale
into insignificance, however, alongside inflation, which reached 2,500 per
cent last year, and which is mainly responsible both for Brazil's very low
investment rate of 16 per cent of GDP and for one of the world's worst
income distributions.
Mr Rubens Ricupero, finance minister, says that without economic
stabilisation 'there's no salvation'. 'Stabilisation is not an end in
itself, but a pre-condition for Brazil to recognise its problems and deal
with them,' he says.
The latest anti-inflation plan has won wide support from economists because
it concentrates on the economy's main problem, a lack of confidence in the
government's ability to balance its budget. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
the former finance minister who resigned in March to run for the presidency,
negotiated a budget through Congress which was balanced, thanks to swingeing
spending cuts, especially in investment, and optimistic estimates of tax and
social security revenues.
The next step will be the introduction of the new currency, the Real. Future
monetary and exchange rate policy will not be announced until next month,
but it seems likely the Real will be linked at parity to the US dollar, at
least to begin with, and backed by Brazil's more than Dollars 30bn foreign
exchange reserves. However, the country's powerful industrial lobby will
squeal if the new currency becomes overvalued against the dollar, as
happened in Argentina's stabilisation. If inflation continues in the Real,
gradual devaluation is likely.
Monetary policy will have to be kept extremely tight, especially in the
first few months but there are already growing electoral pressures to
increase spending. Several federal and state banks, which benefit from
inflation and use the profits to cover losses from non-performing and often
politically-inspired loans, would face severe problems if inflation fell.
The government may not risk closing down these banks so close to elections
and the far-from-independent central bank may instead be pressured to
support them, thus threatening monetary policy.
There is another, longer-term threat to the stabilisation plan. When the
programme was launched in December, the government still hoped Congress
would approve a number of constitutional changes to allow future
administrations greater freedom to control spending. The widely criticised
1988 constitution imposed too many spending demands on the government and
introduced social welfare provisions which were too generous. For example,
female teachers can retire after just 25 years' work. At this rate, more
people will soon be receiving pensions than contributing.
The problem is that Congress, again fearing election repercussions, has
failed to approve many of the constitutional changes the government needed.
As a result, the incoming regime will face the same problems with balancing
future budgets as in the past, and this year's spending cuts are not
repeatable.
'The IMF didn't sign for good reasons,' says Mr Antonio Delfim Netto, former
planning minister, in reference to the IMF's refusal to agree to a standby
loan programme ahead of Brazil's private bank debt restructuring last month.
Mr Cardoso is trailing in the opinion polls, and almost certainly needs
inflation to fall sharply under the plan. If it does, he will be a strong
challenger to the front runner, Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing
Workers Party (PT), usually known as Lula.
Mr Cardoso's problem is that he has found it difficult to develop a rapport
with poor voters. Also, he cannot complain about the government's poor
performance because he was, until recently, part of it.
Mr Tasso Jereissati, chairman of Mr Cardoso's PSDB political party, says:
'There is immense disillusionment in this country towards politics, and that
is making Lula more appealing.'
A victory for Mr da Silva would mark a big shift in Brazil, which has never
elected a socialist president. But he has himself moderated many of the PT's
more radical policies.
He is surrounded by good, sometimes idealistic, advisers and the party is
determined to concentrate on problems such as education, unemployment and
land reform.
These are central to Brazil's longer-term development yet have been
neglected because of the economic mismanagement of the past 10 years -
Brazil's so-called 'lost decade'.
A PT victory would lead to considerable short-term uncertainty, especially
among foreign investors. The party has said it will review an already
flagging privatisation programme and demand renegotiation of Brazil's
foreign debts.
These threats are serious, but it seems likely that an incoming PT
government will face many other more pressingproblems. It will also almost
certainly lack a congressional majority and would have to compromise in
order to build a governing alliance.
While government and the economy lurch from one mini-crisis to the next,
underlying changes within Brazil will ensure the country's slow advance
towards modernity. The downfall of Mr Collor was followed early this year by
a recommendation from Congress that 18 of its own members should be expelled
on corruption charges although, unfortunately, some have been pardoned.
The growing demand for transparency at all levels of government is leading
the media and pressure groups to focus on what politicians do, individually
and collectively, for Brazil - and often to demand improvements. Second,
there is a growing realisation in the media and parts of the political
classes of Brazil's position in the world, and its dubious distinction as
the only main Latin American country yet to stabilise its economy.
Reform will take time and will be erratic. Mr da Silva and Mr Cardoso will
offer similar pledges of change, but both may find Brazil's traditional
preference for consensus frustrates their programmes. Mr Roberto Macedo, a
Sao Paulo economist, contrasts Brazil with the Asian 'tiger' economies such
as South Korea. 'Brazil is a whale economy, it moves very slowly and is very
difficult to turn round,' he says.

FT  26 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg retreats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden collapse of stock and bond markets around the world wiped out an
early big gain in SG Warburg shares, the only merchant bank in the FT-SE 100
list and, ironically, one of the most important bond and equity trading
houses in London.
Early in the session Warburg had rocketed to 740p in the wake of doubled
preliminary profits, which was towards the top end of the range of market
estimates. The near 16 per cent dividend increase was in line with market
forecasts. But by the end of a turbulent session Warburg shares had
retreated to 694p before closing 4 down on balance at 699p as dealers became
increasingly worried by the slide in international markets.
The early surge in the shares came amid relief that Warburg had managed to
avoid any big losses resulting from the volatility and overall weakness in
world markets following the decision by the US Federal Reserve to tighten
monetary policy early in February.
One merchant banking specialist said there was a big question mark over the
sustainability of earnings at SG Warburg. 'Warburg relies very much on
earnings from flotations and rights issues which are very much reliant on a
strong equity market. If the market collapses so does the earnings stream at
Warburg and the other merchant banks.'
The candidates involved in the bid for the National Lottery suffered a mixed
reaction to the mid-morning news that the Camelot consortium - which
includes De La Rue, Cadbury Schweppes and Racal - had won the franchise.
Racal shares bounded away on the news, ending the day 13 ahead at 238p.
Smith New Court estimates that Racal will be the biggest winner from the
contest, its earnings potential boosted by 22 per cent. De La Rue shares
closed 3 up at 830p, although dealers said this was as much in reaction to
several weeks of weakness - the stock stood at 1021p two months ago - as to
the lottery result. Smith has pencilled in a potential 9 per cent earnings
boost for the printing group and 3 per cent for Cadbury. Its shares
retreated 13 to 479p.
Among the losing candidates, Carlton Communications slid 22 to 901p, a solid
set of results notwithstanding. BZW inched up its 1995 forecast to Pounds
179m and reiterated its positive stance. Ladbroke ended three days of
weakness following Monday's veiled profits warning more steadily, the shares
off 3 at 172 1/2 p. MAI lost 13 to 249p, Granada remained friendless,
finishing 18 off at 490p, while Rank Organisation tumbled 25 to 380p.
A hefty jump in the net asset value of Land Securities helped the shares
remain one of the few shades of blue among the FTSE 100 stocks. The market
had been predicting an NAV range of 630p-660p, so Land's 677p saw the shares
leap to an immediate 20p premium. They later came back with the market to
close 2 1/2 up at 663p on turnover of 3.4m. James Capel, long-term bulls of
the property sector, are forecasting an NAV for next year of 790p.
Widespread talk around the market that the sudden collapse in world markets
had caught some of the big market operators on the wrong foot, triggering
potentially huge trading losses, unsettled all the big clearing banks and
the merchant banks.
Among the clearers Barclays, 527p, and NatWest, 439p, which control two of
the UK's biggest institutional broking firms, BZW and NatWest Securities,
dipped 14 and 12 1/2 respectively, while HSBC, which only on Tuesday said
reports it had made big losses in bond trading were inaccurate, fell 24 to
725p.
The insurance broking sector endured more pain after the recent dismal
profits performances with US investors said to have been steady sellers of
Willis Corroon and responsible for driving the shares down 12 more to 169p,
their lowest level since September 1992.
Chemicals group Courtaulds was among a handful of FT-SE 100 constituents to
remain in positive territory during an difficult trading session, with the
company's shares bolstered by a 6 per cent increase in the dividend total.
At the close Courtaulds shares were unchanged at 527p.
A fall in profits at Argyll Group added to the pressure on the shares in a
weak food retail sector. The company said a disappointing performance from
its Lo-Cost chain was partly to blame and remained cautious over the trading
outlook. Argyll shares fell 9 to 239p.
Good results from Morland helped the regional brewer forward 10 to 518p.
A shift of stance from BZW, the investment bank, was an additional burden on
the building materials sector. BZW shifted from overweight to neutral in the
sector, highlighting Blue Circle as 'fully valued' and therefore a 'sell'.
BCI lost 5 to 302p.
BOC was one of the five FT-SE 100 constituents to resist the market's sudden
decline, the shares closing 2 harder at 730p following the recent excellent
results and subsequent broker recommendations.
Shares in engineering group Glynwed International held up well, closing a
penny lower at 358p after a two-day visit to the company by institutions and
analysts. Smith New Court and Panmure Gordon were reported positive on the
stock.

Strong speculation that Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel would launch its
long-awaited Pounds 850m rights issue today swept through the market.
Dealers suggested that the issue would be at a deep discount to the current
share prices with the best estimates pointing to a three-for-five at 270p a
share issue.
Rumours of the rights issue came as Eurotunnel announced that it had secured
additional financing from its creditor banks. The shares, which had followed
the market lower, clawed back some of the earlier losses to finish 5 down at
355p on the news, on volume of 1.3m.
The company's broker and merchant bank were said to have done the rounds of
institutions over the last three days in a bid to ensure that the issue was
underwritten.
However, one market watcher said: 'They thought they could get it away with
only a 20 per cent discount but no one would take it at that price. It had
to be in the region of a 30 per cent discount for any chance of success.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie falls 2.2 per cent to new low
for 1994 - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London had no choice but to join in the setback in securities markets across
Europe yesterday as this week's growing fear that the fall in German
interest rates may be over drove investors out of equities. The FT-SE 100
Index fell 68.4 points to 3,020.7, a new low for the year and a loss of 2.2
per cent on the day. Weakness in the US dollar gave a further blow to
international blue chip stocks at the close of the session.
Trading volume increased sharply, but remained below peak levels as
marketmakers struggled to cut share prices before the sellers could strike.
Once the important 3,050 mark on the Footsie was lost, several computer-led
sales programmes opened in the stock index futures market and the collapse
in prices rapidly increased. Across the broader market, shares fell away
sharply to record a loss of 62 points on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which ended
the day at 3,629.4, a fall of about 1.7 per cent.
Equities opened firmly, helped by Wall Street's steadiness overnight. First
quarter figures on UK gross domestic product, showing a modest rise of 0.7
per cent, were comfortably taken and the stock market remained in positive
territory for the first hour of official trading.
However, British government bond prices began to slide in sympathy with
other European bond markets and UK stocks turned off in their wake. The
setback was modest at first, however, despite the disappointingly small
reduction in rates at the weekly Bundesbank repo auction.
The blow fell at mid-session when it was disclosed that the Bundesbank had
cancelled a note auction because of lack of demand for its paper in the
German market. Bonds began to fall in earnest and losses in share prices
increased dramatically as the UK market absorbed the possibility that
domestic interest rates might be forced higher much sooner than expected.
At worst, the Footsie was down by 77.8 at 3,011.3 as traders began to assess
the prospects for Wall Street. But US durable goods orders data for April
turned out to be less threatening than feared and UK stocks tried to rally.
The recovery was very slight indeed, because Wall Street remained 15 Dow
points off in UK trading hours, with Federal bonds also lower.
Seaq volume reached 646.1m shares, compared with 555.8m in the previous
session; Tuesday's equity business was worth Pounds 1.23bn in retail value.
The rout in the market swept all sectors along with it. Hard hit were the
merchant banks which earn their profits in securities markets and also hold
their assets in the form of shares and bonds. With markets heavily down
across the global range, international - such as Reuters, HSBC, RTZ, BP and
Shell - were all under pressure as London traders waited to see how Wall
Street would perform.
Market strategists expressed significant concern over the outlook for the UK
market now that it has plunged below the 3,050 support level. If selling
continues into next week, the Footsie could be at risk of another fall of 70
points or more, according to the equity chart analysts. The UK markets are
regarded as trapped between other European bourses, which are threatened by
the apparent shift of stance at the Bundesbank, and Wall Street which is now
perceived to be in danger of a further tightening of the credit screws by
the Federal Reserve.

<TEXT>
Stock index futures crashed through the 3,000 barrier to trade at a sharp
discount to the cash market as dealers reacted to the strong setback in
European bond markets, writes Joel Kibazo.
After opening at 3,078, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 briefly moved
ahead to touch 3,091. This turned out to be the high of the day.
However, the contract soon succumbed to active selling said to have been led
by brokers Mantrad and Fimat, with one of them reported to have been a
seller of 5,000 lots.
The slide was attributed to talk that there would be no further reductions
in interest rates. This not only sent led to the decline of the contract but
also pulled the underlying cash market lower. The decline of the US dollar
was also said to have played a part in the day's fall.
At the day's low, June traded at 2,998 but steadied to close at 2,999, a
day's fall of 79 points and around 18 points below its fair value premium to
cash of about minus 3. Volume improved sharply to reach 25,099.
The traded options also saw heavy volume as a total of 53,800 contracts were
dealt. The FT-SE 100 option was particularly busy, trading 26,382 lots by
the close.
Land Securities was the most active stock option with a total of 3,372
contracts.

FT  26 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities lifted by
Treasury bond auction
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
Bonds set the direction for blue chip stocks yesterday, pulling them down in
the morning and helping to push them modestly higher during the afternoon,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 10.13 better at 3,755.30, after
recovering from a 24-point mid-morning deficit. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.52 at 456.33 in moderate NYSE volume of 254m
shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged 0.07 ahead to
439.25, and the Nasdaq composite inched up 0.61 to 732.08.
From the opening bell to close, the mood closely paralleled the vagaries of
the bond market. Early on, equity investors were forced to contend with an
unlikely combination of negatives - weak economic news alongside further
declines by Treasuries.
Though indications of an economic slowdown are often worrying to
shareholders betting on strong growth in corporate earnings, such data often
trigger an upturn in bonds because of the improved outlook on inflation,
which would eat into the value of fixed-rate investments. But higher bond
prices, and a concurrent decline in yields, are usually a plus for equities.
Yesterday morning, however, Treasury prices receded in spite of the Commerce
Department's announcement that orders of durable goods last month had grown
by a meagre 0.1 per cent, against expectations of a solid 1.0 per cent gain.
The bond market shrugged off the development amid concern over an afternoon
note auction.
The double blow hit stocks across the board. But when the Treasury auction
was completed successfully, longer-dated government bonds reversed course
and moved higher. Stocks followed suit, and the Dow industrials nudged into
positive ground in the final hour.
The session's most notable loser was Gtech Holdings, which plummeted Dollars
12 7/8 , or 37 per cent, to Dollars 22 3/4 . The company, which designs and
operates on-line lotteries and games, warned that net income in fiscal 1995
would not show improvement on fiscal 1994.
On the Nasdaq, Video Lottery Technologies plunged Dollars 3 to Dollars 14
1/4 after the UK government named its rival, Camelot Group, to operate a new
national lottery. Ironically, Gtech is a member of the Camelot consortium.
Among the Dow industrials, trading in Philip Morris was halted for the
entire session, while its board was meeting amid stepped-up pressure to
consider splitting the company's tobacco and food operations into separate
entities. After the close, the company revealed it would take no action on
the proposal. The stock fell 2.7 per cent to Dollars 53 3/4 the previous
session.
Technology issues again generated activity but the results were mixed.
Hewlett-Packard had dropped Dollars 2 1/8 soon after the computer maker
suggested during the analysts' briefing that its revenue growth may begin to
slow from the current rate of 20 per cent. But the stock regained its stride
to finish off Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 81 1/4 .
Elsewhere, Compaq Computer jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 119 1/4 on news
that it had displaced IBM and Apple as the world's leading supplier of
personal computers.
On the Nasdaq, Chiron dropped Dollars 42 3/64 to Dollars 62 17/64 after
Montgomery Securities downgraded the biotechnology company. Computer stocks
were mixed, with Lotus sheding Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 and Cyrix
adding Dollars 2 to Dollars 28.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed mixed in continued quiet trading. The TSE 300
composite index edged up 4.39, or 0.10 per cent, to 4291.37 in volume of
48.2m shares.
Stocks spent most of the day in negative territory before posting a small
gain in the last hour.
None of the 14 stock groups showed major swings. Banking and mining rose a
little, energy, industrial products and golds were flat, and consumer
products increased moderately.
Bank of Montreal rose CDollars  1/2 to CDollars 26 1/8 after reporting
slightly higher second-quarter earnings.
Hudson's Bay Co gained CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 31 5/8 on reporting its
first first-quarter profit since 1979.
Brazil
Sao Paulo closed up 8.1 per cent in heavy trade on bullish sentiment over
the presidential race. The Bovespa index rose 1,740 at 23,018 points in high
turnover of Cr406.4bn.
Analysts said the breaking of the 22,800 resistance level charted a new
bullish trend. They warned about profit-taking at tomorrow's opening.
Mexico
Equities closed virtually flat after a roller coaster session punctuated by
profit-taking and a technical rebound.
The key IPC index closed up 3.64 points at 2,472.16 - a gain of 0.15 per
cent. Volume totaled a moderate 1.6bn new pesos, on 139.2m shares traded.

FT  26 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses face 'corrosion of
confidence'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Including Monday's trading on Seaq International as part of the sequence,
bourses registered a fifth consecutive decline yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
called this a 'corrosion of confidence', and attributed it to several
factors, including:
optimism over recovery prospects approaching a crest;
interest rate cuts likely to be on hold in Europe, in the face of inflated
German M3 money supply figures;
uncertainty over US inflation prospects, which could delay any robust
recovery in bonds and the US dollar;
European cyclicals looking tired after their recent strength, and an
unwillingness to buy financials because of interest rate uncertainties; and
the unabated boom in new equity issues.
FRANKFURT, once again, was hit hard. The Dax index fell 39.95, or 1.8 per
cent to 2,158.77 during the session, and lost another percentage point in
the afternoon, ending at an Ibis-indicated 2,137.56 after weakness on Wall
Street and late pressure on the dollar against the D-Mark.
Turnover rose from DM7bn to DM8.2bn. In financials, Allianz took the biggest
beating, dropping DM70, or 2.8 per cent, to DM2,439 on the session and DM24
to DM2,415 after hours.
Carmakers and chemicals were savaged among the cyclicals but, as expected,
the worst fall of the day was reserved for Metallgesellschaft after its
revelations of newly identified risks which it would have to cover in the
US.
The shares dropped DM29 to DM231 on the session, and DM11 more to DM220 in
the afternoon for an overall fall of 15.4 per cent.
PARIS was infected by German rate cut worries after the Bundesbank cut its
repo rate by only 3 basis points. The CAC-40 index fell 48.91, or 2.3 per
cent to 2,084.41 in turnover of FFr4.4bn.
Thomson-CSF, which delayed further the publication of its 1993 results, fell
FFr5.80 to FFr175.10.
MILAN turned back after an early rally prompted further selling. The Comit
index finished 4.55 higher at 759.79, although the real-time Mibtel index
registered a 2.6 per cent fall over the day.
Insurers were marked down as investors lightened their holdings in
preparation for the Ina privatisation, scheduled for the end of June.
Generali fell L1,308 or 2.8 per cent to L45,039, RAS L1,039 or 3.4 per cent
to L29,224 and Toro L2,070 or 6.6 per cent to L29,525.
Montedison fell L82 or 5.7 per cent to L1,350 amid speculation that its
chemical joint venture with Shell would fail to win European Union approval:
the company said that the commission competition authorities were still
considering the deal.
Mediobanca gave up another L567 or 3.5 per cent to L15,644 on continuing
fears that it could be dragged into police investigations of the background
to the Ferruzzi group's debt problems.
ZURICH was lower in line with other markets and with the domestic outlook
clouded by worries about interest rates. The SMI index fell 18.9 to 2,673.1.
Holderbank dipped SFr5 to SFr940 after the group said it expected better
results this year if economic circumstances remained favourable.
Sandoz finished SFr5 ahead at SFr725, after a day's high of SFr737, after
Tuesday's sharp fall which followed news of its agreed bid for Gerber
Products in the US.
MADRID dropped 1.8 per cent, the general index losing 6.07 to 330.45 as
turnover climbed to Pta34.43bn.
In New York, Natwest Securities announced an upgrading of Telefonica after
the stock dropped Pta50 to Pta1,865 in its domestic market.
AMSTERDAM fell in response to the weakness on Wall Street and in domestic
and German bond markets. The AEX index dipped 4.79 to 403.50, although price
movements tended to be exaggerated by thin trading.
The recently firm Hoogovens led the way down with a Fl 1.90 decline to Fl
70.50 on profit-taking.
Unilever lost Fl 2.90 to a 12 month low of Fl 189 in response to the slower
than expected economic recovery and continuing brand battles.
ATHENS tumbled another 5.6 per cent, hitting a year's low for the third
consecutive session, with soaring interest rates continuing to drive
investors away from equities and into bank to customer repurchase
agreements. The general index fell 47.58 to 854.25 in active volume of 2m
shares.
James Capel
said that with all capital controls now lifted, a drachma devaluation seemed
inevitable. 'The market would view a devaluation positively and, in the
event, we would expect a rebound from these very low levels.'

<TEXT>
The Bombay stock exchange tomorrow launches a broadly based 200-share index,
as a first step towards index-based futures trading to replace the banned
carry-forward system, Reuter reports. The index is expected eventually to
replace the BSE 30-share index which, critics say, is unfairly weighted in
favour of a few blue chips. The BSE is also introducing a dollar-based
index, to help foreign investors measure their returns on Indian bourses. Mr
Asit Mehta of Nucleus Financial Services, who proposed the system, said that
index-based futures trading would solve the bourses' problems of
illiquidity, inadequate hedging opportunities and a cumbersome settlement
mechanism. India's 22 bourses have been seeking a replacement to the badla,
or carry-forward trading, since it was banned six months ago on the grounds
that it caused excessive speculation. Analysts say that index-based futures,
though not the ideal solution, were the only viable alternative.

FT  26 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges up yet
again as region wavers

Buying by overseas investors narrowly outpaced large-lot selling by domestic
institutions, and the Nikkei index finished marginally higher, gaining
ground for the sixth consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average rose 41.51 to 20,663.63 after a low of 20,509.90 and a high
of 20,700.94. Active selling by corporate and financial investors pulled
share prices down in the afternoon session, but overseas buying then came in
and the index recouped its losses.
Arbitrageurs, who were heavy buyers on Tuesday, retreated to the sidelines
as they adjusted their positions ahead of today's last trading session for
April settlements. Volume totalled 440m shares against 552m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 2.56 to 1,658.18, and the
Nikkei 300 by 0.60 to 303.27. Gainers led losers by 506 to 503 with 173
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.94 to 1,358.77.
Traders said that investors were growing cautious in reaction to the recent
gains in share prices. However, Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel,
said that increasing evidence that corporate earnings were now bottoming out
was underpinning share prices.
Buying by overseas investors pushed up heavy electricals. Hitachi rose Y20
to Y1,030 and Toshiba gained Y7 to Y803. Consumer electronics shares also
rose with Matsushita adding Y60 to Y1,810 and Sony up Y30 to Y5,970. TDK,
the video game maker, lost Y90 to Y4,540 on poor profits.
Large capital shipbuilders were also strong on foreign buying. Mitsui
Engineering and Shipbuilding rose Y14 to Y373 and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries added Y8 to Y723.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone saw continued support from bargain hunting
after its recent weakness. The stock rose Y25,000 to Y867,000.
Speculative stocks lost ground on profit-taking. Sumitomo Coal Mining fell
Y32 to Y948 and Chino fell Y90 to Y1,050.
Non-life insurers lost ground. The industry had been requesting an increase
in fire insurance premiums, but it has been hit by the government's decision
to freeze all rises in public service rates. Tokio Marine and Fire fell Y10
to Y1,330.
Mining stocks, which had gained in tandem with commodity prices, met
profit-taking. Sumitomo Metal Mining fell Y2 to Y942.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 12.55 to 22,724.04 in volume of 26.3m shares.
Roundup
Sentiment was mixed around the Pacific Rim. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur,
Jakarta, Bombay and Colombo were closed for public holidays.
SYDNEY seemed in confused disarray as weakness in the gold, banking and
resource sectors left the All Ordinaries index down 26.5, or 1.2 per cent,
at 2,105.9.
In the banking sector, down nearly 3 per cent overall, ANZ took the sharpest
fall to end 22 cents, or almost 5 per cent lower at ADollars 4.44 although
it posted a big jump in half year profits.
The golds sub-index dropped 39.9, or 1.7 per cent to 2,333.4 following
weakness in New York bullion overnight, and the resource and commodity
sectors followed suit, this time on profit-taking.
MANILA's buyers paused for breath and again and the composite index fell
another 22.77 to 2,879.21 although traders said that the mood remained
positive.
Turnover fell from 1bn pesos to 762m pesos.
HONG KONG balanced afternoon profit-taking against positive Chinese comments
on airport project financing, and the Hang Seng Index rose 31.26 to
9,521.37, well below the day's peak of 9,664.07. Turnover improved from
HKDollars 3.97bn to HKDollars 4.59bn.
Jardine Matheson outperformed with a rise of HKDollars 2.50, or 4.2 per cent
to HKDollars 62.50 on institutional bargain hunting.
TAIPEI featured strength in electronics as the weighted index staged a weak
rebound after seven straight sessions of falls, closing 6.06 higher at
5,775.18 in slow turnover of TDollars 36.22bn.
Reports that the government had agreed gradually to raise the ceiling of
foreign equity investment funds to TDollars 20bn from the current USDollars
7.5bn, lifted electronics, a foreign favourite, with ASE up TDollars 2.50 to
TDollars 81.50 and Acer TDollars 1.50 better at TDollars 57.
BANGKOK was led higher by the finance and banking sectors, which accounted
for over 45 per cent of the business done yesterday as the SET index closed
10.21 higher at 1,348.80 in turnover of Bt7.1bn.
KARACHI closed flat in low volume, the KSE 100 index rising 0.93 to
2,246.61, but Fecto Cement put on Rs1.25 to Rs52.75 on dividend hopes.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar weakens again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar's recovery on the foreign exchanges proved shortlived yesterday
as the US currency came under renewed pressure from a stronger D-Mark,
writes Philip Gawith.
The agreement on Tuesday to restart the US-Japan trade talks had bolstered
the US currency, but weaker than expected April durable goods figures were
the catalyst for a steady weakening of the dollar.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.6447 against the D-Mark, from DM1.6478
on Tuesday and an intra-day high of DM1.6545. It was barely changed against
the yen at Y104.455.
Activity was generally fairly quiet until the dollar started to weaken in
the European afternoon. Apart from generalised D-Mark strength, the features
of Europe were the weaker lira, the Portuguese escudo coming under pressure
again, and the firm Greek drachma.
The futures markets were again very volatile, with most of the movement in
eurosterling. Sterling had a steady day with the sterling index finishing at
80 from 79.9 as strength against the dollar offset weakness against the
D-Mark.
US April durable goods orders were only 0.1 per cent up in April, compared
to market expectations in the 0.8 per cent to 1.5 per cent range. Although
durable goods figures are not normally closely watched, the disappointment
was sufficient to deflate whatever thin veneer of optimism had come to
surround the dollar.
Contributing to the dollar's difficulties was a general firming of sentiment
towards the D-Mark. The catalyst for this was the fairly small fall of only
three basis points in the German repo rate, to 5.20 per cent. Although
widely expected, it appeared to confirm recent comments from Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, suggesting that the pace of German
monetary easing would slow.
These sentiments were further strengthened by comments from two senior
Bundesbank figures yesterday. Mr Otmar Issing was quoted in a German
business daily saying that 'current money supply figures did not match a
landscape of falling interest rates.' M3 grew at a seasonally adjusted,
annualised rate of 15.8 per cent in April.
Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a central council member, was also quoted expressing
concern about differences between Bundesbank policies and government fiscal
policy.
Some analysts believe the D-Mark is being re-rated by the market as
economists upgrade their forecasts of German growth. Yesterday the German
currency had a mixed performance in Europe, finishing at FFr3.421 against
the French franc from FFr3.422.
The escudo returned to market attention yesterday with the Bank of Portugal
forced to step in to support the currency when it fell below Es104 against
the D-Mark. Dealers said a series of rumours about alleged crises were
undermining sentiment, while the currency also seemed to be acting in
sympathy with the weaker bond market.
In Greece, by contrast, the drachma had a steady day despite the overnight
downgrading of Greece's senior foreign currency debt by the rating agency
Moody's.
Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International in London said she
believed the worst was probably past for the Greek currency. 'If there was
going to be a serious crisis, it would have happened by now,' she said.
Last week many in the market were predicting a devalution. The short term
aim of the Greek government, some analysts argue, is to try and support the
drachma through the European elections, and until Greece hands over the
presidency of the European Union.
The lira was weak yesterday, closing at L969 against the D-Mark from L965.
Analysts said this was probably a function of heightened political
uncertainty following the announcement that Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern
League leader, would have to appear in court.
The futures markets enjoyed another hectic day. Trade in the euromark
futures was again heavy, with the December contract trading over 57,000
lots. Price movement, however, was fairly sedate after the recent gyrations,
with the December contract closing unchanged at 94.77.
Trade was fairly heavy in eurosterling too, with the December future trading
nearly 34,000 lots, and closing fifteen basis points lower at 93.80.
Analysts said it was difficult to make sense of the move, which appeared to
flow from weakness at the longer end of the yield curve. A lot of the
selling was technically driven as price falls triggered various chart
points.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 525m of late assistance to the UK money
markets after predicting a Pounds 750m shortage. The Bank had earlier
provided Pounds 76m liquidity to the market. Overnight rates moved between 4
7/8 per cent and 6 1/2 per cent.
In the German money markets call money rates eased to 5.25/5.35 per cent
from 5.30/5.40 per cent after the Bundesbank added a net DM7.5bn in its
money market operations.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Economic reform brings golden
dawn in Peru - The flood of foreign miners into South America's 'new
Eldorado'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To judge from the interest shown in last week's first ever gold symposium
held in Lima, Peru is now seen as the continent's new Eldorado. More than
800 gold experts - geologists, metallurgists, traders, environmentalists and
just plain miners - attended the three-day event.
'It's like Chile was 15 years ago,' said Mr Johan Smit of Newcrest's
Peruvian subsidiary. 'There's a 'let's go' feeling which is tremendously
exciting. It's the herd instinct, but in this case the herd is right.'
Acting as chief magnet for foreign interest - and drawing gold prospectors
to the north-central Andean department of Cajamarca - is the successful
Minera Yanacocha operation, a joint venture between Newmont Mining of
Denver, leading local group Buenaventura and France's BRGM.
Yanacocha is a perfect advertisement for the opportunities on offer in Peru
today. Its gold, in a low-grade disseminated deposit, was commercially
unrecoverable until the development of leaching techniques over the past
decade. Now, since coming on stream last August, the company has clawed back
its Dollars 37m initial investment in just seven months.
Carachugo, Yanacocha's first deposit, has mineable reserves in excess of 28m
tonnes averaging 1.38 grams of gold per tonne. By November a second, nearby
deposit known as Maqui Maqui will be producing its first dore bullion.
Larger and richer even than Carachugo, Maqui Maqui promises 40m tonnes of
ore at an average 1.91 grams a tonne.
Unlike Carachugo, whose porous ore can be scooped up and dumped directly on
to leach-pads, Maqui Maqui will be exploited as an open-cast mine. Trials
indicate the leaching cycle will take 120 days with a 60 per cent recovery
rate, compared with Carachugo's exceptional 35-day cycle, 80 per cent
recovery.
Development of Maqui Maqui is costing Newmont and partners Dollars 40m. With
production costs around Dollars 150 a troy ounce and projected annual output
of 180,000 ounces, Minera Yanacocha is on to another hugely profitable
operation.
Combined output from the two Yanacocha deposits should top 400,000 ounces
next year. That alone will boost national gold production to close to 40
tonnes a year and catapult Peru up the Latin American gold league table,
still well behind Brazil but vying for second place with Chile. Gold would
then become Peru's second most important export after copper.
Hard on the heels of Newmont in the current Peruvian gold rush is American
Barrick, also Nevada-based. In the past six months, Barrick has established
an aggressive presence, with 'between 40 and 60' geologists and minerals
experts sizing up maybe a dozen Peruvian prospects.
Barrick is already drilling at Cerro Corona in Cajamarca. The company is
tight-lipped about its findings but industry rumours credit Cerro Corona
with some 15m tonnes at 3 grams a tonne in an 'attractive, eminently
leachable oxide cap' with huge sulphide deposits below. Initial investment
is expected to be in the region of Dollars 20m.
An equally enthusiastic newcomer to Peru is Canada's Cambior, which in March
acquired the Cajamarca copper deposits of La Granja. Investing an initial
Dollars 31m in the five-year exploration stage, Cambior expects to start
drilling in June.
Simultaneously, the Canadian company will begin development of a
recently-acquired gold deposit in the remote eastern jungle department of
Apurimac, the first foreign company to venture into a zone hitherto
considered dangerous. Some 35 people are involved in Cambior's Peruvian
operation and investment in exploration locally is 'double what we're
spending in Chile this year', according to Mr Andre Gauthier, Cambior's
regional manager.
Yet another Canadian company, Placer Dome, has also gained a foothold in
Peru. In January, it outbid Newmont to secure a gold deposit known as
Jehuamarca-Canariaco in the northern department of Lambayeque. Initial
studies are under way.
All of this is good news for the long-suffering Peruvian mining community.
Inward-looking, nationalistic and protectionist economic policies meant Peru
had been shunned by international investors for a full 25 years. With the
exception of the giant Asarco-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation and
Japan's Mitsui - which has continued with a low-profile operation - mining
development has been left to local companies.
'Four hundred mining concerns have closed down in the past 15 years and the
rest are badly decapitalised,' said Mr Roque Benavides, president of the
national mining society. 'There's been almost no new exploration. The
deposits you see today were known in the 1960s.'
Privatisation was an initial trigger for international investors.
AngloAmerican/Mantos Blancos, Cyprus Minerals and China's Shougang
Corporation, in addition to Placer Dome and Cambior, all acquired their
stakes by bidding for formerly state-owned deposits at public auction.
Other foreign investors are forming associations with Peruvian mine-owners,
many of whom hold promising claims but cannot finance development. Still
others are participating in the anticipated boom by acquiring shares - many
leading Peruvian mining companies have large, liquid holdings available for
purchase through the Lima stock exchange.
But for many mining concerns like Newcrest and RTZ, Peru's attraction lies
in its largely unexplored territory. Over the past year, Peru's mines
ministry has seen twice as many claims lodged as in the previous four
decades.
'In Peru, the nice surprises come from grass-roots exploration,' says Mr
Smit. With increasingly attractive macro-economic conditions and a much
improved security situation, it seems plenty of foreign investors agree.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grain price fall sparks
sell-off in commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodity markets sustained a long-awaited sell-off yesterday as the drop in
grain futures prices in Chicago spilled over into other markets.
July coffee futures price at the London Commodity Exchange lost almost
Dollars 250 a tonne at one stage in hectic trading. It later recovered to
close down Dollars 138 a tonne at Dollars 2,210 a tonne. The nervousness in
the commodity markets also affected cocoa which lost Pounds 30 a tonne at
Pounds 1,024 a tonne.
The fall in price was partly due to speculators and fund buyers taking a
breath in their current commodities buying spree. But analysts said the
coffee market still looked tight even at these prices and could move higher
again.
'Given the magnitude of the rally, the market still seems well supported at
these breaks and I don't think we've seen the highs yet,' said Mr Bill
O'Neill, softs analyst at Merill Lynch in New York.
The coffee market has been pushed upwards by the reluctance of many
companies to sell stocks they are holding because they are worried about
further price rises. But supply tightness is expected to remain even in
spite of the decision earlier this week by members of the Association of
Coffee Producing Countries to sell off the rest of the stocks held under
their export retention programme.
Investor interest in commodity markets has been sparked by the current price
rises, which have received a lot of attention in the media. This has added
fuel to the recent price spiral. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the
London brokers said: 'I've never known as much media interest in commodities
in all the seven years I've covered the markets as there has been in the
past week.'
Some of the heat was also taken out of London Metal Exchange trading. There
was much less business than in recent stormy days and copper trading became
hesitant above Dollars 2,300 a tonne - but metal for delivery in three
months reached Dollars 2,305 before a downward reaction set in. By the
official close three-month copper was down Dollars 17 at Dollars 2,279.50 a
tonne and in late trading it fell again to touch Dollars 2,250.
Traders suggested that the market was going through a necessary period of
consolidation before making another upward move.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Firestone man to take over as
rubber buffer stock manager
</HEADLINE>

   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Hegarty, a senior manager at the US Firestone Tire and Rubber
company, has been named as the new buffer stock manager of the International
Natural Rubber Organisation.
He replaces Mr Aldo Hofmeister, who retires in August after nearly nine
years with Inro. The organisation groups the six main natural rubber
producing countries and 21 consumer nations.
At a meeting here this week Inro members agreed to request for a further
conference, held under Unctad auspices, to discuss the formation of a new
International Natural Rubber Agreement. The conference is likely to be held
in Geneva during the first two weeks of October.
Despite a rally in natural rubber prices in recent months Malaysia's
production has continued to fall as further land is given over to industrial
uses or planted with the more lucrative palm oil. The Malaysian statistics
department says that the country's natural rubber production was 241,202
tonnes in the first quarter of the year, a drop of 18 per cent on the 1993
figure.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hydro and Amoco in Russian oil
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's Norsk Hydro Production and Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company
yesterday announced a co - operation agreement that could lead to joint
rights for petroleum exploration and development in the southern part of the
Russian sector of the Barents Sea and the Pechora Sea.
The agreement covers joint evaluation of oil and gas production
opportunities of the vast region and close co-operation with Russian
companies and research institutes.
The two companies have separately studied this part of the Arctic during the
past five years but have joined forces to co-ordinate resources in an effort
to enhance their evaluations and working knowledge of the area, for which
the Russians have announced their intention to issue exploration rights.
A Norsk Hydro executive said that the two companies would also be looking at
sites to identify a potential location for an oil export terminal.
Amoco and Hydro last month joined Texaco and Exxon in establishing the Timan
Pechora Company, which is negotiating a production sharing contract with
Russia for an area onshore in the Timan Pechora Basin.
In the Barents and Pechora Seas Hydro and Amoco will be seeking to identify
areas where exploration could be undertaken.
Five years ago Hydro provided technical assistance to the Russians during
production testing of the giant Shtokmanovskoye field, believed to be one of
the world's biggest gas fields, in the northern part of the Barents Sea.
Hydro had hoped to be awarded a production sharing agreement for the field,
which went instead to the Russian company Rosshelf. Hydro withdrew from the
project in 1992.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold demand falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, mining correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for gold in markets covered by the World Gold Council fell by about
25 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same months a year ago,
from 693.2 tonnes to 514.2 tonnes, the producers' organisation reported
yesterday, writes Kenneth Gooding, mining correspondent.
In early 1993 gold prices in US dollar terms touched a seven-year low and
demand was also boosted by import liberalisation in India where the number
of jewellery shops consequently increased tenfold, the council pointed out.
The market was returning to normality and demand was holding up well, it
said in its latest Gold Demand Trends publication.
The markets monitored by the council represent about 75 per cent of total
world demand.
Among the price-sensitive 'developing markets' demand in India was down from
153.1 tonnes in the first quarter of 1993 to 82.5 tonnes this year; in
'Greater China' - which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan - it was down from
166.8 to 103.3 tonnes; and in the Gulf states it fell from 73 to 49.6
tonnes. In Turkey, where the market was hit by political uncertainty and
devaluation of the local currency, demand fell from 32.7 to 12 tonnes.
In the developed markets, demand in the US was flat, at 57.5 tonnes compared
with 58.8 tonnes, while in Japan it fell from 55.2 to 49.1 tonnes. Most
European markets were flat in the first quarter except for Italy, also
affected by political uncertainties, where demand fell from 20 to 17.1
tonnes.

20 May, against 440 tonnes in the previous week. Subdued offtake did not
bring many operations. Support was forthcoming in certain specialist styles
notably in the American range.

FT  26 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metals follow copper - Market
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange base metals prices generally followed copper higher in
early trading yesterday and then lower as the day progressed.
ALUMINIUM moved in a narrow range, meeting resistance around Dollars 1,370 a
tonne for three months delivery and ending at Dollars 1,366, a Dollars 5
loss.
NICKEL struggled near the lower end of the day's range for most of the
session, but traders said buying was being attracted on the dips. The three
months position ended at Dollars 6,555 a tonne, down Dollars 135.
At the London bullion market the GOLD price recovered most of Tuesday's fall
as buying was prompted by the weaker dollar and sharp drops in bond prices.
But the market looked very much in the hands of the investment funds.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: German auction withdrawal batters European
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany led a sharp decline in European government bond markets yesterday
after the withdrawal of an auction of short-dated German government bonds
intensified doubts over further cuts in official interest rates in the near
term.
The Bundesbank cancelled its auction of four-year 5.875 per cent bonds
because of insufficient demand, the first time this has happened since
September 1990. The next tender of four-year notes will be in August.
The Bundesbank's decision was taken badly by investors, whose confidence had
been undermined earlier this week by cautionary comments by Bundesbank
president Mr Hans Tietmeyer and data showing continued rapid growth in M3
money supply. Surveys showing an acceleration in Germany's economic
recovery, and speculation that the Bundesbank would announce an auction of
10-year bunds early next month, added to the gloom.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments on Monday, which suggested the market should not
expect further interest rate cuts in the near future, were reinforced by
comments yesterday from Bundesbank council member Mr Reimut Jochimsen that
the recent high M3 growth posed an inflationary threat.
Although the Bundesbank's decision to cut its repo rate by only three basis
points, to 5.20 per cent, was in line with most dealers' expectations, it
still disappointed the market. The June Bund future on Liffe reached a new
low for the year, of 93.30, before rising to 93.55 in late trading, down
0.69 point on the day.
The Bundesbank is due to meet today, but is not expected to take any action
on interest rates.
The fall in bunds dragged down UK government bonds already depressed by the
higher-than-expected price realised at the Bank of England auction of the
government's first convertible gilt since 1987. In late trading, the June
long gilt future on Liffe was down  15/16 at 103 1/2 .
A tail of four basis points, the difference between the yield on the average
and lowest accepted bids, was greater than had been expected, and reflected
the wide range of bids.
The auction of the 7 per cent gilts due 1997, convertible into 9 per cent
2012 gilts, was covered 1.93 times. Analysts said this was a good result,
given the uncertainty about the issue.
The heavy fall in bunds weighed on other continental markets, most of which
suffered losses of around one point.
Italian futures were among the worst casualties, following news that more
leading political figures had been ordered to stand trial in connection with
illegal financing of political parties.
By late afternoon, the June Italian government bond future on Liffe was
trading at 109.76, down 1.61 point, in heavy trading of more than 80,000
contracts.
In France, data providing more evidence the recovery is gathering momentum
failed to support prices. On the Matif, the June notional French government
bond contract fell as low as 118.82, before recovering to 119.04 in the late
afternoon, down 0.06 point on the day.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut only three basis points off the repo rate
also depressed French bond prices - it rules out any easing by the Bank of
France.
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds recovered from earlier weakness after an
afternoon auction of five-year notes proved to be a success.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 better
at 86, with the yield easing to 7.352 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 27/32 , to yield 5.942 per cent.
Early on, prices across the board deteriorated despite economic news that
appeared favourable for bonds. The Commerce Department reported that orders
of durable goods had risen by just 0.1 per cent in April, against
expectations of 1 per cent. The data suggested the economy had grown at a
measured pace last month, improving the odds that inflation was still in
check.
Traders, however, were unmoved, and focused more on the Treasury's auction
of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. Many were anticipating the market would
have difficulty absorbing the fresh supply.
In the event, the sale drew slightly better-than-expected demand.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: US management urged to
improve use of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior US company managers needed to understand and control the risks of
using derivative financial products, Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England's
executive director of banking supervision, said yesterday.
Mr Quinn said recent losses announced by US companies 'seem to have the
common theme that senior management did not have full knowledge or full
understanding or what was being transacted'.
He told a conference organised by the Futures Industry Association and the
Futures and Options Association that the need for companies trading
derivatives to have 'full and proper controls' was as great as for banks.
Mr Quinn said he 'fully-endorsed' recent remarks on controls by the US
General Accounting Office. 'There will always be some products to which the
correct response for an end-user is to say 'no', or at least 'not yet',' he
said.
He said the responsibility of banks selling derivatives to companies varied
depending on whether they were acting as advisers or simply as
counterparties. In the latter case, there was no 'best advice' requirement.
'Of course, commercial considerations may narrow the difference, but it must
be correct for the precise nature of the relationship to be made clear from
the beginning. Beyond that, caveat emptor,' Mr Quinn said.
He said the use of derivatives would probably grow further 'albeit, perhaps
at a less hectic pace'. The rate of growth would depend on treatment by
financial regulators, and whether the number of market-makers grew.
He said there were signs the differences between exchange trade products and
over-the-counter derivatives were being eroded, with the development of more
customised exchange products such as Flex contracts in Chicago.
Separately, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse said yesterday derivatives
were not excessively risky for companies to use, provided they took
appropriate care.
Mr Andrew Coleman, a partner at the firm, said any company looking to manage
risks should 'ensure that the appropriate risk culture is in place, that
risk management policies are set and compliance monitored'.
He said these requirements were the responsibility of senior management.
Senior executives had to have a detailed understanding of the risks the
business was trying to manage and the hedging techniques it was adopting.
In a number of recent cases, companies had incurred losses through the use
of derivatives which seemed to involve types of interest rate swaps with an
option embedded in the structure, Mr Coleman said.
'If the user is not sophisticated enough to recognise and control these
risks, they could easily be overlooked in a company's internal review,' he
said.
He said the swap market was evolving too rapidly for some players to keep
pace. Many companies were now relying on banks to help them value some of
the more exotic derivative products.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Bonds: GrandMet braves unease to launch
Dollars 1.2bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several companies issued dollar-denominated debt yesterday, braving a choppy
international bond market.
Grand Metropolitan, the large UK food and drink group, returned for the
second time within a week to issue Dollars 1.2bn of zero-coupon 10-year
paper in the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign
borrowers.
The offer is GrandMet's first zero-coupon funding and one of the largest
such offerings in the market. It is part of the company's strategy to
develop a longer-term portfolio of debt.
Bookrunner Goldman Sachs, which controlled about three-quarters of the
allocation, said its own quota had been nearly two times subscribed. The
bonds were priced at 46.55 with an effective yield of 8.1 per cent.
They are expected to raise some Dollars 600m for GrandMet, and were targeted
at US insurance and pension groups which are required to hold a certain
amount of zero-coupon paper in their portfolios.
Short-dated dollar paper was also in vogue. AT&amp;T, the double-A rated US
telecommunications company, offered Dollars 400m of two-year paper priced to
yield 18 basis points above US Treasuries.
When CS First Boston broke syndicate, the yield spread on the bonds narrowed
 -an unusual situation in the current market. By the end of trading in
London, the spread had come down to around 10 basis points.
Ford Motor Credit offered Dollars 150m of three-year debt priced to yield 45
basis points above Treasuries. The deal was announced before lead manager
Deutsche Bank had formed a syndicate, and dealers said that the pricing was
too aggressive. One commented: 'It equates to Libor plus 20 (basis points)
and you can already buy all the Ford paper you want at Libor plus 25.'
Toyota Motor Credit Corp was rumoured to be planning a short-dated dollar
issue. Dealers said the Japanese car company was expected to offer some
Dollars 200m of three-year paper through a Swiss bank.
The World Bank chose the Eurolira sector to launch its structured
medium-term note programme, announced in February. It achieved sub-Libor
funding by swapping the proceeds of the L 150bn offering of seven-year
reverse floating-rate notes. The issuer has the option to exchange the notes
into a straight FRN at the end of the second year.
The bonds, via BNL, traded at 99.43, 10 basis points within fees, despite
the slump in Italian government bond futures yesterday afternoon.
Moody's Investors Service upgraded the long-term foreign currency debt of
the Czech Republic, to Baa2 from Baa3. Moody's said the Republic was making
progress towards becoming a full market economy and had integrated quickly
into the world trade system.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sankyo ahead in dull drugs
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese drugs companies saw sluggish profits for the year to last March,
due to a fall in sales of antibiotics as the number of flu patients in the
second half fell sharply from the previous year.
A steep fall in purchases ahead of the price cuts implemented last month by
the ministry of health and welfare also affected sales during the six months
to March.
Takeda Chemical Industries said unconsolidated sales fell in all units
except its overseas medical drug division. Operating profits rose 5.3 per
cent to Y66.8bn (Dollars 639m), due to a Y1.9bn cut in advertising expenses
and a fall in prices of raw materials.
However, a fall in financial items hurt pre-tax profits and after-tax
earnings rose 17.3 per cent to Y37bn.
Sankyo posted a firm non-consolidated earnings rise on the back of profits
from Mevalotin, its antihyper-lipedemic, in spite of an overall sales
decline due to the transfer of its antiallergic cures to Sandoz. After-tax
profits rose 30.6 per cent to Y36.9bn.
Parent sales at Shionogi declined due to a fall in antibiotic sales, but
earnings rose thanks to cost cutting and streamlining its management
personnel. After-tax profits rose 22.2 per cent to Y10.3bn as a result of a
fall in corporate taxes.
Yamanouchi's sales were supported by strong demand for its stomach ulcer
drugs. However, the fall in financial income due to lower interest rates
depressed pre-tax profits. After-tax profits rose 1.5 per cent to Y27.6bn.
Earnings at Fujisawa were hit by the decline in antibiotic sales and
sluggish exports due to the strong yen. Net profits, however, soared 71.8
times to Y100bn due to sales of its product rights and stake in
Fujisawa-Astra, the joint venture with Astra, the Swedish drug group.
For the current year to March, the companies face a squeeze on sales and
profits due to the government's official drug price cuts. The amount of
drugs prescribed is likely to be hit due to stricter limits on consultation
fees reimbursed to doctors by the health ministry.
Mr Yoshihide Yoda, pharmaceutical analyst at UBS Securities, forecasts a 5
per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the industry, while the size of the
market is expected to grow by 2 per cent.
Takeda forecasts a 6.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits while sales are
expected to remain almost unchanged at Y565bn, Sankyo sees pre-tax profits
rising 3.3 per cent to Y83bn on a flat growth in sales to Y396bn.
Shionogi expects earnings to fall 15.2 per cent to Y19.5bn on a 2.7 per cent
decline in sales to Y224bn and Yamanouchi predicts earnings to remain almost
flat at Y54.5bn on a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y265bn.
Fujisawa forecasts a 9.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y18bn on a 3.3
per cent rise in sales to Y227bn.

<TEXT>
NSK, Japan's largest maker of ball-bearings, yesterday reported a 20 per
cent fall in pre-tax profit for the 12 months to March, but forecast a
slight recovery this year.
The group had to sell securities to keep its published earnings in the
black, a technique used by many Japanese companies to tide them through the
longest decline in operating earnings since the second world war.
NSK's taxable profits fell to Y3.33bn (Dollars 32m), on sales down by 8.4
per cent to Y325.16bn. The pre-tax profit includes a Y7.3bn capital gain
from securities sales, said Mr Shunji Saigo, managing director.
Sales of bearings and parts to the car industry fell by 9 per cent and
demand from the electrical and information equipment industry was poor, he
said.
Earnings rose from Y4.47 per share in 1992 to Y6.43 last year. The dividend
is to be cut from an uncovered Y7 per share to a barely covered Y6 per
share.
In the current year, NSK expects pre-tax profit to show a small recovery to
Y3.5bn, on sales up to Y330bn.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Wesfarmers offers ADollars 275m
for Bunnings
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wesfarmers, the Australian diversified rural products and services group,
yesterday announced a ADollars 275m-plus bid for the outstanding 51.9 per
cent which it does not already own of Bunnings, the Perth-based forest
products, manufacturing and merchandising company. The offer, which
comprises a mixture of cash, shares and options, values the whole of
Bunnings at more than ADollars 535m (USDollars 394m).
Under the terms of the bid, Wesfarmers is proposing to offer ADollars 22.60
in cash plus two of its own shares and an option to subscribe for one
Wesfarmers share at ADollars 12.50 by end-December 1997, in exchange for
every four Bunnings shares held.
It noted that this represented a premium over the average Bunnings market
price of ADollars 9.53 during the past month, and a 'substantial increase'
over the ADollars 3.55 a share offer which Wesfarmers made for Bunnings back
in February 1992. The news came after the stock market closed yesterday;
Wesfarmers shares were down 6 cents at ADollars 9.34, while Bunnings were 4
cents lower at ADollars 10.16.
Wesfarmers, which first acquired an interest in Bunnings in 1987 and has had
three board representatives since it raised its stake significantly in 1992,
said it believed that Bunnings' future would 'be enhanced by being a
wholly-owned member of the Wesfarmers' group', although it would continue to
treat Bunnings as 'an independent business unit' with its own corporate
identity.
Wesfarmers' earlier offer for Bunnings, in 1992, was rejected by the target
company. Last night, Bunnings reacted cautiously to the new bid, saying that
the offer would be discussed at a board meeting today.

losses rise

<TEXT>
Both the president and chairman of Kanebo, the Japanese
cosmetics-to-textiles company, are to resign their posts following a much
larger pre-tax loss and lower sales in the 1993-94 year compared with a year
earlier.
The company said the two were taking responsibility for the company's poor
performance last year and its decision to pass its dividend. The moves were
aimed at winning employee co-operation for wide-ranging restructuring plans
the company is likely to adopt in an effort to return to profitability.
Both men will stay with the company. Mr Masao Nagata, president, replaces Mr
Kazutomo Ishizawa as chairman. Mr Ishizawa becomes honorary adviser. The
senior managing director, Mr Soichi Ishihara, becomes president.
Kanebo suffered an 18 per cent drop in unconsolidated sales to Y418.9bn
(Dollars 4bn), from a previous Y510.1bn, in the year to March 1994. Pre-tax
losses ballooned to Y6.7bn from Y4.5bn, and the company fell into a net loss
of Y3.7bn compared with a net profit of Y1.6bn in the previous year.
Sales had been depressed by the weakness of the Japanese economy with sales
of textiles particularly hard hit by slow consumer demand for clothing since
the Japanese economy plunged into recession.
Sales of textiles, which make up about 45 per cent of overall sales, dropped
22 per cent as the company was also hit by cheaper imports from Asian
countries such as Pakistan, Korea, China.
The pharmaceuticals and new materials businesses held up but cosmetics,
which accounts for 37 per cent of sales, made a loss. Foods, a smaller
business for Kanebo, fell 57 per cent.
Efforts to restructure the business area under way. The company has
introduced cost reductions, is keeping a lid on new recruitment and moving
production overseas in a bid to improve profitability.
Kanebo forecasts higher sales in the current year at Y420bn, and larger
pre-tax and net losses of Y9.8bn and Y7.8bn respectively.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: NSW State Bank sale details due
in August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An announcement on the future of the State Bank of New South Wales, the
fifth-largest bank in Australia and due to be privatised by the state
government, will be made in August, according to state treasurer, Mr Peter
Collins.
He said that legislation, including the name of the bidder and the sale
price, would be put before the state parliament in September.
The sale is proving troublesome, with many of the interested bidders pulling
out of the bidding in recent weeks. Only one name is known to be left -
Colonial Mutual, the insurance group - while Australia's four big national
banks were barred from entering the auction at the outset.
Earlier this week, the NSW premier, Mr John Fahey, indicated that the
government might be willing to delay the sale to get a better price.
However, Mr Collins denied yesterday that the gov-ernment was backing down
on the sale or planning to defer it.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Packer raises stake in winning
casino rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman who lost a joint bid to develop
the new ADollars 1bn-plus (USDollars 736m) Sydney casino earlier this month,
has raised his underlying interest in Crown Casino, the company currently
developing the rival Melbourne property.
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Mr Packer's Consolidated
Press said that a further 16.7m shares had been acquired, raising its
interest, along with that of its associates, from 62.47 per cent to 67.23
per cent. The shares were bought at a price of ADollars 1.49.
Ahead of the latest purchases, which were rumoured to have taken place
earlier this week, ConsPress owned around 22 per cent of Crown, while its
associate, Hudson Conway, owned 26.4 per cent. ConsPress also has an option
over some further shares.
Crown won the right to build the ADollars 750m Melbourne casino last year,
which, when completed, will be one of the world's largest gaming properties
with 200 tables and 2,500 machines.
The casino is being built on the banks of Yarra River, which flows through
the Victorian city.
Mr Packer, who had teamed up with Circus Circus, the large US gaming group,
was the surprise loser in the fight for the even larger Sydney casino
development. His bid was beaten by the Leighton Holdings/Showboat
consortium.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japan Tobacco bucks trend with
10.9% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan Tobacco, the state-owned cigarette group aiming for privatisation this
year, yesterday bucked the trend of a grim results season and reported a
sharp rise in annual profits.
Taxable profits at the group, the world's third-largest tobacco company,
rose by 10.9 per cent to Y110.45bn (Dollars 1.06bn) in the year to the end
of March, mainly due to cost reductions, on sales up by 1.6 per cent to
Y3,462bn.
The small increase in turnover reflects the fact that Japan's tobacco
market, where Japan Tobacco holds an 83 per cent share, is mature. But the
group has lowered its break-even point by cutting staff and reducing the
number of outlets in a restructuring programme which began in 1985.
However, pre-tax profits for the current year are expected to stagnate at
around Y110bn, said the group, on sales up slightly to Y3,500bn.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Tepco surprises with profit rise
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the world's largest private sector electric
utility company, reported a slight increase in pre-tax profits for the year
to March 31. Unconsolidated pre-tax earnings were Y159.9bn (Dollars 1.5bn),
up 1 per cent on the previous year, on turnover higher by 0.4 per cent at
Y4,721bn.
The figures surprised analysts, who had expected a difficult economic and
regulatory environment to be reflected in lower earnings. Last autumn, Tepco
was required by the government to cut its charges to offset windfall gains
caused by the appreciation of the yen. A large proportion of the company's
costs are oil imports, which fell in price as the yen rose, and Tepco's
tariffs were reduced by an average 1.6 per cent.
Higher demand brought on by a cold winter partially offset the impact of
lower prices, but the overall effect was to depress operating profit by 2.5
per cent.
However, sharply lower interest rates boosted earnings at the pre-tax level.
Like most utility companies, Tepco carries a heavy debt burden, and the
steep fall in the cost of borrowing throughout the year cut interest costs.
A company spokesman said that debt service costs were around Y4bn lower than
had been forecast at the half-year.
The company expects a difficult 1994. Last week the government announced
that utility charges would be frozen for the coming year, and Tepco forecast
a 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y140bn.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sluggish earnings for JR East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East Japan Railway (JR East), the semi-privatised railway group, posted
sluggish earnings figures for the year to last March due to a decline in
revenue from its passenger operations.
Consolidated pre-tax profits fell 1.8 per cent to Y108.6bn (Dollars 1bn), on
a 0.4 per cent fall in the group's revenue to Y2,343.35bn. After-tax profits
fell 0.2 per cent to Y56.7bn.
The company said its poor performance in the railway operations eroded the
gains from sales increases in its kiosks, travel agent and real estate
leasing division.
On a non-consolidated basis, JR East posted a 0.6 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y101.5bn thanks to a Y20bn fall in interest payments due to lower
interest rates. Revenues fell 0.3 per cent fall to Y1,974.35bn and after-tax
profits fell 0.4 per cent to Y56.7bn.
For the current year to next March, the company expects consolidated pre-tax
profits to remain almost flat, down 0.8 per cent to Y109.6bn, on a 6.7 per
cent rise in sales to Y2,502.5bn.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Kumagai Gumi hit by investment
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kumagai Gumi, the internationally ambitious Japanese property developer and
construction company, yesterday reported a 20.56 per cent decline in taxable
profits and forecast worse to come.
Taxable profits, which have been hit by an unprecedented long decline in
capital investment by Kumagai Gumi's Japanese industrial customers, fell to
Y23.56bn (Dollars 224.38m) in the year to March, from Y29.65bn in the
previous year.
Net profits fell even more steeply, after a higher-than-forecast Y33.56bn
extraordinary loss on the cost of pulling out of poorly performing projects
in Europe and Asia and the reorganisation of its south-east Asian
businesses.
This brought net earnings down by 88 per cent over the year to Y1.09bn, or
Y1.6 per share, from Y13.29 per share in the previous year. As a result
Kumagai Gumi was obliged to slash its dividend from Y9 to Y3 per share.
Directors, consequently, have given up their bonuses.
The result highlights the twin problem faced by several leading Japanese
contractors, faced with a weak home market and losses on overseas
developments undertaken during the fast growth in asset prices of the late
1980s.
Kumagai Gumi's formerly dwindling stock of new orders recovered slightly
over the year, by 1.7 per cent to Y865.5bn. This was entirely due to a 10
per cent rise in public sector orders, responding to the government's public
spending packages. Civil engineering contracts from the private sector
dipped, the group said.
Sales fell by 21.9 per cent to Y842bn, due to a sharp decline in orders for
office property and industry buildings and are expected to decline again
this year, to Y840bn.
All this indicates that pre-tax profits will fall by 36.3 per cent to Y15bn
in the current year, it warned.
Moreover, the group plans to sell another Y50bn of overseas holdings,
reducing the total to Y440bn, on which it expects to book a Y23bn
extraordinary loss.
Accordingly, net earnings in the current year to next March are forecast to
fall by 8 per cent to Y1bn.
Of last year's Y33.56bn extraordinary loss, Y10.7bn comes from the sale of
Thames Exchange in London, to Scottish Amicable, a UK insurance and
investment group.
Another Y6bn was due to the sale of a stake in a Frankfurt property
developer.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Viag forecasts a full recovery
by year-end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Viag, the German industrial conglomerate, yesterday said it was on the way
to a full recovery following a 19 per cent drop in group profits to DM302m
(Dollars 183.27) from DM371m the year before. The dividend will remain
unchanged at DM9.
Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, chief executive, said profits in the first quarter of
this year rose about 33 per cent and were expected to grow at the same level
for the year overall. He said the group's industrial sectors, including
aluminium and chemical units, were performing particularly well.
Viag said it was 'confident' it would win the bid for a data transmission
contract, due to be awarded by the post ministry later this month.
In July the company will complete its takeover of Bayernwerk, Germany's
third largest utility, for which it will pay the Bavarian government
DM5.515bn, including a cash payment of DM2.3bn.
Viag said the deal was 'not cheap', but 'still pretty attractive' given
Bayernwerk's annual pre-tax profits of about DM1bn and the high liquidity of
the electricity generation business. The takeover of Bayernwerk will
increase group turnover to about DM40bn, moving Viag into the top 10 German
companies in sales terms.
Mr Pfeiffer said the company would still consider acquisitions to extend its
chemicals unit but this would only happen once Bayernwerk had been fully
consolidated.
Group turnover in 1993 fell two per cent to DM23.7bn, from DM24.3bn the year
before, due to losses in the aluminium and packaging operations. The company
has spent DM120m on redundancy costs for about 10 per cent of its workforce
and said it would shed a further 4,000 jobs this year.

<TEXT>
The turnround at TNT, the Australian transport and delivery services group,
has continued in the third quarter, allowing the company to post an
operating profit before abnormal items of ADollars 28.9m (Dollars 21.26m) on
an equity consolidated basis, for the nine months to end-March.
This compares with a loss of ADollars 41.5m in the same period of 1992-93.
Revenues during the period reached ADollars 4.27bn, compared with ADollars
4.07bn a year ago. The equity-consolidated operating profit before tax was
ADollars 104.3m, up from ADollars 4.2m in the first nine months of 1992-93.
TNT said yesterday that the progress was largely due to improved earnings at
Ansett, the Australian airline which it owns jointly with Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation, and reduced losses from its GD Express Worldwide
joint venture, the international express delivery business formed by TNT and
a consortium of overseas post offices.
On a consolidated basis - ignoring the impact of associate companies - the
picture looked less rosy: TNT's operating profit before tax appeared to have
increased only marginally, from ADollars 28.8m to ADollars 30m. But the
company said that the 1992-93 figure included 'substantial' non-recurring
profits and revenues resulting from TNT Leisure's involvement in Expo '92
and the 1992 Olympic Games. It said that there was an underlying profit
improvement of ADollars 19.7m at the pre-tax level, once this factor was
removed.
TNT said that many of its operations, including those in Australia, North
America, the UK and Germany, were seeing an improvement. The Italian
business traded 'in line with expectations' and TNT Chronoservice in France,
continued to reduce losses. But Spain remained 'disappointing', with
increased losses.

<TEXT>
Carter Holt Harvey, the forestry group which has interests in New Zealand
and Chile, yesterday reported a 34 per cent rise in tax-paid profits to
NZDollars 325m (USDollars 191.16m), reflecting cost-cutting and efficiency
measures over the past 12 months, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The chief executive, Mr David Oskin, said that during the coming year the
company intended to extend its operations into offshore markets in
Australia, Asia and South America and to take aim to become a leading force
within the Pacific Rim area.
Operating earnings before interest and tax rose 55 per cent to NZDollars
368m.
Turnover was NZDollars 2,476m, against NZDollars 2,461m a year ago, and tax
was NZDollars 90m, up from NZDollars 19m.
International Paper of New York manages Carter Holt Harvey and is the
biggest shareholder with 24 per cent.
In March, Brierley Investments effectively wound down the joint venture
which controlled the company by selling International Paper an 8 per cent
stake. BIL retains 7 per cent.

The assets involved are a 20 per cent interest in the Golden Grove joint

Darwin. Posgold had said it was putting the assets up for auction, but
yesterday announced no outside bidders had emerged for Golden Grove and only

<TEXT>
Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, increased first-half pre-tax profits by 5 per
cent to DKr731m (Dollars 113m) in the six months to March 31, compared with
the year-ago figure of DKr694m, but warned that the improvement might not be
maintained in the second half.
The group attributed the improvement to better-than-expected performances by
several of its breweries. However, Carlsberg-Tetley, its joint venture in
the UK with Allied Lyons, was hit by falling beer consumption and a small
loss of market share.
First-half group sales were ahead by 8 per cent to DKr7.87bn.
Carlsberg said that extensive restructuring plans were on schedule and would
result in operating economies in coming years, which would more than offset
depreciation and interest in the investments.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sharp first-half improvement at
ANZ Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, one of the big four
Australian banks, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in first-half
operating profits after tax but before abnormal items, at ADollars 363.8m
(USDollars 267.7m).
This figure compared with ADollars 170.3m in the same period of the previous
year, and ADollars 289.4m in the following six months to end-September.
After abnormals, profits were unchanged in the most recent period, although
they were reduced to ADollars 72.1m in the corresponding period of the
previous year.
Like National Australia Bank and Westpac, which reported interim figures
last week, ANZ attributed the improvement to the recovery in the domestic
economy and to declining bad and doubtful debts.
'The profit levels we are back to are reasonable and respectable, although
that's not to say that there won't be further improvement,' said Mr Don
Mercer, ANZ's chief executive, yesterday.
ANZ's net interest income in the six months was ADollars 1.39bn, up from
ADollars 1.23bn in the previous year. Other operating income rose from
A951.3m to ADollars 1bn, while operating expenses increased by 3.3 per cent,
to ADollars 1.58bn. Specific provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell from
ADollars 377.4m a year ago, to ADollars 220.5m, and ANZ's total non-accrual
loans by end-March stood at ADollars 2.86bn, compared with ADollars 4.89m a
year earlier.
This left operating profit before tax at ADollars 570.8m, up from ADollars
249.1m a year ago. On a divisional basis, ANZ reported good profits growth
from its Australian and international operations. Profits in New Zealand
declined, however, due to a competitive squeeze on margins, although Mr
Mercer said that the performance in that country had been 'very solid' under
the circumstances.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank of Montreal rises 9% in
second quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Montreal opened the second-quarter reporting season of Canada's Big
Six banks yesterday by posting a 9 per cent rise in earnings.
The improvement was attributed largely to higher volumes and a drop in
loan-loss provisions. However, it was partly offset by slimmer margins,
especially in money market operations, and a 6 per cent rise in non-interest
expenses.
Net income grew to CDollars 188m (USDollars 136.2m), or 69 cents a share, in
the three months to April 30, from CDollars 173m, or 63 cents, a year
earlier. Return on common equity fell slightly to 14 per cent from 14.2 per
cent, while return on assets rose to 0.66 per cent from 0.62 per cent.
Loan-loss provisions fell to CDollars 157m from CDollars 163m.
Non-performing loans, totalling CDollars 247m, were 11 per cent down on the
previous three months.
Assets grew 14.5 per cent over the past year, to CDollars 124.8bn on April
30.
The bank, whose interests include Harris Bankcorp of Chicago, said the
strongest growth during the quarter came from Nesbitt Thomson, its
securities arm, and Canadian residential mortgages and mid-market commercial
loans.

<TEXT>
A spate of proposed price increases has firmly tilted the balance of power
in North American and European pulp and paper markets towards producers.
International Paper, the world's biggest paper company, based in Purchase,
New York, last week announced plans to cut discounts on coated groundwood
paper by about 7 per cent on July 1.
The rise coincides with the peak ordering period for mail-order and
Christmas catalogues. It would be the first increase for this grade of paper
in four years.
In the newsprint market, US and Canadian producers plan to cut discounts by
between 6 per cent and 7 per cent on August 15, the second price increase
this year.
Sizeable increases are also scheduled for linerboard and corrugating medium,
used to make cardboard boxes.
In Europe, producers of coated grades made from chemical pulp are pushing
for a 10 per cent price rise on top of hikes of between 15 per cent and 20
per cent over the past six months.
The shift in bargaining power is illustrated by Fletcher Challenge Canada's
decision not to renew a long-term newsprint contract with Times Mirror,
publisher of the Los Angeles Times.
According to one paper consultant, Times Mirror, which gained a reputation
during the past recession as one of the toughest bargainers among newsprint
buyers, has yet to find another supplier willing to provide long-term
protection against further price increases.

Magna International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, posted
record sales and earnings for the third quarter ended April 30, reflecting
strong north American car sales, improved margins, lower finance costs and
greater efficiency.
The European plants are breaking even and are expected to pick up with the
economy.
Third-quarter net profit was CDollars 72.4m or Dollars 1.18 a share, up 63
per cent from a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1bn, up 36 per cent. The
quarterly dividend is being raised to 26 cents a share from 20 cents.
Nine-month net profit rose 68 per cent to CDollars 169.2m or CDollars 2.82 a
share on sales up 29 per cent to CDollars 2.5bn.
Capital outlay was CDollars 135m in the third quarter, including buying
Austria's Zipperle and 11 per cent of Atoma in North America from
Mitsubishi. Zipperle has sales of about CDollars 150m. Magna sells parts and
assemblies to car and light truck makers.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Comcast UK's IPO postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Plans by Comcast UK Cable Partners to raise funds through a secondary share
issue in the US were put on hold yesterday when underwriters postponed the
sale because of poor conditions in the market for initial public offerings
of stock.
The decision comes at a crucial time for cable companies in the UK which
have announced, or are considering, flotations in London.
Comcast UK Cable Partners, a unit of the Philadelphia-based cable
communications group Comcast, had initially planned to sell 11.75m shares
for up to Dollars 18 each.
The US IPO market, however, has been extremely weak in recent months, and
the underwriters, led by investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
struggled to find buyers.
Comcast is believed to have set a floor for the issue of around Dollars 14 a
share, and when investors showed little interest at that level, the offering
was postponed.
Analysts in New York were not overly concerned by the postponement. Ms
Jessica Reif, cable industry analyst at the US brokerage house Oppenheimer,
said: 'The economics of the business are still sound . . . It was just that
the IPO market stinks.'
In London analysts acknowledged that the Comcast decision might have an
impact on the timing of some flotations although they expect the debut of
TeleWest, the UK's largest cable operator, to go ahead next month as
planned.
Most said they did not expect it to affect the valuation of TeleWest which
is believed to have strong institutional support.
Last month TeleWest, a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest
cable operator, and US West, the American telephone company, confirmed its
plans to come to market through a global share offering expected to value
the group at around Pounds 1.7bn (Dollars 2.55bn).
TeleWest plans to seek a full listing for its shares on the London Stock
Exchange and a registration of American depository shares on Nasdaq.
Yesterday Mr Alan Michels, TeleWest chief executive, dismissed suggestions
that the postponed Comcast secondary issue would have any effect on its
plans, arguing that TeleWest was 'a special case'.
'We will still get a good reception in both the UK and US markets,' he said.
The company and its financial advisers will be meeting institutional
investors over the next few days and are expected to price the issue
shortly.

Scandinavian Airlines System said yesterday it was on course for its first
profit in five years following a dramatic improvement in its first-quarter
figures.
Although the airline remained in the red, pre-tax losses fell to SKr101m
(Dollars 13.07m) from SKr1.53bn. The result reflected higher traffic
volumes, cost-cutting, exchange gains and lower interest costs.
The airline expects the improvement to continue, despite intense
competition, as the second and third quarters are traditionally stronger
than the first. Confidence is based on an improving traffic trend and the
impact of tough restructuring.
First-quarter group revenues were SKr8.99bn, compared with SKr8.67bn, while
operating losses after depreciation were cut to SKr84m from SKr651m.
All business units showed better results, but the improvement was felt most
in the core flying operations. Traffic was 5 per cent higher and yields were
up 3 per cent.
There was also a much better financial performance. The stronger krona
produced a SKr200m unrealised exchange gain, compared with a SKr500m loss in
the first quarter of 1993. Interest costs fell to SKr194m from SKr465m due
to lower interest rates and a SKr2bn reduction in net debt since the start
of the year.

<TEXT>
A spate of proposed price increases has firmly tilted the balance of power
in North American and European pulp and paper markets towards producers.
International Paper, the world's biggest paper company, based in Purchase,
New York, last week announced plans to cut discounts on coated groundwood
paper by about 7 per cent on July 1.
The planned price hike coincides with the peak ordering period for
mail-order and Christmas catalogues. If implemented, it would be the first
increase for this grade of paper in four years.
In the newsprint market, US and Canadian producers plan to cut discounts by
between 6 per cent and 7 per cent on August 15, the second price increase
this year.
Sizeable increases are also scheduled for linerboard and corrugating medium,
used to make cardboard boxes. The proposed USDollars 40 per ton hike for
linerboard is the third - and biggest - since last October. It would bring
the price to Dollars 385 per ton, up from Dollars 290 last autumn.
In Europe, producers of coated grades made from chemical pulp are pushing
for a 10 per cent price rise on top of hikes of 15-20 per cent over the past
six months.
Producers will not necessarily succeed in pushing through the full
increases. Prices of some grades, such as tissue, remain weak.
But the size of the planned rises points to a more prolonged tightening in
paper markets than most observers expected. 'The situation could continue
for a while,' said Mr Mads Asprem, analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. Mr
Asprem has backed away from forecasts that pulp prices will turn down this
autumn.
Mr Ross Hay-Roe, analyst at Equity Research Associates in Vancouver, says
that a combination of rising demand and shrinking capacity has brought the
North American newsprint market into balance for the first time since 1988.
Mr Hay-Roe predicted in his latest market commentary that 'there won't be
enough newsprint to go around' if the US economy keeps growing.
The shift in bargaining power is illustrated by Fletcher Challenge Canada's
decision not to renew a long-term newsprint contract with Times Mirror,
publisher of the Los Angeles Times.
According to one paper consultant, Times Mirror, which gained a reputation
as one of the toughest bargainers among buyers, has yet to find another
supplier willing to provide long-term protection against further price
increases.

Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest electric power utilities earned
CDollars 643m (USDollars 465.9m) in the first quarter, up 23.7 per cent from
a year earlier, as harsh winter weather boosted domestic and export demand.
Electricity sales rose 8.4 per cent by volume and revenues 8.2 per cent to
CDollars 2.3bn. Sales in Quebec rose 3.8 per cent by volume and revenues by
6.4 per cent. A rate rise generated an additional CDollars 32m in the latest
period.
Revenues from power exports, mainly to the US, but also other provinces,
were up 4.4 per cent to CDollars 144m.
Spending rose 3.3 per cent largely because new generating and transmission
equipment came on stream, increasing depreciation and amortisation.
Tight controls held operating costs steady, while taxes were up 7.5 per
cent. The utility cut staff, controlled overtime strictly and began a pay
freeze.
Hydro-Quebec, 100 per cent owned by the Quebec government, invested CDollars
629m in the quarter, down from CDollars 755m a year earlier. Total
investment in 1994 will be CDollars 3.86bn, against CDollars 4bn last time,
mostly for James Bay hydro expansion and for the distribution system. Many
large projects are nearing completion.
The utility arranged a CDollars 1bn global issue and total 1994 borrowing
will be almost CDollars 3bn.
Cancellation of a US export contract to take effect in 1999 will not affect
the utility's construction programme. An existing 800 MW contract may be
extended beyond 1998 expiry.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Iberia, Lufthansa in talks on
closer co-operation
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iberia, Spain's state-owned national airline, is negotiating a wide-ranging
commercial agreement with Germany's Lufthansa.
The talks form the third leg of a series of preliminary agreements also
involving United Airlines of the US. The US carrier has already announced
co-operation pacts with both Lufthansa and Iberia.
A senior Iberia source said the aim of the Lufthansa talks was to establish
as close a co-operation on routes, ticket sales and promotion as is allowed
by the European Unions' anti-cartel limits.
A share swap between the two national carriers was not a 'primary
objective', the source said, and 'would not, in any case, occur in the short
term'.
Iberia sees Lufthansa as its ideal European partner because the routes of
the two airlines, weighted towards east Europe and the Middle East in the
case of the German airline and Central and South America in Iberia's, are
complementary. The airlines share historic bonds going back to the 1920s.
The Lufthansa agreement will make little impact on Iberia's balance sheet
but it could bring additional business to its hub it operates in Miami and
to destinations in the Caribbean and Central America. The hub has incurred
heavy losses. The source said a decision would be taken at the end of the
year on whether to sell it to United Airlines.
The Spanish carrier is also hoping to dispose of part of its 80 per cent
shareholding in Aerolneas Argentinas.
Iberia hopes to halve its losses this year to around Pta30bn (Dollars 220m).

Celsius, the Swedish defence group privatised last year, yesterday announced
a 20 per cent increase in first - quarter profits to SKr186m (Dollars
24.07m).
The group said rationalisation had driven the results from SKr155m a year
ago, allowing it to compensate for reduced financial income.
An improved business climate and the group's emphasis on high technology
niches enabled sales to reach SKr3.1bn, up SKr200m. The order intake rose to
SKr2.5bn from SKr1.8bn partly due to the recent acquisition of Enator, a
data technology group.
Operating profit more than doubled to SKr146m from SKr58m, even though the
contribution from associate companies fell to SKr10m from SKr26m. Lower
interest rates meant financial income was SKr57m lower at SKr40m.
The group predicted that its full-year result would exceed last year's
SKr721m. It expects higher sales and increased efficiency to compensate for
reduced financial income and a lower contribution from associate companies.

<TEXT>
Avtovaz, the Russian carmaker which produces the Lada, yesterday signed a
Dollars 100m medium-term loan facility from Standard Chartered Bank. The
loan is the third Avtovaz has negotiated with western banks over the past
year, bringing its total western borrowing to Dollars 350m.
Avtovaz, which produces some 7 per cent of Russia's GNP, was the first
Russian manufacturer to borrow directly from western banks without Russian
government guarantees.
Yesterday's loan is a seven-year revolving facility and is secured against
Avtovaz's exports.
Mr Nikolai Glouchkov, deputy general-director of Avtovaz, said high
inflation and interest rates in Russia compel domestic companies to seek
western financing for medium or long-term infrastructure projects.
The transaction was structured and arranged by European Capital, a UK
merchant bank.
Standard Chartered Bank is providing Dollars 100m to LM International
Finance, a private Luxembourg company, jointly owned by Avtovaz, Mannai
Corporation, a private Middle Eastern company, and Avtovazbank. LM
International Finance will then lend the money to Avtovaz.

56%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A big reduction in credit losses enabled Skopbank, the Finnish state-owned
bank, to cut its operating loss by 56 per cent to FM216m (Dollars 39.95m) in
the first four months from FM488m a year ago.
It expects to remain in the red for the rest of the year, although the 1994
deficit will be around half last year's FM1.6bn total.
The drop in credit losses to FM207m from FM526m reflected an improving
Finnish economy and lower interest rates. Non-performing assets totalled
FM2.27bn at the end of April, against FM3.97bn a year earlier.
The bank, the biggest casualty of the Finnish banking crisis, said income
from financial operations fell to FM82m from FM117m due mainly to a FM33m
loss on bonds.

metal group
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Metallgesellschaft dropped 15 per cent yesterday following the
disclosure on Tuesday night that the Frankfurt-based group will have to make
fresh provisions to cover newly-identified risks arising from its oil
operations in north America.
The group's shares fell DM40 to DM220 in after-market trading - a quarter
lower than the year's high of DM292 reached last week but still well above
the low point of DM175 to which they fell in the aftermath of its DM3.4bn
(Dollars 2bn) rescue package this January.
The metals, mining and industrial group refused yesterday to put a figure to
the new provisions. In its statement on Tuesday it said it planned to sell
its 80 per cent stake in the Buderus engineering company and other assets to
make the new provisions and cover the costs of further restructuring charges
in its German smelting activities.
Buderus made pre-tax profits of DM133m last year on sales of DM2.77bn. A
manufacturer of heating equipment and other products used primarily by the
building trade, it has a market capitalisation of DM1.6bn, valuing
Metallgesellschaft's 80 per cent stake at DM1.28bn. The sale of the stake is
likely to take place in the next few weeks.
'Metallgesellschaft's problems were meant to have been cleared up,' said one
analyst, who predicted that the provision could amount to DM1bn or more.
Metallgesellschaft said the new provisions arose as a result of contracts
made between MG Corp, a Metallgesellschaft subsidiary in New York, and
Castle Energy Corporation, an oil-refinery in which MG Corp owns a minority
stake.
This has no connection with MG Corp's oil futures trading which incurred
total losses of DM2.3bn in 1993-94, bringing Metallgesellschaft to the brink
of bankruptcy earlier this year.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Spain to make offering of Repsol
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government is to make an international offering of Repsol shares
in the last quarter of this year that could raise between Pta200bn and
Pta300bn (Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 2.2bn), Mr Oscar Fanjul, chairman of the
state-controlled energy and chemicals group said yesterday.
The size of the offer suggests that INH, the state's energy holding company,
is considering reducing its present 41 per cent stake in Repsol to close to
20 per cent. Mr Fanjul said he expected INH to decide in the near future the
extent of the offer.
Last year, INH realised Pta110bn when it reduced its equity in Repsol from
54 per cent to 41 per cent through an international placing.
Repsol is at present completing the acquisition by Gas Natural, its gas
distribution subsidiary, of Enagas, the fully state-owned monopoly supplier
of industrial gas.
Gas Natural, which is 45 per cent owned by Repsol, is likely to pay about
Pta80bn for Enagas's main business and will have the option to acquire a
Pta300bn pipeline being built linking Spain, via Morocco, to Algeria's
natural gas fields.
Mr Fanjul said the acquisition would be announced shortly after final
details on pricing and consumption had been resolved between Enagas and
Spain's electricity utilities.
The main obstacle to the acquisition had been Enagas's commitment to the
1,265km pipeline which Gas Natural was unwilling to undertake. This has been
resolved by the creation of a separate public company, Sagane, which will
build the pipeline.
Repsol has the option to buy Sagane from INH, the company's present owner,
when the pipeline becomes operational.
The acquisition of Enagas completes a 10-year long diversification by Repsol
into the domestic gas business. Gas Natural controls 41 per cent of natural
gas sales in Spain. After the takeover, it will have close to 90 per cent.
Gas Natural's contribution to Repsol's operating income rose from 9 per cent
in 1989 to 25 per cent last year.
Repsol increased its 1993 net profit by 11.4 per cent to Pta80.1nbn and its
first-quarter net profit this year by 11.6 per cent to Pta46.4bn.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: France to sell insurer stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The French government is planning to float a substantial part of its stake
in Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, the state-owned life insurance group,
within the next few months, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said
yesterday.
He indicated, however, that the sale of shares in the insurance group would
represent only a partial privatisation and that state institutions,
including the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, would retain majority
control.
The French government holds about 43 per cent of the shares in CNP, the
country's largest life insurance group with annual turnover of about FFr64bn
(Dollars 11.35bn).
According to the economy minister, the French government will relax its
influence over Credit National, the private sector bank which was
established in 1919 to help finance reconstruction after the first world
war. Mr Alphandery said the government would surrender its right to appoint
the chairman of the bank and its power of veto over board decisions.
The announcement comes as public sector companies are bracing for a round of
musical chairs. Between now and the end of September, 27 public sector
chairmen will see their mandates expire. Many of the most important posts
are unlikely to be affected because of recent appointments. These include Mr
Jean Peyrelevade, at Credit Lyonnais, and Mr Loik le Floch-Prigent, who was
moved last year from Elf Aquitaine to the head of Gaz de France.
Question marks remain, however, over Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson,
the electronics group, and Mr Jean Gandois, head of Pechiney, the aluminium
group. Both are keen to retain their posts but Mr Gomez has already had his
mandate renewed three times, the legal limit, and Mr Gandois is approaching
retirement age.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bawag spotlight shifts offshore
 -How the Austrian bank bolstered its earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Austrian bankers have marvelled for years at how Bank fur Arbeit und
Wirtschaft (Bawag), the country's third largest bank, has been able to
achieve high growth and high profitability.
The bank, controlled by Austria's trade unions, has nearly doubled its total
assets in the past decade to Sch220.3bn (Dollars 19bn), and raised its
market share in the savings deposit field from 2 per cent to just over 6 per
cent.
Over the same period, its operating profits have jumped more than six-fold
to Sch1.45bn last year.
In the past few weeks, as investigations into offshore investment structures
operated secretly for several years by the bank's chief executive and his
son have progressed, the explanation for this exceptional performance has
become much clearer.
The bank has confirmed that up to a third of its profits came from these
offshore activities.
The full scope and nature of these activities has still not been uncovered.
But Mr Walter Flottl, the Bawag chief executive, has admitted that for more
than six years he has directed some Sch22.9bn, a 10th of the bank's balance
sheet, to offshore companies controlled by his son, Wolfgang, a high-rolling
Wall Street trader.
In a statement last week, Mr Walter Flottl spoke vaguely of 'direct loans,
indirect loans and securities' arranged by Ross Capital Markets, a private
Bermuda based company controlled by his son.
Bawag has also confirmed that the investments included collateralised bond
obligations, while Bankers Trust of New York, which last week withdrew a
Dollars 100m credit line to the bank, said it was unhappy with Bawag's
dealing with a Bermuda based hedge fund.
Mr Flottl, a 70-year-old icon of Austrian banking, angrily rejected
accusations that he exposed the bank to unacceptably high risks. 'If we had
in fact been involved in such risky activities, we could not have had an
unbroken six-year record of profits.' Loans were granted only against
excellent collateral, he claims.
He also defended the connection with his son. 'We had no branch in New York
and for this reason, we used specialised firms which we could trust.
Precisely because the son of the chief executive was the director of these
firms we were able to build such a business relationship,' Mr Flottl said.
The bank's supervisory board and the Austrian government's banking
supervisors had been unaware of these operations for most of the past six
years, while its auditors, KPMG Austria Wirtschaftsprufungs, appear to have
been satisfied with imperfect explanations.
He has not answered other, more pointed, questions. If the operations were
safe and produced such high returns, why has he closed them down? And why
has Bawag been less than forthcoming in dealing with questions from central
bank investigators and journalists?
(The FT submitted questions early this week in writing, as requested by
Bawag, but has not yet received replies.)
At a time when banking authorities and investors everywhere are increasingly
worried about big banks' investment policies, observers wonder how the
conventional control mechanisms could have been circumvented for so long.
Austrian bankers have pointed out that the amounts involved were more than
double Bawag's own capital. If something had gone wrong, the bank could have
been wiped out.
When the scale of the Flottl offshore operations became known in April, the
Austrian National Bank sent in a four-man team to investigate. The FT has
obtained a copy of the team's confidential interim report submitted on May
11.
While it confirms that all the bank's capital has been repatriated, the
investigators admitted that they were still far from having a complete
understanding of what had gone on.
'No final verdict can be given at this point on the question of whether
Bawag has any further financial obligations resulting from these credit
transactions.'
They chased down one loan file where the credit rose from Dollars 45m in
1992 to Dollars 58.8m last year, but on which no written contract existed.
Austrian banking supervisors are embarrassed by the whole affair. They admit
that it exposes not only failures of the bank's own risk management and
internal audit functions but also lacunae in the regulatory apparatus.
Only from this year will Austrian banks be required to publish full
consolidated accounts. And, as in most countries, there is as yet no
regulation of off-balance sheet activities.
Mr Erwin Schmidbauer, director of financial markets in the Austrian National
Bank, said the central bank first noticed that Bawag was up to something
unusual last year by studying Bank for International Settlements (BIS) bank
exposure statistics.
Mr Schmidbauer also said suspicions would have been aroused much sooner if
the Bank of England separated exposures to the Channel Islands from those of
the UK as a whole.
The Austrian authorities emphasise that Bawag remains a sound and liquid
bank. However, investigations into transgressions of banking regulations and
Bawag's own internal rules will probably cramp its style for some time.
As for Mr Flottl, his contract expires next year, and no one expects it to
be renewed.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ciga suffers net loss of L200bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels chain, yesterday announced a net
consolidated loss for 1993 of L200bn (Dollars 126m), weighed down by the
heavy cost of financing more than L1,000bn of debt.
Net financial charges reached L149bn, against L196bn in 1992, but overall
debt grew from L972bn at end-1992 to L1,102bn at end-1993.
Having been courted by ITT Sheraton of the US and Forte of the UK, Ciga has
now gained a fragile independence following the unexpected success of a
L1,003bn rights issue.
The L1,000-a-share issue was expected to fail, delivering a majority of
shares to Ciga's creditor banks and then to ITT Sheraton, which had offered
L740 a share for the company.
Ciga has now started direct negotiations with creditors to reduce its debt,
most of which is short-term. Talks are likely to take some weeks.
The rights issue means Ciga is no longer controlled by Fimpar, the Aga
Khan's holding company. Attention is now focused on the shareholder assembly
called for June 24 or July 6, at which new investors could press for board
changes.
Snam, the gas distribution subsidiary of Eni, Italy's state-owned energy and
chemicals group, made net profits in 1993 of L127bn, against L139bn in 1992.
Sales rose to L12,011bn from L10,807bn.

FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nokia to raise more than FM2bn
in global issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications group, yesterday announced plans to
raise more than FM2bn (Dollars 370m) of new equity in the biggest
international share issue ever made by a Finnish company.
Up to 6m new preferred shares will be offered, increasing total outstanding
shares to 74.9m. At yesterday's closing price of FM410, the issue would
raise more than FM2.4bn.
The offer could take foreign ownership in the group above 50 per cent. An
estimated 46 per cent of the company's capital is already held by
foreigners, compared with 20 per cent a year ago. Around 90 per cent of the
shares will be targeted at non-Finnish institutions, with the balance being
offered on the domestic market.
Most of the international offer will be directed at the US, where the
company plans to seek a listing for its preferred stock, in the form of
American depositary receipts, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's president, said the funds would be used to finance
the group's rapidly-growing telecommunications and mobile phone businesses
and to strengthen its balance sheet. It will bring down gearing from 52 per
cent at the end of last year.
It is the group's second big share issue in a year, after it successfully
raised FM918m last summer. The buying has been driven by a sharp improvement
in Nokia's performance. Last year pre-tax profits were FM1.15bn after a
FM158m loss in 1992.
The company, the world's second biggest supplier of mobile phones after
Motorola of the US, has seen huge growth in sales of mobile phone and fixed
telephone equipment. Its share price has risen five-fold from FM82 at the
beginning of 1993.
Nokia intends to launch the issue during the summer, but is first seeking
shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting on June 23. Its
shares fell FM21, or nearly 5 per cent, on yesterday's announcement.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Old Speckled Hen boosts Morland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer, yesterday reported a 10.6 per cent
increase in interim profits buoyed by a better than expected 21 per cent
increase in sales of its own ales, led by Old Speckled Hen.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.02m (Pounds 3.63m) in the six months to
March 31, on turnover ahead 12 per cent at Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 23.7m).
Earnings per share were 12.8p (11.9p) and the interim dividend is lifted to
3.06p (2.78p.) The shares rose 10p to 518p.
Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chairman, said the result continued a trend of
sustained growth and had been achieved despite a generally depressed trading
environment.
Operating profits rose 12.3 per cent to Pounds 5.41m but were reduced by a
Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 30,000) deficit on property disposals and net
interest costs of Pounds 1.28m (Pounds 1.16m).
Sales of Old Speckled Hen, now its biggest selling beer brand, more than
doubled over the same period last year, helped by a series of agreements
with wholesalers and other brewers. Overall beer volumes were ahead 13 per
cent, and the group said it plans to increase capacity at its Abingdon
brewery next year.
Volumes in the tenanted estate were slightly lower but profits were
marginally ahead on a like-for-like basis. The 75-pub estate, showed a 17
per cent increase in profits with those pubs specialising in food again
recording strong growth.
Food now represents 27 per cent of sales, and meals in the Artist's Fare
restaurants showed a 12 per cent increase. The group is seeking more
Artist's Fare and Ale House sites.
Volumes in the free trade, including wholesalers, were 50 per cent higher
and, combined with a Pounds 100,000 reduction in bad debts, led to a marked
improvement in profit contribution.
Net borrowings were Pounds 23.9m, down from Pounds 24.8m at the year end,
equivalent to gearing of 22.7 per cent.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software to raise Pounds 1.6m via
placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based developer of accounting
software for large companies, is raising Pounds 1.6m through a placing to
enable the development of international business relationships.
The share price rose 4p to 405p.
QSP has invested some Pounds 16m over the past few years in developing an
advanced system, Universal Olas, which has now been sold to eight customers.
Last year, it concluded a deal with Global Software, a US accounting
software company, through which Global will distribute Universal Olas at
minimum cost to QSP.
It is understand that the company has been having discussions with potential
partners in Japan, France, South America, the Middle East and east Asia,
with a view to striking similar distribution arrangements.
The company believes that Pounds 500,000 will be needed to finance the first
of these deals. The rest of the money is being used partly for product
development and partly as priming finance should opportunities from new
business partnerships present themselves.
QSP recently announced an alliance with Hewlett Packard, a leading US
electronic manufacturer.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT Business Systems, a division of the Birmingham-based computing services
company, has formed a strategic partnership in Europe with the Gartner
Group, a leading US information technology consultancy, writes Alan Cane.
The alliance marks a further stage in ACT's transformation from computer
manufacturer to a provider of computing services.
The alliance is intended to exploit the expertise of BIS Information
Systems, which ACT bought last year for Pounds 94m, and ACT Logsys, part of
the group which specialises in open systems for central and local
government.
Last year, ACT made pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.5m on sales of Pounds 108m.
Gartner, once a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiary but now a US company quoted on
Nasdaq, advises companies on information technology strategies. It will be
the prime contractor in the new alliance, subcontracting analytical work to
ACT.
Mr Harvey Parr, managing director of ACT Business Systems, said he believed
the division, which had sales of about Pounds 32m last year, was
complementary to ACT's core financial interests.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Carlton advances 33% to Pounds 73m -
Increases in television activities and continuing growth in video sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, may have picked a
losing National Lottery ticket yesterday but he was still able to celebrate
an unexpectedly high 33 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits.
Carlton had a 10 per cent stake in the Great British Lottery Company, one of
the seven losers in the battle for the National Lottery licence.
Profits of Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 55.1m) for the six months to the end of
March were boosted by growing profits from Carlton Television, holders of
the London weekday ITV licence and continuing growth from the video sales
market, which helped Technicolor's performance.
Excluding the two month contribution from Central Television, the underlying
profit increase was about 25 per cent.
Ironically Carlton, which now owns the two largest ITV companies, will
benefit from the launch of the National Lottery in November. It is likely to
generate huge sums in television advertising.
Most analysts were predicting profits of Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m for the
half year and yesterday were raising their expectations for the full year
from Pounds 170m to Pounds 180m.
'The first six months have shown good growth, both in trading, and
progressing our strategy to expand and maintain our leading position in
broadcast television and film and video services,' said Mr Green, adding
that prospects for the next six months were encouraging.
Turnover was Pounds 658.7m (Pounds 469.9m), an increase of 40 per cent.
Earnings per share rose by 16 per cent to 21.3p (18.3p); the interim
dividend is increased to 8.15p (7.4p).
Turnover in broadcast television, including the Central contribution, rose
to Pounds 202.6m (Pounds 64.1m) and pre-tax profits were up to Pounds 22.9m
(Pounds 600,000).
Pre-tax profits in the video and audio products division rose to Pounds
35.6m (Pounds 30.8m), largely because of the increase in demand for
sell-through video cassettes. Turnover was Pounds 234.3m (Pounds 207.5m).
The share price yesterday fell 22p to 901p.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chamberlin &amp; Hill shows 11% decline to
Pounds 1.42m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chamberlin &amp; Hill, the maker of iron castings, electrical conduit fittings
and switchgear, reported a near 11 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 1.59m to Pounds 1.42m for the year to end-March.
The outcome was struck on turnover up by 8 per cent, from Pounds 20.3m to
Pounds 22m. Interest payable was Pounds 131,000 (Pounds 141,000) and after
tax of Pounds 288,000 (Pounds 441,000) earnings per share came out at 15.78p
(16.07p).
Despite the fall in earnings directors are recommending an unchanged final
dividend of 4.5p, making 6.5p (6.25p) for the year.
Mr John Eccles, chairman, said the second half of the year had proved more
volatile than expected and the forecast improvement in the trading position
following high levels of capital expenditure at the Bloxwich foundry did not
materialise.
In addition, Fitter &amp; Poulton ended the year with second half profits well
below its estimates as a result of price competition and sharply reduced
margins.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Young hits out over duty after standstill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Young, the normally ebullient chairman of Young &amp; Co's Brewery, was
in far from jocular mood yesterday as he launched a fresh attack on the
government's 'short-sighted' policy on beer duty.
'British brewers contribute more in (excise) duty than in the rest of the
European Union put together, which puts us at a major disadvantage.'
Mr Young was speaking after announcing results virtually unchanged for the
53 weeks to April 2. 'We are being hampered by levels of duty that are
totally unfair when compared with the low rates levied on our European
competitors.'
He continued: 'Cheap, and often illegal, imports are taking away much of our
trade and therefore the government's income.' He called for a immediate
reduction in British rates 'to restore confidence and to safeguard thousands
of jobs'.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 5.18m (Pounds 5.17m). Despite the extra
week's trading, turnover showed a marginal decline to Pounds 72.3m (Pounds
72.9m). Following a sizeable drop at the halfway stage, interest charges for
the full year remained relatively high at Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 3.02m)
reflecting finance of the debenture stock issued in April 1993. 'The long
term security and stability the debenture gives us has meant that we have
been unable to benefit in full from lower rates', Mr Young said.
A recommended final dividend of 7.75p lifts the total by 0.5p to 15p,
covered 1.8 times by earnings of 26.43p (26.4p).

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Vosper builds 13% advance - Order book
worth Pounds 500m and prospects for new contracts good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vosper Thornycroft Holdings, the Southampton-based shipbuilding and
engineering group, increased annual profits by 13 per cent and said
yesterday its order book was worth Pounds 500m.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 19m to Pounds 21.5m in the year to March
31, while turnover increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 239m.
Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said the policy of broadening the group's customer
base continued. Businesses independent of Vosper winning warship contracts
had risen to 15 per cent of group earnings - and would reach 20 per cent,
following the acquisition last month of HSDE, a business which makes
electronic con-trol systems for gas tur-bines.
Vosper has bid against the GEC-Yarrow yard on the Clyde to build up to seven
San-down class minehunters for the Royal Navy and said it hoped to hear the
outcome in the next few months. The Southampton group has built the five
existing Sandown vessels, which have fibreglass hulls.
Mr Usher said: 'We have responded vigorously to this tender and were pleased
to note that bids proposing foreign hulls will not be accepted on this
occasion.'
Vosper is competing with German and French shipyards for a patrol craft
order for the Kuwait navy.
It is also interested in a joint venture to build six mine-hunters for the
Royal Australian Navy, which would be constructed in Australia, but using
Vosper techno-logy.
Mr Usher said that with good prospects of new orders from home and abroad,
he had every expectation that the group could continue to report good
results in the year ahead.
Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 46.2p (41.3p). A final dividend of
12.7p gives a total 18p (15.8p), an increase of 14 per cent.
COMMENT
These results, slightly ahead of expectations, showed again that Vosper's
focus on minehunters and patrol craft - selling mainly to the Middle East
and east Asia - has insulated it from the downturn in spending by former
cold warriors. A lack of recent orders has brought down the future order
book from more than Pounds 700m last year to Pounds 500m, but the group
seems well placed to win some of the work to be awarded soon. The Royal Navy
minehunters order would be particularly welcome, as the proportion of work
being done for the Ministry of Defence has slumped to only 2 per cent, with
95 per cent earmarked for export. Forecast profits of Pounds 24m put the
shares, down 1p yesterday at 778p, on a prospective multiple of 15.2 - an 8
per cent premium to the market. The shares are tightly held and have had a
good run, more than tripling in value since 1992, but they could advance
further if the minehunter order comes through.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Flotation puts Pounds 141.5m value on
London Clubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Clubs International, owner of the Ritz CLub and five other London
casinos, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing the shares at 200p to
give it a market capitalisation of Pounds 141.5m.
Of the 16.38m ordinary shares to be placed with institutions, 4.09m will be
subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries.
The shares - of which 15m are new - have been placed by Samuel Montagu,
which has fully underwritten the issue.
The placing will raise about Pounds 27.5m net of expenses, which will be
used to pay off bank debt incurred under the 1989 management buy-out from
Grand Metropolitan.
The group will be quoted on the USM because the management has only two
years' experience of the company, and Stock Exchange rules require three
years.
The change of management followed a police raid in 1991 under the Gaming
Act, just days before a previous planned flotation.
The clubs were issued with new licences in autumn 1992. Mr Alan Goodenough,
chief executive, said the company considered the events of 1991 as 'very
much a thing of the past'. The company would be seeking a full listing next
year.
The prospectus shows the group, which operates casinos in Europe and Egypt
as well as on cruise ships, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m in the 51
weeks to March 27, compared with Pounds 9.1m in the 53 weeks to April 6
1993.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 146.4m (Pounds 143.7m).
Pro forma pre-tax profits are put at Pounds 23.1m, and earnings per share
before restructuring costs of Pounds 2m at 22.5p, giving a multiple of 8.9.
The prospectus said the directors would have recommended a dividend of
11.92p, giving a notional gross yield of 7.45 per cent.
Mr Goodenough said the group intended to export its expertise in the
industry.
Early next month it is opening a new casino in Taba, Egypt, across the
border from the Israeli resort of Eilat.
COMMENT
This issue has been priced to go, even on a day when the market fell sharply
and the National Lottery winner was announced. Although the high rolling
Ritz accounted for almost two thirds of last year's trading profits, the
portfolio of casinos is strong. This helps to minimise the risk of relying
too heavily on a few high spending players, although it is worth recalling
this week's warning from Ladbroke that credit betting profits were down in
the first four months. The yield is very high, and strong cash generation
will sustain it. Providing the market does not come back too far, the shares
should move to a premium when dealings start on June 6.

Shares in Donelon Tyson fell 4p to 15p yesterday as the Cheshire-based
building and civil engineering company announced that its annual accounts
would be delayed and that the dividend was likely to be passed.
The directors said that their expectations of the group's results for the
year ended December 31 1993 were based on an assessment of the value of work
in progress which reflected the recognition of certain contractual claims.
Because of delays in agreeing some of those claims they could not now be
included in the 1993 results, they said.
The value of the unresolved claims is Pounds 3.5m.

Arcadian International reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 471,000 for the
eight months to December 31, its new year-end. In the year to April 30 1993
there were losses of Pounds 994,000.
Mr Robert Breare, chief executive, said the reporting period had been one of
transition for the company whose core business was now the ownership and
operation of hotels and leisure facilities.
The results were the first since the increase in capital and the acquisition
of the Clipper and Hidden hotels in November.
Turnover was Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 326,000). Losses per share came through at

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Paramount calls for Pounds 5.42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paramount, the public house operator, is raising Pounds 5.42m net of
expenses through a 1-for-1 rights issue.
Most of the proceeds will be used to buy 28 pubs from Greenalls Group for a
total consideration of Pounds 3.27m.
The issue of 69.8m shares, priced at 9p each, has been fully underwritten by
Meespierson.
The company's shares closed up  1/4 p yesterday at 11p.
The company also announced it had applied to move from the Unlisted
Securities Market to a full listing.
The acquisition will increase the number of pubs owned by Paramount to 124.
It operates 246 pubs in north-west England and Wales. All its establishments
are tenanted.
Paramount also intends to use part of the proceeds to make a further
investment in Real Inns, a joint venture company owned equally with John
Labatt (UK), a subsidiary of Labatt, the Canadian brewer. Real Inns owns 77
pubs.
Paramount said it was buying the new pubs as part of its strategy to
increase the overall value of its estate and to improve operating margins.
'The additional pubs will give us greater purchasing power with breweries.
Our aim is to increase our barrelage through a large estate while keeping
our overheads lean,' the company said.
Its strategy is to buy smaller value pubs - in the Pounds 100,000 to Pounds
140,000 range - and to develop this niche market.
In the six months to November 30 1993 the company reported pre-tax profits
just ahead from Pounds 261,000 to Pounds 273,000.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Leeds up despite margin pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leeds Group, the West Yorkshire-based textile dyer and printer, lifted
profits by 17 per cent and sales by 21 per cent in its first half.
'We have managed to wring some growth out of pretty challenging market
conditions,' said Mr Robert Wade, chairman.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 3.41m in the six months to
March 31, on turnover ahead from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 26.4m.
Mr Wade said the UK high street fashion business had been under constant
price pressure.
Continental Europe had been at a low ebb since the autumn, making trading
tough in the Benelux countries, Germany and France. But while many
continental competitors were losing money, the group's transfer printing
business in the Netherlands, acquired last year, was trading profitably.
Margins were also under pressure, from increased prices for both wool and
cotton and demands for extended credit. However, the group had attained
across the board cuts of at least 5 per cent from its dye wares and
chemicals suppliers.
The group, which makes most of its money through commission business, had
succeeded in reducing its dependence on clothing by going for curtain and
upholstery business.
The outcome included Pounds 332,000 (Pounds 385,000) of business
interruption insurance following a fire at a factory in November 1992.
Earnings rose from 7.2p to 8p. The interim dividend is increased from 1.83p
to 2.1p.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Sustained growth in fees behind Warburg's
Pounds 297m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg, the investment bank, reported record pre-tax profits for the
year to March 31 reflecting sustained growth in commission and fee income
from advisory and underwriting activities.
At Pounds 297m, profits were double the comparable Pounds 148.2m, on total
operating income of Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds 715.8m). Earnings per share were
82.4p (39.6p) or 75.7p (37.5p) fully diluted. The total dividend is
increased to 22p (19p) with a proposed final of 16p.
Mercury Asset Management, the 75 per cent-owned subsidiary, reported a 33
per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 109.5m (Pounds 82.3m) despite a
sharp rise in expenses. Earnings per share rose to 42.9p (32.6p) and the
dividend is raised 50 per cent to 18.5p (12p), lowering cover to 1.99 times.
The investment banking side recovered to Pounds 187.5m, almost three times
the Pounds 65.9m of the previous year. Funds under management rose from
Pounds 49.7bn to Pounds 60.4bn, of which Pounds 3.7bn was net new cash.
A little more than 25 per cent of the new cash came from UK institutions,
the source of most of MAM's fund management business. Another Pounds 1bn
came from investment trusts, Pounds 400m from charities and private banking
with the remainder from international sources.
'The business, in common with the industry, has had a good year,' said Lord
Cairns, chief executive. However, he added: 'It could prove to be a peak
year in the economic cycle.'
After a strong first half, revenues from fee and commission-based activities
continued to grow strongly throughout the year.
Group fee and commission income rose from Pounds 478.1m to Pounds 749.1m, of
which Pounds 446.6m was earned in the second half.
While declining to predict whether fees could maintain momentum, Lord Cairns
said: 'The pipeline of business is still very strong.' And he noted that new
issue underwriting was the single most significant contributor.
Although revenues from marketmaking and proprietary trading improved from
Pounds 145.5m to Pounds 207.2m, most - Pounds 140.6m - were received in the
first half. They were significantly lower in the second six months, which
included volatile trading conditions in most world markets in February.
However, Lord Cairns said that a greater, and more stable, percentage of
overall profits was likely to be derived from trading in the future than is
currently the case.
Largely as a result of the increased trading activities, gearing rose
sharply to 41 per cent, having hovered at about 15 per cent for the previous
three years, and may rise further. 'We think our gearing is conservative
relative to the industry,' Lord Cairns said.
He said that more than 50 per cent of the group's business was now derived
from outside the UK and would increasingly be international.
Mr Hugh Stevenson, MAM chairman, said that the fund management company's
activities were also increasingly international with about 20 per cent of
all funds under management being those of non-UK clients.
Growing demand for fund management services for so-called defined
contribution schemes helped assets of Mercury Life, the life assurance
division, to nearly triple to Pounds 155m.
However, expenses have risen in the past year by a third to Pounds 133m,
while turnover rose more modestly. Mr Stevenson attributed the rise to
increased performance-related pay and an increase in back office staff in
the later half of 1993 to cope with the sharp rise in trading turnover.

Late 1980s accounting met with old-style aggressive 1980s acquisition battle
tactics yesterday as the escalating war of criticism by Lasmo in its defence
from Enterprise's hostile bid switched to its predator's financial reporting
policies.
In a 12-page document called 'Enterprise Oil: the financial myth', Lasmo
accused the oil company of a series of manipulations and of contravening UK
accounting standards.
'This goes to the heart of (Enterprise's) value,' said Mr Rudolph Agnew,
Lasmo's chairman. 'They have overstated profits, have an uncovered dividend
and an unsustainable share price.'
Enterprise lost no time in fighting back. Mr Andrew Shilston, finance
director, said: 'This is incredibly mischievous. We have absolutely not
broken the rules. To get a lecture on accounting from Lasmo given their
history is a bit rich.'
The company's auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, also issued a statement saying:
'We have signed an unqualified audit report and in our opinion the accounts
of Enterprise Oil do and have complied with UK accounting standards.'
The document represents the outcome of work conducted by teams from Ernst &amp;
Young, Lasmo's auditors, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Both firms said yesterday
they stood by the accusations made.
Lasmo's central attack is that Enterprise has not recorded the assets bought
in large acquisitions at their purchase price, which would then require
substantial depreciation. Instead, it has written them down immediately
against reserves in the balance sheet, which it argued 'contravenes'
accounting standards.
It highlights two examples. In 1988 Enterprise bought an interest in Beryl
Properties for Pounds 158m and wrote the assets down against reserves by
Pounds 149m to leave a recorded value of Pounds 9m. In 1989 it acquired
assets from Texas Eastern Corporation for Pounds 442m, and wrote down their
value by Pounds 386m.
The document also shows that Enterprise used merger accounting when it
bought ICI Petroleum in 1987, and that if acquisition accounting had been
used instead, net assets would have been recorded at Pounds 109m higher.
Mr Shilston said that the company had used merger accounting, which allowed
it to 'add the balance sheets together' without the need to readjust for the
fair values of the assets. He said he believed this was more prudent.
'We took the view that the substance of the transactions were as mergers,'
he said. 'We abided by the rules that existed then. This was not a mindless
interpretation but a commercially-based decision.'
Fred 6, a draft new accounting standard which will become mandatory this
autumn, will prevent Enterprise's approach to the acquisitions in the
future.
Lasmo criticises Enterprise for 'opaque accounting' in its presentation of
Elf Enterprise Petroleum, a joint venture one third owned by Enterprise
created in 1991, which in turn acquired an interest in the Piper Field in
the North Sea and has so far been heavily lossmaking.
However, Mr Shilston said that Lasmo had itself acquired a direct interest
in the field 'at a slightly higher price'. 'We would not disagree that the
Piper field took longer and cost more than expected. But Lasmo has been
subjected to it infinitely more directly and materially than us.'
Finally, Lasmo attacks Enterprise's dividend policy, saying it is
overdistributed because its earnings are inflated and because it is using a
higher proportion of its cash flow to fund the dividend payment; and of
raising its dividend while its underlying earnings have fallen.
Mr Shilston said the relatively high dividend paid by Enterprise reflected
the company's strength. 'We are quite happy to be associated with the
quality end of the market. What's the embarrassment?'
He stressed that the company had adequate cash flow to fund the dividend
payments, which was far more important as a measure of its ability to pay
than the earnings figure.
Enterprise is believed to have written to the Takeover Panel complaining
about the accusations. However, Mr Agnew stood by the charges. 'We have laid
out all the facts. Now it is for the market to study them. If they believe
we have made a telling point Enterprise will be severely damaged. If they
ignore them God help us all.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Argyll 13% down after depreciation charges
 -Wide-ranging review of Safeway in progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Depreciation charges, tough competition and a poor performance at its
Lo-Cost discount chain combined to produce a 13 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits at Argyll Group, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer, in the
year to April 2.
The fall, to Pounds 361.8m, compared with Pounds 417.3m for the previous 53
weeks, or Pounds 407m on a 52-week basis.
This year's figure was depressed by Pounds 37.1m of new depreciation charges
after Argyll began writing down superstores, and a Pounds 3m property loss.
Adding those back, profits were still lower than last year - in contrast
with Argyll's competitors, Tesco and Sainsbury, which were also hit by
depreciation and property charges, but improved profits before the
accounting changes.
In spite of a fall in earnings from 27.1p to 22.6p per share, the total
dividend goes up to 11.5p (10.9p), with a proposed final of 7.75p.
However, directors said future rises would be in line with earnings growth.
Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, said competition would remain tough, but there
were signs the market was stabilising after a downward adjustment in
margins.
The gross margin at Safeway had fallen 0.3 percentage points in the second
half, but was now running only 0.1 to 0.2 points below last year.
Current trading showed some encouragement with like-for-like sales up 0.5
per cent, before price deflation of 0.7 per cent.
Sales at Safeway increased by 12 per cent on a 52-week basis to Pounds
4.87bn, with operating profits up 7.4 per cent to Pounds 361.2m. New stores
contributed 11.6 points, with 0.4 points from existing stores. Inflation
averaged 1.2 per cent, but prices had fallen in the last four months of the
year.
Presto and Lo-Cost fared less well, with sales up 2 per cent on a 52-week
basis to Pounds 1.11bn, but operating profits were down by 20 per cent to
Pounds 40.7m.
The company said cutting prices at Lo-Cost to strengthen its position in the
discount market had improved sales but not profitability, and a fundamental
review of the business was under way. Analysts believe it will be sold.
Safeway has also appointed consultants to review all its operations and the
results will be announced with the interim profits in November.
COMMENT
As it admitted yesterday, Argyll is a follower rather than a leader. It has
lagged behind its main rivals in instituting a strategic review - and in
revealing the expected cost savings - as well as in diversifying or
expanding overseas. The business is sound and well-run, and the business
review and other initiatives should certainly cut costs. But while the
threats of a price war have receded, the outlook remains tough, and without
a dose of inflation, earnings and dividend growth prospects look unexciting.
However, with current-year forecasts averaging about Pounds 375m the shares
are on a prospective multiple of only 10.25, which may suggest they are a
little oversold - especially given the 6 per cent yield.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NW Water ahead of expectations with Pounds
269m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North West Water yesterday said it was comfortable with the initial outcome
of the current price review process, as it announced a 9 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits.
Replying to questions over whether North West felt the industry regulator
had taken a tough approach to the draft price increases issued at the
weekend, Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman, said: 'The logic and methods by
which Ian Byatt goes about it leave one with a feeling of comfort.'
The UK's 31 water and sewerage companies are preparing replies for Ofwat on
the draft K factors - the rate above inflation by which they will be allowed
to raise prices from 1995 to 2000. The final allowances will be announced on
July 28. Analysts estimates for North West's increase range from 2 to 2.6.
The utility kicked off the water company results season with better than
expected figures, largely due to a reduction from Pounds 36m to Pounds 12m
in provisions for restructuring the regulated business. Pre-tax profits rose
from Pounds 247m to Pounds 269m on turnover up from Pounds 878m to Pounds
924m.
The increase masked a disappointing performance from the process engineering
business, where profits before interest and tax fell from Pounds 19.7m to
Pounds 8.8m.
On the international contract business North West wrote off Pounds 8m in
investments against Pounds 9.6m last time.
The regulated businesses showed a 15 per cent increase in profits before
interest and tax to Pounds 326m because of reduced working capital and
operating efficiencies. A decline in industrial and commercial turnover held
back the advance in sales to 6 per cent at Pounds 729m.
Gearing fell from 29.1 per cent to 27.3 per cent.
The final dividend is increased to 15.4p for a total 8 per cent higher at
23.07p (21.4p). Earnings rose from 62.3p to 70.8p.
COMMENT
North West warned at the interim stage that process engineering would be
difficult, but one might wonder why it has taken the group two years to spot
excessive overheads. The utility, as expected, has returned a sterling
performance. All of this is almost irrelevant, however, given uncertainty
over future price increases. Until the K factors are known the sector will
be unattractive. Forecasts are for Pounds 290m this year, for a prospective
multiple of 7 and a yield of 6 per cent. Yesterday's noises may leave
existing investors as comfortable as the chairman, but they may not be
enough to tempt new ones in.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Concert party at Liberty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Myerson, who has forced a number of changes at Liberty, yesterday
announced a concert party with a Malaysian group to press for further
changes at the upmarket fabric and fashion group.
Mr Myerson and Insas, an investment holding company quoted on the Kuala
Lumpur stock exchange with a market capitalisation of Pounds 205m, will
control 16.8 per cent of Liberty's capital after June's enfranchisement of
the non-voting shares.
Mr Myerson's family vehicle - Concerto Capital Corporation - will hold 12.8
per cent and Insas 4 per cent.
Since he began his campaign in 1992, Mr Myerson has been instrumental in the
appointment of a new chief executive at Liberty, the appointment of
non-executive directors and the enfranchisement.
This will reduce the votes controlled by the founding families from just
over 50 per cent to about 40 per cent.
Mr Myerson said the object of the concert party was to 'maximise Liberty's
value to all shareholders'. This, he said, included developing markets in
the Pacific Rim, improving merchandising, and promoting changes of personnel
at the company.
Liberty's success at its new outlet at Heathrow's Terminal 3 has led to the
view that there is pent-up demand in east Asia.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds falls to Pounds 121.6m -
Recovery seen in Chinese markets helps sustain share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Courtaulds, the chemicals and fibres group, yesterday said it was seeing
recovery in some of the markets hit by last year's credit squeeze in China.
Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, said that acrylic fibre prices had
started to harden, helped by the problems of the Chinese cotton crop, and
that demand for acetate tow, used in cigarette filters, was picking up.
The comments helped Courtaulds' shares remain unchanged at 527p in a falling
market despite a sharp drop in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 186.2m to
Pounds 121.6m on turnover of Pounds 2bn (Pounds 2.09bn), including Pounds
43.7m (Pounds 141.2m) from discontinued activities.
The figures were affected by a number of exceptional items and a higher
interest bill. At the operating level profits slipped 11 per cent to Pounds
174.5m.
About half the fall was due to a sharp drop in acetate tow prices after
China suspended purchases in its anti-inflation drive. Profits from acetate
tumbled by Pounds 12m to Pounds 28m.
Although Chinese purchases have resumed Mr Huismans does not expect to see
much improvement in the short-term. 'The price position will take some years
to recover.'
But the prospects for fibre prices have improved following a disappointing
cotton crop in China. 'It is now such a big economy that marginal changes
start to have a significant impact on world markets,' said Mr Huismans.
Following the figures several analysts upgraded their forecasts with Mr
Martin Evans at Hoare Govett increasing his pre-tax prediction from Pounds
170m to Pounds 185m before exceptionals, up from Pounds 146.2m last year.
Total profits from fibres and chemicals fell to Pounds 93m (Pounds 108m) on
sales of Pounds 727m (Pounds 775m) with Tencel, Courtaulds new fibre, making
a net profit.
Mr Huismans said Tencel's contribution this year would be held back by the
costs of building European and Asian operations. Courtaulds is constructing
a second US Tencel plant costing Dollars 134m (Pounds 90m) and is still
examining four possible sites for its European factory.
Capital investment, which rose to Pounds 130m, or 1.7 times depreciation,
will increase further this year but gearing was down to 30 per cent (39 per
cent) helped by disposals profits of Pounds 25.1m.
There were Pounds 49.7m of restructuring charges, relating largely to the
previously announced rationalisation in coatings and sealants, and the
interest bill rose Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 31.6m, including a Pounds 9.1m
charge to close interest rate swaps no longer required.
Profits from coatings and sealants slipped to Pounds 62m (Pounds 64m) on
sales of Pounds 875m (Pounds 848m) with the marine paint business buoyant
but US industrial markets still in recession. Polymer products were steady
at Pounds 32m on turnover of Pounds 352m (Pounds 330m).
Dividends are up 5.7 per cent to 14.8p, via a 10.8p final, although earnings
fell to 20.3p (35.1p) or 25.8p before exceptionals.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Countryside Properties finds strengthening
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Countryside Properties, one of south-east England's biggest housebuilders,
has strengthened its balance sheet substantially with the sale for Pounds
60m cash of its commercial property investment portfolio to BriTel Fund
Trustees, the British Telecommunications pension scheme.
The sale, announced yesterday, emphasises the continuing strong
institutional demand for commercial property as this market continues to
recover.
Countryside intends to use the proceeds initially to reduce borrowings to
Pounds 22.5m, equivalent to gearing of 29 per cent, compared with 103 per
cent at the end of March.
A number of inquiries were received about the portfolio from property
companies and institutions, but BriTel made the most attractive offer, said
Mr Alan Cherry, Countryside's chairman. The book value of the investment
properties was Pounds 56.7m at end-September.
Mr Cherry said that pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 had risen
by 43 per cent from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 3.72m. Turnover increased by 62
per cent from Pounds 41.9m to Pounds 67.8m.
The company is paying a maintained interim dividend of 1.41p on an enlarged
share capital following last year's Pounds 16.8m rights issue. Earnings per
share for the latest six months were also maintained, at 4.1p.
Mr Cherry said that the number of private homes sold had risen from 161 to
224. Economic conditions continued to ease in spite of last month's tax
increases, which had failed to dent the gradual recovery in the housing
market.
The number of homes completed for housing associations had fallen from 494
to 148, due to the timing of handovers. Work for housing associations
measured by on-going contracts had actually increased from Pounds 85m to
Pounds 115m since the end of the last financial year.
Overall housing turnover had risen by more than 50 per cent to Pounds 55.5m
(Pounds 36.7m) while profits had increased by 26 per cent to Pounds 3.9m
(Pounds 3.1m).
Mr Cherry said the group would continue to build commercial properties for
sale. This division increased profits from Pounds 88,000 to Pounds 457,000
in the first half and recently has negotiated forward sales of developments
in Bishop's Stortford, Brentwood and Nottingham.
The property investment portfolio incurred a Pounds 600,000 loss in the
first half, the same as last time.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Land Securities' Pounds 237m beats City
forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of the recovery in the property investment market was yesterday
underlined by a 34 per cent rise from 504p to 677p in the net asset value
per share of Land Securities, the UK's largest property company, during the
year to March 31.
Pre-tax profits increased by 3.5 per cent, from Pounds 229.1m to Pounds
237.1m.
The group's properties were valued at just above Pounds 5bn, an increase of
Pounds 934m. Following the better-than-expected results, the shares rose 2
1/2 p to 663p.
The recovery in the asset value reflected a sharp decline in yields, the
ratio of income to capital value, which fell from 9.9 per cent to 8.2 per
cent.
The occupational market showed little sign of recovery during the year,
although Land Securities said that the downturn in rents appeared to be
coming to an end.
'There has been some encouraging signs of stability and strengthening of
demand, particularly for prime retail locations and top quality central
London office buildings,' said Mr Peter Hunt, chairman. 'However, we do need
to see rental growth coming through to underpin the investment market and to
reduce its dependence on yield comparisons with gilts and other financial
instruments.'
Mr Hunt was cautious about the scope for profits growth. 'There are positive
signs of economic recovery but until businesses have sufficient confidence
to expand their operations and create the demand for more space, the
potential for increasing revenue profit remains limited,' he said.
Over the past three years, the company has spent Pounds 600m on properties,
more than 60 per cent of which was on acquisitions in which it bought nearly
1m sq ft of retail, industrial and warehouse space.
Mr Hunt said that the recent strengthening of yields had made it less
attractive to purchase investment properties.
Land Securities has restarted its development programme. Last year it spent
Pounds 23m on developments; it has committed a further Pounds 128m to
developments this year.
Gearing fell from 59.6 per cent to 45.6 per cent. Available funds at March
31 amounted to Pounds 241.5m.
Values of properties increased by 19 per cent in the City and by 19.5 per
cent in the west end and Victoria. Shop and office properties elsewhere in
the UK rose by 16.4 per cent. Out-of-town retail property increased in value
by 34.1 per cent and industrial and warehouse property by 20.5 per cent.
Earnings per share increased by 8.6 per cent to 35.66p (32.83p).
A final dividend of 17.4p is recommended, making a total of 24p, an increase
of 5 per cent.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Making a marque on the world: GM is using Opel as a
springboard for global growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors is using its German subsidiary Opel to spearhead its
expansion into international car markets outside the US.
While its domestic North American automotive operations have racked up four
years of heavy losses, GM has opted to use its healthier European car
business as its springboard for geographic expansion.
GM Europe's agreement to establish a joint venture in India to assemble the
Opel Astra is the latest move by the world's leading vehicle maker to gain a
foothold in emerging car markets.
Opel products have been in the forefront of GM's effort to set up assembly
in Turkey and eastern Europe - the Astra small family car is produced in
Hungary and production is due to begin in Poland. They are also leading the
drive to build GM's presence in Asia. Assembly of the Opel Astra began in
Taiwan last year, small volume production of the Opel Vectra family car will
start in Indonesia later this year, to be followed by production of the
Astra in India in 1995.
Mr Louis Hughes, executive vice-president of GM's international operations
and president of GM Europe, says the group 'has made a strategic decision to
further internationalise and expand the Opel name and Opel products around
the world'.
The world's biggest carmakers all believe the Asia/Pacific region holds the
brightest prospects for growth. Car sales in Asia (excluding Japan) are
expected to triple during the next 15 years.
According to Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, GM's
rival, 80 per cent of the world's population lives outside the traditional
automotive markets of western Europe, North America and Japan. The number of
cars and trucks sold in these regions, however, represents only about 8 per
cent of the global total.
This view is confirmed by the latest study of world car markets by DRI
McGraw-Hill, the London-based analysts, which forecasts that new car sales
worldwide will rise from 33.2m last year to 42.5m in 1999, a near 30 per
cent jump. The report cites South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and
eastern Europe as offering the best growth prospects.
For a long time US vehicle makers - as well as the Europeans - neglected
Asian markets, allowing them to become largely the preserve of their
Japanese rivals. Belatedly they are seeking to regain lost ground.
'We are number two in Europe and in Latin America and our sights are zeroed
in on growth in Asia and the Pacific,' Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive,
told shareholders last week.
While Ford has embarked on an ambitious strategy of merging its North
American and European operations to try to eliminate duplication and lay the
foundations for developing more so-called 'world cars', GM has chosen to
lead its international operations from Europe with the aim of integrating
its European, Latin American and Australian engineering activities.
Most of the products to be sold in these regions, as well as in Asia, will
originate from the Opel technical development centre in Russelsheim, near
Frankfurt, and will be developed from the European product range. Mr Hughes
describes the Opel Corsa supermini as GM's most international car. Already
in production in Spain, Germany and Brazil and planned for Mexico, GM is
also studying Corsa assembly in China and Russia.
Apart from building a network of Opel assembly plants across Asia, GM is
also increasing exports of cars from Europe. Opel is being used as the
group's main marque in Japan, where GM has set a target of selling 100,000
cars a year by 2000.
It has taken advantage of the conflict between the Volkswagen group and
Yanase, the VW/Audi importer in Japan, to win over the Yanase dealer network
for Opel. Sales of Opel cars in Japan jumped last year to 17,042 from only
1,371 in 1992. By contrast VW/Audi sales plunged to 24,878 from 42,083.
'In the last four to five years Opel has gone from being very much a
Europe-oriented carmaker to an international company with global export
sales and local assembly and manufacturing,' says Mr Peter Hanenberger, GM
Europe vice-president for design, product and manufacturing engineering.
Signs are also emerging that GM eventually plans closer co-ordination
between Opel and its North American automotive operations. GM Europe is
developing a version of its new Opel Omega executive car for sale in North
America under the Cadillac brand name. This will be the US carmaker's first
substantial export of cars from Europe to North America since the early
1960s, and the first European-produced GM car to be sold under a North
American nameplate.
The process can also happen in reverse. GM is planning for the first time to
export to Europe a version of its next generation US-produced MPV
(multi-purpose vehicle) for sale under the Opel/Vauxhall badges, to compete
with vehicles such as the Renault Espace.
According to Mr Smith, the programme for a European-produced Cadillac is
'one of the most significant international projects GM has undertaken . . .
It makes little sense to build duplicate components or near-duplicate
platforms (chassis) for different regional market segments, when one region
can adapt or tailor what is being developed for another.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Lasmo hits out at Enterprise accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of Lasmo shifted gear yesterday as the UK oil
explorer accused its rival and predator, Enterprise Oil, of flattering
profits with unacceptable accounting practices.
Mr Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo chairman, alleged in a letter to shareholders that
Enterprise Oil had breached UK accounting practices in its treatment of
acquisitions. He claimed earnings would benefit by Pounds 650m. He
questioned the value of Enterprise's Pounds 1.4bn all-paper bid in light of
the accounting practices.
Lasmo's document alleges that Enterprise's accounting methods are out of
step with the oil and gas industry and cast doubt on the viability of the
dividend. It states that Enterprise's practice of writing off substantial
sums on acquisitions results in a lower depreciation charge and thus higher
profits. The write-offs cannot be attributable to goodwill, since this does
not arise on oil and gas assets.
'Both UK and US accounting standards require asset purchases of this type to
be recorded at the prices paid,' the company said. Yet the adjustments were
revealed only in US documents reconciling UK to US earnings.
'They have attacked us for openly and publicly writing off Pounds 500m
whereas they have secretly written off Pounds 600m,' Mr Agnew said.
Enterprise counter-attacked by noting that Lasmo had been one of its
shareholders at the time of two deals. Mr Julian West, head of corporate
development, said they had discussed the accounting treatment and 'they were
happy to book the Enterprise profits'.
Mr West accused Lasmo of pursuing 'an Arabian nights defence of a succession
of tall stories'.
Enterprise also rejected Lasmo's charge that it was over-distributing
uncovered dividends. 'We have never borrowed to pay the dividend,
exploration or overheads,' he said.
Analysts said the attack on the profit and loss account had been
over-played. 'It is really the balance sheet and cash flow which are
important to exploration and production companies,' said Mr Howard
Cattermole, of Strauss Turnbull. None believed that Enterprise or
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick would deliberately breach accounting
standards.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Bankers Trust withdraws Dollars 100m credit to Austrian bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust of New York and five other international banks have withdrawn
credit lines from Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft (Bawag), a leading Austrian
bank under investigation for irregular offshore investment practices.
Bankers Trust said it withdrew a Dollars 100m line of credit from Bawag last
week because it was uncomfortable with the bank's dealings with a
Bermuda-based hedge fund operation run by Mr Wolfgang Flottl, the son of
Bawag's chief executive, Mr Walter Flottl. The credit line was used to cover
Bankers Trust's exposure in its foreign exchange trades with Bawag.
Meanwhile, a confidential interim report by investigators from the Austrian
National Bank named five other international banks - Credit Lyonnais and
Paribas of France, Commerzbank and BHF of Germany and Republic National Bank
of New York - as having withdrawn credit lines from Bawag.
Austrian news magazines revealed last month that Mr Walter Flottl had
secretly directed up to Sch22.9bn (Pounds 1.3bn) more than a tenth of the
bank's total balance sheet, to offshore investment companies controlled by
his son.
The bank, which had been carrying out these operations for more than six
years, subsequently repatriated the entire amount.
Mr Tom Parisi, head of public relations at Bankers Trust, said that in spite
of the repatriation, 'we felt that the credit profile of the bank had been
adversely affected by this exposure to the hedge fund'.
Noting that Bawag's executive committee had not been fully informed of the
loans to companies run by Mr Flottl's son, and that a large part of Bawag's
earnings seemed to have been derived from this activity, Mr Parisi said: 'We
just didn't like the smell of it.'
The Austrian central bank investigators concluded that the liquidity of the
bank left 'no grounds for concern', but they could not yet confirm 'whether
Bawag has any further financial obligations resulting from these credit
transactions'.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Reuters to broadcast news to Londoners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters, the international financial information and news group, plans to
start broadcasting news and talk radio services to Londoners this autumn -
despite losing last year's franchise battle for the commercial radio
station.
The UK media giant has agreed to buy London Radio News, the consortium
backed by the merchant bank Guinness Mahon, which in September won the
battle for the AM and FM licences then held by LBC.
Reuters has paid less than Pounds 10m for the franchise, its first move into
radio. The group said the deal continued its expansion of news services
across all sectors of the media.
Guinness Mahon claimed it had been well advanced in putting together a
syndicate to fund the new station, but Reuters 'made us an offer we couldn't
refuse'.
Pressure on LRN may have been increased by the collapse into receivership of
LBC. LRN last month bought LBC from the receivers to prevent a damaging gap
in broadcasting and the dispersal of its 90 journalists.
The Radio Authority will approve the change of ownership, but emphasised
that Reuters would have to fulfil the conditions on which LRN was awarded
the licences.
Mr John Parcell, managing director of Reuters UK and Ireland, said: 'We
regard these as the most attractive local radio licences in the country and
they will be a showcase for Reuters news services.'
Mr David Rogers, Reuters editor UKI, said: 'The FM service will have a news
format unique to London and Britain, as developed by the founders of the LRN
licence bid. The AM service will also be speech-based, and will include
phone-ins, documentaries and discussion programmes.'
It is not clear whether there will be a role in the new set-up for Mr John
Tusa, former managing director of the BBC World Service, chairman of LRN.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Warburg names heirs to top jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg, the UK-based investment bank, yesterday put to rest speculation
about the succession of the firm's top management, saying its chief
executive Lord Cairns, will succeed chairman Mr David Scholey when he
retires in 1995.
There will be no new chief executive: Lord Cairns, with the title of
executive chairman, will fill both roles. This is a departure from
recommended best practice for corporate boards which urges separation of the
roles.
Meanwhile, Warburg also said that its 90-year old co-founder and senior
president, Mr Henry Grunfeld, would no longer hold that position from next
year. Mr Grunfeld, who emigrated to Britain in 1934, founded the original
New Trading Company with the late Mr Sigmund Warburg.
The announcement came as Warburg revealed record profits of Pounds 297m for
the year to March 31, despite a 40 per cent rise in salary costs and a
slowdown in trading profits in the second half.
Speculation about a new chief executive had centred on Mr Nick Verey,
managing director of investment banking and Mr Derek Higgs, a managing
director at SG Warburg and Co. Under the new structure, Mr Verey, 51 and Mr
Higgs, 50, will be chairmen of SG Warburg Securities and SG Warburg and Co
respectively.
Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman of Warburg's 75 per cent-owned fund management
arm, Mercury Asset Management, will form the third divisional chairman.
A spokesman for MAM, which has been a frequent, although quiet, participant
in corporate governance matters as a shareholder, said the group had no view
on whether companies are best run by separate chairmen and chief executives.
Meanwhile, MAM, reported a 33 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds
109.5m, despite a 30 per cent rise in operating costs following increases in
performance related pay and staffing.
MAM also said it had provisionally agreed to buy the 50 per cent of the
Geneva-based Bank SG Warburg Soditic AG it does not already own. It will pay
Pounds 48.3m cash, roughly twice the sum paid to SG Warburg for the first 50
per cent in 1990.
Mr Stevenson said the transaction would further MAM's ambitions in private
client fund management. MAM is trying to ease its dependence on the UK
institutional market and diversify into retail and international fund
management.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Beckett opens way for wider Labour contest: Leadership team
to be declared on July 21
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's national executive committee threw the party's leadership election
wide open yesterday by inviting a challenge to Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy
leader.
The surprise decision, taken at Mrs Beckett's request, opens the way for her
to join up to five other candidates in the race to succeed Mr John Smith as
leader.
It also raises the prospect of a contest for both jobs between teams linking
'modernising' and traditional candidates.
The new team will be declared on July 21 after a six-week campaign and a
postal ballot involving up to 4.3m party members and trade union supporters.
But the NEC will not accept nominations until after the European election on
June 9, suggesting that Labour is in for at least a fortnight of backstage
manoeuvring by potential candidates.
Mrs Beckett remains acting leader, and is not obliged to stand down as
deputy, even if she decides to stand for the leadership.
The decision to trigger an early contest removes the threat of a divisive
election at the party conference in September.
It also offers substantial financial savings. The joint poll, a preferential
ballot conducted mainly by post, will cost the party about Pounds 100,000
and the unions up to Pounds 1.5m.
Mrs Beckett, a traditionalist, is regarded as an outside candidate for the
leadership, which is widely expected to go to Mr Tony Blair, the modernising
shadow home secretary.
Last night a poll among trade unionists paying the political levy, who have
one third of the votes in Labour's electoral college, gave Mr Blair a
comfortable lead over his four main potential rivals. The NOP poll for The
Independent and BBC-TV's Newsnight put support for Mr Blair at 37 per cent
of levy-payers, ahead of Mr John Prescott, employment spokesman, on 22 per
cent, Mr Gordon Brown, shadow home secretary, 21 per cent, Mrs Beckett 12
per cent and Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, 7 per
cent.
Labour MPs said Mrs Beckett's chances could be boosted by her high-profile
role as acting leader during the European election campaign. Or she could
strengthen her authority as deputy leader by standing for re-election
independently or on a dream ticket with Mr Blair or Mr Brown.
The possibility of a contest for deputy leader also widens the options for
the other main traditionalist candidates - Mr Prescott and Mr Robin Cook.
In another surprise development, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign
secretary, said he had not ruled out standing for the leadership.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Greenspan opposes legislation to control derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve board, yesterday brushed
off calls for new legislation to control derivative financial instruments
and warned that intervention could increase risks to the US financial
system.
'Remedial legislation relating to derivatives is neither necessary nor
desirable at this time,' Mr Greenspan told a congressional subcommittee.
Mr Greenspan said there was a pressing need to overhaul the entire US
regulatory structure, but he warned that reforms aimed solely at derivatives
could be counterproductive.
Last week, the US General Accounting Office called for measures to
strengthen controls on this fast-expanding area of the financial markets.
Derivatives, such as swaps and options, are instruments derived from other
financial assets or indices.
The GAO warned that the entire financial system could be undermined because
of the lack of regulation, but Mr Greenspan highlighted the risk of
interven-tion: 'Legislation directed at derivatives is no substitute for
broader reform,' he said.
Without broader reform, he added, such legislation could increase risks in
the US financial system 'by creating a regulatory regime that is itself
ineffective and that diminishes the effectiveness of market discipline'.
Mr Greenspan's remarks were echoed by representatives of four US regulatory
agencies overseeing banks, securities dealers and futures markets in their
testimony in Washington to the House of Representatives subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance.
'I'm not prepared to say at this point: the sky is falling down, we need to
legislate,' said Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
Mr Eugene Ludwig, comptroller of the currency, and Mr Andrew Hove, chairman
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the two other principal
federal bank supervisors, as well as Ms Barbara Holum, acting chair of the
Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, expressed similar sentiments.
In contrast to Mr Greenspan, Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England's director
for banking supervision, yesterday repeated a call for the derivatives
trading subsidiaries of US securities firms to be regulated.
Mr Quinn said he was 'more agnostic' about increased regulation of other
participants in derivatives markets.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Ofgas chief eases hard line on energy efficiency plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ray of hope for the govern-ment's energy efficiency plans was offered
yesterday by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Britain's gas regulator, who extended an
olive branch to her predecessor as director-general of Ofgas.
Quizzed for the second time by the House of Commons environment committee,
Ms Spottiswoode qualified her earlier opposition to passing the costs of
energy efficiency projects on to gas customers.
Referring to her controversial testimony earlier this year, Ms Spottiswoode
said: 'I withdraw unreservedly any implication that my predecessor (Sir
James McKinnon) acted illegally.'
Sir James yesterday told the committee he had not acted outside his powers,
as previously suggested by Ms Spottiswoode. He said an energy efficiency
levy added to gas bills would not fall disproportionately on poorer
households.
MPs on the committee, however, described Ms Spottiswoode's comments as a
'grudging retraction'. They said they were still concerned for the future of
energy efficiency plans.
Mr Robert Ainsworth, Labour MP for Coventry North East, said: 'She has been
forced to move her position by the fact that the excuses she gave didn't
hold water.' But he added: 'I don't believe her basic principles have
changed - she will find ways of minimising Ofgas's role (in funding energy
efficiency) That was her attitude.'
The row, which has grown since Ms Spottiswoode's appointment in November,
centres on the financing of the Energy Saving Trust, one of the main planks
of the government's environmental strategy. The trust is intended to
subsidise household improvements which save energy, passing on the costs
through gas and electricity bills.
Ms Spottiswoode has argued that it was outside the regulator's powers to
levy, in effect, a tax. Yesterday, however, she said she now accepted that
such a levy did not constitute a tax.
She said she would reserve her discretion on approving projects in the light
of their impact on bills and whether schemes were 'the most cost-effective
way of achieving the objectives'.
Mr Eoin Lees, chief executive of the trust, said he was 'encouraged' that Ms
Spottiswoode might approve some projects.

FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There were two gratifying aspects to SG Warburg's results. The underlying
level of dealing profits appears quite strong in spite of February's
particularly sticky patch in the gilts market, while fee income has forged
ahead. Warburg's business will always have a cyclical element, but the case
that it is also enjoying long-term structural growth starts to look more
plausible as its international reach grows. In the short run much depends on
whether market conditions sustain the large volume of corporate business
that is evidently in the pipeline. Even so the shares do not look expensive.
Stripping out Warburg's Mercury Asset Management stake leaves investment
banking with a market value of Pounds 730m. That is not much for a business
which generated pre-tax profits of Pounds 187m last year.

FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Land Securities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike most of its peers, Land Securities has not put a foot wrong in recent
years. But the defensive qualities that stood it in good stead in the
recession may be a handicap in a rising market. Land's conservatism has
stopped it making mistakes, but has also prevented it from seizing
opportunities. Its modest spending on acquisitions has left it with a
sizeable chunk of unspent funds at a time when competition from institutions
is particularly intense. Restarting its development programme will take up
some of the slack, but on too small a scale to make much difference. With
its low gearing and safety-first approach, Land Securities will find it hard
to keep up with its more nimble rivals.
The company remains a well-tuned rent collecting machine, with a secure
income and good quality, well-let properties. But since most of its tenants
pay above-market rents, it will be several years before it reaps the benefit
of rising rents in its rent reviews. Flat or declining earnings mean Land
Securities may thus only maintain steadily rising dividends at the expense
of running down its dividend cover.

FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Carlton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is hard to know whether Carlton's acquisition of Central Television is
paying off. Though group interim results included two months of profits from
Central, they were not split out. Carlton did say that changes already
implemented would save Pounds 10m on an annual basis. The takeover benefits
have therefore come through somewhat faster than expected. Still unclear is
whether the eventual savings will be greater than the Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m
forecast when the deal was agreed last year.
In the short run, the recovery in TV advertising and strong growth of video
sales will continue to boost Carlton's profitability. Longer term doubts
hang over both of the group's major businesses: the expected eclipse of
videos by compact disc formats; and increased competition to its ITV
franchises from cable and satellite.
The government's review of cross-media ownership may throw up opportunities
for Carlton in cable and satellite. The chairman, Mr Michael Green, has been
vocal in calling for the barriers that keep media groups out of each others'
patches to be pulled down. But shareholders will probably want to see
Central fully integrated and enhancing earnings per share before Carlton
embarks on another big acquisition. Fortunately, that seems to be
management's intention.

FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Courtaulds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After near-disaster in the late 1970s, Courtaulds spent a decade trying to
iron out volatility from its fibres business. The outperformance of the
shares since then is a measure of its success. Yesterday's figures are a
reminder of the limits to text-book management. While Courtaulds is a
low-cost producer, demand remains unpredictable. Given the bleak outlook at
the interim stage, a 14 per cent drop in full year operating profits from
fibres and chemicals is something of a relief.
If fibres markets are kinder this year, tackling the coatings and sealants
business is now the most pressing task. Yesterday's Pounds 50m restructuring
charge is a step in that direction. An operating margin of 7 per cent on
turnover of Pounds 850m is well below what could be achieved. With the
economic cycle now turning in Courtaulds' favour, improvement in this area
should underpin growth.
But even if Courtaulds repeats its management success in fibres, the
prospects are hardly dazzling. For the shares to sustain a rating above the
market average, Courtaulds' new fibre Tencel needs to deliver. With plans
for 150,000 tonnes capacity by the end of the decade the company is backing
its faith with cash. The potential return on this investment is still
difficult to predict. If Courtaulds can make the best of its lead in this
area, though, the shares should again outperform.

FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: In a bind with bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to believe that barely a week has passed since the promise
of a hiatus in US monetary tightening was supposed to bring calm to
financial markets. Yesterday's 68 point fall in London equities came in the
slipstream of some bad news from the bond markets, notably Germany's
decision to withdraw a debt auction for lack of demand. But there were local
factors at work as well.
Though the UK's own gilts auction was well covered at 1.93 times, there were
doubts as to how much of the paper found its way into firm hands. There is
growing indigestion in the new issue market for equities, coupled with the
prospect of a not particularly appetising rights issue from Eurotunnel this
morning. With the FT-SE 100 index hovering not far above 3,000, equities
arguably offer value. The economic recovery has apparently survived last
month's tax rises, while both earnings and dividends have proved
surprisingly buoyant in 1994.
Yet the argument is not compelling. The market is still on a historic p/e
not far short of 20. The earnings momentum may falter next year when both
interest rates and taxes will be rising again. As for dividends, Whitehall
chatter about possible action to stop companies over-paying is a
destabilising force. The most worrisome aspect is that the more the
authorities come under funding pressure in a weak gilt market, the more they
may be tempted to alter the fiscal regime in a way that favours bonds over
equities.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Camelot draws the winning ticket: The victors and losers in
the hotly contested battle for the UK lottery licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 18th-century author Henry Fielding had a clear idea of how powerful a
device a lottery could be for raising money.
'A lottery is a Taxation
Upon all the Fools in Creation;
And Heaven be prais'd
It is easily raised,
Credulity is always in Fashion.'
The song was sung in Fielding's play The Lottery performed at the Drury Lane
Theatre in 1732.
Across London, in the more sober surroundings of the Institution of Civil
Engineers, near the House of Commons, there was little credulity yesterday
when Camelot was unveiled as the winner of the fiercely contested battle for
the National Lottery licence.
There was, however, a lot of optimism that enormous sums can be raised for
five 'good causes' specified by the government through the first nationwide
lottery in the UK for more than 150 years.
Camelot is forecasting that during the seven-year term of its licence the
total turnover for the National Lottery will amount to Pounds 32bn, and that
Pounds 9bn will be distributed to the good causes - the Arts Councils of the
UK, the Sports Councils, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Millennium
Commission and the National Lottery Charity board.
In its 'peak year' of operation, Camelot, which has long been seen as the
potential victor in the lottery contest - although no official word of the
actual winner leaked - envisages a turnover of Pounds 5.5bn and a payment to
the good causes of Pounds 1.6bn. Camelot, which plans to launch the lottery
in early November, believes it will be able to hand over Pounds 750m in its
first full year of operation.
Camelot brings together five large organisations: Cadbury Schweppes, the
confectionery group, De La Rue, the banknote and security printer, G-Tech,
the US lottery equipment manufacturer, ICL, the computer group, and Racal,
the electronics and communications group.
Mr Tim Holley, the quietly spoken Racal executive who became chief executive
of Camelot, said yesterday: 'This is a very, very exciting project.' He said
not only would the lottery be the largest in the world, but it would also
involve the largest launch of a consumer brand in the UK.
The game itself could hardly be more simple. A player will pay Pounds 1 and
choose six numbers out of a possible 49 on a 'play card'. The numbers do not
have to be placed in any particular order. Three correct numbers will
probably be worth a Pounds 10 prize; four, Pounds 50-Pounds 60; five,
several thousand pounds. Pick the correct six numbers and you hit the
jackpot, which could be between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m each week.
'It's easy, it's simple, and it will be a lot of fun,' said Mr David Rigg,
Camelot's communications director.
The draw of the winning numbers will take place live on prime-time
television on Saturday nights. Camelot believes the programme could shoot
straight to the top of the ratings with possible audiences of 23m. Though no
television contracts have been signed, Camelot says the broadcast will
'probably' go to the BBC, partly because the corporation can offer extensive
live radio as well as television coverage.
The company has not yet decided whether the draw will be the climax of a
40-minute light entertainment show or a five-minute programme devoted
entirely to the draw, or whether the BBC will make the programme in-house or
use an independent producer. A celebrity guest will inevitably be involved.
The total prize pay-out ratio over the period of the licence, which runs to
the end of September 2001, will be more than 56.5 per cent of net sales
after the deduction of a 12 per cent lottery tax on gross sales. The good
causes' money will range from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total revenues.
One of yesterday's losers, who had promised to offer all profits to a
combination of good causes and charities, was Mr Richard Branson, chairman
of Virgin group. He was not alone in his disappointment. Seven applicants
failed, a number of whom had been working on the project for several years.
The unsuccessful bidders, ranging from The Great British Lottery Company,
which includes Granada and Carlton Communications, to Mr Branson's UK
Lottery Foundation, and the NM Rothschild-Tattersalls bid, spent millions in
putting their consortiums together.
Mr Peter Davis, the director-general of the National Lottery, who finally
took the crucial decision last week, made it clear that he had no doubt that
Camelot was the strongest applicant. The company came near the top or at the
top of every category in which the applicants were assessed, he said.
They were 'amongst the highest' in the forecasts for money to be raised, and
plan to retain only 11 per cent of revenues as combined profits and
operating costs - by far the lowest on offer. Out of this will come 5 per
cent sales commission to retailers. This will leave profits of less than 1
per cent of sales. 'Camelot was also by a long way the best prepared,' said
Mr Davis.
The only thing that might have stopped Camelot winning the licence was
controversy surrounding G-Tech, which has been accused by rivals in the US
of irregularities. The company has never been found guilty of any
wrongdoing.
'I am satisfied that we have a full and comprehensive picture of all the
people involved, and I am confident in my decision that all those involved
with Camelot, and Camelot itself, are fit and proper for that role,' Mr
Davis said.
The lottery will not just make winners of the players. Camelot itself is the
most obvious winner so far. Mr Bruce Jones, leisure analyst at the
stockbroker Smith NewCourt, marked Racal, which will benefit from
communications contracts, and Cadbury Schweppes as 'buys', and De La Rue a
'hold' in a recent forecast if Camelot won.
But there are likely to be a large number of other business winners from a
lottery that plans to sell its first tickets in 26 weeks - in early
November.
The G-Tech lottery machines will be made at ICL's plant at Ashton-under-Lyne
and contracts will soon be awarded for the provision of tickets and later
the scratch-card games which will be launched next year. Camelot will
directly employ about 500 at Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, and at Aintree
on Merseyside, but more jobs will flow from the retail operation - selling
lottery tickets in both shops, from independent corner stores to garages,
supermarkets and newsagents.
Camelot plans to have 10,000 outlets selling tickets by the November launch,
and within two years 27,000 outlets connected to the largest computer
network in the UK, plus a further 12,000 outlets selling only scratch cards.
Some observers have suggested that the total number of jobs generated
directly or indirectly could reach 85,000, though the figure is probably
optimistic.
The construction industry could be among those benefiting greatly from the
proceeds of the National Lottery. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage
secretary, has made it clear that he expects the money to be 'spent mainly
on capital projects' to provide new and lasting improved facilities, such as
sports stadiums and concert halls.
Even Mr Branson, who had pledged to raise more than Pounds 11bn for
charities and good causes, and angrily attacked the choice of Camelot
yesterday, contributed to the lottery outcome by improving the income of the
good causes.
First Mr Branson and his partner Lord Young, the former trade and industry
secretary, generated publicity for the lottery and dominated front pages
when the bids were submitted in February by bringing along Desert Orchid,
the famous racehorse. More significantly, by promising to give all his
profits to the good causes and some charities of his own, Mr Branson forced
all the other bidders to reduce their own profit margins.
As Mr Davis observed yesterday, the bidding process had worked well, in
forcing up the money for good causes and forcing down the amount absorbed by
profits and operating costs.
It remains to be seen, however, whether Fielding was right in saying that a
lottery is 'easily raised', even when the sums involved total Pounds 32bn
and the odds against winning a jackpot are roughly 14m to one.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Personal View: Too many dollars, not enough sense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE A MAGNUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It still amazes me that the US dollar's weakness has caused so much
surprise. The consensus may be cracking, but most people still seem to
believe the outlook is promising or, more bluntly, that long positions will
be rewarded eventually. Part of the reason for the surprise and continuing
optimism is the failure to grasp the real issues underlying the dollar's
weakness.
Most commentaries on the dollar's problems have ignored or overlooked the
simple words 'balance of payments deficit'. It is here the root cause of the
dollar's problems lies. The financing needed, in terms of required capital
inflow, has started to falter in the face of real interest rate levels that
are still too weak, relative to Germany and Japan, for example. Unless the
US authorities are prepared to agree soon to a substantial increase in US
interest rates - for example, an increase in the Federal Funds rate to about
6 per cent, implying long yields of about 8 to 8.5 per cent - the value of
the dollar will erode by a further 7 to 10 per cent.
The last significant US balance of payments problem was in 1987, some time
after the 1985 Plaza agreement to secure further depreciation. Then, the US
current account deficit reached a record Dollars 167bn, equivalent to 3.7
per cent of gross domestic product. But at that time the US still enjoyed
substantial inflows of private, long-term investment capital of about
Dollars 60bn.
In 1993, the US current account deficit was a mere Dollars 109bn, or 1.7 per
cent of GDP, but net long-term capital (securities transactions and direct
investment) recorded an outflow of some Dollars 40bn. Thus, comparing 1987
and 1993, the sum of the current account deficit and net long-term capital
flows was about the same, at 2.2 per cent of GDP.
This year and in 1995, America's balance of payments is set to reach real
records. We forecast the current account deficit will rise this year to
about Dollars 145bn-Dollars 150bn and in 1995 to about Dollars 170bn, or
some 2.5 per cent of GDP. But we have to add long-term capital outflows,
which are assumed at some Dollars 50bn to Dollars 60bn a year - 0.75 per
cent of GDP.
As the table shows, the US faces the problem of obtaining stable and secure
financing of the growing amount of dollars it is creating via its balance of
payments deficit, at a time when the main vehicles for such financing are
suspect. Central banks have acquired large increases in dollar reserves
already and net banking flows cannot be relied on.
The US is already the world's largest net debtor. Its net international
investment position has swung from +Dollars 230bn in 1977 to - Dollars 34bn
in 1987 and to an estimated - Dollars 588bn at the end of 1983.
By comparison, in Japan, the current account surplus (Dollars 130bn in
fiscal 1993-94) may fall on a temporary and cyclical basis, but medium-term
prospects favour a renewed widening towards the middle of the decade as
Japan Inc learns to live with a stronger yen. Upward pressure on the yen has
less to do with US trade rhetoric than with the fact Japan is not recycling
its current account surpluses as in years gone by. Foreign investment is not
that appealing to companies trying to rebuild after the domestic asset price
collapse and coping with a strong yen. And in Germany, unification led to a
collapse of the country's current account surplus, but its trade balance is
on the rise again from 1994 and it continues to enjoy a sizeable capital
inflow.
The task of absorbing about Dollars 200bn a year is problematic because US
real interest rates are inadequate to make US investors change the
structural diversification on which they have embarked or make foreign
investors, already long of dollars, buy more. It will not count for much if
the Bundesbank reduces nominal interest rates once more over the next six to
nine months, say to about 4 to 4.5 per cent, if this keeps real D-Mark rates
at about 2 to 2.5 per cent. In the bond market, real yields are running at
about 4 per cent. The US Fed would have to offer considerably in excess of
that to reactivate capital flows that helped to push the dollar back up on a
medium-term view. Moreover, it would have to 'shock' the markets. The
trouble is, it knows it would shock the US government and domestic financial
markets, too.
The question is whether the US authorities would permit such monetary
tightening and, if not, whether they may be forced into it by the extent of
US dollar depreciation. Either way, the issue for the US - as it is for
markets - is when and under what circumstances US authorities will pay
attention to the imbalance between savings and investment, which is
resulting in the supply of far too many dollars.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Leading Article: More knocks for the PIA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few disinterested observers would argue with the Treasury select committee's
assertion that the British retail financial services industry has for too
long been characterised by incompetence and mis-selling. The irony is that
the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), a watchdog that has not yet even
been recognised by the Securities and Investments Board, has attracted
louder and more damaging criticism than the existing regulatory bodies that
so signally failed to check the abuses that have come to light. The risk,
amidst all the hullabaloo that now surrounds the future of the PIA, is that
the need for more rigorous and speedy investor protection will be
overlooked.
The credibility of the PIA's chairman, Mr Joe Palmer, has undeniably been
damaged by an unfortunate gaffe before the select committee and by
misdemeanours committed by Legal &amp; General, which he used to run. Yet it is
not clear that the committee is right in thinking that a new chairman would
help at this point. Any new candidate would be unlikely to command universal
confidence. The job calls for an understanding of the industry, the respect
of consumer groups and the public, and a deft hand in dealing with
politicians. Even if such a paragon could be found, the loss of yet another
chairman, after the departure last year of Sir Gordon Downey, would in
itself be damaging.
The priority at this point should be to implement those of the select
committee's recommendations that are designed to put this rickety show on
the road as quickly as possible. Calls for changes in the balance of the PIA
board to strengthen public interest representation, close monitoring of
commission-only salesmen and individual registration of salesmen and
advisers are eminently sensible. Should Mr Palmer fail to deliver on such
minimum requirements of the committee within a reasonable time of the PIA
being recognised, then the case for replacing him will be unanswerable.
The wider question concerns the logic of the SIB's continuing role in retail
regulation. This is, in effect, a fifth wheel on the regulatory coach, which
opens up undesirable scope for regulatory arbitrage. The PIA is not a
self-regulatory body along the lines originally envisaged by the Financial
Services Act. The objection to it both setting standards and regulating
practitioners is no longer relevant; and the case for an intermediate body,
the SIB, between the PIA and the Treasury has lost its rationale.
But if the PIA were to become a 'designated agency', such as the SIB, it
would not have legal power to go down the desirable path of individual
registration or to impose fines. That, along with technical legal problems,
means that legislation would be necessary to knock the structure into
coherent shape. But the Treasury prefers to hide behind the protective
shelter of the SIB. In view of the magnitude of past failures in the area,
that is a bridge the government must eventually cross.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Leading Article: European peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's EU conference on 'stability in Europe' is the brainchild of the man
who will open it, Mr Edouard Balladur. Nearly a year ago he launched his
plan for a 'stability pact' under which the EU would coax central and east
European states into settling their bilateral disputes over frontiers and
national minorities.
The rationale sounded good. The EU, having ignominiously failed in
Yugoslavia, should take timely action to prevent the same sort of thing
happening elsewhere. It should use its undoubted leverage over ex-communist
states to persuade them to work together, rather as the US did in western
Europe with the Marshall Plan. If these countries were to join the EU, they
must not bring unresolved conflicts in with them.
For all that, there were many reservations both among France's partners and
among the countries concerned. The mention of border disputes was felt to be
unhelpful: no state in Europe officially lays claim to its neighbours'
territory, but all too many would feel justified in doing so once the
subject was opened. To link the question to national minorities was doubly
unfortunate, since one of the main arguments used against giving rights to
such minorities is precisely the fear that this would prove the first step
towards loss of national territory.
The proposal has since been refined so as to avoid, or at least attenuate,
those objections. But it is clear that the central European countries
attending still do so with strong reservations, except perhaps in the case
of Hungary whose outgoing nationalist government (now disavowed by the
voters) made agitation on behalf of its 'kith and kin' in neighbouring
countries one of the main planks of its foreign policy. The other country
which seems increasingly anxious to do the same is Russia, whose foreign
minister Mr Andrei Kozyrev, will no doubt stress the issue in his speech.
That very fact will make Russia's neighbours even less keen on the whole
project.
Both central and east European states can legitimately object that, like the
victorious allies in 1919, the EU is trying to impose on them a standard of
minority rights that it does not apply to itself. And, while 'kin states'
can sometimes play a constructive role in managing minority issues - as
Austria has in the Italian South Tyrol and Ireland is trying to do in Ulster
 -it is dangerous to give such states a general licence to interfere in
their neighbours' affairs, especially when they have the size and record of
Russia.
In so far as such issues can be handled internationally, it is best done
discreetly and on the basis of a single, generally accepted set of
principles. That is the approach already adopted by the CSCE, 40 of whose 52
member states will be represented in Paris today, through its high
commissioner on national minorities, Mr Max van der Stoel. The EU's most
valuable contribution could be to give his efforts quiet support.

Is there life after the Beeb for John Tusa? The former head of the World

director-generalship, then had a discordant eight-month sojourn as president
at Wolfson College, Cambridge, before walking out saying that he had better
things to do with his time.
His name was bandied about for the Arts Council job. He didn't get it.
Now London News Radio, of which he is non-executive chairman, may be gobbled
up by Reuters even before it goes on air.
If this happens, Tusa could be looking for another part-time job. Of course,
he could always do a few more shifts presenting the One o'Clock news for the
BBC.

Such are the troubles of Tansu Ciller, Turkey's prime minister, that even a
seemingly innocuous family event, such as this week's visit to the US to
attend her son's graduation day, is recast as a major crisis.
Entirely omitting the real reason for her visit, the country's leading
newspaper has made out that it was her husband Ozer, under the heat of
scandal allegations, who was fleeing the country to live in America.
There have indeed been periodic allusions to business wrongdoing when Ozer
was general manager of the collapsed Istanbul Bank, but we are hardly
talking Whitewater here.
Again, Ozer may use his wife's position to push a few of his business
cronies, but he does not appear to have much interest in broader policy
questions. She so demonstrably wears the trousers - indeed, she started off
by forcing him to take her maiden name, a feisty move, even by western
standards.
Much more likely is that Ozer means to brush up his American contacts. He
was after all franchise-holder in Turkey for the 7-Eleven convenience store
chain before he very publicly resigned when his wife took on the Turkish
leadership last June.

Why has Max Chapman, Nomura's hard-hitting New York chief, cancelled his
plans to come to London?
Nomura's top management in Tokyo had been counting on the Chapman magic,
which transformed the firm's sleepy New York operation into a significant
Wall Street presence, to work similar wonders with its less-than-dazzling
London outfit.
The official version of events thereafter is that Chapman decided that
running New York and London together would be a bit much - and might indeed
jeopardise what he had achieved so far in America.
Wall Street, however, believes that Chapman did not take the London job
either because he asked for too much in the way of pay and perks, or because
management in Tokyo suddenly got cold feet about bringing Chapman's loose
and aggressive management style to London.
Nomura insiders counter that a compensation package had already been agreed
upon by both sides, and contend that his family's opposition to the move was
a very significant factor in the volte face.
Chapman must believe there is still plenty to occupy him in the Big Apple,
for he has just renewed his contract. He could make a start by trying to
recoup the losses sustained in the volatile markets of recent months.

Sprint had better get a move on. The US long-distance phone company thought
it had its eye on the ball when it sent a 24-page booklet extolling its
services to journalists covering what it calls 'the world's greatest
sporting event' - football's World Cup to be held in the US this summer. 'As
you make your preparations,' it said, 'you may not be thinking about things
as simple as phone calls. We are.'
Not enough, unfortunately. Nowhere in all the bumf was there a contact phone
or fax number.

So what next for Sir David Scholey, the man responsible for assembling
Britain's only half- decent competitor to Wall Street's powerful investment
banks?
After 30 years on the job, he has handed in his notice as a director and
plans to retire upstairs to join the 86-year-old Lord Roll in the
president's office.
Warburg stresses that Sir David will continue to devote his time 'largely to
the business of the group'. But he is not yet 59, and the young turks at
Warburg might prefer it if he went off and did his own thing for a while and
left them to run the show.
There is no shortage of jobs. If British Telecom ever decided to split the
role of chairman and chief executive, Sir David, as one of BT's senior
directors, would be a natural chairman.
Then there is the question of the succession at GEC, where both Lords Prior
and Weinstock are getting a bit long in the tooth. Sir David would be a
diplomatic choice as chairman while the City decided whether young Simon
Weinstock was up to taking over from his dad.
If Sir David really has tired of the commercial grind, there is always the
BBC, whose board he has just joined. The chairman's job does not fall vacant
until November 1996, but Marmaduke Hussey is over 70 and might be persuaded
to take early retirement.
Given that Sir David didn't get the Bank of England governor's job, how
about giving him the BBC as a consolation prize?
It's hard to imagine him disappearing from public view for long.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Raising skills
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the government published its white paper on competitiveness on Tuesday,
it was quickly attacked for the absence of dramatic initiatives. Eschewing
such grand gestures was sensible, given the history of UK industrial policy
and its poor record of picking winners. A new study from the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research suggests that less glamorous
micro-economic policies can do more to enhance business performance than
heavy-handed government action.
The study analyses the skills and performance of engineering and chemical
companies in Germany and the UK. In both sectors, the German companies have
workforces that are better qualified than those in the UK. On the shopfloor,
this is a consequence of the high level of craft qualification achieved by
the German apprenticeship training system. Among supervisors, the German
companies can draw on the technically-trained meister while only a handful
of British supervisors have specific training. Tackling these shortcomings
in the UK's skills base is rightly at the centre of the competitiveness
package.
But the researchers also found significant differences in the skills
available at graduate and postgraduate levels. In engineering, the German
companies have more than double the proportion of technical and higher
degree graduates of their UK counterparts. As a result, British companies
are less innovative in their products. They also find it harder to make
incremental production changes to remain competitive. It is hardly
surprising that their productivity trails the German plants, or that they
are 'followers' in technical innovation.
In the chemical industry, companies in the two countries employ similar
numbers of graduates. But German companies have a much higher proportion of
postgraduates which the study believes will help them cope better with the
accelerating pace of innovation. Postgraduates can draw on specialist
knowledge and contacts, and improve knowledge transfer from research
institutes to business. Yet UK employers tend to prefer first degree
graduates and regard postgraduates as over-specialised and lacking in
commercial and practical skills.
Raising the skills base of key industries thus involves much more than
training. Encouraging business to make better use of the UK's excellent
science base and to harness the skills of postgraduates is also vital. Last
year's science white paper launched a series of initiatives to encourage
this, including a new research master's degree. This will combine a
grounding in research techniques with skills such as management, team
working and communication.
Policy changes such as these are unlikely to grab the headlines or win many
votes in the political marketplace. But if successful, they could make a
significant contribution to improving the performance of British business.

Sir, How did Laura Thompson manage to overlook Newcastle United in her
review of the English season (Sport: 'Blessed break for the game', May 23)?
They are surely the very thing she was looking for - a team that plays with
the skill, attitude and flair of Manchester United but which, more often
than not, is composed solely of English outfield players.
Newcastle United may not quite match up to Manchester United yet in
consistency of performance throughout the season, but there is every
indication they will do so very soon.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Three big cheers for no 'beef'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Democrat aspirant to the White House (Gary Hart) was plagued by
cries of 'Where's the beef?' What the complaint meant, when translated out
of journalese, was the relative absence of plans to raise federal spending
or intervene in the conduct of business and industry.
The British government's white paper on competitiveness, now appearing after
a long gestation period, has been predictably greeted with similar cries.
The kinds of 'beef' that exponents of competitiveness usually want are
nearly all pernicious: tax favours for selected sectors, disguised export
subsidies, or threats to overseas countries such as President Bill Clinton's
'targets' for import penetration into Japan.
The absence of such items is a good feature of the white paper. Except in
the education and training field few new policies are announced.
For the rest the white paper restates existing policies. Some new ideas are
to be 'studied' or 'investigated'; and in their search for hard
announcements officials have been forced to drop in sentences such as: 'Lord
Walker is to be personal adviser to the president of the Board of Trade on
overseas investment.' The document is reminiscent of many of the products of
pre-Thatcher Tory governments in its mixture of exhortation, statistics and
summaries of mostly minor government moves.
The postwar style comes out clearly on the cover, which illustrates a
melange of industrial processes - as if to reassure ministers who might have
been alarmed by the patient explanations of the official writers (paragraphs
1.27 to 1.29) that all sectors of the economy are (equally) important and
that 'many of today's high-tech industries include ones in the service
sector'.
The white paper is torn between the desire to show that Britain's
performance has been relatively good over the past 15 years of Conservative
government and the need to show that it has not been good enough, in order
to sustain exhortation about competitiveness. On the whole the first
requirement tends to prevail.
The document has many good things, in spite of its title. It can be regarded
as a sort of economic report: an embryonic version of a document such as the
US Council of Economic Advisers' Report, which reflects the outlook of the
incumbent administration, but is reasoned and analytical, with a statistical
framework that changes little from one president to the next.
The white paper should be improved, given a new title and made into an
annual event until it achieves such status. But it has a long way to go. It
is a difficult document in which to find one's way. There is no index, list
of figures or even detailed table of contents. Maddeningly, the statistics
from which the charts are drawn are omitted so one either has to guess or
fax the Department of Trade and Industry if one wants more than an
impressionistic glance.
The white paper authors try hard to come out with a concept of
competitiveness by which they can square their economic conscience. In the
end they settle for the OECD definition: 'The degree to which (a country)
can, under free and fair market conditions, produce goods and services which
meet the test of international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and
expanding the real incomes of its people over the long term.'
The OECD definition might please politicians by giving some credence to the
notion of all countries being more competitive, but it is opaque enough to
put off others from fuller analysis. Deconstructed, the definition means
some combination of reasonable productivity growth and an appropriately
valued real exchange rate. If people want to use words in this funny way,
why should we seek to spoil their game? But alas the issue does matter. The
white paper's official authors desperately try to undo damage by inserting
in the body of the document that 'there are prizes in world markets for
all'.
But what competitiveness means to most people is illustrated by the white
paper's sub-heading: Helping Business to Win. Overall performance can only
be translated into competitiveness if countries are ranked in an imaginary
league table rather than being content to improve on their own. The big
defect in talking about countries being more or less competitive is that it
makes world trade a form of warfare in which one country can only gain at
the expense of another.
Thus unfortunately the lack of 'beef' in this white paper is all too likely
to mean pressure on this or another government to produce a much more
interventionist document which will really attempt to boost Britain's trade
at the expense of other countries. For being more competitive means, in
ordinary language, being more competitive against others.
The positive conclusion from international comparisons is that, judged by
labour costs, the UK is the most competitive of the European Union countries
except Italy, and is also more competitive than Japan. Only the US is more
competitive. Even in 1990 when the UK entered the exchange rate mechanism,
unit labour costs in manufacturing were lower than in Germany and France.
How come if America and Britain are so competitive that they have such
notorious current payments deficits? One could say that it is non-price
competitiveness, such as delivery, design and so on. But that would be
scraping the barrel. The payments deficits could be the mirror image of
budget deficits, but that is not completely convincing either. An
alternative explanation is that these deficits reflect international
differences in private savings relative to investment opportunities, or
inflows of capital funds across the exchanges. In the latter case, as some
people will be sorry to hear, there may be no problem at all.
There is such a thing as being too competitive. Let us suppose that by some
magic British labour costs could be halved overnight relative to those of
other countries. Unless there were some change in underlying international
capital flows the improvement could not last. British producers would for a
time be swamped with extra demand, which would be fine for a while.
Eventually, however, a combination of higher domestic costs and an
appreciation of sterling would choke off the extra demand. The result would
be a return to the original level of competitiveness and balance of
payments, with a great deal of disturbance en route.
Fifty years ago yesterday, a much more important white paper was issued, the
wartime coalition government 1944 paper on employment policy. The promise of
that earlier document was to provide conditions for high employment. Alas,
that hope has been dashed from our lips.
If unemployment were a question of just a few countries with overvalued real
exchange rates, then it might make sense to see the problem in terms of
competitiveness. But when high unemployment is a common problem among nearly
all developed countries, it makes no sense at all to see it in these
relative terms. Nor does it make sense to call for greater competitiveness
against developing or former communist countries which are hard put to pay
their way even with their comparatively low wages.
Some ministers in the Thatcher government of the 1980s were brave enough to
talk of workers being priced out of jobs. Present-day ministers prefer to
translate this unpalatable concept into the superficially softer one of lack
of international competitiveness. The effect is, however, to project the
problem on to the outside world - as if somehow inferior performance by
China or the Czech Republic would make western European unemployment go
away.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Positive achievements of Dr Banda
should also be recognised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir HENRY PHILLIPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is all too easy for Michael Holman and Nick Young to brand Dr Banda
of Malawi as an oppressive dictator accountable only to himself ('Malawi
slips at last from iron grip of Banda,' May 21). Not much is said about his
positive achievements.
I was his minister of finance during Nyasaland's transition to independence
in 1964 and when at that point I left the country it is not unfair to say
that, due to a paucity of resources, it was an impoverished colonial
backwater. Dr Banda's first task was to mobilise funds from elsewhere in the
western world.
This enabled him to finance a formidable programme of social and economic
development. The importance he attaches to education manifested itself in
the establishment of primary schools for all, secondary schools in every
district and a university of which he is chancellor. The need to open up the
country resulted in major road construction, a railway extension, more
frequent air services and vastly improved telecommunications. And he sought
to encourage industrial investment by a liberal regime for private
enterprise.
Even more important, his personal intervention in agricultural production
and marketing ensured self-sufficiency in their basic foodstuff. Very
occasionally, the failure of the rains might have made it necessary to
import maize, but this danger did not divert him from admitting a million
hungry refugees from the civil war in neighbouring Mozambique, a signal act
of humanity.
Since I left Malawi and, until recently, I have been a regular visitor as a
director of the National Bank of Malawi, and I have travelled the length and
breadth of the country. Compared with my colonial memories I can say without
hesitation that the quality of life of its peoples has vastly improved as a
result of Dr Banda's policies. Adults and children alike are by African
standards well clad, well nourished, industrious and happy.
We may detest autocratic rule, but strict discipline is often necessary to
overcome backwardness. In Malawi, many individuals have suffered in the
process; and the emotional reporting of such incidents has unsurprisingly
engendered a worldwide sense of outrage which tends to overshadow any
resultant common good.
Dr Banda, even at his great age and in supreme command, has bowed to world
opinion (while reminding us that not so long ago we imprisoned him without
trial]) He set in train reforms necessary to safeguard human rights and to
introduce political pluralism; and he has graciously acknowledged defeat by
a successor to whom he has pledged full support.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Corruption and Fall of Richard Nixon
By Fred Emery
Jonathan Cape, Pounds 20, 542 pages
It is instructive to look again at the edition of Life magazine, dated
November 25 1968. On the cover, next to the caption 'The Nixon era begins',
is a smiling president-elect, but the text and pictures inside now come over
with a sense of retrospective fore-boding.
There is a three-quarter-page shot of election night in New York conspicuous
for its lack of warmth and enthusiasm. Richard Milhous Nixon and his family
are celebrating, but the crowd is curiously static, no punched fists in the
air, no one obviously shouting approval. Reflecting on an awful year, with
two assassinations, race riots and violent anti-war demonstrations at the
Democratic convention in Chicago, Life did not hold out much hope that the
new president could change things for the better. His campaign had been
'serviceable if not inspiring', his solutions 'managerial and unspecific'.
When he died last month, American reactions to their 37th president went
through two phases in quick order. The first, dictated by the decent
instinct not to speak ill of the dead and spurred on by the generous
eulogies of President Bill Clinton and others, almost amounted to a kind of
revisionism. Obituaries and columns delved deeply enough into the reasons
for his downfall - Watergate - but they were offset by compliments for an
endurance in disgrace that to many was tantamount to rehabilitation, and for
the good things he had done as president. A fixture in American politics
since 1946, there seemed almost a sense of national loss that he was no
longer around as the focus of a new admiration or the old loathing.
The second phase revised this revisionism. Garry Trudeau's 'Doonesbury'
cartoon strip savagely lampooned those who had tried to rewrite Watergate.
Others wrote with passion about the betrayal of a nation's trust by a man
who became the first president to resign in order to avoid impeachment.
Interestingly, for one who had covered Nixon's first term, which ended with
his landslide victory in 1972 but before Judge John Sirica opened cracks in
the Watergate defences, and who had spent long nights in London editing
Watergate copy from our Washington bureau, I found much of both phases
unreadable. I had my opinions of Nixon, I said to myself. Why read those of
others with axes to grind?
Fred Emery has provided a necessary 'reality check' and it could not have
come from a better non-American source. He was The Times's Washington bureau
chief from 1970-77. Unlike the late, great Peter Jenkins who, when resident
Guardian correspondent, knew in his bones that Nixon was rotten, Emery was a
reporter's reporter, in the best American sense of the term, writing what he
knew and could find out without embroidery.
He survived - and thrived - even though his then editor, William Rees-Mogg,
once flew to Washington to tell US journalists assembled at the National
Press Club to stop crucifying their president because Watergate simply was
not important enough. It may be doubted that today's press barons would be
so charitable to those not toeing the proprietor's line.
Emery's book, published in conjunction with the BBC documentary series
already begun in the UK and due to air in the US to coincide with the 20th
anniversary of Nixon's resignation in August, is a smoothly written,
meticulously researched narrative account of what began as 'a third-rate
burglary' and ended as a cover-up of monumental proportions at the highest
levels of government.
Of course, as he makes 'perfectly clear', to use Nixon's favourite phrase,
it did not all begin with the break-in of Democratic party offices on the
Memorial Day weekend of 1972. The seeds had been sown a good two years
earlier, as an enraged Nixon - and an equally furious Henry Kissinger -
tried to find out who had been leaking what over the bombing incursions in
Cambodia and the publication of the Pentagon Papers, detailing US
involvement in Vietnam.
The cast of characters that was to become notorious - Haldemann, Ehrlichman,
Mitchell, Liddy, Hunt, Dean, Huston, Young, Magruder and many more - was
commissioned (the 'plumbers') and in place for 'dirty tricks'. What they did
still has the power to shock, but nothing like as much as the cover-up
itself. The endemic characteristic of good US scandals is that the act
itself is never as bad as subsequent attempts to frustrate and conceal, a
lesson still not learnt 20 years on.
Indeed, if there is one overriding lesson from this book relevant to
contemporary revisionism, it is that Nixon was not betrayed by overzealous
minions taking the vague wishes of his darker side to extremes. The
president might have overruled, in July 1971, a madcap scheme to firebomb
the Brookings Institution, a Democratic redoubt, but for such a plan to have
been drawn up and presented to the Oval Office on the reasonable expectation
of approval speaks volumes for the degree of control exercised from the very
top. If that were true pre-Watergate, it just got worse as events spun out
of the control of even the mastermind.
None of this was evident to, or even suspected by, Life in 1968 beyond its
graphic pictures and words. But Hugh Sidey wrote in that edition that the
new president-elect could do far worse than visit Williamsburg, Virginia,
where independence from Britain was planned, to soak up an atmosphere he
said was still redolent of Washington, Jefferson, Monroe and Madison. We may
only speculate whether history would have been different had Richard Nixon
taken the advice.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Frustration of auditors over
liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G ACHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am delighted your editorial, 'The liabilities of auditors' (May 23),
recognises there is a serious issue to address: '. . . In principle, the
argument for reform seems sound. It must be unreasonable for auditors to be
held wholly responsible for corporate disasters when they have not been the
direct cause of the problems.'
You recognise that reform would require radical changes in the law
'overturning the principle of joint and several liability', and that there
is no likelihood of this reform being introduced soon. That is the dilemma
which has resulted in what you term 'a flawed alternative'.
Auditors are well aware that the change proposed to Section 310 of the
Companies Act 1985 is the second-best solution. However, it is surely better
to do something to improve an unfair position, even the second-best option,
than to do nothing at all? Readers may remember that five years ago the
Liklerman report suggested, among other steps, the change to Section 310
which the big firms now propose, yet nothing has been done since then.
You also commented on the reluctance of firms when sued for audit negligence
to go to court, particularly when the courts have 'in practice demonstrated
considerable sympathy for the profession, tightly restricting its duty of
care . . .' Decisions not to go to court are based on a case by case
commercial assessment of the likely cost, etc - legal costs have represented
more than half the total costs of settling claims against major firms. Cases
like Caparo and Galoo have been heavily criticised in many quarters and
those defending suits would be unwise to rely on the courts taking a similar
line in other circumstances.
The blunt fact for the auditing profession is that we are exposed at present
to the very real risk of massive claims and of bearing a disproportionate
share of responsibility. You have pointed out this situation is
unreasonable.
I hope you and your readers will also be sympathetic to our frustration in
having to put forward a second-best solution to a problem. G Acher,

FT  26 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment authority role still
unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL BRYANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The interim report of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee
identifies, but does not provide an answer to, a fundamental problem in
retail investment regulation.
The committee obviously believes that, in its present form and structure,
the Personal Investment Authority will not be effective; major and
fundamental changes are needed. But, before then, and as a matter of
urgency, government should indicate if it is prepared to legislate to
withdraw the ability for any retail investment business to seek
authorisation from the Securities and Investments Board directly. If such
legislation is promised, the PIA can be developed, as the committee
obviously believes is necessary, as a single retail regulator under the
self-regulatory organisation regime.
If government is not prepared to legislate, regulatory arbitrage will
frustrate the accepted need for a single retail regulator; there will always
be the choice between SIB or PIA.
Consequently, if no legislation is likely to be forthcoming, the only answer
is for the PIA to become a designated agency, equal to and alongside the
SIB. In these circumstances, there would be no opportunity for regulatory
arbitrage. Arguments about composition of governance would cease, and
consumers would know exactly how their adviser was regulated.
Without a clear indication from government of legislation to remove SIB's
authorisation powers, the PIA as a self-regulatory organisation has no real
future as the single, effective retail regulator.

For reasons best known to themselves the people who run BBC2 have changed
the name of 'Business Matters' to The Business. The new series begins by
considering 'the rise and rise of Bill Gates', inventor of the DOS computer
system and head of Microsoft. At 38 he is said to possess a personal fortune
of seven billion dollars but, as David Lomax reports, is accused of unfair
business practices (7.20). That is followed by Wooldridge On Whisky, in
which the journalist tells the story of the famous drink. Did you know that
Humphrey Bogart on his death bed said 'I should never have switched from
Scotch to dry Martinis'? (8.00). The fashion for stretching successful
dramas to create comedy series, as with 'Outside Edge', continues in Moving
Story. Jack Rosenthal's original work was called 'The Chain' and told the
portmanteau tale of a sequence of house moves. In today's episode a new boy
joins the moving men (8.30 ITV). Subject of BBC2's series True Brits is the
'shoe string' style of the British embassies in the 15 states which used to
form the Soviet Union (9.30).

GRUMPY OLD MEN (12) Donald Petrie
THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN (PG) Stephen Sommers
HOSTILE HOSTAGES (15) Ted Demme
A BUSINESS AFFAIR (15) Charlotte Brandstrom
What are the constituents of North American popular culture? Let me start
with my postbag. I returned from Cannes to find two outraged letters from
trans-oceanic readers, one calling me anti-Canadian, the other
anti-American.
In the first case I had quoted Leslie Nielsen as saying he was brought up
near the Arctic, although his birthplace is, says the correspondent,
'further from the Arctic Circle than is London.' I and fellow journalists
are accused of conspiring to paint Canada as 'one boring, amorphous lump
somewhere in the frozen north.'
In the second case, a Washington DC reader resents my claim that many US
citizens 'have not heard of Arthur Miller, Einstein or the Pope.'
I am, as you know, a registered acolyte of western Atlantic culture high and
low. But part of that culture's appeal is the thin line between inert
honesty and productive hyperbole. Nielsen was the one who played fast and
loose with the Arctic's location. And while I have not personally polled
America about Arthur Miller and Co, recently large numbers of America's
youth did fail to answer the question 'Who was Adolf Hitler?'
Let us come to Grumpy Old Men and The Adventures Of Huck Finn. The first is
a Walter Matthau/Jack Lemmon comedy shot in what looks like the Arctic
Circle - huts on frozen rivers, fishing through ice - but is actually no
further north than Minnesota. And Huck Finn is about an American boy's dream
of living a life of eternal truancy. Truancy from home, parents, education:
in short, from what we shall hereinafter call EEBF (Everyone Else's Boring
Facts).
If Finn lived today, he would be a movie addict, where respectable truth is
ritually sacrificed to radiant embroidery. The same spirit fills Grumpy Old
Men as fills LN's assertion that he grew up cheek-by-jowl with the Eskimoes.
We are asked to believe that Matthau and Lemmon both fall for new neighbour
Ann-Margret and that she, an auburn-haired knockout even at 50, would be
ardently torn between the two codgers.
Grumpy Old Men does not so much 'stretch' plausibility as strain, split and
finally lacerate it. But I found the film fun in direct ratio to its
increases in absurdity. Matthau as a Don Juan? He looks more like a
basset-hound trapped in a fridge. Lemmon as a sweet monastic widower? He
looks more like Mr Executive Stress sent for a rest-cure to the icy north.
But this is what movies are about. Hire that star; push him up that mountain
towards Peak Preposterous; then have him tell his interviewers he was born
in Katmandu, Spitsbergen or El Dorado.
Grumpy Old Men is no masterpiece but it coaxed a cool Dollars 70m from
Americans who know a class comic double act when they see one. The
Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn is a masterpiece, on page, but has an odd
habit of defeating people on screen. Twain's Mississippi was of the mind,
just like Nielsen's remembered Regina, and his hymn to childhood fantasy,
otherwise definable as the flight from EEBF, resists photographic
re-enactment.
Elijah Wood is a tousled, puckish Huck with eyes like UFOs. And Jason
Robards as the King of Bilgewater, Twain's master fraudster, won gusts of
laughter from the press show audience with his DIY cockney accent and A-Z
knowledge of English landmarks. 'Where's Buckingham Palace?' Robards:
'Buckingham.' But the book's real magic is the river, and that is skimped:
even though cameraman Janusz Kaminski, Schindler's List Oscar-winner, might
have worked wonders if allowed out for long enough.
Hostile Hostages is unhappier proof of our assertion that many Americans
cannot have heard of the playwright, physicist and papal eminence cited
above. If they had, this 'comedy' might have a less casual attitude towards
dramatic structure, space-time improbabilities and marital break-up.
Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey play the bickering couple whose car and, later,
home are hi-jacked by a fleeing burglar. As the footpad who referees their
rows - the film's US title was The Ref - stand-up comic Dennis Leary looks
as if he wished he had never sat down in his Disney actor's chair. Feeble
dialogue destabilises an already strained plot conceit, and only dear Glynis
Johns as Mum-in-law - how they wheel out the English actors for villain
roles] - floats above the hi-concept banality.
A Business Affair is set in London, but might be set in the Arctic for all
resemblances to life in this city. The film is funny, but how much is it
meant to be? Jonathan Pryce is the egomaniacal English writer married to
model and would-be novelist Carole Bouquet (French). And Christopher Walken
is the snaky, Italian-extracted American publisher who steals La Bouquet
plus her works-in-progress.
Director Charlotte Brandstrom approaches William Stadiem's script, drawn
from two novels by Barbara Skelton, like a headmistress approaching a
difficult but talented pupil. Her no-nonsense style irons the irony out of
lines that we assume to be satirical but cannot be sure: 'I can't negotiate
with Amis in a condition of frustration. I'm Sicilian' (Walken to sex-bored
Bouquet).
I hoped Martin Amis would walk in, pick up his dropped name and hurl it
among the cameras, causing the film to jump about and get some style. With
Walken and Pryce both in mint form - the first a flaky-voiced dandy with
dancing eyes and teeth, the second tall, slim and deadly like an explosive
pencil - the histrionic components are here. But the movie's own rhythms are
relentlessly four/four, and Bouquet has yet to acquire enough convincing
English phrasing to wrap around even simple lines.
'Why not call eet a naaht?' the actress asks at one point, causing us
critics to nod in agreement. But no rest for culture monitors: it is
half-term and the world is full of children's films. Besides Twain we have
Rookie Of The Year and Josh And SAM Rookie (PG) is about a small boy (Thomas
Ian Nicholas) who develops a miraculous pitching arm after an accident and
plays baseball for the Chicago cubs. This made much money in America and we
see why. Played for frantic charm, it has a frantic charm. Actor Daniel
Stern debuts as director.
Josh And SAM (12, director Billy Weber) is the lesser tale of a boy who
persuades his brother Sam that he (Sam) is a Strategically Altered Mutant;
hence name. As a result they travel all over America escaping from parents,
schools and EEBF. In short, they are just like Huck Finn, Les Nielsen and
the rest of us who love that wonderful world called Imagination and who will
not be put off by Cantankerous of Canada or Apoplectic of America.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Arts: Keeping up with Arcadia - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Nobel prize-winner said on the radio on Monday that he could keep up with
all the talk about science and Romanticism in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia. I
rather pity him. Trying to keep up with Arcadia is, for us lesser mortals,
impossible, exuberant, and, finally, strangely touching. The play was
exciting when new last year at the National Theatre; but returning to it,
now that it comes to the West End, is even better - just that bit less
bewildering but no less tantalising. For our failure to understand
everything is part of the beauty of the play.
Arcadia is all about knowledge - about the effort to know things, about the
mutations of known things and our ways of knowing them, and about the
ultimate unknowability of things. It suspends, shimmering in the air, both
knowledge as a human epistemological endeavour and knowledge as an ultimate
ontological fact. Its wit puts one in mind of Congreve and Wilde, but
finally it comes closer to the forsworn, death-clouded scholars of Love's
Labour's Lost. It says 'Lord] what fools these scholars be', and then, so
tenderly, darts on to knowledge of life, death, and sex.
Arcadia commutes between two eras: 1809-1812 and the present day. Lord Byron
is forever offstage, much spoken of by characters in both periods. Romantic
sincerity and Romantic artifice are all-important; and so is nature - nature
as spoilt and reinvented and investigated by successive humans; and so is
time.
The play cast its spell with its marvellous original cast last year. This
time I admire Trevor Nunn's direction even more because he has kept the play
virtually as enchanting with a new and generally inferior cast. I miss some
of the first cast dreadfully - we are lucky that Radio 3 has twice broadcast
their performance - but I remain captivated. The best news is that the two
most touching and complex roles, Thomasina and her young tutor Septimus -
are still very well played by talented young actors. Lucy Whybrow has
Thomasina's febrile intensity and charming precocity; and Edward Atterton
has the smouldering intensity of the young Romantic's mind and emotion.
The worst news is that Thomasina's mother and the revisionist scholar Hannah
are acted terribly - busily, over-emphatically, weakly - by Julie Legrand
and Joanne Pearce. Roger Allam is a more languid, classy lecturer than was
Bill Nighy; Charles Simpson a more affected young aristo than Sam West.
Yet any flaws are minor, for Nunn has elicited pacing so lucid, and pointing
so natural, that this astonishingly complex play remains rich in suspense,
laughter, and the excitement of thought. Jeremy Sams's music, brilliantly
crossing historical periods, is perfect and moving; and so is the beautiful
Georgian round room of Mark Thompson's set. In this post-modern work, every
rococo embellishment makes its telling contribution.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Arts: An audacious 'Coriolanus' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boy. The real Caius Martius Coriolanus was probably thirty-something when he
died, and Shakespeare's hero has been played by many actors older than that.
Before killing him, however, his enemy Aufidius calls him 'boy', and it is
this brilliant taunt that drives Coriolanus into his final, fatal fury. And
this word is the clue to the RSC's splendid audacity in casting Toby
Stephens - 24 years old, forsooth - as its new Coriolanus.
He charges through the role in a youthful blaze. His voice, a tenor, has
steel and clarion attack. Not only proud (the word forever applied to him by
other characters), but thrillingly hot-tempered and impetuous too, this
Coriolanus has never quite grown up. Assured of his own natural superiority,
he lives in action; he has no reflectiveness until it is way, way too late.
Even when his mother and friends persuade him to return in mildness to the
people, his temper bursts out again, and he shouts 'Well, MILDLY BE IT
THEN.' This is, to us, marvellously funny  - but he himself lacks any irony.
Something in him dies on being exiled from Rome. When he comes to Antium and
is embraced by Aufidius as a friend, he is stiff, lifeless, as if already in
rigor. His mother cracks this dead facade, and he cries out in massive
misery at how she has undone him. He knows she has sealed his death-warrant,
and in his final scene he seems to invite his death. He dons again the same
insolent haughtiness that had brought the Romans close to killing him; this
time, with his new Volscian colleagues, nothing will save him.
The director, David Thacker, has had the idea of setting the play in
post-1789 revolutionary France, to lend new force to the republican talk
that surrounds Coriolanus and his fellow-aristocrats. Banners around the
theatre bear the words 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'. A key image is the
stream of corn that pours from above into a locker beneath the stage, and
which the hero bars the plebs from taking.
But Fran Thomson's designs, handsome and vivid though they be, are so
historically specific that they raise problems. Stephens's hair is brushed
forward like Napoleon's - ie not an aristo but a self-made man who turns
republicanism back into conservatism - and the noblewomen are dressed with
Napoleonic neoclassicism. He is uniformed in black and gold like a Gericault
officer: ie post-Napoleonic. And the backdrop is Delacroix's 'Liberty
Leading the People': which, surely, is all about the barricades of 1830. The
more you know about post-1789 France, the more distracting you will find
this production's notion(s) of period.
This notwithstanding, the production has great vigour and narrative energy.
Thacker makes the most of the love-hate nexus between Coriolanus and
Aufidius (Barry Lynch, darkly smouldering, as slight and lean as Stephens).
At the end, the Volscians leave Aufidius alone to embrace again his now dead
enemy. As the hero's mother Volumnia, Caroline Blakiston begins as a hearty
and youngish society lady, with horridly Oedipal outbursts against her son's
wife Virgilia. Her finest hour is in the helpless fury she unleashes on the
tribunes who have exiled her boy. She is, however, too subdued in the great
scene when she persuades him to save Rome. And her diction has become muzzy.
Monica Dolan makes the ungrateful role of Virgilia into a very interesting
study of passivity. And Philip Voss makes old Menenius into the most rounded
character in the play: hero-worshipping young Caius Martius, contemptuous of
the tribunes, fully possessed of the moderation and diplomacy his boyish
hero so eminently lacks. This difficult play can have a vaster scale, the
hero a mightier intellect, than in this production. But it is completely
alive, and gathers powerfully in excitement.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Arts: Laurie Anderson and David Byrne - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two niche brands from New York, both with rather dodgy sell-by dates, have
been marketing themselves hard in London this week. Laurie Anderson, big in
1981 but as minimal as her music since, has a new book. David Byrne, driving
force behind Talking Heads, the po-faced students' band of the 1980s, was
plugging David Byrne, the album.
Anderson got caught in the performance art web and has never escaped. She
still sits solemnly at her electronic keyboard; she still has mastery over
the same note; she still chants, in her hypnotic drawl, well-rounded
nonsense. Her 90 minute monologue at Sadler's Wells was 'what I did on my
holidays'. 'In 1987 I went to Mexico to see my brother' and then on to an
anecdote about primitive Mayans mistaking her contact lenses for jewels that
she hid in her body. Most of her tales are less exciting: many are downright
banal; some test credibility, especially the Arctic family who eat possum
smeared with maple syrup while their children disappear down mining shafts.
Anderson brazenly reads from her book, entitled Stories from the Nerve
Bible, her fanciful name for the body, occasionally switching from her
natural voice to an electronic mike which catapults her from bass profondo
to squeaky soprano. Sometimes she sings. In the hushed, reverential,
atmosphere it is all but impossible not to nod off - but, oh so,
beautifully.
You expect Laurie Anderson to be out-to-lunch and you enjoy the test of
wills between her kookiness and the credulity of the audience. David Byrne
had a harder task at the Palladium, introducing introspective new songs to
unregenerate Talking Heads fans. I felt sorry for the chap who stood up
ready to boogie: he had to wait for the fourth encore before Byrne had
mustered enough enthusiasm from the audience.
Byrne, now with long hair, sings bleak songs with even bleaker settings,
performed by a trio of guitars and percussion. Actually they grow on you,
but at first sounding are rather relentless. Of course the lyrics are
startling: 'I met my love at a funeral' begins 'Crash'; 'Running naked down
the state highway' opens the more hopeful, indeed evangelistic, 'Buck
naked'.
But the more you get down to the words the more you feel Byrne is going for
easy fixes. The lyrics sound important but fall apart. The salvation is in
the rhythms, the Latin tinge to 'Sad Song', for example, which, with 'Lilies
of the Valley', is the song most likely to ingratiate itself quickly with
Byrne's now rather mature cult following.
Perhaps in a smoky club it might have clicked, but at this palace of variety
Byrne came across as a rather serious family man in his early forties half
heartedly taking on world issues to fulfil a contract. There is actually
little Byrne offers in performance that adds to his CD, except perhaps a
tendency to sing flat. The great thing about Talking Heads was that the name
said it all.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Forty into one does
go - Why IBM is putting all of its advertising eggs into Ogilvy and Mather's
basket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You don't need an army to run our system.
The slogan, featured in the latest poster advertising of its AS/400
computers, belongs to International Business Machines. But as of next month
it could just as easily be applied to the running of the computer giant's
own worldwide advertising.
In a move which took the ad industry by surprise on Tuesday, IBM announced
that it would be sacking its 40-plus advertising agencies around the globe
and giving all the work to a single agency, Ogilvy and Mather. Estimates of
IBM's annual advertising spending - unconfirmed by the company itself -
range from Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) to Dollars 500m.
The rationalisation follows plans announced earlier this month to shake up
IBM's 40,000-strong marketing and sales force. Lou Gerstner, chief
executive, intends to cut across the existing geographic organisation and
form 14 teams, each covering a specific industry segment. All the upheavals
are part of the company's desperate attempt to regain ground lost to rivals
and restore profits, following three years of losses.
Companies everywhere have been cutting the number of their suppliers - be
they advertising agencies or providers of goods and other services - in
recent years. What is remarkable in this case is the extreme to which IBM
has gone in placing all its advertising with a single agency. Says Abby
Kohnstamm, IBM vice-president for corporate marketing: 'There is a trend
among many companies we have looked at to have as few agencies as possible
as their partners. But I'm not sure any have taken it to the degree we
have.'
According to Dominic Mills, editor of the advertising trade journal
Campaign, IBM's move is a 'reaffirmation of something Martin Sorrell (chief
executive of WPP, O&amp;M's parent company) has always preached, which is
one-stop shopping - you can get everything you want from one agency
network'.
But while it is possible to point to other companies going in the same
direction as IBM - Mills cites Reebok, the sports shoe manufacturer, for
example - he also says there are companies taking the opposite path and
decentralising. 'Coke, for example, traditionally only used McCann-Erickson,
now it uses a number,' he says.
Now that IBM has a single worldwide network at its disposal, it can be
expected that global advertising for the IBM brand will emerge. Kohnstamm
says that the intention is for there to be an overall international
campaign, modified as necessary for each country. Beneath that, there will
be more localised advertising for specific products.
There are dangers inherent in this global approach, as Maurice Saatchi,
chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, pointed out in a speech in London recently.
'How do you communicate to lots of different people in all these different
countries across the world without being so bland and jelly-like that you
have nothing real to say?' he asked.
Charlotte Beers, O&amp;M chief executive, acknowledges that global campaigns are
'the most challenging of all tasks because you must reach for a common
denominator and yet never violate significant cultural differences'. But she
nevertheless believes that it can be done, pointing to her agency's work for
Unilever on its Ponds skin care range. 'The idea was developed in Paris,
refined in London and has now been taken to 43 countries with major market
share success. The same thing has been done with the Ford Mondeo,' she says.
Maurice Saatchi also points to the organisational challenge for an agency of
running offices all over the world. Networks 'mean co-ordination, which
often means committees - not the best environment for inspired creativity',
he said. The organisational challenge, both for O&amp;M and IBM, is not
underestimated by either party. Shelly Lazarus, head of O&amp;M's North American
operation, says she is putting together a worldwide team to bear
responsibility for the IBM brand. There will also be a regional O&amp;M team in
Paris relating to IBM's head of communications in Europe, and similar teams
for Latin America and Asia Pacific - the latter will operate from Tokyo.
These will be in addition to all of the national offices which both IBM and
O&amp;M already operate.
O&amp;M is ideally placed for the job, in Mills' assessment. 'There's a cultural
fit - both are powerful brands, with long traditions and big global
operations.'
Overall, he sees the move to a single agency as positive for IBM. 'It has
the reputation of being a really bad client, with the left hand never
knowing what the right hand was doing - hence 40 agencies producing what
were potentially very discordant messages about IBM,' he says.
The financial rewards for the agency, and parent WPP, are as yet unclear.
Neil Blackley, media analyst with Goldman Sachs, says it will cost the
company money in the first half of the year. 'It's pain and then, hopefully,
pleasure down the road,' he says. There will also be some account losses
within the agency - Microsoft and Compaq business, for example, will have to
be jettisoned because of conflicts of interest. And what has been O&amp;M's gain
has been some loss to sister WPP agency J Walter Thompson, one of the 40
agencies to be crossed off IBM's list.
But these minor points will not be uppermost in Sorrell's mind. For him the
IBM victory is particularly sweet. When WPP took over J Walter Thompson in
1987, it also inherited a smaller subsidiary called Lord, Geller, Federico,
Einstein. The agency was well-respected and held a number of prestigious
accounts, including IBM. After defections of a number of key personnel,
financial claims by Sorrell and counter-claims by the defectors who formed a
rival agency, a court settlement of Dollars 7m was accepted by WPP. The IBM
account was lost to both agencies and Sorrell has had to wait until now to
see it return to the fold.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Facing up to life's
problems - Why disclosure can be a virtue for insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance companies face a huge challenge next year when the UK's new
regulatory regime for the industry comes into effect. But according to the
organisers of a seminar in London today* the mandatory disclosure of
commissions and other policy details should be seen as a marketing
opportunity, not a threat.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, has made
compulsory from January 1 both the design and the use of a 'key features'
document giving details of costs, charges and the risks in taking out a
policy.
Companies' responses to this new demand - how they redesign their products,
for example to spread charges and commissions, and how they incorporate the
new document into their agents' sales pitch - will be a sign of how flexible
they really are.
Many life companies have previously regarded new regulatory requirements as
part of their problem rather than part of any solution. So it is perhaps
quixotic of marketing consultants Bamber Forsyth, which together with
Courtyard City Services is staging the free lunchtime seminar, to seek to
persuade them that they can use the change to improve their contact with
customers.
The presentation will include some marketing jargon. There will be talk, for
example, of customers going on 'information journeys': either a 'horizontal'
one - often the company's vision of what happens, in which they see a range
of branded leaflets - or a 'vertical' one - in which information comes from
more varied sources.
There will also be some statements of the seemingly obvious, but on the
whole the seminar should raise some valid issues at a time when much of the
life industry would be unwise to reject any offers of help.
Peter Kelly, a financial communications consultant taking part, says
companies need to be positive and that the sales force should not see
compliance as just a mass of detailed requirements to be met. 'The life
insurance industry is nowhere near as good at communication, especially
internally, as it thinks it is,' he says.
Compliance can be presented to the customer as a sign of a powerful and
client-friendly organisation.
Anne McCrossan of Bamber Forsyth argues that one of the effects of
disclosure will be that products will become less easy to differentiate:
companies should therefore take the opportunity to develop more strongly
their corporate values in communicating with the client. 'It's a question of
how good customers feel about the company as well as the product.'
The need to develop corporate branding applies not just before the sale but
also afterwards. Keith Bamber cites a company whose after-sale material was
so forbidding that sending out the annual statement acted as a trigger for
policies to be cashed in. He argues that branding should be more powerfully
reflected in the papers sent to an investor after buying a product.
'Retention of customers has to be paramount,' he says. Companies will need
new sales strategies to address this, including greater integration of the
promotion and administrative functions. The clear language of the compulsory
SIB document will put the onus on companies to spell out equally clearly the
benefits of taking out a policy.
'The company has to do something just as strong, simple and understandable
about what it is offering, and the kind of company it is,' says Kelly.
While the overall message is that the new regime can work positively for
life companies, other conclusions are more chilling: Bamber Forsyth says
there is high cost to getting it wrong and warns that 'disclosure can
dominate even if you bury it'.
*The seminar takes place at the Institute of Directors, Pall Mall, London
from 12.30pm.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Yabba dabba deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The formidable marketing machine behind The Flintstones, which premieres in
the US tomorrow, is getting into gear. Even if you never see the film -
which opens later this summer in Europe and Asia - it will be hard to escape
the promotional blitz.
Amblin Entertainment, Steven Spielberg's production company, estimates that
more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) will be lavished on marketing, more than
twice what was spent on Jurassic Park. The Flintstones film is based on the
1960s cartoon series of life in prehistoric Bedrock. The series holds cachet
with US babyboomers, and viewers in countries such as Britain, Mexico and
Japan, where re-runs have been playing for years.
The toy maker Mattel has signed a deal with Amblin for a new line of
Flintstones dolls, including the Talking Fred. Actor John Goodman, who plays
Fred in the movie, has been taking the doll with him on television
appearances.
Flintstones songs have already become hits. The rock group the B-52s, which
appears in the film as the BC-52s, has two new singles out: its version of
the Flintstones theme song and 'Bedrock Twitch'.
McDonald's has traded in its golden arches in the film for dinosaur tusks,
and has been re-christened Rocdonald's. In exchange for the cameo, the food
chain has launched what it calls its biggest promotion. McDonald's will be
selling Flintstones mugs and t-shirts in 38 countries.
Left-over products from the cartoon era will receive a free ride from the
promotion. Turner Entertainment, which owns the animated series, is
receiving heavy play on television.
The ultimate success of the Flintstones products depends on how much
enthusiasm the film generates at the box-office. In a few months, executives
involved in the promotion may either be crying in their dinosaur milk or
yabba-dabba-doing all the way to the bank.

FT  26 MAY 94 / People: Knapton quits Lazards for L&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Knapton, who had stayed a brief year as chief investment officer of
Lazard Brothers, has quit to become managing director of the securities side
of Legal &amp; General.
David Rough, group director of investments, had previously been doing the
job himself. However, he is effectively number two to chief executive David
Prosser, according to Knapton, and the company reckoned it needed someone
specifically to manage the group's quoted investments and to chair the
investment strategy committee. The heads of the property and venture capital
divisions also report, alongside Knapton, to Rough.
Knapton says the head-hunters were 'reasonably persuasive' and claims he was
enjoying himself at Lazards. 'Jobs like this don't come up very regularly,
and when they do, the timing is never going to be ideal,' says the father of
seven daughters.
However, the rest of the industry suspects that he had yet to fit into the
cliquey senior management at Lazards - which has, moreover, struggled to
become anything other than a niche player in the investment business; it has
Pounds 5bn under management.
Legal &amp; General is one of the biggest passive fund managers in London - with
group investments under management of Pounds 30bn plus. Knapton says his
task is not to lead it, say, aggressively into active techniques. His
preferred style is not to 'come in and shake things up' but rather to 'try
to build a team of people who work well together. Legal &amp; General has a
perfectly reasonable track record and perfectly reasonable people.'
While his first job in the City was with National Provident, he had stayed
away from insurance companies until now. He came to Lazards from Invesco.

FT  26 MAY 94 / People: Noble: realistic with the actuality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Skye Bridge Ltd, developer of the highly unpopular toll-bridge which next
year will eliminate the ferry trip across the Kyle of Lochalsh to Skye in
Scotland, has persuaded Sir Iain Noble, one of the project's most
authoritative critics, to become its chairman.
Noble, who is an Edinburgh merchant banker (he co-founded Noble Grossart and
chairs Noble &amp; Co), owns an estate on Skye and is a Gaelic speaker, still
thinks the bridge is a waste of the government's money on a non-essential
project. Although Skye Bridge, a consortium of (the construction companies)
Miller Group and Dywidag (of Germany) and Bank of America, is financing the
bridge and will recoup the Pounds 17m construction cost from tolls, the
Scottish Office is spending Pounds 6m on the connecting roads.
'The ferries are the most efficient and cheapest way of crossing to Skye,'
says Sir Iain. 'The government will lose the profit which Caledonian
Macbrayne makes on them, and about 30 ferrymen will lose their jobs. With
tolls on the bridge the highest in Europe (Pounds 5 for a car), it's not
surprising it's unpopular.'
So why take on the job? 'You can't spend your life girning (moaning) about
what's done,' says Noble. 'The bridge is now an actuality. What we must do
is make it an important Skye-based business. Yes, I can imagine all the
brickbats that will be thrown at me. But the tolls are set by parliament.
People should work on their MPs to get them reduced or abolished.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Technology: From sand dune to science park - Israel is
learning fast how to exploit its technical skills, writes Peter Norman in a
continuing series on research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'My generation saw this country grow from sand dunes into a garden and then
into an industrial state. As modern Zionists, we want our country to excel
in high-tech and scientific achievement.'
 -Dan Propper, president Israeli Manufacturers' Association.
Propper need not worry. Israel already appears to be one big science park
and is learning fast how to exploit and commercialise its scientific
expertise.
More than 60 per cent of Israeli university students graduate with degrees
in science-based disciplines. Israel has the highest ratio of scientists and
engineers to population in the world. Its expenditure on research and
development, at about 3 per cent of gross domestic product, is
proportionally higher than the US, Japan and the other Group of Seven
leading industrialised countries.
The country's Ministry of Trade and Industry has a battery of statistical
superlatives at hand. No fewer than 135 scientists and engineers per 10,000
inhabitants are engaged on R&amp;D against 70 in the US, 65 in Japan, 48 in
Germany and 28 in the UK. Israel's natural scientists and engineers produced
61 papers of published research per 10,000 of the labour force in 1987,
about twice the rate of the US, Britain and Canada and more than four times
that of Japan.
This performance predated recent immigration from the former Soviet Union
which has increased Israel's population by a tenth and further enhanced its
scientific potential. About 36 per cent of the 550,000 mainly Russian
immigrants since 1989 have scientific occupations and 53 per cent have more
than 13 years of schooling.
But it is only since the mid-1980s that Israel has focused on turning its
formidable R&amp;D potential to commercial ends. An increasingly open economy
and the gradual lifting of the threat of war have encouraged researchers and
companies to explore peaceful uses for many of the technologies developed
when the nation's existence was under threat. This potential has been
boosted by improvements in the Israeli approach to marketing - a traditional
area of weakness - and the greater availability of start-up finance and
venture capital after the 'discovery' of Israel by foreign investors.
The government has also increased its support for industrial R&amp;D through the
Office of the Chief Scientist, an agency of the trade ministry. This
invested about Dollars 330m (Pounds 220m) in R&amp;D last year and has sponsored
an innovative programme of technological 'incubators' attached to research
institutes and established high-tech companies to create conditions in which
recent immigrants, in particular, can develop their ideas.
Basic research is centred on seven universities, of which four, the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot near
Tel Aviv, Technion - the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa - and Tel
Aviv University, are of worldwide renown. All have set up companies to
commercialise their discoveries and develop technological transfer to
industry while protecting their patent rights. Some, such as Technion and
the Weizmann Institute, have also created science parks.
Technion, Israel's equivalent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
has the Technion Research and Development Foundation to strengthen the
university's applied technological research activities and create closer
ties with industry. R&amp;D efforts are focused in 22 different centres covering
research in areas such as aeronautics, space technology, electro-optics,
microelectronics, advanced silicon chips, solid state electronics and
robotics.
There is no barrier to collaborative research efforts between academia and
industry in Israel. It is a small country - about the size of Belgium. The
constant threat of war since its creation in 1948 led to the build-up of a
large and innovative defence industry and intimate links between the
military-industrial complex, academia and the government. People know each
other and move easily in and out of the various sectors.
The interaction between industry and research institutions inside Israel has
been augmented by close ties with the US scientific establishment. Israeli
academics are generally not well paid. But they often make up for lack of
earnings at home by spending several months a year on sabbatical at US
universities or research centres. Exposure to American ways has not only
boosted academic incomes. It has led to an interchange of ideas and helped
spread the spirit of entrepreneurship in Israel.
Bob Buckwald, president of CI Systems, was born in the US and has lived in
Israel for 23 years. He taught physics at Technion until 1982 when he
decided to set up his company. CI began as an R&amp;D subcontractor, helping to
make testing equipment for advanced weapons systems. Based in Migdal HaEmek,
one of several industrial towns about half an hour from Haifa, CI has grown
from a Dollars 100,000 company in 1984 to a developer and manufacturer of
electro-optical test and measuring systems, worth an estimated Dollars 40m
today.
Buckwald says Technion played an important part in getting his company
launched when it had few resources. He used Technion facilities to develop
CI's first electro-optical device, paying royalties in return. He has
continued to maintain close ties: Technion scientists visit CI about every
two weeks. The company is developing a spectral imaging system, the
SpectraCube. Scientists at the Technion and the Weizmann Institute have
helped in its development.
Orgenics, a diagnostic bio-technology company, is located in a nondescript
business park in Yavne, south Israel, just 10 minutes' drive from the
Weizmann Institute. It was founded in 1983 by Professor Max Herzberg, who
emigrated with his family to Israel from France after the 1967 six-day war,
and who then shuttled between Israel and the US teaching and researching
before finally taking a position at Tel Aviv University in 1982 to teach
molecular and cell biology.
Orgenics is a small research-oriented company with annual sales of Dollars
6.5m. It has invested about Dollars 14m on R&amp;D since start up, is now
profitable and exports 98 per cent of its output of diagnostic products.
The company exemplifies how Israel's new high-tech companies interact with
the country's research establishment. It is currently carrying out a joint
research programme with Tel Aviv University on monoclonal antibodies, used
to control food quality. Herzberg is no longer an academic. But since 1991,
he has chaired the Israeli National Steering Committee on Biotechnology
which centralises the government's funding activities in the sector. He is
also a member of the chief scientist's research committee.
Technion's academic excellence was one factor behind the decision of Intel,
the big US semiconductor group, to start a development centre in Haifa in
1974 which now employs 550 people. Intel's Israeli scientists developed the
numerical maths processors for the 386 chip and helped develop the Pentium
processor.
Dov Frohman, general manager of Intel Israel, says it was attracted to Haifa
in part because of the large pool of talented science graduates. A
concentration of technologists in Jerusalem was one factor behind the
company's decision to set up its production facilities there.
But he does not think Israel's academic institutions are particularly
productive. According to Frohman, much of the collaboration between science
and industry is based on personal contacts. Intel has invited scientists
from Technion to visit its Haifa facilities. It currently has a small joint
programme with the Hebrew University to develop neural networks in data
processing.
With government backing, Intel staff have also set up an incubator: one of
two dozen in the country which provide infrastructure for small high-tech
projects to help them towards commercial viability.
Israel's incubators and recently established high-tech companies are
producing 'some really world class projects', says Ilana Gerard, president
of Gerard Group International, a US-Israeli consultancy that puts Israeli
high-tech companies in contact with US 'Fortune 500' companies.
She shares none of Frohman's reservations. 'The prediction may seem far
fetched,' she says. 'But by the year 2005, Israel will be the world centre
of high-tech R&amp;D'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Technology: Mix and match for PC users - The growth of
component software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL FRAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 50 years after the tin can was invented someone came up with the idea
of a can opener. By that timescale, it has taken the personal computer
industry a comparatively short 10 years to work out how to unlock software
applications so that they become easier to use and integrate.
Several leading US software companies are developing technology that will
allow software applications such as word processors or graphics packages to
be broken up into smaller software 'components' that users can recombine in
different ways, according to their needs.
Proponents of component software say this will make working on a PC easier
and more efficient because users will no longer be saddled with large,
complex applications with superfluous features.
Instead of having to switch between a word processor, a spreadsheet and a
graphics program to create a report with text, charts and illustrations, the
PC user will be able to combine features of all three programs to create a
set of software tools specifically designed for the job.
However, the development of component software largely depends on
establishing standards that define how software components work together.
This could lead to yet another battle over software standards in the
computer industry.
Already, there are two competing approaches to component software. The
first, led by Microsoft, is called Object Linking and Embedding. OLE is a
set of programming standards that enable features of one program to be
incorporated in other programs. Microsoft's dominant role in the software
industry has given OLE broad support from other software developers.
An alternative approach, called OpenDoc, is favoured by a consortium led by
Apple Computer, IBM and WordPerfect. Other members include Novell, Sun
Microsystems, Xerox and Taligent, the systems software joint venture funded
by IBM, Apple and Hewlett-Packard.
The consortium claims its technology will be easier to use and require less
computing horsepower. OpenDoc is also promising software that will work on a
variety of computer systems, whereas Microsoft's OLE is currently geared to
the company's Windows PC operating system.
While OLE is already available, however, the OpenDoc group will not complete
the first versions of its software until the end of the year. A San
Francisco-based organisation set up by the founding members of OpenDoc,
called Component Integration Laboratories, will publish the specifications
so that other software developers and corporate users will be able to design
their own components.
The OpenDoc consortium claims wide support
but few applications developers have so far publicly endorsed OpenDoc.
WordPerfect, which Novell is acquiring, is the only member of the OpenDoc
consortium that is primarily an applications vendor.
Moreover, the critical test of component software will be whether PC users
embrace the concept.
Whether it will be cheaper, or more expensive, to buy software in the form
of mix-and-match components has yet to be seen.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: Eastman Kodak tight-lipped on
derivatives use
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of last year, Eastman Kodak was sitting on paper losses of
Dollars 492m on derivatives contracts. It is a big user of interest exchange
rate derivatives, but gives little information about how these instruments
are used.
Some of the paper losses could be realised in the near future. The company
plans to pay off part of its Dollars 7bn debt by selling three of its
businesses. The cost of liquidating interest rate swaps associated with this
debt could amount to between Dollars 250m and Dollars 350m, according to Mr
Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential Securities.
The swaps have kept down the interest charges reported by Kodak in the past.
A one-off charge now would beg the question why the swap losses weren't
offset by a matching gain from pre-paying the debt.
Like many big US companies, Kodak refuses to discuss its hedging policies
beyond what appears in its accounts. The Securities and Exchange Commission
has written to several big companies putting pressure on them to say more
about their use of derivatives.
Kodak said it was not aware of reciving a letter.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: Auditors hedge their bets on derivatives
 -The accounting treatment of financial instruments in the US is in flux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reported profits of US companies that use complex financial instruments
to manage their risks look set to become much more volatile, leading many
companies to stop using all but the simplest derivative instruments.
There is a new unease (some might say, panic) among accountants and auditors
in the US about the way many companies use - and account for - these
financial instruments. The interest being shown by regulators and
legislators has also sharpened the accounting profession's attention.
Recently announced losses from miscued corporate hedging strategies have set
the tone. The Dollars 102m after-tax loss (Dollars 157m pre-tax) taken by
Procter &amp; Gamble on two leveraged interest rate swaps last month has
reverberated through the corporate and accounting worlds.
Of particular concern to the bean-counters is the fact that P&amp;G had been
treating these instruments as straightforward hedges - even though, it now
says, they were highly risky bets that US and German interest rates would
rise.
US accounting rules give companies considerable leeway in their treatment of
financial instruments. If P&amp;G had been exploiting the weaknesses in the
system, how many others?
A restatement of its figures last week by Caterpillar Financial Services,
after a review by auditors Price Waterhouse, could become the norm as
companies scrutinise their derivatives holdings more closely, and auditors
(fearing shareholder lawsuits) become more cautious.
Companies can pick either of two ways to account for derivatives. One, known
as hedge accounting, involves matching gains or losses on a financial
instrument against the asset or liability it is intended to hedge. Any
profits or losses on the instrument are deferred. Provided the hedge works,
these can be set off later against corresponding losses or gains in the
underlying asset.
Under the second method, all derivatives are shown at market value at the
end of each period, and any gains or losses are taken through the profit and
loss account immediately. Mark-to-market accounting produces volatile
quarterly earnings. It fails to reflect the economic reality of an effective
hedging strategy, critics say.
Companies, naturally, prefer hedge accounting. Under lax accounting rules,
many may have shovelled instruments into this category which more
realistically should have been marked to market.
Auditors are clearly getting more wary. Caterpillar's financial services arm
says it uses a variety of instruments to protect its net interest income,
including interest rate swaps, forward-rate agreements, caps and swaptions.
The last two, Price Waterhouse now says, should be marked to market
(previously, Caterpillar had hedge-accounted the whole book.)
Caterpillar Financial Services was forced to restate its first quarter
figures to record a Dollars 5.4m after-tax charge, cutting its profits for
the period to Dollars 6.4m. In future, its quarterly earnings will depend on
the market value of those instruments at the end of each period.
If writing caps and swaptions was part of an overall risk-management
strategy, as Caterpillar claims, then such an accounting treatment is
nonsense - the figures do not reflect the economic reality. Caterpillar said
it won't write caps and swaptions in future, but will stick to instruments
that qualify for hedge accounting.
The problem for companies and their auditors is, how do you decide what is a
hedge and what isn't?
There is little guidance. Rules have been developed for foreign exchange
forward contracts and interest rate swaps, which have been applied by
extension to other situations.
To justify using hedge accounting, companies normally have to meet fairly
strict criteria. General practice is to apply three tests. A company's
managers must identify the exposure they want to hedge; establish that the
instrument will actually reduce this exposure; and designate which risks
each instrument is intended to hedge.
Applying these principles in practice is not easy. 'Modern risk management
doesn't work that way,' says Mr Bob Herz of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Companies
pool their various exposures and manage risk on a portfolio basis.
Some common uses of derivatives are uncontroversial. If companies borrow
variable-rate money and use an interest rate swap to convert it to
fixed-rate, the practice is to account for this as synthetic fixed-rate debt
(rather than treating the two parts of the transaction separately).
Others situations are less clear-cut. What about the use of forward
contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposures on sales which have not yet
been completed? Most big exporters hedge their expected future sales to some
degree (on the assumption that their on-going business will continue to
involve foreign currency receivables). But under the strictest accounting
interpretation, entering a forward exchange rate agreement under such
circumstances amounts to speculation.
The General Accounting Office - the investigative arm of Congress - waded
into the debate last week, urging the accounting profession to consider
scrapping hedge accounting altogether. It said it isn't clear how direct the
correlation must be between a hedge and the underlying asset or liability,
or how often the effectiveness of the hedge needs to be reassessed.
'Determining whether a hedge is operating effectively and thus qualifies for
hedge accounting is difficult in reality,' the GAO said.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board may also be leaning towards full
mark-to-market accounting. Last June, it put forward some tentative
conclusions about how to apply hedge accounting to all types of derivatives.
In December, though, it went back to the drawing board.
It is now considering two possible approaches - to develop the hedge
accounting approach, or to require all instruments to be marked to market.
Under the second, trading profits and losses would be taken into the income
statement, whereas gains or losses on derivatives which are used for
risk-management purposes would be shown as an adjustment to equity.
There is another interesting accounting twist to the P&amp;G saga. According to
Bankers Trust, the consumer products company has bought other leveraged
swaps from the bank in the past and made a profit on the deals. Why hasn't
P&amp;G reported these as trading profits?

FT  26 MAY 94 / Overseas pensions paid to dead people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Benefits Agency pays social security benefits worth more than Pounds
800m a year to people living abroad without regularly checking that they are
still alive, the National Audit Office says in a report published today.
According to the public expenditure watchdog, a spot check last year into
the eligibility of 7,700 pensioners and widows led to the suspension of
payments to a fifth of those contacted.
The agency pays benefits and pensions to 680,000 people overseas, almost
half in Australia, Canada and the US. More than 95 per cent of the payments
are retirement pensions or benefits to widows.
The NAO says most other countries regularly check the eligibility of
pensioners living abroad, usually annually. They send out 'life
certificates' requiring recipients to attest to the fact that they are still
alive and entitled to the benefits.
The US had suspended payments to 1.5 per cent of its 353,000 beneficiaries
abroad in 1989 after such an exercise, and found that the circumstances of a
further 15 per cent had changed. Canada suspended payments to 2.5 per cent
of its 78,000 recipients in 1990.
Similar checks were carried out on a selective basis by the Department of
Social Security until 1985. However, these were discontinued after
industrial action left a backlog of work to be cleared.
The Benefits Agency, which took over the payment of social security benefits
in 1991, has begun a programme of selective checks.
The first, last year, involved contacting all retired pensioners in the
Indian sub-continent and all widows receiving benefits in Bangladesh.
By January, payments to 20 per cent had been suspended, though some payments
may be resumed if the recipients react to their suspension by returning the
life certificates.
The NAO says the agency has only one employee abroad to keep in contact with
pensioners in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Other UK organisations in the public and private sector make regular checks
on the eligibility of pensioners abroad, according to the NAO. Army
pensioners are required to complete a life certificate every five years.
Shell UK sends certificates out every three years - annually to pensioners
living in Iraq.

FT  26 MAY 94 / GDP up 0.7% in quarter: Imports recalculation boosts growth
figure for 1993 to 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's gross domestic product grew by 0.7 per cent in real terms in the
first quarter of 1994, confirming earlier estimates, the Central Statistical
Office reported yesterday.
However, a CSO review of trade statistics, which reduced the volume
(although not the value) of imports last year, has resulted in estimates of
1993's GDP growth being revised upwards from 1.9 to 2 per cent. A rise in
export volumes also helped boost GDP in the first quarter of 1994.
The latest GDP figures from the CSO use three methods to calculate economic
growth: output, income and expenditure.
The expenditure measure appears to show that growth accelerated sharply in
the second half of 1993. However, that effect is smoothed out when the three
calculation methods are combined.
GDP in the first quarter was 2.6 per cent higher, at constant prices, than
in the first quarter of 1993. If oil and gas are excluded, GDP rose 0.6 per
cent in the first quarter and was 2 per cent higher than in the same period
a year earlier.
The opening of new oilfields in the North Sea has caused a sharp rise in UK
oil production over the past year although the growth rate appears to be
slowing.
The GDP deflator, which measures the average prices of the components of GDP
and is an indicator of inflation, rose 0.6 per cent in the first quarter of
1994 and was 3.1 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1993.
Consumer expenditure rose 0.7 per cent in the first quarter, and was 3.4 per
cent higher than in the first quarter of 1993. Spending increased in most
areas except energy, which was affected by the mild temperatures
(pre-payment of fuel bills was not taken into account in the figures).
Income from employment in the first quarter was 4 per cent higher than a
year earlier, in line with Department of Employment estimates of the annual
growth in average earnings.
Gross domestic fixed capital formation, or fixed investment, rose 2.2 per
cent on the previous quarter and was 3.4 per cent higher than in the first
quarter of 1993.
'These are encouraging figures in terms of hopes of an export and
investment-led recovery,' said Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at SG Warburg
Securities.
However, capital expenditure by manufacturing industry was 1 per cent lower
in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of 1993. The value of stocks
and work in progress fell by Pounds 244m in the first quarter, having risen
by Pounds 99m in the last quarter of 1993.

FT  26 MAY 94 / CBI aims to boost tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday moved tourism closer to the
top of its agenda, admitting that it had paid insufficient attention to the
industry in the past.
In its first response to this week's white paper on competitiveness, the CBI
said it was setting up a Tourism Action Group to raise the industry's
profile. The paper said UK tourism was losing market share. The CBI also
published a report on tourism, saying the industry had the potential to
create many jobs.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said tourism employment grew by 31
per cent between 1983 and last year, well above the rate for the economy as
a whole. He said tourism was one of the country's leading industries, with
annual revenues of Pounds 29.6bn, accounting for 5.6 per cent of gross
domestic product, and earning Pounds 10bn in foreign exchange a year. It
employed more than 1.4m people - 6 per cent of UK employment.
Mr Davies said the tourist industry worldwide was expected to double in size
by the year 2005. Although the UK was the world's sixth-biggest earner of
tourist receipts, its US dollar market share had fallen from 6.8 per cent in
1980 to 4.2 per cent today.
British tourism faced increased competition, he said. However, he added that
the UK had a good reputation in tourist markets such as the US and,
increasingly, in western Europe and Japan.
The new CBI group will urge greater support from the government in areas
such as tax and public transport. It will also encourage better training.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Row on rail equipment sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp differences between the government and the railway equipment industry
on prospects for future sales emerged yesterday.
Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, offered an optimistic
vision for manufacturers, but industry executives said there was
overcapacity in the industry in the UK and worldwide.
Mr Freeman spoke on a visit to Metro-Cammell's plant at Washwood Heath,
Birmingham, to see the GEC Alsthom Metro-Cammell Eurostar trains for the
Channel tunnel. 'If we can get co-operation from all sections of British
industry and long production runs, we can compete with the best in the
world,' he said.
Replacement trains would be needed, especially on commuter routes, he added,
and he expected the train-operating companies that succeeded British Rail to
place orders. He pointed to London Underground's need to re-equip and to the
equipment demands of the Jubilee Line and cited demand in countries such as
China and Germany.
But Mr Bryan Ronan, managing director of GEC Alsthom Transport, said: 'There
is overcapacity in the UK. I don't see that changing in the short term.' He
added: 'Export markets have always been difficult, cyclical and dominated by
national struggles, aid and other political factors.'
GEC Alsthom Metro-Cammell, the UK's largest train manufacturer, faces
delivery schedules which will peter out towards the end of the decade after
it has delivered 19 Eurostar trains and vehicles for the Jubilee Line and
the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Infolink survey sees fall in consumer debt arrears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer debt arrears are falling, according to a survey published today by
Infolink, the credit information group.
The survey found 7.6 per cent of instalment credit accounts in arrears in
the first quarter of 1994, compared with 10.1 per cent in the first quarter
of 1993. The proportion of accounts significantly in arrears (three months
or over) fell from 4 per cent to 3.6 per cent over the same period.
Infolink said the regions worst hit by the recession, the south-east and the
south-west, had shown particular improvement. Scotland had the greatest
credit arrears.
The region with the lowest level of repayment problems is Northern Ireland,
where only 6.4 per cent of agreements are in arrears. Wales is the next
best, at a level of 7.1 per cent.
Dr Brian Bailey, Infolink's chairman, said: 'Falling unemployment levels and
low interest rates appear to have boosted confidence and increased
consumers' ability to meet financial commitments.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Tax chief calls for scrutiny of advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax advisers should be subject to a regulatory regime, the incoming
president of one of the leading UK tax bodies said yesterday.
Mr Ian Luder, a tax partner with accountants Arthur Andersen and the new
president of the Institute of Taxation, called for self-regulation monitored
by professional bodies.
His plea comes at a time of growing concern about control of one of the few
forms of financial advice that is completely unregulated.
Many tax advisers are also accountants or lawyers subject to regulation by
professional bodies, but there are no examination requirements or other
controls over the use of the title 'tax adviser'.
'I have no time for the unclean and unwashed, the unqualified practitioner
with no professional standards and whilst I do not seek to create a
monopoly, I am very opposed to the current position whereby anyone can put
up a brass plate and offer their services,' Mr Luder said.
He said regulation was inevitable, and should not be introduced through 'the
back door'. He added that the Inland Revenue was already moving in this
direction with plans to accredit advisers from whom it would accept tax
returns lodged electronically.
He also cited a proposal in this year's finance bill which would have
considerably boosted Revenue powers to gain access to tax advisers' papers
but which was dropped. 'The Revenue is trying to introduce quite draconian
powers when the problem is with a small minority of practitioners.'
Mr Luder said the institute received a number of complaints each year about
tax advice and that several members had been reprimanded or expelled. But
many complaints related to individuals who were not members of the institute
or of any other professional body which could take action against them.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday
reprimanded Mr Samuel Oddy of Carlisle and fined him Pounds 500 for
'improperly' passing tax repayments belonging to clients through his
overdrawn practice account.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Skills gap with Germany revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British manufacturers continue to trail their German opposite numbers in the
training of technicians and the use of postgraduate engineers and
scientists. That is the conclusion of an analysis of chemical and
engineering companies in the two countries by the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research.
In a survey last year, the researchers found a bigger skills and performance
gap in four pairs of engineering companies compared with three pairs of
chemical companies.
The British engineering plants had improved productivity substantially over
15 years, but still trailed the German plants. They were also 'followers' in
technical innovation. 'British price competitiveness still depends heavily
on favourable movements in exchange rates,' says the report.
By contrast, the analysis in chemicals pointed to a similar performance
between the two countries. 'Most British plants were at least equal to and
sometimes ahead of their German counterparts in the use of new,
sophisticated capital equipment.'
The German plants were well ahead on shopfloor qualifications: in chemicals
45 per cent of Germans had a craft apprenticeship compared with 23 per cent
in Britain. In engineering the gap was wider, 57 per cent to 20 per cent.
These differences were even sharper at the intermediate-technician level,
with virtually all German supervisors trained to meister level and only 5
per cent of British supervisors with any specific training for their role.
The proportion of technical and higher-degree graduates was similar in the
chemical industry, but the German plants had more than double the British
level in engineering. Germany is taking more postgraduate level students who
are regarded by UK employers as 'over-qualified' and lacking commercial
aptitude.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Interest rates 'may be forced up soon': Action foreseen to
keep inflation within target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates will have to be raised by a full percentage point within the
coming months if inflation is to be kept below the government's target of 4
per cent, a leading economic research body warned yesterday.
Although raising rates might be politically unwelcome for the government,
the new climate of openness means that the Bank of England increasingly has
the upper hand in setting inflation policy, the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research says in its latest quarterly report.
'The publication of the minutes of meetings between the chancellor and the
governor . . . has left the government with surprisingly little room for
manoeuvre,' the report says.
'(The government) has allowed a situation to develop in which it is
difficult for the Bank's advice on interest rate moves to be rejected,' the
report adds, pointing out that the Bank itself is increasingly inclined to
approve increases in interest rates.
The main factors that will persuade the Bank to raise rates before the end
of the year are the growth in earnings and money supply, the report
suggests. Average earnings have grown at a slower-than-expected rate, but
are expected to grow 3.5 per cent this year and 5 per cent next year.
Meanwhile M0, which has been growing by 6 per cent, is expected to continue
rising well above the government's 4 per cent monitoring range.
These factors have not triggered inflation yet, says the institute, which
admits that its own inflation predictions - among the gloomiest in the City
 -have become more optimistic since February.
It says inflation will rise only a 'little over the next year or two' from
its current underlying 2.3 per cent, if base rates are brought in line with
the level of interest rates now expected in the markets.
But with the markets now assuming that interest rates will rise to 6 per
cent by the end of the year, and 7 per cent by 1995, this implies a
significant rise from their current level of 5.25 per cent, it points out.
This rise will have to occur within 12 months. However, if earnings and
money aggregates grow, it will have to take place much sooner, the report
says.
These interest rate rises should not seriously affect recovery, the
institute says. Its more upbeat predictions for the growth in gross domestic
product have been revised up to 2.9 per cent this year, from 2.7 per cent.
Consumer spending will continue to grow, by 3.5 per cent this year, it
suggests. Unemployment is predicted to continue falling until it reaches
about 2.5m next year. Public debt is predicted to be Pounds 35.3bn this
year, a little below the Treasury forecast. Meanwhile, manufacturing
investment is predicted to rise by 6 per cent this year, and 8 per cent next
 -a pattern that the institute describes as 'a classic investment cycle'.
But elsewhere in the report the institute notes that the calculations used
to measure competitiveness may have been painting an overly flattering
picture of labour productivity.
Although the UK has had significantly higher rates of growth in
manufacturing labour productivity, measured in terms of output per hour,
unit labour costs measured in a common currency are rather less impressive,
the report notes, adding that it is still difficult to reconcile some of the
different statistical techniques used in different countries.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Mortgage benefit may be scrapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Social security ministers are considering abolishing mortgage relief for
low-income families as a way of containing the long-term growth of their
department's budget.
It is understood that Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary,
believes the principle of providing mortgage payments through income support
is fundamentally flawed.
He has told officials to examine the consequences of abolishing it if the
Conservatives were to win the next general election, and to outline the role
private insurance might play in replacing it.
Officials say abolition of the benefit - which would save about Pounds 1.2bn
a year - is emerging as one of the main possibilities for cutting the
department's Pounds 85bn annual expenditure. Many other areas of the
department's spending are far more politically sensitive and would be more
damaging to touch.
The cost of mortgage benefits has already been cut. Last year ministers
lowered the ceiling for mortgages on which payments can be made from Pounds
150,000 to around Pounds 125,000.
Senior figures in the industry believe they have not been vigorous enough in
supporting mortgage benefit, having concentrated instead on opposing
reductions in mortgage interest tax relief (Miras).
Recently Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
building society and chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, wrote to
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, arguing against
further cuts in mortgage benefit.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Society levies members after property losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance Society have approved a rule
change under which a 12 per cent levy has been imposed on their policies to
create a fund to pay compensation to most of them.
The decision at the society's annual general meeting in Rotherham yesterday
follows a high court ruling last year that 39,000 policyholders who lost
money because of unauthorised investment in property by the society must be
compensated.
The society may also have to pay compensation to a further 7,000
policyholders whose lump sum policies may not be tax exempt, contrary to
their understanding when they invested. Negotiations between the society and
the Inland Revenue are continuing.
Some members at the AGM complained at the society's decision to impose the
levy last year before consultation. Only three of the 100 attending the
meeting voted against the rule change, which was also endorsed by all but 88
of the 2,280 proxy votes received.
Afterwards, one disgruntled policyholder, Mr Andy Anderson, who made a
950-mile round trip from Morayshire, condemned the levy as 'robbing Peter to
pay Peter' and said he would pursue the society's past investment practices
with the regulatory authority.
The problems of the Rotherham-based friendly society, which has 63,000
policies in force and total assets of Pounds 90m, relate partly to its
Capital Secure Fund which invested Pounds 6.8m in a hotel development
although policy holders believed their money was invested in cash deposits
and gilts.
Mr John Ramsden, who became chairman in 1990 after the hotel purchase, told
the AGM the property, now valued at about Pounds 2m, had still not been
sold.
Mr Ramsden, whose sympathetic manner defused much of the AGM's potential for
hostility, said the compensation fund stood at Pounds 10.4m and contingent
liabilities at Pounds 8.5m.
He said no final decision on possible legal redress against those
responsible for the society's past actions had been taken but he would not
be party to the 'vindictive and fruitless trail of legal cases'. He could
support expensive legal action only if there were reasonable chances of
success.
Mr Ramsden said he hoped compensation would be paid in September or October
after which members would be consulted on the society's future.
The options, he suggested, included a transfer to another society or a
relaunch, possibly under a different name. He had had discussions with
'quite a number of institutions' and would make a recommendation in the
autumn.
'In a sense there will be no better society than this to invest in once we
get everything sorted out,' he said. 'It's the one society where you know
the stables have been cleaned out.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Sinn Fein in talks with US executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Irish-American businessman is holding informal talks with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, in an effort to bring about peace in
Nothern Ireland.
It emerged yesterday that Mr William Flyn, president of Mutual America, one
of the biggest US insurance companies, has renewed contact with Sinn Fein
while on a visit this week to Dublin and Belfast.
Mr Flyn is part of a delegation of Irish-American businessmen who have been
discussing investment oppor-tunities on both sides of the Irish border with
government officials and local enterprises. He is understood to have used
the opportunity of the visit to try to persuade Sinn Fein of the growing
support within the Irish-American community for the UK-Irish peace
initiative.
Mr Flyn was one of the central figures behind the controversial visit of Mr
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to New York in February. His invitation to
Mr Adams to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland led to President Bill
Clinton granting the Sinn Fein leader a visa against the advice of British
and US state department officials.
Mr Flyn believes the visit helped strengthen Mr Adams's influence within the
IRA in support of the peace initiative.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Merchant banks are given warning on advice risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England has warned merchant banks of the growing risks of being
sued or suffering damage to their reputation as a result of advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions and restructurings, it emerged
yesterday.
The Bank disclosed that its supervisors had discussed risks with merchant
banks after cases such as Samuel Montagu being ordered to pay Pounds 172m to
the creditors of the collapsed financial group British &amp; Commonwealth
Holdings.
It disclosed the action in its 1993-94 banking act report, which said the
role of merchant banks in takeovers, new issues and corporate restructurings
'makes them especially vulnerable to litigation and loss of reputation'.
Supervisors are thought to have questioned merchant banks over whether they
are charging appropriately for the risk of losing reputation, even in cases
where they are publicly criticised rather than being sued for damages.
The Bank also disclosed that 170 cases of suspected fraud in banks had been
referred to its new special investigations unit, established following the
collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International to prevent similar
incidents.
It said half of these cases had required 'further action' by the unit,
although in some instances this was simply advice. There were three cases of
formal investigation under section 41 of the Banking Act, but none led to
prosecutions.
The Bank's report and accounts, released separately, showed that it has
released Pounds 10m of the Pounds 90m provision made last year against
losses in the 'lifeboat' operation to keep four small financial institutions
afloat in 1991. It said it had reduced estimated losses by taking over the
financing of credit provided to the institution which required the 'major
part of the provision' - thought to be National Mortgage Bank, a subsidiary
of National Home Loans.
The release of the provision helped the Bank's banking department record a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 120.2m, compared with Pounds 88m in 1992-93. It
made a dividend payment of Pounds 48.4m to the Treasury, against Pounds
38.1m the previous year.
The banking act report said that the financial pressures on smaller UK banks
have eased because of greater stability in wholesale funding markets, the
lower level of short-term interest rates and the end of falling property
prices. However, it said there was a net loss of 11 small UK banks during
the year. Some had surrendered licences because of an inability to raise
adequate funding.
The Deposit Protection Board reported that in the year to February 28 1994
it had an outstanding liability to depositors of Pounds 25m. Net liabilities
of Pounds 19.5m at the end of the year have been reduced to Pounds 6.8m by
subsequent recoveries.

FT  26 MAY 94 / George praises publication of minutes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Publication of the minutes of the monthly monetary meetings between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England
governor, should over time contribute to financial market stability, Mr
George said yesterday.
In evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, the
governor said the minutes would show the markets that the discussions were
based on monetary economics and that it would not be possible for a
chancellor to override such considerations 'in a blatant way'.
Mr George said politically motivated interest rate changes had rarely
happened in the past.
The experience of the February meeting, when Mr George and Mr Clarke had
initially differed over whether to cut rates and which ended in agreement on
a 0.25 percentage-point cut in base rates to 5.25 per cent, had been the
'clincher' in persuading the two men to publish accounts of their
discussions. This was because speculation of differences between the two,
soon after the meeting, had been exaggerated.
Mr George said he considered the decision to publish the minutes was 'a
terrific step in its own right'.
He added that he was happier with the UK's present monetary policy regime,
which is based on a target range for underlying inflation and in which the
Bank has greater powers than before in the execution of policy, than he had
been with monetary policy under the European exchange rate mechanism or in
the 1980s when the government pursued a broad money target.
He stressed that the greater responsibilities given to the Bank since
Britain's exit from the ERM should not be confused with independence.
However, the requirements for the Bank to publish its views on inflation
each quarter and be accountable for its advice to the government
concentrated the Bank's mind.

FT  26 MAY 94 / MPs urge replacement of PIA head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cross-party committee of MPs yesterday called for the replacement of the
chairman of the much-criticised Personal Investment Authority, the planned
watchdog to protect private investors.
Mr Joe Palmer, the PIA chairman, has previously come under fire from Labour
MPs. The insurance group Legal &amp; General, where he was formerly chief
executive, was fined heavily for failure to meet regulatory standards.
There is no sign, however, that Mr Palmer will resign from the PIA. He still
has the backing of the Treasury, and insisted yesterday that he would stay
as chairman.
The call for a new chairman came against the background of general concern
about the role of PIA directors who were public-interest appointments even
though they had long associations with the financial services industry.
The report, agreed by all but one of the Treasury committee of MPs after a
stormy debate, said serious changes were necessary for the PIA to achieve
credibility and authority.
The committee said the government should legislate to allow SIB to refuse to
regulate financial services organisations for which another appropriate
regulator exists, instead of such organisations being able to insist on
being regulated directly by SIB.
SIB would welcome this power, but the government is most unlikely to want to
legislate at all on financial services, so its prospects look doubtful.
The MPs proposed conditions to be attached to SIB's decision to recognise
the PIA as the regulator for retail financial services. These conditions
related to the public-interest PIA board members. The most important and
difficult was to give the PIA board a clear majority of public-interest
members excluding the chief executive. They also proposed SIB approve
public-interest appointments and that public-interest directors should be
nominated by outside organisations, such as the Treasury and relevant
consumer interests.
The tensions which were a feature of reaching an agreed report burst into
the open yesterday, undermining the force of its recommendations. Some
committee members distanced themselves from those recommendations which they
had opposed. Tory MPs said they did not support the criticism of Mr Palmer.
Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour MP who was the only committee member to vote
against the report, described the manoeuvrings needed to reach an agreed
report as a 'disgrace'.
The committee broke up in disagreement last Wednesday when Mr Barry Legg, a
Conservative, proposed amendments making structural changes to the PIA. Mr
John Watts, chairman, revised his original draft and on Monday Tory members
reluctantly accepted a revised report, which took a harder line on the PIA.
The government and regulators welcomed the committee's support for one
regulator for retail financial services, and its recognition of the need to
introduce the improvements in investor protection.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the bank of England, yesterday defended Mr
Palmer, saying that he would contribute to an improvement of standards in
the retail financial sector.
During testimony to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee,
Mr George said he believed Mr Palmer carried credibility 'with the
constituency he represents' and that he can earn the confidence of the
general public by putting the machinery of the PIA into place.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Institutions warn on housing grants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
City investors most involved with housing associations have warned that cuts
in government housing grants could make it harder to provide private finance
to build low-cost homes for rent, according to the National Federation of
Housing Associations.
A majority of institutions contacted by the federation said they were
concerned at government plans to cut the grant rate to 55 per cent of the
cost of a new home. Several said that they were concerned that the financial
health of associations might be affected.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Dispute at BBC will go to Acas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC unions and management yesterday agreed to conciliation talks in the
dispute over pay and conditions, as unions withdrew plans for further strike
action tomorrow, Richard Donkin writes.
The talks, to be held today at the Acas conciliation service, follow
Tuesday's 24-hour strike among 11,000 BBC technicians and journalists
protesting at plans to introduce performance-related pay and other changes
to working conditions.
The National Union of Journalists and Bectu, the broadcasting union, said
they would not yet withdraw plans for further one-day strikes next week.
Mr John Fray, NUJ broadcasting officer, said: 'Acas has given us an
assurance from the BBC that these talks will be meaningful.' He added: 'I
hope the BBC has got the message after yesterday's successful action that
they have to change their position.'
The BBC said: 'The BBC has always said that it wants to reach a negotiated
settlement and welcomes the opportunity at Acas.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / BAe wins Pounds 66.5m order for missiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace Defence has won a fresh government order for its Advanced
Short-range Air-to-air Missile worth Pounds 66.5m.
The original Pounds 570m development and production order for the Asraam was
placed with BAe two years ago, and included a fixed-price option for a
further batch of missiles which the ministry has decided to pick up. The
number of missiles in each batch has not been disclosed by the Ministry of
Defence.
Asraam is due to enter service with the Royal Air Force in 1998. The new
order will mean further work for BAe's production plant at Lostock, Greater
Manchester, between 1997 and 2000, which employs 950 people. Development is
being handled at the company's sites at Bristol and Stevenage, where 250
engineers and an additional 250 support staff are working on the project.
Asraam is the only replacement under development for the long standing AIM-9
Sidewinder missile and BAe has high hopes for its export prospects.
The Ministry of Defence yesterday placed an order worth more than Pounds 20m
for submarine command systems - to be installed in Trident ballistic missile
submarines and retrofitted to the Trafalgar and Swiftsure classes - with
electronics specialists BAeSEMA of New Malden, Surrey.
This follows BAeSEMA's success last week in winning contracts worth Pounds
36m for its surface ship control system for the Korean navy.

FT  26 MAY 94 / C&amp;G bid faces statute challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH

<TEXT>
As 'creatures of statute', building societies could do only what legislation
expressly or implicitly allowed, the High Court heard yesterday.
Opening the argument for the Building Societies Commission, the sector's
statutory regulator, Mr Phillip Heslop QC, told Sir Donald Nicholls, the
vice-chancellor, that the court should approach the Building Societies Act
1986 on that basis, rather than on the basis that what was not expressly
forbidden was permissible.
The commission is challenging the agreed Pounds 1.8bn offer by Lloyds Bank
for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society.
It argues it is unlawful for anyone except a society and its successor
company to be party to a transfer agreement; that a payment in respect of a
transfer is unlawful except where expressly permitted by the act; and that
the act does not allow payments to members of less than two years' standing.
The court heard that 27 per cent of C&amp;G shareholding members are of less
than two years' standing.
Their votes could be critical for the high thresholds of members' consent
which would be required.
The regime in the 1986 act for transferring the business of a society either
to a specially formed or existing company was complete and comprehensive, he
said.
There was no suggestion the government intended to extend the arrangements
for transferring a society's business - which it was putting forward as an
exception to the previous ban - to societies' entering agreements with third
parties.
The transfer proposed was really an attempt by Lloyds to acquire C&amp;G by a
route outside the regulatory regime, which could not have been the
intention, he said.
Judgment is being considered.

FT  26 MAY 94 / US businessman in talks with Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Irish-American businessman is holding informal talks with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, in an effort to bring about peace in
Nothern Ireland.
It emerged yesterday that Mr William Flyn, president of Mutual America, one
of the biggest US insurance companies, has renewed contact with Sinn Fein
while on a visit this week to Dublin and Belfast.
Mr Flyn is part of a delegation of Irish-American businessmen who have been
discussing investment oppor-tunities on both sides of the Irish border with
government officials and local enterprises. He is understood to have used
the opportunity of the visit to try to persuade Sinn Fein of the growing
support within the Irish-American community for the UK-Irish peace
initiative.
Mr Flyn was one of the central figures behind the controversial visit of Mr
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to New York in February. His invitation to
Mr Adams to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland led to President Bill
Clinton granting the Sinn Fein leader a visa against the advice of British
and US state department officials.
Mr Flyn believes the visit helped strengthen Mr Adams's influence within the
IRA in support of the peace initiative and exposed republican militants to
the moderation of most Irish Americans. He said yesterday that continuing
paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland remained the 'biggest obstacle' to
increased US investment in the province, but he felt 'encouraged' about the
prospects for peace.
Northern Ireland officials regard the US as important to the local economy -
38 US companies operate in the province employing about 9 per cent of the
manufacturing workforce, much of it in Roman Catholic areas.
The visit by US company executives follows a plea by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, during his visit to the US in March that the influence of
corporate Irish-America be brought to bear on producing peace in Northern
Ireland.

FT  26 MAY 94 / MPs back separation for roles of City regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs on the cross-party Treasury committee yesterday in a report gave the
government, the Securities and Investments Board and the Personal Investment
Authority - the proposed new regulator - separate tasks.
The government is told that it should legislate to allow SIB to refuse to
regulate financial services organisations for which another appropriate
regulator exists, instead of such organisations being able to insist on
being regulated directly by SIB.
SIB would welcome this power, but the government is most unlikely to want to
legislate at all on financial services, so its prospects look doubtful.
For SIB, the MPs propose conditions to be attached to its decision to
recognise the PIA as the regulator for retail financial services.
These relate to the public-interest PIA board members. The most important
and difficult is to give the PIA board a clear majority of public-interest
members, excluding the chief executive. They also propose that SIB approve
public-interest appointments and that public-interest directors be nominated
by outside organisations, such as the Treasury and relevant consumer
interests.
SIB and the PIA will consult about these recommendations, and the Treasury
will also be involved in the discussions.
Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, saw difficulties with an immediate change in
the balance of the board, particularly given general agreement that the size
of the board should not increase from its current 21.
He said the regulator might be accused of 'bad faith' in altering its
governance in such a fundamental respect when the board's composition had
already aroused strong views in the financial services industry.
Many life companies and independent financial advisers had signed up on the
basis of a board comprising 10 public-interest members, 10 financial
services practitioners and the chief executive.
Even though Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said last year there should be a
public-interest majority within a smaller board of 15 members - implying
fewer practitioners than on the board at present - Mr Palmer said it would
be difficult to reduce their number and meet the requirement to have a
proper balance of industry representatives.
The PIA itself has a longer list of tasks, which include:
Completing its rulebook by the end of the year.
Maintaining a public and accessible register of individual sales agents and
advisers.
Maintaining a register of firms offering fee-based advice and keeping a
close eye on companies which operate on the basis of commission alone.
Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, said a rulebook would be published
next month, though this would contain sections of rulebooks from existing
regulators and would be amended in the longer-term.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Gas regulator feels pressure: Why Clare Spottiswoode has
fallen from favour among MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The appearance yesterday by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director general,
before a parliamentary select committee came amid a smear campaign directed
at her competence, the circumstances of her appointment and her personal
life.
Ms Spottiswoode adopted a conciliatory tone before the Commons environment
committee when she spoke about the financing of the Energy Savings Trust, a
key element of the government's environment policy.
It contrasted sharply with an earlier appearance during which she bluntly
rejected the idea of passing on the costs of energy efficincy projects to
gas consumers.
MPs say that earlier testimony infuriated Mr Robert Jones, the powerful
Conservative committee chairman who has championed the scheme. And it was
also at that appearance that she alleged that her predecessor, Sir James
McKinnon, had acted illegally in connection with implementing the programme,
a statement she yesterday withdrew 'unreservedly'.
But it is not clear whether her change in tone will end the smear campaign,
which culminated this week in allegations that Ms Spottiswoode had an affair
with Mr John Michell, a senior official at the Department of Trade and
Industry who was involved in her selection.
The DTI said it found no substance to back the allegations, and Ofgas
officials say they are in the dark as to who might be orchestrating the
campaign.
Many industry observers and politicians say her initial performance in front
of the committee prompted MPs and others to question her effectiveness. They
believe that other dissatisfied parties within the gas industry and
government simply joined the campaign as it gained momentum.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, noted that 'MPs
are an unforgiving bunch and have been reluctant to put her poor performance
down to inexperience. Her problem is that she has not made enough friends on
the way up.'
One executive at an independent gas marketer noted that 'enraged Tory MPs
don't like to be told what to do'.
Her suggestion that her predecessor had acted illegally clearly angered Sir
James. She is said to be deeply embarrassed by the incident, and the two are
no longer on speaking terms.
One gas industry executive says the present frosty relationship is similar
to that between Baroness Thatcher and Sir Edward Heath.
Changes made at Ofgas by Ms Spottiswoode may also have alienated some staff
members who were particularly close to Sir James.
Some DTI officials may also feel miffed that Ofgas is taking the lead role
in de-regulation, although Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, is known to
have expressed strong support for Ms Spottiswoode. Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, is said by some officials to be 'wishing that
the whole thing would just go away'.
There has been speculation that some members of the government believe gas
liberalisation will prove to be such a politically explosive issue close to
the next election that the process should be slowed. One way to do this
would be to deflect criticism onto the regulator.
But the government could simply stall the process by not putting forward the
necessary legislation.
Independent gas marketers believe British Gas may also be whipping up press
scare stories about widespread price rises as a result of opening up the
domestic market. There are even suggestions that members of the British Gas
'old guard' may be fighting a rearguard action against the introduction of
competition.
Industry and Ofgas officials are concerned that the persistence of the smear
campaign could endanger the liberalisation process.
But Ms Spottiswoode appears determined to ride out the storm, although
officials worry that her propensity for plain speaking and clear aversion to
the present financing of the Energy Savings Trust could lead to additional
difficulties.
