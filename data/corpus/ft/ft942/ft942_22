FT  26 MAY 94 / Underwriter pay points to upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best-paid underwriters at Lloyd's of London significantly increased
their pay last year, according to Financial Intelligence &amp; Research, the
insurance analysts.
Ten underwriters received remuneration, including profit-related pay, of
more than Pounds 230,000 each. Only six underwriters achieved these pay
levels in 1992.
The best-paid underwriter, Mr John Charman, whose marine syndicate number
488 is one of the biggest in the market, increased his pay to Pounds 401,000
last year compared with Pounds 306,000 in 1992. Syndicate 488 earned a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 17.6m in 1991, the last year for which it has
closed its accounts.
According to the analysis, eight of the top 10 best-paid underwriters
improved their pay by at least 13 per cent.
The increases reflect a gradual return to profitability at the insurance
market, where insurance rates have increased very sharply over the past two
years. Lloyd's last week reported losses of Pounds 2.05bn for the 1991 year,
and will make further losses in 1992, when it reports results for that year
in 1995.
However, the number of underwriters earning more than Pounds 100,000 a year
continued to decline.
Separately Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, told a conference
yesterday that he expected capacity at the market - the amount of insurance
premiums that syndicates are permitted to underwrite - to decline in 1995
from its present level of Pounds 10.9bn.
Suggesting that a fall may help sustain profitability at the market, Mr
Middleton said Pounds 9.5bn would be an 'optimal' level of capacity.
He also said that the market was examining a possible modification in its
three-year accounting rules. It is possible that some syndicates might be
allowed to close both their 1992 and 1993 years of account next year.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Labour poll likely to cost Pounds 1.5m: Leadership contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour leadership election is likely to cost about Pounds 1.5m, of which
only Pounds 100,000 will be borne directly by the party, it emerged
yesterday. Most of the cost will fall on affiliated unions which will have
to organise postal ballots of more than 4m members who pay the political
levy.
The TGWU and the GMB, the two biggest general unions, said the gross cost of
balloting their 1.8m members would be about Pounds 300,000 each.
Some unions, such as the AEEU craft union, will reduce costs by sending
ballot papers with routine literature such as union journals.
Labour officials said that up to a third of the cost might be recouped by
combining the ballot with a membership drive and delivery of marketing and
advertising material.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour chairman, said: 'Provided it is done with
sensitivity and with an eye to the political nuances, we can ensure that we
raise money and don't just spend it.'
The unions' leadership election costs will be deducted from the movement's
financial contribution to the Labour party.
Union funds cover about half of Labour's annual costs and provide most of
the election fund, which is expected to reach about Pounds 20m by 1996. 'For
the first time . . . almost everyone . . . is deciding who to back on the
basis of who can win the election, not on the basis of ideology,' said one
official, adding: 'It is an extraordinary cultural change.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / BNFL to shed 2,000 Sellafield jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels plans to cut a third of its workforce at its
Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria over the next five years in an
effort to cut costs, the company said yesterday. It will also shed 200 jobs
at Chapelcross in Dumfries.
Mr Grahame Smith, director of BNFL's UK group, said the company had to cut
costs by 20 per cent or Pounds 100m a year for the next five years in order
to remain competitive.
He said he was confident of a viable future for BNFL's UK business,
'providing we continue to help our customers to reduce their cost base and
compete with fossil fuels'.
BNFL's customers are the UK nuclear generators for which it reprocesses
spent fuel.
BNFL will reduce the number of jobs at Sellafield by 2,000 over the next
five years, but officials stressed that it plans to make no compulsory
redundancies. The job losses would leave 5,000 full-time employees at
Sellafield and Chapelcross. The job losses will not affect BNFL's
controversial Thorp reprocessing plant which employs 1,500 people, the
company said.
But opponents said the job losses would have an adverse impact on the local
economy similar to what would have been felt if the government had refused
permission for the Thorp plant, for which ministers gave the go-ahead in
February. BNFL had used the impact on the local economy as an argument for
going ahead with Thorp. Cumbria County Council called the job cuts 'a major
blow'. Mr Alan Clark, chairman of the council's economic development
committee, said: 'This is desperately disappointing news.' Sellafield is the
largest employer in the area, where unemployment rates at 9.6 per cent are
high.
The company's announcement comes just a week after the UK government
embarked on an all-embracing review of the nuclear power industry. BNFL said
the timing of its announcement had nothing to do with the review and that,
unlike Nuclear Electric, one of its nuclear generator customers, it had not
been lobbying for privatisation.
'We have to get into a strong business position: that is what is behind the
job losses,' an official said.
The company said the nuclear generators were having to compete in an
increasingly competitive electricity supply sector and the company needed to
cut its costs for the services it provides.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Nuclear risk provides top Lloyd's profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Lloyd's underwriter who insures nuclear power stations produced the best
profits for his Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the market - in 1991, when the market as a whole had losses of
Pounds 2.05bn.
Lloyd's, which reports its results three years in arrears, posted the 1991
figures last week, bringing its cumulative losses since 1988 to about Pounds
7bn.
Details of the results of individual syndicates, published in the latest
issue of Limelight, show that 111 of the 349 syndicates trading in 1991 made
profits, with the small nuclear syndicate 1176 doing best of all - with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.8m, compared with gross premium income of Pounds
4.8m.
Before deductions for personal expenses its 782 Names made Pounds 4,858 for
every Pounds 10,000 traded.
The underwriter Mr Michael Dawson, whose agency Cox Newton and Harman
started the syndicate in 1991, mainly covers the risk of physical damage for
western-built nuclear power stations and is advised by Mr Walter Marshall,
who was chairman of the former Central Electricity Generating Board.
Second in the list of top performers at Lloyd's in 1991 is Mr Peter Butler,
who specialises in high-risk catastrophe business. Another small syndicate,
1179, with premium income of less than Pounds 3m, made profits of Pounds
4,246 for every Pounds 10,000 of capacity - the amount of premiums the
syndicate is allowed to write.
A much larger syndicate, Janson Green 386, which specialises in non-marine
liability business, was third most profitable, while Bankside syndicates 45
and 318 occupied the fourth and fifth places in the profitability league.
Most of the 20 worst-performing syndicates in 1991 have been closed by their
agents. For every Pounds 10,000 traded on the the worst performer  -
syndicate 833, a marine syndicate - its 677 members face losses of Pounds
10,577.

FT  26 MAY 94 / SFO conviction rate falls to 59%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conviction rate of the Serious Fraud Office fell to 59 per cent in the
year to April from 71 per cent in 1992/93, it was announced yesterday.
After another controversial year in which the SFO was criticised for its
handling of the prosecutions of Mr Asil Nadir, former Polly Peck chairman,
and disgraced financier Mr Roger Levitt, Mr George Staple, SFO director,
said the office should be judged on its overall performance.
During the year 23 trials involving 54 defendants were completed and in 20
of them one or more of the principal defendants had been convicted. Of the
32 convicted, 12 pleaded guilty and 25 received custodial sentences.
That was consistent with the SFO's record over the previous five years and
represented a successful outcome in over 80 per cent of cases, he said.
The Levitt and Nadir cases represented the low points of the past 12 months.
It was 'difficult for a prosecuting agency to act in the glare of publicity
which inevitably diminishes public regard (for the SFO),' he said, adding
that he was confident that success in the majority of cases was acting as an
effective deterrent against serious fraud.
The SFO has seen a marked drop-off in its workload and had just 48 active
cases on its books at the beginning of April, compared with 57 the year
before.
Mr Staple said he could not comment on the Treasury review of the SFO and
the fraud investigation group of the Crown Prosecution Service. The review,
believed to recommend merger of the two bodies, is being considered by the
Attorney General and is expected to be published before parliament rises for
the summer.
The SFO accepts it will be judged over the coming 12 months on its handling
of the high profile Maxwell and Brent Walker prosecutions. It also faces a
possible change in its status to an executive agency.
The SFO's Pounds 20.8m budget for 1993/94 was underspent by Pounds 1.97m due
to the downturn in caseload. The 1994/95 budget has been set at Pounds
19.6m.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Lamont urges Tories to move to the right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, yesterday warned the Tory party it
must move to the right to meet the electoral threat from a Labour party
which may soon be led by Mr Tony Blair.
In a speech which contained a number of coded attacks on Mr John Major's
leadership and undisguised compliments for Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Lamont
called for a new round of cuts in spending on the welfare state.
He also warned that further reduction in interest rates could jeopardise the
hard-won gains on inflation of the past few years.
In one of a number of thinly-veiled swipes at Mr Kenneth Clarke, his
successor at the Treasury, he suggested the next move in interest rates
should be up rather than down: 'The level of interest rates appropriate to
ease the economy out of recession is clearly not appropriate when all the
indications are that the economy is growing quite rapidly.'
Mr Lamont insisted that the government's electoral prospects could best be
advanced by offering the prospect of tax cuts and a return to the radicalism
of the Thatcherite 1980s rather than by competing with Labour for the centre
ground.
Mr Lamont rejected a recent suggestion by Mr Clarke that the welfare state
should be strengthened, and criticised the cabinet's hesitancy over the
privatisation of the post office. He stressed that reducing the burden of
taxation would require more savings in public sector expenditure.

FT  26 MAY 94 / MP apologises over bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A chastened Lady Olga Maitland, Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam, yesterday
apologised to the Commons for her role in blocking the backbench bill which
sought to provide new rights for the disabled.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, said remarks in the Commons earlier this
month by Lady Olga about the origin of amendments which she moved 'fell
below the standards the House is entitled to expect from its members'.
In a rare public admonition, Miss Boothroyd said: 'I strongly rebuke her for
her conduct on that occasion.'
When the civil rights disablement bill was blocked, Lady Olga had claimed
amendments in her name were 'mine and mine only'.
This was later contradicted by Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister responsible
for the disabled.
In apologising for misleading the House, Mr Scott admitted that the
amendments had been prepared by parliamentary counsel in co-operation with
officials of the Department of Social Security and made available to
Conservative backbenchers who supported the government in opposing the bill.
After the rebuke, Lady Olga told the speaker: 'In the light of your
statement may I give an unreserved apology to you and this House.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Political Notebook: A practical lesson from Rab Butler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Patten delivered a lecture last night on the contribution to
Britain's political life made by the late Rab Butler. Mr Patten's close
friend Mr John Major and others around the cabinet table would do well to
read it.
The governor of Hong Kong was careful to stress that the focus of his talk
to the Coningsby Club (one of those high-Tory dining clubs) was the
Conservative party's past rather than its miserable present or its uncertain
future.
For good measure, the former Tory chairman poured cold water on recent
suggestions that he is bored by life in one of Britain's last imperial
outposts.
To those who have speculated recently that he would like a return to the
cabinet via the House of Lords, Mr Patten replied he had 'quite enough' on
his hands until June 30 1997.
But politicians as clever as Mr Patten cannot complain if his audience
chooses to read between the lines of his ruminations. To glance at Mr
Butler's role in shaping post-war Conservatism is to appreciate just how
divided and directionless his party has become.
Mr Butler was the best prime minister the Tories never had. He is remembered
best for the Education Act 1944, the bold legislative measure that laid the
foundations for modern state schooling.
But during his 26 years as a government minister Mr Butler held each of the
three great offices of state - home, foreign and Treasury - as well as the
chairmanship of his party. He was a superb Conservative chancellor, an
adroit foreign, and a cool home secretary.
As Mr Patten remarked, he was unjustly denied the party leadership in 1963
for reasons which lay buried deep in the psychiatrist's couch of the then
prime minister Harold MacMillan.
There was though, a more important point to last night's lecture. Mr
Butler's essential contribution to Conservatism was to reconstruct from the
ashes of its post-war defeat a philosophical framework.
It was not driven by ideological certainties. Mr Butler believed, as Mr
Patten put it, that Conservatism was not a 'collection of causes for which
we are obliged to die in a ditch'.
Instead it was a 'mature tradition of political thought which is neither
fixed nor finished'. In the middle decades of the century that meant an
approach to government which promoted incentives for enterprise and
initiative without abandoning social justice or reverting to mass
unemployment.
Above all, though Mr Patten did not use the word, Mr Butler provided
constancy: a sense that the governments he served knew how to translate
principles into practical policies.
Here we come to Mr Major's party. For all the prime ministerial speeches and
policy initiatives of the past two years - and there have been more than
most can remember - the party is drifting still without an ideological
compass.
The Tory right has the same difficulty in coming to terms with Britain's
modest place in Europe as their counterparts in the 1950s had in recognising
the end of empire. Many now look back wistfully to those glorious days of
the 1980s when the party could define itself by bashing the trade unions or
demanding back Britain's money from Brussels.
For the 1990s and beyond, some like Mr Michael Portillo (backed forcefully
yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont) are demanding that the party re-define itself
in terms of Thatcherite radicalism. Others, Mr Kenneth Clarke among them,
see themselves as heirs to the Butler tradition - denying the contradiction
between free-market economics and social action.
But even if one subtracts from the equation the corrosive battle over
Europe, the overwhelming impression is of a party unable to distinguish
principle from policy, practicality from expediency.
Some, many, blame Mr Major for the crippling lack of consistency. Others,
including many close to the prime minister, say Mr Patten's absence has
deprived a lacklustre cabinet of its latter-day Rab Butler. Others say
simply that the party has become ungovernable.
There are ministers who believe the reality of economic recovery will allow
the government to muddle through. They point out that the Labour party is
stranded also in the no-man's-land between the ideological certainties of
the past and the harsher truths of the present.
But the odds are that in eight weeks' time Labour will elect as its leader
Mr Tony Blair - a politician who, like Rab Butler, knows how to translate
enduring values into modern policies. If his government is to survive Mr
Major must do the same.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Landlords criticised on energy efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owners of accommodation for private rental make the least investment in
energy efficiency, according to a report published today by the Institute
for Fiscal Studies.
Although many of these households will suffer the greatest impact from the
imposition of value added tax on fuel, they are in the worst position to
take steps to cut their bills, it says.
The conclusion highlights one of the weaknesses of the Energy Saving Trust,
whose future was the subject of a tense and prolonged Commons committee
meeting yesterday.
The trust, which is intended to subsidise energy saving measures by
households, plans to direct almost all of its schemes at owner-occupiers.
Some of the poorest households, particularly in urban areas, may not
qualify.
Yesterday, MPs on the Commons environment committee were grilling Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator, about her
unwillingness to pass on the costs of the trust's schemes to gas customers.
She said she would consider each scheme on its merits in the light of its
cost-effectiveness.
The IFS report says 'there are certain areas in which market failures may
deter households from making rational decisions regarding energy efficiency
investments'.
While tenants in rented housing would benefit from lower fuel bills if the
property were well insulated, responsibility for decisions about the fabric
of the building usually lies with the landlord.
The IFS report calls for improved information for tenants about energy
efficiency. 'Only if tenants are willing to pay higher rents for more energy
efficient properties will landlords face an incentive to make energy
efficiency investments,' it argues.

FT  26 MAY 94 / UDM joins Edwards bidding consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Union of Democratic Mineworkers yesterday formed a powerful bidding
partnership with the former commercial director of British Coal as it
emerged that each of the country's mining regions is likely to attract at
least three tenders.
The UDM consortium with Mr Malcolm Edwards and Coal Investments, the quoted
company he heads, is to consider bidding for the three English regions in
the forthcoming privatisation. Coal Investments is thought to be bidding for
the south Wales region - but without the UDM.
If the consortium decides to proceed it is likely to face competition from
bidders including RJB Mining, Ryan Group and at least two management buy-out
teams.
By yesterday, the final day to register an interest, each of the regions for
sale had attracted at least four potential bidders. However, some companies
 -such as RTZ, the world's biggest mining company - are thought unlikely to
make a bid after studying what is on offer.
The UDM decided to link with Coal Investments after its original partner,
Jim Walter Resources, withdrew due to problems in the US. Mr Edwards said
workers would be offered shares in the group.
The following lists some of the parties thought to have registered to
'pre-qualify' to bid. Scotland: Mining (Scotland); Ryan and Miller joint
venture; Caledonian Mining; RJB Mining; RTZ.
North-east: Ryan/Alcan joint venture; UDM/Coal Investments; management
buy-out team led by Mr Bob Siddall, British Coal opencast director;
Caledonian; RJB; RTZ.
Central North: UDM/Coal Investments; management buy-out team led by Mr Alan
Houghton, regional director; management buy-out team led by Mr Siddall; RJB;
RTZ.
Central south: UDM/Coal Investments; management buy-out team led by Mr
Siddall; RJB; RTZ.
South Wales: management buy-out team led by Mr Bryan Riddleston, opencast
director in south Wales; RJB; Coal Investments; Ryan Group; Caledonian.
Companies have paid Pounds 15,000 for each pre-qualification registration
and another Pounds 5,000 in regard to stand-alone mines which British Coal
has closed but is offering for sale. Bidding is expected in September.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Boost for coal sell-off: Non-mining activities set to raise
more cash than pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of British Coal's non-mining activities is likely to earn the
government significantly more than its pits, it emerged yesterday as the
corporation published details of nine activities, including subsidiaries, to
be sold off by next March.
The companies - which include Coal Products, the smokeless fuel
manufacturer, and British Fuels Group, the distributor of coal, gas and oil
 -last year recorded turnover of more than Pounds 700m and operating profits
in excess of Pounds 40m.
British Coal would not be drawn on what it expects the proceeds to be. Mr
Charles Kernot, mining analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said the companies
could fetch more than Pounds 500m, compared with as little as Pounds 130m
for coal mines.
In addition, British Coal's property portfolio, ranging from the lease on
its Hobart House headquarters in London to miners' allotments, could raise
between Pounds 300m and Pounds 1bn, according to some forecasts.
Mr Ray Proctor, British Coal finance director, said most of the non-mining
activities, which employ 4,800 people - a quarter of British Coal's
workforce - would be offered by way of trade sales. He hoped privatisation
of non-mining businesses would be largely completed by March 1995.
British Fuels Group, with an annual turnover of Pounds 550m, is among the
largest units being sold. British Coal plans to offer the three BFL arms -
GB Coal, GB Oil and Cawoods, serving Northern Ireland - separately towards
the end of the year.
Coal Products, with turnover of Pounds 130m, may be attractive for its
Phurnacite and Homefire brands and its 30 per cent of the UK solid smokeless
fuel market. It will be offered for sale early in the summer.
British Coal is considering options for the future of CIN Management
(Cinman), investment manager for the industry's pension schemes and for the
pension funds for Barclays Bank and British Rail. It plans to offer for sale
next year its Centris Coal Benefits subsidiary which is taking over the
activities, assets and staff of British Coal's pensions administration and
insurance centre.
More peripheral to the UK industry is German Creek, an Australian company
with two deep mines and opencast activities producing between 4m and 5m
tonnes a year. British Coal's 15 per cent stake, taken in the late 1970s to
give it a testbed for mining technology, is to be offered for sale towards
the end of the year.
Other activities to be sold include: information technology activities
including the Compower computer services bureau; technical and scientific
services; and consulting and engineering services to the mining, minerals
and energy industries. Several of these are likely to be the subject of
management buy-out bids.
Potential bidders are being told they can register an interest with Samuel
Montagu if they wish to consider bidding for the activities other than Coal
Products, on which Price Waterhouse is the adviser.
Other organisations still under consideration include British Coal
Enterprise, the job-creation arm, and the Coal Research Establishment, which
carries out research and development into coal utilisation.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Tory election campaign hit by political truce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The moratorium on campaigning after the death of John Smith, the Labour
leader, appears to have done serious damage to the Conservative campaign for
the European elections in south-west England.
While Liberal Democrat activists campaigned quietly last week in the
south-west, where they have their highest hopes of winning seats, the
Conservatives restricted themselves to 'housekeeping chores' such as
labelling election addresses.
The Liberal Democrats avoided high-profile 'media events' or canvassing in
strongly Labour areas, but several MPs visited the region.
One Conservative official said the campaign 'hiatus' had been difficult to
maintain: 'I don't think that people appreciate the extraordinary difficulty
in the shutting of a campaign machine. Once it's stopped, it's very
difficult to start up.'
The Conservatives have not achieved the display of posters they had hoped
for, and will mount only two or three more visits to the region by cabinet
ministers before the final week of the campaign.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, visited Cornwall on Monday, while the
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, was in Dorset yesterday, in trips designed to
boost local activists' morale and demonstrate that the party is vigorously
contesting the region.
The campaign is complicated by the south-west's large areas and sparse
population covered in each constituency.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader, will visit each south-west
constituency at least four times duringthe campaign, while there will be a
visit from at least one of the party's MPs each day.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Poll leaders face up to pitfalls: Labour's popularity has a
downside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the election Labour cannot lose, but may not win. Even Conservative
strategists admit privately that Labour will add to the 45 seats it holds in
the outgoing European parliament. But the party's campaign managers are
painfully aware of the dangers in being so far ahead.
Before the formal opening of the campaign on Monday, Labour's senior
officials spent much time trying to douse expectations that the party would
win at least 60 of the 84 seats in mainland Britain.
It was all to no avail. An opinion poll by ICM in the Daily Express
newspaper predicts that Labour will win 61 seats; Mr David Butler, the
Oxford University psephologist, forecasts a haul of between 52 and 66.
Against this background, a result that gave Labour fewer than 60 seats would
look disappointing, while a haul of fewer than 50 would cast doubts on the
party's ability to translate its opinion-poll lead into support in the
voting booths.
Labour's strategy is to maximise support by fighting a twin-track campaign
focusing on the government's domestic record and its difficulties over
Britain's place in Europe.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting party leader, signalled the shape of the
campaign at the party's first election press conference when she spent as
much time on domestic issues such as tax, crime and health as she did on
Europe.
When Labour does talk about European issues, it is largely in terms of the
government's record: the embarrassing about-turn by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, on qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers; the
government's failure to take up European Union funds to combat fraud; the
cost of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy.
The party has blunted Conservative attacks on its own commitment to Europe
by insisting on the retention of the British veto in important areas, and by
proposing radical reforms of the CAP - the EU's most expensive programme.
But it is less keen to discuss its own approach to thorny issues such as the
scope of reforms to EU institutions at the 1996 inter-governmental
conference and the possibility of a referendum on the next steps to economic
and monetary union.
Labour's hope is that its robust defence of the British national interest in
Europe will make it easier for disgruntled Conservatives to register a
protest vote against the government.
The big danger, especially in the south of England, is that maverick Tories
will switch to the Liberal Democrats. To combat that possibility, Labour has
resurrected the 'wasted vote' argument that has served it well in successive
general elections.
Tactical voting worked largely in favour of the Liberal Democrats in the May
local elections. But if its strategy succeeds, Labour could win Conservative
seats - including London north-west and south-east, Lincolnshire and South
Humberside, Norfolk, and Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes.
It has hopes, too, in a batch of southern and Midlands Tory seats which
could go to any of the three main parties. These include Hertfordshire, Kent
East, Hampshire North and Oxford, Sussex South, the Cotswolds and Hereford
and Shropshire. In Hertfordshire, the Liberal Democrats are mounting a
strong challenge on the back of a good performance in the local elections.
Labour activists in the constituencies are less circumspect about the
party's chances than the cautious officials in London. For example, the
Conservatives have held Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes for 15 years. Yet
local Labour campaigners believe the party may win as much as 41.3 per cent
of the vote in the constituency, with the Tories on 33 per cent.
Labour is also benefiting from the emergence of anti-Europe candidates, such
as the 24 standing for the UK Independence party. Such candidates will
almost certainly cream off some votes which would otherwise have gone to the
Conservatives.
Local activists say another factor is emerging - a surge of sympathy for the
party after the death of John Smith, which has galvanised local supporters
into canvassing for Labour. More important, it may help ensure that a high
proportion of Labour supporters turn out on polling day. That could be the
key to victory. But it is a factor Labour would rather have done without.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Police admit drug rivalries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rivalry between Customs officials and police is hampering arrests and
prosecutions in drug-related crime, a senior police officer told the Commons
home affairs committee yesterday, Stewart Dalby writes.
Drug-related crime accounts for 60 per cent of crime in Britain - but only
10 per cent of drugs coming into the country are being detected.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Dickens, national co-ordinator of
regional crime squads, said relations between Customs and police had
improved, 'but the rivalry does hamper operations'. He added: 'It is my
opinion that the distinction between importation and distribution should be
abolished.'
Asked if there were any 'Mr Bigs' in UK organised crime, he said: 'No, but
there are plenty of Mr Big Enoughs.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / Lib Dems pledge retention of 'effective veto'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday sought to gloss over the party's disarray
over Britain's ability to block decisions in Brussels as Mr Charles Kennedy
said it backed the retention of an 'effective national veto'. The Liberal
Democrat president said the party's suggestion for a 'double majority'
system for taking important decisions in the European Union's Council of
Ministers amounted to such a veto.
His remarks came less than 24 hours after Sir David Steel, the party's
foreign affairs spokesman, said in Cornwall that the EU would be
'stultified' if it did not abandon the national veto in favour of qualified
majority voting.
The Tories last night seized on the apparent discrepancy, calling on Mr
Paddy Ashdown to explain his party's position.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, used an open letter to the Liberal
Democrat leader to highlight Sir David's comments. He said the veto was 'the
most crucial constitutional issue in these elections'.
Earlier Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, acknowledged that in spite
of the Conservatives' decision to make preservation of the veto the
centrepiece of their campaign, the outcome of the June 9 elections would not
affect Britain's ability to block controversial legislation. Mr Hurd
accepted that the Strasbourg assembly had no remit to remove the veto and
that other leading countries in the EU were as committed as Britain to
retaining it.
But any increase in the number of Labour or Liberal Democrat members in the
parliament would over time give support to the case of some smaller EU
members for a move to majority voting on constitutional issues, he said.
In spite of his distaste for his own party's Euro-sceptics, Mr Hurd said the
policies of the main opposition parties would undervalue 'the role of the
nation state' in Europe. He refused to accept statements from Mr Jack
Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, earlier this week that committed
Labour to retaining a veto.
Confusion over the Liberal Democrats' position was triggered on Monday when
Mr Ashdown backed away from abandoning the veto. The party has been anxious
to add a sceptical note to its pro-European stance to win Tory votes in
southern England.
According to Sir Norman's letter, Mr Ashdown said last December that his
party wanted ministers to 'make decisions in public without single national
vetoes'.
The Liberal Democrat manifesto commits the party to working for an extension
of qualified majority voting. But it avoids direct reference to the veto,
suggesting that the system be reformed to require a double majority for
'particularly important issues'.
This double majority would consist of three-quarters of member states and
the votes of states representing three-uarters of the EU's population.
A Guardian/ICM poll suggests today that the Conservatives could be left with
only six seats in the European elections. The figures are: Labour 47 per
cent, Conservatives 26 per cent, Liberal Democrats 23 per cent, SNP 2 per
cent, Greens 1 per cent, Plaid Cymru 1 per cent.
These voting intentions could leave Labour with 65 seats, the Liberal
Democrats with 12 and the Tories six.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Unions face biggest bill in Pounds 1.5m Labour leader poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour leadership election is likely to cost about Pounds 1.5m, of which
only Pounds 100,000 will be borne directly by the party, it emerged
yesterday. Most of the cost will fall on affiliated unions which will have
to organise postal ballots of more than 4m members who pay the political
levy.
The TGWU and the GMB, the two biggest general unions, said the gross cost of
balloting their 1.8m members would be about Pounds 300,000 each.
Some unions, such as the AEEU craft union, will reduce costs by sending
ballot papers with routine literature such as union journals.
Labour officials said that up to a third of the cost might be recouped by
combining the ballot with a membership drive and delivery of marketing and
advertising material.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour chairman, said: 'Provided it is done with
sensitivity and with an eye to the political nuances, we can ensure that we
raise money and don't just spend it.'
The election will make only a small dent in the union movement's financial
contribution to Labour, which is running at about Pounds 9m a year.
Union funds cover about half of the annual running costs of the party and
provide the bulk of the election fund, which is expected to amount to about
Pounds 20m by 1996.
Union leaders are more concerned about the political implications of the
leadership election.
Officials say that a large number of affiliated unions are likely to refrain
from endorsing any of the potential candidates when nominations open after
the European elections on June 9.
Like many Labour activists, union officials want to back the candidate most
likely to win an election. Many grudgingly believe that will be Mr Tony
Blair, the shadow home secretary. However, some union leaders have too many
reservations about Mr Blair's modernist views on union and employment issues
to offer him public support.
Some union leaders also fear their authority would be undermined if they
publicly endorsed a candidate who was then rejected by a majority of
rank-and-file members.
Many officials say the election has revealed a cultural shift in unions.
'For the first time . . . almost everyone . . . is deciding who to back on
the basis of who can win the election, not on the basis of ideology,' said
one official, adding: 'It is an extraordinary cultural change.'

development of a new commercial jetliner smaller than its current Boeing 737
family of 100-170 seat narrow-body aircraft.
Boeing yesterday said it had appointed Mr Richard James, its former

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has launched an
electronic pocket-book for exporters on CD-Rom, enabling users to call up
comprehensive information on trade flows, tariffs and trade rules for more
than 5,000 products in the world's main markets, writes Frances Williams in
Geneva.
The CD-Rom version of Unctad's Trade Analysis and Information System
(Trains) unites six separate databases and includes information on 50
markets accounting for more than 85 per cent of world imports. The Trains
CD-Rom 'has everything an exporter or negotiator needs to know about the
market access conditions for a product,' according to Unctad. CD-Roms
contain up to 650 megabytes of information, equivalent to 450 normal
computer diskettes, and the falling cost of CD-Rom drives (now less than
Dollars 400) has made the technology widely accessible. Trains covers tariff
and non-tariff trade measures, including details of preferential schemes,
detailed import data, names and addresses of importers for selected product
categories and markets, and other general trade documentation.

<TEXT>
The US ambassador to Haiti said yesterday that a three-day-old total trade
embargo clamped on the Caribbean nation had been violated repeatedly, Reuter
reports from Malpasse, Haiti.
Ambassador William Swing said at the border with the Dominican Republic that
oil was coming in from Haiti's neighbour and acknowledged the embargo had
been broken several times since it was imposed at midnight on Saturday. He
was referring to reports that boats loaded with fuel entered the southern
Haitian port of Jacmel this week. Mr Swing spent about 15 minutes at the
Malpasse crossing, through which much of the smuggled fuel and other
contraband goods pass. Minutes before he arrived, Haitian entrepeneurs in
rowboats docked on Lake Saumatre's shore with illegally imported fuel.
The UN imposed the embargo on Haiti to try to force intransigent military
leaders to allow democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
return to power. The military toppled Aristide in a bloody coup 32 months
ago.

Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications group, yesterday became the first
European manufacturer to start selling cellular phones in Japan, write
Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo and Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The move marks the entry of Europe's largest mobile phone manufacturer into
the world's second-largest mobile phone market. It follows last month's
deregulation when it became possible to sell mobile phones in Japan for the
first time. Previously it was only possible to lease them.
The Finnish group has delivery agreements with two operators in Tokyo and
Kyoto, with a third accord, in the Nagoya region, due to come into force in
July. Last year Nokia and Mitsui, the Japanese trading house, established a
joint venture to import Nokia's phones. Last week it signed up Casio, the
maker of watches and calculators, to supply its customer support services.
Nokia expects mobile phone sales in Japan to reach between 1.3m and 1.4m
this year, including 300,000 digital phone sales. It aims to capture around
25 per cent of the digital market.

France said yesterday the Gatt world trade body's offspring, the World Trade
Organisation would fail to meet its start-up goal of next January 1, and
threw its weight behind Geneva's bid to host the WTO, Reuter reports from
Paris.
'We will not meet the start-up date of January 1, 1995, for the very simple
reason that we want to wait for ratification by the US Congress and then,
naturally, by the French parliament,' industry and trade minister Gerard
Longuet said. Answering a question in the National Assembly (lower house),
Mr Longuet said history proved 'it is better for an international
organisation to be sure the Americans will ratify (it) before we ratify it
so as not to be caught in an uncertain position.'

TCI, the US cable TV operator, and Sumitomo, the Japanese trading house,
have agreed to set up two new joint ventures in Japan to operate cable TV
companies and supply programme software, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
The two companies will set up a cable TV operator to oversee the operations
of Sumitomo's portfolio of cable TV companies in Japan as well as any others
the company might acquire. Sumitomo has an equity stake in 26 cable TV
companies with a total of 132,000 household subscribers.
The other joint venture company will provide programmes to cable TV
companies, take charge of the TV shopping business Sumitomo and TCI are
considering, and set up new TV channels.
The capital of the two new companies will total Dollars 500m (Pounds
333.3m), with Sumitomo investing the bulk of funds and TCI investing up to
the maximum allowed to a foreign company.
Recent deregulation moves by Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications increased the permissible foreign equity level to
one-third.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton is expected to announce a renewal of China's Most
Favoured Nation status, either today or tomorrow, despite Beijing's minimal
efforts to meet the conditions of an executive order which ties trade with
human rights.
The president is likely to revoke MFN - which allows for the lowest tariff
rates available - for guns and ammunition produced by the People's
Liberation Army. Mr Clinton is scheduled to make his announcement today,
though threats by Congressional Democrats that a minimal punishment would
bring a fight in both houses may delay it until tomorrow.
High level discussions were under way in the White House yesterday on a
face-saving package which would allow US companies to preserve their markets
in China, while the US displays its ire over China's human rights record.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, one of the leaders in the battle to tie MFN and
human rights, said yesterday China was still exporting products made by
prison labour and thus has failed to fulfil one of the two mandatory
conditions set out in the president's executive order.

The Cuban government has set new targets which indicate expectations of a
significant expansion in tourism over the next two years, writes Canute
James in Kingston.
It is expecting gross income from the sector to reach Dollars 900m (Pounds
600) this year and Dollars 1bn next year, Mr Osmany Cienfuegos, the tourism
minister, told a recent conference on Cuban tourism. Gross income from the
sector last year was Dollars 720m, of which about one third represented net
earnings. The government is hoping the volume of visitors will reach 1m by
1996, double last year's volume, the minister said. The island's stock of
hotel rooms is being increased to meet the growth in visitor arrivals, with
foreign investors involved in the construction and rehabilitation of 7,000
rooms. The expansion in capacity should lift the number of rooms to 50,000
by the year 2000, he said.

Mr Peter Sutherland, the director general of Gatt, has said that the idea
that the recently concluded Gatt agreement would erode national sovereignty
was 'absolute nonsense' and that such sentiments must not be allowed to
undermine the accord, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Some members of the US Congress have said that a new World Trade
Organisation (WTO), to be set up next year, will be like an 'economic United
Nations' in which the US could be outvoted by smaller countries.
Mr Sutherland, in Kuala Lumpur to attend a meeting of business leaders from
around the Pacific, said it would be an act of the greatest folly if the
recently concluded agreement was to be questioned in this way. 'By any
stretch of the imagination, sovereignty is not at issue. The WTO will not be
an instrument of world government. It will in no way inhibit sovereignty.'
Mr Sutherland said there was an urgent need for countries including the US
to ratify the Gatt agreement.

FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Deutsche Telekom loses cartel case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned German telecommunications operator, has
been seriously hindering competition in Germany's liberalising telecoms
market through substantial cross subsidies from its monopoly businesses.
A six-month investigation by the Federal Cartel Administration in Berlin
concluded that since 1989 Deutsche Telekom has channeled subsidies totalling
DM1.9bn (Pounds 760m) into its data networks division.
The decision has far-reaching implications for Deutsche Telekom as it faces
privatisation amid growing international competition. Deutsche Telekom still
has 90 per cent of Germany's data networks market; in the other liberalised
telecoms sectors of satellite and mobile communications rival operators have
taken nearly half of the German market.
Data networks were liberalised in Germany in 1989, in accordance with
European Union rules on telecoms liberalisation. But competitors have long
complained that Deutsche Telekom was keeping them out of the DM800m-a-year
market by subsidising data networks from its monopoly voice and leased lines
businesses.
The Federal Cartel Administration has broadly upheld the complaints. 'We
proved how Deutsche Telekom had been hindering competition through providing
hidden subsidies,' the Cartel Office said yesterday. Its report is with the
Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
An association of rival telecoms operators, which took the case to the
cartel authority, includes British Telecommunications, AT&amp;T of the US, and
Unisource, a joint venture between the Swiss, Swedish and Dutch state
telecoms companies.
'This is a landmark case in German telecommunications and business,' said Mr
Gerd Eickers, president of the association, saying it would send a 'strong
signal and incentive to all aspirants in the liberalised European
telecommunications market'.
Deutsche Telekom said it had yet to see the report, but claimed to be
'confident' that significant changes to its accounting system made over the
past two years, and others in train, would meet the complaints.
The Economics Ministry said the findings would not delay the privatisation
of Deutsche Telekom. The governing Christian Democratic coalition has
secured backing for the partial privatisation of the telecoms and postal
services, although a flotation is unlikely before 1996.
However, the cartel report calls into question the capacity of Deutsche
Telekom to meet early competition. Under existing EU rules its monopoly on
basic voice traffic is protected until 1998. The cross-subsidy report also
has ramifications for the Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) joint venture between
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, the French state operator, formed last
December to provide data and other advanced services to multinationals.
The companies argued that the exposure of the data sector to competition
justified their move to integrate their international data services. They
are anxious to extend the alliance, but EU competition authorities may
resist any further integration until competition is well established.

FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Boeing looks east in project for smaller
jet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up
efforts to enter for the first time the market for smaller 70-100 seat jets.
The US group, which has traditionally dominated the large airliner market,
is working with the Japanese and Chinese aircraft industries to study the
development of a new commercial jetliner smaller than its current Boeing 737
family of 100-170 seat narrow-body aircraft.
Boeing yesterday said it had appointed Mr Richard James, its former
vice-president of marketing for commercial aircraft programmes, to a new
position of vice-president to study the development of a new small aircraft.
'His assignment will be to explore the market feasibility and structure of a
new small aircraft programme,' said Mr Ron Woodward, president of Boeing's
commercial aircraft operations. Boeing said representatives from Japan
Aircraft Industry and the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export
Corporation had begun work with Boeing in Seattle to examine the market
requirement and potential configuration for a new commercial jet aircraft
slightly smaller than the 737.
The move is expected to intensify further competition in the small jet
airliner market which is scrambling to restructure itself in the face of
large-scale over-capacity in that sector. It would pitch the world's leading
aircraft manufacturer against companies such as Fokker, British Aerospace
and Saab in that market.
Boeing sees strong demand for smaller jet airliners emerging during the next
20 years in the Asia-Pacific region.
The small aircraft project will extend Boeing's close links with both the
Japanese and Chinese aircraft industries. Japanese companies already
participate on all Boeing airliner programmes, including the latest 777
wide-body aircraft, while China produces parts for the 737 and the 757.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Compromise brings whale sanctuary nearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Whaling Commission moved closer to agreement on a
comprehensive whale sanctuary for the Antarctic Ocean yesterday, after a
compromise plan backed by a solid majority of member nations had emerged.
'If you take everybody together, we have enough votes,' said a member of the
UK delegation. 'I am optimistic.' The sanctuary, opposed by Japan and
Norway, needs to be supported by three-quarters of the commission's member
nations to take effect.
The optimism was based on a draft amendment that the UK delegation expected
to be formally tabled last night. The proposed sanctuary sought to meet the
objection of Chile and its supporters by excluding the waters of southern
South America.
The UK delegation said last night that the Chileans were ready to back the
compromise sanctuary. Chile had offered a proposal which, unlike the
compromise plan, would not have protected the feeding grounds of sei and fin
whales in the Atlantic and the western Pacific.
The UK delegation said the proposed amendment brought together countries,
such as Ireland, which opposed the Chilean plan, and the backers of Chile,
such as Mexico.
Japan has proposed a sanctuary that would not protect minke whales, the only
whales of commercial interest in the Antarctic. Japan argues that minke are
in abundance and so do not need blanket protection. It describes the
proposal for a comprehensive sanctuary as 'unscientific'.
Whale hunting is prohibited by a moratorium that has been in place for eight
years. However, the International Whaling Commission is slowly moving
towards replacing the moratorium with hunting quotas for whales in plentiful
supply.
Under the proposed quotas, Japan would have been able to hunt about 2,000
minke whales a year in the Antarctic, the main reason it has objected so
strongly to the blanket sanctuary.
Environmentalists are concerned that the information on which quotas are
calculated may be faulty. This year, it was reported that the former Soviet
Union had under-reported the number of whales it used to kill.
Environmentalists reckon that the sanctuary will in effect kill Japanese
interest in whaling, since the Southern Ocean is the only sea where Japan's
fishermen could hunt minke whales on a large scale.
Some Japanese whalers say their government will object to the sanctuary  -
such an objection would enable them to ignore it legally - although in
practice this would be difficult politically.

<TEXT>
Taiwanese travel agents lifted a 25-day boycott against China yesterday,
despite lingering anger over the death of 24 Taiwanese tourists in eastern
China two months ago, AP reports from Taipei.
The boycott was part of Taiwan's reaction to allegations that the tourists
were robbed and murdered and that China covered up the facts.
But the attempt to punish China appeared to have ended with travel agents
and the government each saying the boycott was the other's initiative.
Travel agents say about 20,000 cancelled tours have cost them revenues of
between TDollars 40m to TDollars 100m (Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.5m). Last year
about 1.5m Taiwanese travelled to China, pumping Dollars 3bn into the
Chinese tourism industry.
The Taipei Association of Travel Agents said the lifting of the boycott was
approved by the Mainland Affairs Council, which makes Taiwan's mainland
policy in the absence of official China-Taiwan ties.
Mr Micky Chen, the council's director of economic affairs, said the
government had never encouraged organised tours to China, believing it to be
a dangerous place, but was in no position to impose travel bans. 'It was
travel agents who started the boycott,' he said in an interview.
China and Taiwan do not recognise each other, and their trade and tourism
links, while tacitly approved by both governments, are unofficial.
The bodies of the tourists and eight Chinese crewmen were found in the
burned-out hulk of a pleasure boat on Thousand Islands Lake in Zhejiang
province.
The victims' relatives complained that they were denied information and
harassed when they visited the lake.

State-owned Indian Airlines said yesterday it had settled a pay dispute with
engineers, ending their 10-day strike that had disrupted flights, Reuter
reports from New Delhi.
The Press Trust of India said the airline, which flies mainly domestic
routes, agreed to a 45 per cent increase in the allowances of some 860
striking engineers.
Indian Airlines officials said earlier they had invited the engineers for
talks on a productivity-linked incentive scheme after they had rejected a 30
per cent wage increase.
The engineers began a go-slow on May 16 to back demands for wage parity with
their higher-paid counterparts in Air India, the country's international air
carrier.
Indian Airlines, in the red since private airlines were allowed to compete
against it three years ago, said earlier it could not afford to pay what
would have amounted to a 90 per cent wage rise. It lost more than Rs100m
(Pounds 2.1m) in revenues during the go-slow.

FT  26 MAY 94 / India resists IMF pressure over currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government is resisting advice from the International Monetary
Fund to let the rupee float upwards in response to record private capital
inflows into India.
Though not committed to an exchange rate target, the government is
determined to resist any substantial appreciation from the rate of close to
31 to the US dollar, at which it has stayed since March 1993.
According to senior Indian officials, such an appreciation would risk
inflicting the 'Dutch disease' on the economy - a reference to the way
discoveries of natural gas reduced the competitiveness of exports from the
Netherlands in the 1970s. An appreciation could, it is feared, inflict
comparable damage on India's still fragile export success.
In the financial year ending March 1994, according to the ministry of
finance, India received foreign direct investment of about Dollars 600m
(Pounds 398m) and a portfolio flow of Dollars 4bn, Dollars 1.5bn of which
was from foreign institutional investors, while Dollars 2.5bn arrived in
response to foreign issues of equity and convertible bonds by Indian firms.
This capital inflow, in addition to what the finance ministry believes will
turn out to be a small (and unexpected) current account surplus, helped
produce an increase of Dollars 8.7bn in India's foreign exchange reserves
during the financial year. Even without holdings of gold, reserves stood at
Dollars 15.5bn at the end of March, equivalent to some seven months of
imports.
Along with a fiscal deficit of 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product, the
rise in reserves has considerably augmented domestic liquidity. Monetary
growth has jumped from 5 per cent in the year to May 1993, to 18 per cent in
the year to January 1994. Annual inflation is also running at 11 per cent -
disturbing by Indian standards.
During its annual 'Article IV' consultations, the IMF advised India to let
the rupee appreciate, if it could not implement a much sharper than planned
cut in the fiscal deficit. But the government, supported by the World Bank,
is concerned about the adverse effect a big appreciation might have on
exports, which grew at the encouraging rate of 21 per cent, in US dollars,
in the last financial year.
The Indian government believes the reserve accumulation is likely to prove
temporary. A rise in relatively import-intensive fixed investment  - the
likelihood of which is indicated by an increase of 8.1 per cent in
manufactured output between January 1993 and January 1994 - should, it
believes, expand imports substantially. In consequence, the finance ministry
expects a current account deficit of Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn in 1994-95. The
capital inflow may also dwindle, albeit temporarily, during the current
financial year.
In the short run, the government is prepared to accept the reserve
accumulation, rather than risk seeing the export drive come to an end. But
it has decided to curb the monetary effects through the imposition of higher
cash reserve requirements on the banking system. It has the additional
option of trying to sterilise the inflow, via open market operations of the
Reserve Bank of India, the central bank.
Should the build-up of foreign exchange reserves continue, the government
might consider making terms of non-resident banking deposits less
attractive. It might also try to restrict the access of Indian business to
foreign capital.
In addition, a modest start to liberalisation of consumer goods was made in
the government's import policy for this year. The current build-up of
reserves will make it politically easier to accelerate liberalisation in
future, which the IMF and World Bank both strongly recommend.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Beijing success may impress Chernomyrdin: Tony Walker
previews the Russian prime minister's four-day visit to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Victor Chernomyrdin arrives in Beijing today his view of life in the
Chinese capital through the tinted windows of his official limousine may be
of greater interest than the issues to be discussed in four days of talks
with officials.
Russia's prime minister could not help but be struck by evidence that
China's embrace of the market has carried it farther and faster than his
country's fumbling efforts to reform its socialist era economy.
Chinese leaders are known to draw unfavourable comparisons with economic
progress in Russia to urge swifter reform, lest China's ruling Communist
party meets the same fate as its counterpart in the former Soviet Union.
While it is most unlikely that any Chinese official would be so undiplomatic
as to make crude reference to the yawning gap between the performances of
the respective economies - China recorded growth rates in each of the past
two years of about 13 per cent compared with decline in Russia - it would be
hard for Mr Chernomyrdin to ignore China's success.
He might seek to draw lessons from his exposure to China's economic
progress: at the very least he will be trying to engage his country's
economy more closely with that of its booming southern neighbour.
Mr Chernomyrdin's visit will be concerned primarily with trade, including
vexed questions of payment - both counties are seeking a bigger proportion
of payments in cash rather than barter goods. These and other trade-related
issues, such as strengthening management of border trade, are being
discussed in Beijing this week at the second session of the Sino-Russian
Joint Commission on Economic, Trade and Technical Co-operation.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister has been in Beijing
since early this week for the joint trade commission. He will also have been
preparing for the Chernomyrdin visit which will encompass a broad range of
topics, including co-operation in aerospace - such as a joint fighter
project - chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and machinery. They are also working
on improving sea, road and rail transport routes.
Two-way trade reached Dollars 7.68bn last year, an increase of 30 per cent
over the year before, making Russia China's seventh-largest trade partner.
Chinese imports reached Dollars 4.99bn and exports Dollars 2.69bn.
In the first three months of this year two-way trade fell sharply, however,
to Dollars 991m. This was largely due to a dramatic slide in border trade
which, according to some estimates, was down by more than 50 per cent to the
end of March compared with the corresponding period last year.
Stricter customs and immigration regulations on the Russian side have
slashed the number of Chinese pedlars crossing the frontier. Payments
problems are also bedevilling cross-border trade.
In Beijing, Mr Geng Xuncai, a senior ministry of trade official, called for
a greater percentage of business to be conducted in cash. This call partly
reflects growing Chinese impatience with the practical difficulties of
barter trade, which accounts for 70 per cent of business, now that the
state-controlled trading system is breaking down.
The Russians are also pressing for cash payments for supplies of military
equipment, according to the representative of a western arms supplier in
Beijing.
China purchased 26 Su27 fighters from Russia in 1992 and is anxious to add
another squadron but payments problems appear to be holding up the deal.
On-going negotiations on military purchases and exchanges in the technical
field are being underpinned by a new military co-operation agreement.
The agreement, signed last November by Mr Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence
minister, provides for an annual review of military co-operation and
includes reference to the possibility of joint training exercises and access
to each other's airfields.
Russian and Chinese officials have been stressing the complementary nature
of the two economies. In Beijing, Mr Igor Rogachev, the Russian ambassador,
described as 'great' the potential for economic co-operation. He proposed
the establishment of more joint ventures to marry Russia's 'natural
resources with China's rich agricultural and labour resources'.
Russia itself is anxious to exploit China's enormous demand for
infrastructure assistance. It has proposed that it become involved in big
capital works projects such as the Dollars 10bn Three Gorges dam on the
Yangtze river.
Among the more delicate issues of Mr Chernomyrdin's visit are those
concerned with foreign relations. Moscow will have viewed with misgivings a
recent 12-day tour of central Asia by China's premier Li Peng which was
aimed at increasing Beijing's influence in those former Soviet republics,
including resource-rich Kazakhstan.
Russia fears a greater Chinese presence in these areas and with it increased
competition for the region's oil and minerals resources. China traditionally
has regarded the countries on its western frontier as part of its sphere of
influence.
Meanwhile Moscow has indicated that it is anxious to calm the tension on the
Korean peninsula and that it would like to work more closely with China on
this. But Russian influence is much diminished in Pyongyang these days.
Beijing may not wish to complicate its dealings with the North Koreans by
involving Moscow too closely in attempts to persuade them to agree to
international demands to open their nuclear sites to inspection.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Kenya currency nears total convertibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kenya yesterday made its currency fully convertible for nearly all
transactions, one of the most important steps in the country's
liberalisation programme.
The decision reflects government confidence that Kenya's economic and
political stability will ensure that there is no capital flight.
Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, said Kenya's relaxation of the
exchange control act made the shilling fully convertible for all current
account transactions. Kenyans are now free to invest outside the country up
to a maximum of Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 331,000) without central bank
authorisation. The bank says it will approve all bona fide transactions
beyond that amount without undue delay.
Exporters are also free to retain all export proceeds in foreign currency.
They used to be required to surrender part of their foreign exchange
earnings after 90 days.
The only area to remain subject to exchange controls is inward investment in
shares and government securities by foreigners. Mr Mudavadi said legislation
to allow foreign investment funds into Kenya was not yet ready. He did not
say when the last controls would be removed.
The currency liberalisation measures appear to have been decided in the wake
of the appreciation of the shilling and the build-up of Dollars 700m in
foreign exchange reserves - enough to cover 4 1/2 months' imports - which
reflect a new confidence in Kenya's economic policies.
Furthermore, they signalled President Daniel arap Moi's support for the
33-year-old finance minister, who has fought, since he took over last year,
to implement the economic programme in the face of fierce opposition from
some politicians and civil servants who resent the loss of patronage
implicit in his reforms.
The decision, coincided with an International Monetary Fund mission visit
which said Kenya had made 'progress in restoring macroeconomic stability'
under an IMF enhanced structural adjustment programme.
Mr Hiroyuki Hino, the mission's leader and assistant director of the IMF's
Africa department, warned: 'Major challenges remain'.
Monetary conditions were 'not as tight as had been expected' and the budget
deficit for the financial year ending next month was likely to reach 7 per
cent of GDP, one point higher than the target.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Israel economy set to grow by 5%, says bank
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's central bank yesterday predicted the economy would grow at 5 per
cent this year despite concern about high inflation and interest rates, a
slowdown in Jewish immigration, and a continuing stock market downward
trend.
The Bank of Israel, which published its annual state of the economy report
yesterday, said stable economic policy and exploitation of sound
infrastructure and potential human resources would fuel fast growth in the
coming years.
Growth of 3.5 per cent for 1993 was low, against 6.7 per cent growth in
1992, but was temporary. The low growth masked significant rises in exports,
investment and employment. The central bank also said the unfolding
Arab-Israeli peace process would have positive effects on the Israeli
economy in opening new markets, increasing exports, investments and
consumption.
'We have the potential, the technology, the manpower and the new markets
.the general direction is positive,' Mr Jacob Frenkel, central bank
governor, said. 'Despite the stock exchange crisis, growth will remain as
expected.'
Analysts said the bank was seeking to deflect criticism from industrialists
and finance ministry officials that recent rises in interest rates would
curb economic growth.
But Mr Frenkel warned that the government would have to urgently tackle a
runaway inflation rate, which is about 13.5 per cent, well ahead of the
government's 1994 target of 8 per cent. The central bank said inflation was
the product of rocketing housing prices, now climbing at an annual rate of
35 per cent.
The governor urged the government to release more state-owned land, press
contractors to build in a fixed time, and increase permits for foreign
construction workers to fill jobs of Palestinians unable to come to work
after Israel sealed off the occupied territories.
The cabinet is due to finalise plans to combat the housing crisis on Sunday.
Mr Frenkel said the government should press ahead with privatisation despite
the crisis on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange where shares have fallen 18 per
cent in the past three weeks. The Mishtanim index of the top 100 blue chip
shares fell by 1.5 per cent again yesterday, closing below the level of
August 1993.
Further reforms in economic policy, including lower taxation, faster
liberalisation, and increased investment in infrastructure, were necessary
to ensure greater stability, the bank noted.
'Once carried out, the reforms will only increase certainty and stability.
Israel today has the potential to continue fast growth, while integrating
into the world's business community and exploiting the new possibilities
opened by the peace process.'

FT  26 MAY 94 / HK group markets Burma fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Hong-Kong based securities company controlled by Mr Robert Kuok, the
Malaysian-Chinese entrepreneur, is marketing the first listed investment
fund targeted at Burma.
The fund, intended to attract Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) from institutional
investors, is the latest indication of the ending of the isolation of
Burma's repressive military regime.
South-east Asian countries have recently adopted a policy of 'constructive
engagement' with Burma. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, one of
the main foreign investors, visited in March with a group of businessmen.
Thailand has invited Burma to attend July's ministerial meeting of the
Association of South East Asian Nations.
The Myanmar Fund, using the name given to Burma by its government, will be
listed in Dublin. It is being established by Kerry Securities and managed by
Kerry Investment Management, both Hong Kong-based arms of the Kuok group. Mr
Jeremy Eakin, a London-based assistant director of Kerry Securities, said:
'It's really a venture capital fund. Burma is a blank sheet: there's nothing
there in the way of industry'.
Since Burma has no stock exchange, the fund will invest in joint ventures
and unquoted companies. It may also buy old Burmese debt issues and shares
in non-Burmese companies with direct exposure to Burma.
Mr Kuok has a wide range of Asian interests. He made his fortune in sugar
and other commodities, then expanded into hotels (including the Shangri-La
group), property and other sectors, especially in China, where his ventures
include Beijing's World Trade Centre, and in Hong Kong where he controls the
South China Morning Post.
The investments to be made by the fund are expected to reflect the interests
of the Kuok group. The fund is likely to put Dollars 20m into a business
park in a venture with the Burmese-Chinese Ho family, based in Thailand. Mr
Halpin Ho is a director of the fund and of a company advising its managers.
It will also invest in hotels and plantations. Tourism, telecommunications,
a deep-sea port and banks are other possible investment opportunities.
Mr John Jackson, campaigns director for the Burma Action Group, said it was
hard to invest in Burma without bolstering the military regime. 'The vast
majority of the economy is controlled by the military or their families. We
think it is very difficult to invest ethically.'
The junta, called the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), has
been seeking to open the country to foreign investment and has introduced
some reforms. But Mr Jackson said it had not loosened control sufficiently
to attract significant investment.
Slorc ignored the results of a 1990 general election won by the National
League for Democracy. It has held Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, NLD leader, under
house arrest since July 1989.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Israel ends Jericho border closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel yesterday ended the 24-hour closure of its border with the
Palestinian self-rule area in Jericho in the West Bank, imposed after
Palestinian police disarmed three Jewish settlers, Reuter reports.
The Israeli army said Israelis would be able to travel along the main Jordan
valley road through Jericho but would not be permitted to leave the main
road.
Israel said it close the border on Tuesday to allow Palestinian police
commanders to explain to their men the parameters of their authority.
Israel insists its peace deal with the PLO enables Jewish settlers to carry
licensed weapons in the self-rule areas of Jericho and the Gaza Strip.
Palestinians say Israelis coming to self-rule areas may not carry weapons.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Australian investment falls 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investment by Australian companies fell more than 5 per cent between the
December and March quarters of 1993/4, a decline which casts further doubts
over the optimistic assumptions on which the federal government has based
its 1994-95 budget calculations.
According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, real
private capital expenditure on equipment, plant and machinery dipped from
ADollars 4.195bn to ADollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2bn to Pounds 1.88bn), while
spending on buildings fell from ADollars 2.027bn to ADollars 1.984bn. The
corresponding figures for the March quarter of 1993 were ADollars 4.144bn
and ADollars 1.876bn respectively.
The figures are significant because the federal government is banking on a
substantial upturn in business investment to help boost economic growth to
about 4.5 per cent in 1994-95 fiscal year. It needs growth of this order to
generate extra tax revenues, to fund a number of welfare-related schemes,
most notably, an ambitious jobs programme designed to address Australia's
double-digit unemployment rate.
In his budget speech earlier this month, Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer,
forecast a 14.5 per cent increase in business investment during 1994-95,
after a predicted rise of 1 per cent in the current year.
This figure was in line with some private-sector expectations, but was at
the upper end of the forecasting range. The government's projections
immediately encountered scepticism from some employer groups, which felt
Australian companies were still seeking efficiency gains rather than new
capacity, and suggested that profit improvements among small and
medium-sized businesses are lagging those in large, quoted corporations.
Yesterday, Mr Willis defended the government's projections, saying overall
expectations for the year were unchanged, and that he expected the
'realisation ratio' (the ratio of actual investment to expected investment)
to increase. But analysts, who had been expecting a modest investment
pick-up in the March quarter, or a stable position at the least, were
surprised by the data.
'The fall in plant and equipment expenditure in the March quarter is
unexpected, puzzling and disappointing,' Mr Chris Caton, chief economist for
Bankers Trust Australia, commented.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the nation's largest
employer group, is to lodge a formal complaint with the International Labour
Organisation over new federal legislation on industrial relations next week.
The ACCI claims the law, passed at the end of last year and highly unpopular
among employers, breaches fundamental principles of collective bargaining
and does not allow companies to bargain freely with employees without being
impeded by compulsory arbitration and centralised awards.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Venezuelan currency value down sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, fell sharply after the
introduction of a new procedure for sales of foreign exchange by the central
bank. The new system narrowed the gap that had developed between the
official value of the currency and that on the parallel market.
Many bankers and economists said they believed the central bank had taken a
step in the right direction by abandoning the system of rationing sales of
dollars to banks and exchange houses. It could help to stabilise Venezuela's
jittery foreign exchange market.
A growing gap had emerged this month between the official rate set by the
previous auction system and the rate on the parallel market.
The central bank abandoned the limited auction system on Monday and dealers
started operating a 'Dutch auction' system, under which the central bank
sells foreign exchange to banks and exchange houses offering the highest
bids of the day. The new procedure sets no limits on resale margins and is
more responsive to market demands.
Yesterday, the central bank sold dollars to the banking system at rates
ranging from 169 to 182, for an average of 172.91 per dollar.
On Tuesday, Venezuelan commercial banks sold US dollars to corporate clients
and the public at rates varying from 165 to 185 bolivars to the dollar,
after purchasing dollars from the central bank at a maximum rate of 165 to
the dollar.
The average price at 29 commercial banks for buying dollars on Tuesday was
175.88:1, a 21 per cent devaluation in comparison to the previous day's
official dollar price, but a 4.4 per cent devaluation against Monday's price
on the parallel market.
In all of 1993, the bolivar lost 25 per cent of its value against the
dollar.
The central bank did not release any figures on the amounts of dollars sold
on Tuesday, but these were clearly higher than under the previous system,
which probably averaged about Dollars 35-40m per day, bankers estimated.
Mr Edgar Romero Nava, president of Fedecamaras, Venezuela's largest
commercial and industrial association, praised the central bank's new
procedure as 'more transparent' than its predecessor, but warned that it
will not work in isolation.
He said the government of President Rafael Caldera should also implement
'macroeconomic stabilisation measures' such as a sound fiscal policy,
privatisation of state-owned companies and a reform in the present system of
employee severance benefits, as well as improving purchasing power for the
public.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Chairman may be on way out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Lawyers for Democratic Congressman Dan Rostenkowski were reported yesterday
to have offered his resignation as House ways and means committee chairman
and, perhaps, even his acceptance of a short prison term in exchange for the
dropping of a multi-count federal indictment on expense account offences,
Jurek Martin reports.
It was far from clear whether a plea bargain acceptable to both sides could
be reached but Mr Rostenkowski's days as committee chairman seemed to be
numbered.
Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton conceded yesterday that his departure would be a
blow to the passage of healthcare reform by Congress this session, which the
powerful chairman is committed to achieve. But she remained confident that
an acceptable bill to guarantee universal medical insurance in the US would
emerge.
The charges against Mr Rostenkowski stem from, and seem to go beyond, the
House post office scandal unearthed three years ago. In spite of the
negotiations being conducted by his lawyers, he has repeatedly protested his
innocence.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's prime minister Mr Jean Chretien has added his voice to a rising
chorus of warnings about the risks Quebec faces if the francophone province
steps up its campaign for independence.
Mr Chretien has so far tried to steer clear of the separatist debate, but he
has been drawn into it by the separatists' strong performance in opinion
polls before a Quebec provincial election, due by year-end.
The Parti Quebecois, which has promised immediately to launch a loosening of
Quebec's ties with Ottawa if it wins the election, is well ahead of the
ruling Liberals in the polls.
The PQ's federal counterpart, the Bloc Quebecois, has lost no opportunity to
press the separatist cause outside Quebec. The BQ forms the official
opposition in the House of Commons in Ottawa.
Mr Chretien accused the separatists this week of hurting the economy by
sowing doubts in financial markets about Canada's political stability. The
prime minister said he was confident that Quebec people would vote to stay
in Canada if a referendum were held. The PQ plans to call one within a year
if it wins the forthcoming election.
Concern has grown in the federalist camp, however, that the risks of
separation are not being driven home forcefully enough to Quebec voters.
Mr Peter White, a business partner of publisher Mr Conrad Black and head of
the Council for Canadian Unity, warned in a newspaper commentary this week
that nationalist parties 'have already made tremendous strides in making
independence seem natural, inevitable and practically a fait accompli.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US orders for durable goods rose 0.1 per cent between March and April, less
than analysts expected, but the longer-term trend appeared consistent with
continued robust economic growth.
The increase in orders was the 11th consecutive monthly gain and followed a
revised 0.7 per cent increase in March. Orders were 10.4 per cent higher
than in April last year, before allowing for inflation of just under 3 per
cent.
Separate figures yesterday showed a small rise in sales of existing US homes
last month, to an annual rate of 4.12m against 4.07m in March.
The volatile transport sector accounted for much of the weakness in goods
orders last month. A decline in orders for motor vehicles and railway
equipment more than offset increased demand for aircraft. Excluding
transport, orders rose 0.6 per cent from March.
Analysts were divided over the figures, partly because they disagree on the
extent to which increases in short- and long-term interest rates are curbing
economic growth.
'Today's report adds to earlier evidence that the economy was already
slowing down,' said Mr Robert Barr, a senior economist at the US Chamber of
Commerce. The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates last week
'may not have been warranted,' he added.
Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the
underlying trend was strong and predicted US capital spending would remain
robust, partly because demand for US durable goods was now growing in
overseas markets.
The Fed would soon have to consider raising interest rates again, to prevent
growth putting upward pressure on inflation, he warned.
Many analysts expect figures for gross domestic product, due on Friday, to
show a modest downward revision in economic growth in the first quarter to
an annualised rate of just over 2 per cent, against a preliminary estimate
of 2.6 per cent.
But this is widely seen as underestimating the economy's underlying rate of
growth. Wall Street growth projections for the second quarter range from an
annual rate of 3.5 per cent to as much as 6 per cent.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Guatemala risks loss of loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Guatemalan government is facing a fiscal crisis and will probably fail
to meet conditions imposed by official creditors. This follows Congress
having resisted crucial draft legislation this month.
Congress failed to pass before the summer recess tax reforms which the
finance ministry hoped would offset sharp revenue losses this year and hold
the government's tax take at 8.5 per cent of GDP.
The reforms were to include stiffer sanctions for tax evaders, the abolition
of many value-added tax exemptions, and the introduction of a 2 per cent
capital tax.
The government may now fail to meet June 30 fiscal targets set by the
International Monetary Fund. That would lead to a freeze of a Dollars 35m
(Pounds 23m) financial sector loan from the Inter-American Development Bank
and of a Dollars 42m structural adjustment loan from the World Bank.
The tax reform package was also opposed by Guatemala's powerful private
sector, where it was claimed that the finance ministry was corrupt and
inefficient, and that improved tax collection was needed rather than reform.
Congress has also blocked approval of relatively soft terms agreed between
the government and Paris Club creditors last year, which must be ratified by
next Tuesday.
Congress is now in recess and is not due to return until after Congressional
elections, due to be held in August.
Ministers say they still hope for Congressional approval of the Paris Club
deal in an extra session, but this would require political bargaining.
The private sector has long regarded tax increases as anathema to its
interests, although Guatemala has one of the lowest taxation rates in the
western hemisphere.
Economists say that, if no changes are made, the tax take will drop below 7
per cent of GDP, widening the fiscal deficit and jeopardising much-needed
social investment.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Advance for Republicans in US poll

<TEXT>
Republican hopes for gains in the mid-term congressional elections in
November were sharply lifted late on Tuesday when the party captured in
Kentucky a House of Representatives seat that had voted Democratic for the
last 129 years.
In a special election caused by the death in March of Congressman William
Natcher, Mr Ron Lewis, a fundamentalist Christian minister, defeated Mr Joe
Prather, the Democratic candidate, by 55:45 per cent.
The House now holds 256 Democrats, 178 Republicans and one independent (Mr
Bernie Sanders of Vermont).
Last month, the Republicans picked up another traditional Democratic seat,
in Oklahoma, also a state bordering the south. With 11 incumbent Democrats
in the region having announced retirement, and with more than 40 House seats
to be vacated by incumbents of both parties nationwide, the prospects for
further Republican gains in November seem clear, perhaps beyond the 25-seat
advance hitherto considered realistic.
Particular factors applied this week in Kentucky's second district, not
least the absence of Mr Natcher, a fixture for the last 40 years who was
often returned unopposed.
Mr Natcher, a conservative Democrat by any standards, bucked the party trend
evident in his own district in presidential elections. In 1992, President
George Bush beat Mr Bill Clinton from neighbouring Arkansas in the district
by 45:41 per cent (Mr Ross Perot, the independent, took the rest); in 1988,
Mr Bush beat Mr Michael Dukakis there by 60:40.
Mr Lewis benefited, in a low voter turn-out, from strong organisation by the
religious right and Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 132,000) in funding, mostly for
media advertising, from the Republican national committee. Mr Prather ran a
low-key campaign.
The victor also scored heavily by explicitly identifying his opponent with
the policies and personality of President Clinton. One slogan ran: 'If you
like Bill Clinton, you'll love Joe Prather. Kentucky doesn't need another
professional politician.'
Special factors or not, Mr Clinton has presided over a series of worrying
Democratic defeats in elections since he won the presidency in November
1992. These include senate races in Georgia and Texas, gubernatorial
contests in New Jersey and Virginia, mayoral contests in Los Angeles and New
York, and two House seats in the last month.
Some of the president's policies have not gone down well in the south,
including his proposals to increase taxes on tobacco, a regional product.
Also, some of these electoral reverses have been partly brought about by
intense efforts by the religious right. These have been most effective in
its heartland of the south and the region's borders, and wherever voter
turn-out has been low and national attention elsewhere, and so do not
necessarily imply growing support for the Christian conservative agenda
nationwide.

The Greens in Germany are expected to achieve the best result of any of the
so-called 'protest' parties in the European election.
According to opinion polls, their support is standing at around 10 per cent,
but even their opponents expect they may do even better than that.
Ironically the party's revival in support, compared with their decline in
west Germany in the 1990 general election to under 5 per cent, comes at a
time when the party has switched from being hostile to European integration
to broadly sympathetic.
'We always had a programme which was critical of a centralised Europe and in
favour of a Europe of the regions,' says Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the former
1968 student revolutionary who is now one of the party's leading candidates
for the European parliament. 'Since the division of Germany was overcome, we
are faced with the choice of a revival of German nationalism or European
integration: there is no longer a choice. We must choose the latter.'
The party is now campaigning for Europe-wide environmental standards, and
wants the EU to put more stress on political integration and less on
economic integration.
In France the election campaign may prove the undoing of the French
ecologists.
The two main environmentalist parties - the radical Greens and the
mainstream Generation Ecologie - fell out so badly that they failed to agree
to field a common list of candidates. Infighting within the Greens became so
fierce that Mr Antoine Waechter, their veteran leader, dropped out of the
campaign.
Opinion polls show the two parties have minimal support.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France must be the only EU state where people have been passing around the
hat at some European election rallies to buy arms for a 'European' cause.
'So far we have got commitments of FFr20,000 (Pounds 2,331) to buy weapons
for the Moslems in Bosnia,' said a representative yesterday of 'Action for
Bosnia'. It has been raising funds at rallies of the 'Europe Begins at
Sarajevo' group which is expected to file its candidate list by tomorrow,
the closing date.
The campaign to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia has injected a note of
uncertainty into the election in France and, given France's leading
diplomatic and military role there, in the future course of western policy
in Bosnia.
The campaign has been mounted in the media with great skill by Mr
Bernard-Henri Levy, a left bank Paris intellectual who produced a film on
Bosnia for this month's Cannes festival and has since gathered 86 other
'potential' names to run on the 'Europe Begins at Sarajevo' ticket.
'Potential', because for the past two weeks, Mr Levy and his colleagues have
been saying that, if the mainstream parties adopt their arms-for-Bosnia
stance, they will withdraw their candidates.
These pressure tactics have had only limited impact on the joint government
list of the RPR gaullists and the UDF centre-right led by Mr Dominique
Baudis, mayor of Toulouse, but far more on the Socialist list led by Mr
Michel Rocard.
Fearing that Mr Levy could provide further competition for the left-wing
vote - in addition to that already provided by the radical list led by Mr
Bernard Tapie, the controversial Marseilles businessman and politician - the
socialist leader has tried to head him off. Lifting the arms embargo would
be 'recognising our failure (in Bosnia), but the only way of saving a bit of
honour,' said Mr Rocard. But this statement may have come too late to save
Mr Rocard votes.
Less surprising is the other issue dominating the election - employment,
which is already the national preoccupation in a country with a record 12.2
per cent jobless rate.
A poll in yesterday's Liberation newspaper showed that two-thirds of French
believe the EU's employment policy is not headed in the right direction. But
there has been little precise debate about the right direction for Europe,
partly perhaps because few French politicians dare espouse the labour market
reforms prescribed by the Delors white paper on European competitivity. They
have all seen the trouble Prime Minister Balladur ran into attempting too
overt a cut in the minimum wage for French youth.
The Euro-election debate has also been blunted by the fact that the joint
list of the RPR-UDF governing parties is a composite, ranging from
enthusiastic Europeans to all but the most die-hard opponents of the
Maastricht treaty, who themselves have formed the dissident 'Alternative
Europe' list under Mr Philippe de Villiers and Mr Jimmy Goldsmith, the
Anglo-French financier. To deny ammunition to the latter, Mr Baudis
carefully hides his federal faith and eschews any mention of Maastricht, or
indeed of Gatt, Mr Goldsmith's particular bete noire.
In the same vein, Mr Alain Lamassoure, the EU affairs minister who is one of
the few ministers to be doing much campaigning, is stressing the need for
subsidiarity within the EU, a rare area where the French and British
governments have something in common. Taking another leaf out of Britain's
book, he has also been using the campaign to try to set a series of
'Euro-scares' to rest by, for instance, emphasising that Brussels rules on
unpasteurised cheeses were drawn up at France's request so that its
'fromages a lait cru' could continue to be sold throughout Europe.
According to yesterday's poll, 47 per cent of French claim their vote on
June 12 will be determined by European issues while 41 per cent admit
national issues will dictate the way they cast their ballot. But the
election will still be very largely read as a preview of next May's
presidential contest.
It is less crucial for Mr Balladur, or his fellow gaullist rival, Mr Jacques
Chirac; neither are on the government list. But the stakes are high for Mr
Rocard, who is leading his party's list; if his list gains much less than 20
per cent, it may encourage some in his party to look for another to keep the
Socialist standard flying in the Elysee.

FT  26 MAY 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Europe's Greens expect a
patchy performance - The environmentalists' election prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In their own eyes, the Greens are the only political movement to have
penetrated every European country. But the elections for the European
parliament are likely to show that while they have established some
strongholds, in other countries they are facing near-extinction. The UK's
Green Party, in particular, knows that it will face a tough fight. In the
1989 elections it scored 15 per cent of the poll, the highest Green vote in
Europe, and pushed the Liberal-Social Democrat Alliance into third place.
But that success was due partly to special factors. The unpopularity of the
government at that point, the collapse of the Alliance, and the low
electoral turn-out helped. Green issues were also high in people's minds
after the 1986 Chernobyl explosion, the death of North Sea seals, and rising
concern about global warming following several hot summers.
Recession and a perception that some environmentalists have been too prone
to doom-mongering have since made the Greens' task harder. It is fielding 85
candidates for the forthcoming elections, contesting every seat. But the
Green Party won only 1.3 per cent in the 1992 general election, although
that had picked up to some 5 per cent in the local elections last month.
According to Mr Shane Collins, candidate for the very un-green London South
Inner constituency, urban areas have an additional problem. 'Most of our
natural voters are disenfranchised', he says - they have dropped off the
electoral register because they are homeless, or objected to the
now-abandoned poll tax.
But both he and Mr David Taylor, candidate for Somerset and North Devon,
where Greens came second last time, stress that one issue has been reviving
Green concerns: the government's roadbuilding programme. Protests against
the widening of the M25 road orbiting London, the extension of the M3
motorway through Twyford Down, and most recently, the Batheaston bypass at
Solsbury Hill near Bath have attracted supporters of all ages and social
backgrounds.
Despite this new stimulus, British Greens are labouring under a handicap not
suffered by their continental European colleagues: the UK's
first-past-the-post electoral system. Ms Penny Kemp, of the Green Party's
national executive, believes this is one reason why environmental enthusiasm
on the continent is a vigorous political force.
Although Greens won a smaller share of the vote on the continent in 1989
than they did in the UK, proportional representation allowed Greens from
seven of the 12 countries to secure 28 seats in the European Parliament.
The German Greens' support arose originally out of national fury over the
corrosion of German forests by acid rain. They were largely dismissed as a
fringe group of radicals after failing to retain seats in the Bundestag four
years ago. But their success in the early rounds of the German electoral
marathon shows that they pose a threat of replacing the Free Democrats as
the third force in German politics.
On March 20, in the Schleswig-Holstein local elections, their share of the
vote rose from 6 per cent to 10.3 per cent. The previous week in Lower
Saxony state elections, and in Hamburg city state elections last autumn,
they seized some 13 per cent of the vote.
The Italian Green movement, which gained prominence during the reign of Mr
Carlo Ripa di Meana as European environment commissioner, is also in buoyant
mood. It has seen a Green candidate elected as mayor of Rome, and has high
hopes for the European Parliament elections, for which Mr Ripa di Meana has
pledged his support.
Ms Kemp and others in the UK Green Party hope that these signs mean that
European Greens will win more than 40 seats in the parliament this year.
However they acknowledge that despite their best efforts, the UK
contribution may continue to be low.

FT  26 MAY 94 / MEPs 'should disclose interests'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European parliament's rules on disclosure of outside business interests
by MEPs is 'totally inadequate', Ms Pauline Green, leader of Britain's
Labour contingent at the Strasbourg assembly, said yesterday.
Ms Green, who is campaigning for re-election in the London North seat in
next month's poll, said the present system for registering MEPs' links in
areas like consultancy needed to be tightened.
Terming as 'extremely sparse' the information MEPs were obliged to give, she
said, 'It is an inefficient system. I feel we should provide much more
in-depth knowledge of members' interests.'
She coupled her recommendation with a call for EU member states to intensify
efforts to co-operate with the parliament.
Speaking at a conference in London organised by the European Business
Foundation, Ms Green said member governments were now recognising the
increased importance of the parliament in the EU legislative process.
'There's a huge amount to be done in bringing that together.'
Britain, in particular, had realised that working together with the
parliament was essential to maximise influence over European legislation, Ms
Green claimed, saying the UK government had 'suddenly become pro-active' in
its relations with the assembly.
Ms Green was speaking along with Sir Christopher Prout, the leader of the UK
Conservatives in Strasbourg, and Sir Russell Johnston, the Liberal
parliamentary spokesman on European affairs.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Questions on Europe: 'Tighter rules on lobbying needed'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Bennett, 45, is managing director of the London-based public affairs
company Beaumark, specialising in EU affairs. A former employee of the
European Commission and British Gas, he stood unsuccessfully for the Liberal
Social Democratic Alliance in the 1983 and 1987 UK elections and for the
European parliament in 1984.
The amount of influence over MEPs by industry lobbyists has attracted
concern. What changes are needed covering contacts between lobbyists and
MEPs or MEPs' staff? The rules on conduct of EU officials, MEPs and their
staff in relation to transfer of Commission documents and information need
to be tightened. Until the parliament agrees a method for the full
declaration of MEPs' outside business and consultancy interests, it will be
difficult to establish effective codes of practice for external lobbyists.
Can British MEPs set a lead in trying to bring about greater transparency?
The Westminster model of disclosure sets an appropriate standard for MEPs to
follow. British MEPs could take the initiative by introducing full
disclosure of their outside interests. This would reassure the British
electorate that they operate in a comparable way to their Westminster
counterparts. It might spur MEPs from other countries to follow suit.
How many lobbyists do you consider are active in Brussels and Strasbourg in
building relations with members of the European parliament? The best
estimate is 140 public affairs consultancies, 160 law firms, 572 trade
associations and professional associations and 58 regional and local
authorities. The Commission estimates that there are 3,000 interest groups
with links to EU institutions, employing 10,000 people.
What are the prospects for a code of practice? Twenty leading public affairs
companies, including Beaumark, are discussing a draft code of practice with
the Commission.
How rewarding is this business for European lobbyists? Typical annual
turnover of companies active in the EU public affairs field is Pounds
200,000 to Pounds 700,000. The leading company claims turnover of more than
Pounds 1m. Beaumark's this year will be Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 400,000.
Are you concerned that some lobbyists may gain access to information under
false pretences, for instance, by posing as journalists? Yes. There should
be clear separation between journalists covering the parliament and
lobbyists. Where there are doubts, the status of the 'journalist' concerned
should be reviewed.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday inaugurated construction in eastern Germany
of one of the region's most modern oil refineries which is backed by
Elf-Aquitaine, one of France's largest oil companies. The Leuna plant in
Saxony-Anhalt is being built by a consortium headed by Elf Aquitaine,
Rosneft, the state-owned Russian oil company, and Thyssen Handelsunion, a
subsidiary of Thyssen, the German steel group. The consortium is investing
more than DM4.3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in the plant which will take three years to
complete. The project nearly collapsed earlier this year after Elf decided
to sharply reduce its stake to a minority holding, causing considerable
embarrassment to Mr Kohl who had been persuaded by President Francois
Mitterrand to give Elf access to petrol distribution and refining in eastern
Germany. The project was salvaged after the Russians secured a stake at the
refinery.
Mr Kohl said the refinery represented 'a milestone for German-French
co-operation' and 'symbolises the thorough change in our relations with
Russia.'

unilateral lifting by the US of the arms embargo on Bosnia. He told the
graduating class at the US Naval Academy that 'we simply must not opt for
options and actions that sound simple and painless but which will not work
in this era of interdependence'. US unilateral action would 'kill the peace
process, sour our relationships with our European allies in Nato and the UN,
and undermine the partnership we are trying to build with Russia across a
whole range of areas'. UN embargoes 'that we like' against Iraq, Libya and
Haiti would also be undermined. Mr Clinton spoke on the day after the House
postponed until June 9 planned votes on the arms embargo similar to those
approved by the Senate earlier this month.

EU energy ministers failed yesterday to break the deadlock on plans to
deregulate electricity markets. Lack of agreement on new proposals for
opening electricity suppliers to competition dimmed hopes for a decision on
liberalisation later this year in spite of Germany's insistence that energy
will be a priority when it takes over the EU presidency in July. The main
obstacle yesterday in Brussels remained third party access - allowing
customers to buy electricity directly from any supplier able to provide it.
The Commission is backing a system of 'negotiated access' whereby
electricity users have to negotiate the use of national networks, rather
than having automatic access. However, with frustration at the lack of
progress mounting steadily, it also said it was willing to 'consider' a
French proposal for a so-called single purchaser system, under which one
body independent of the generator would be responsible for selling
electricity.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek drachma, bolstered by high interest rates, rose yesterday against
both the D-Mark and the dollar, but banks said the currency crisis was
causing a severe liquidity squeeze. It closed at Dr147.5 to the D-Mark, up
from Dr149 on Tuesday, and at Dr244.4 to the dollar, up from Dr245.1.
However, investor nervousness prompted a wave of selling yesterday on the
Athens stock exchange, fuelled by rumours that the government plans to issue
a one-month treasury bill with an interest rate of more than 30 per cent.
The index dropped by 5.5 per cent to a two-year low, bringing losses for the
week to around 10 per cent. Brokers said many investors were disposing of
mutual fund holdings in order to invest in short-term government paper.
Analysts said government efforts to defend the currency by raising
short-term interest rates to triple-digit figures had proved successful, but
only at the expense of stifling the banking system. The drachma has been
under pressure for the past 10 days, since the government decided to lift
capital controls. One banker said: 'It's a grim situation. The interbank
market is practically dead after 10 days of pressure and would-be borrowers
are being turned away.'

<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday opened an official inquiry into the French
government's plan for a FFr20bn (Pounds 2.3bn) capital injection into Air
France, the loss-making national carrier. Officials hope to reach a decision
on the restructuring plan by the end of July, mainly because of the
political sensitivity of the case. Yesterday's announcement means Brussels
has decided the capital injection amounts to state aid, but it has not yet
judged whether the restructuring plan violates competition rules. The next
step is for the Brussels authorities to examine whether the amount of aid is
justified on commercial grounds, and whether it could disrupt the market.
Officials will also attempt to clarify whether the rescue plan is the last
of its kind, rather than a means of funnelling money into the purchase of
stakes in other EU carriers. Observers predict approval for the state aid
plan, albeit with conditions.
The French government is to change Air France's legal status to make it
easier for the airline to offer shares to staff in return for voluntary pay
cuts, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister said yesterday. Mr
Christian Blanc, the airline's chairman, said that staff shareholdings in
the company could rise to between 15 and 20 per cent of the company's
capital, compared with just a few per cent at present.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Italian justice caught between two revolutions: How tensions
from the old regime are affecting the new one
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Umberto Bossi, rough-tongued leader of Italy's federalist Northern
League, never minces his words. Asked on Tuesday whether crusading
magistrates and their 'clean hands' corruption investigations were
responsible for changing Italy, he replied: 'Balls.'
Mr Bossi had just learned that his was the only well-known name from the new
political regime on a list of 32 people who will go on trial on July 5,
charged with breaking the law on the financing of political parties.
In another era - perhaps as recently as three or four years ago - any
ambitious Italian politician might have been pleased to find himself in the
company of those now up for trial. They include two former Italian prime
ministers (the Socialist Mr Bettino Craxi and Christian Democrat Mr Arnaldo
Forlani) three other ex-ministers and several well-known industrialists.
Mr Bossi - like his fellow accused - is fighting back. In an interview
published yesterday in La Stampa, the Turin daily, he accused the
magistrates of trying to hold up the 'revolution' started by his party, now
part of the new right-wing government.
The magistrates, however, claim that the formal decision on Tuesday to move
to a trial is further proof that they are determined to continue a different
'revolution' they began two to three years ago, by uncovering a powerful
network of bribery, corruption and organised crime.
Last Saturday, for example, Palermo magistrates requested a trial for Mr
Giulio Andreotti, the Christian Democrat who has seven times been prime
minister of Italy. He is accused of links with the mafia, which he
vehemently denies.
At least three investigations are also under way into businesses linked to
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister. Meanwhile, Ravenna magistrates are
examining documents taken last Friday from the Milan headquarters of
Mediobanca, the powerful merchant bank, after allegations that the bank did
not reveal all it knew about a 'hole' in the accounts of Ferruzzi-Montedison
before the industrial company collapsed last year.
However, although the work will continue, the high-profile style of Italy's
investigators may now be toned down. Mr Alfredo Biondi, Italy's new justice
minister, has already said that magistrates and judges should stick to their
job - applying the law - and steer clear of policy pronouncements.
Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief prosecutor, appears to agree,
although he would attack any proposal that smacked of increasing the
political control of judges and magistrates.
In an interview last week, he said he used to believe that magistrates
should always remain anonymous. 'But when this operation began, there were
such strong reactions (from the public) I wondered whether perhaps at this
point people wanted to know who we were,' he says. 'Were we archangels,
demons, or people like anyone else?'
Italians certainly know who the magistrates are now, and most of them think
they are on the side of the angels. The best-known example and most popular
is Mr Antonio Di Pietro, one of Mr Borrelli's elite team of investigators.
Currently in Los Angeles to deliver a series of lectures, he has been
greeted like a film star by Italian expatriates.
Mr Borrelli believes that the decision to open up to the public - partly
through carefully timed leaks to journalists about the most important
breakthroughs in investigations - built up the momentum of the 'clean hands'
investigation.
The momentum was maintained over the last few months by revelations during
the long-running trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial adviser to
Ferruzzi-Montedison. Much of the trial was televised, enhancing the image of
Mr Di Pietro, who acted as prosecutor. Mr Cusani was sentenced to eight
years in prison at the end of last month for corruption and falsifying
accounts in relation to the alleged payment of L150bn of bribes by
Ferruzzi-Montedison. Payment to political parties allegedly helped the group
extract itself from Enimont, its ill-fated joint venture with Eni, the state
energy and chemicals company, in 1990.
The trial which will begin on July 5 has sprung from testimony during the
Cusani trial. As an event, it is likely to attract even more public
attention. 'When great heads start to roll, il popolino (the common people)
are always enthusiastic,' Mr Borrelli points out.
The danger in such an approach is that it sets up a potential
'short-circuit', as Mr Borrelli puts it, between the piazza and the
magistrature, which is both undemocratic and unhealthy. Mr Borelli says such
a short-circuit has not yet occurred but he thinks now may be the right time
to recast the public image of the magistrates.
Partly that may be a tactical decision to avoid political interference.
Members of the new government have already launched into polemical debate
with the judiciary and magistrates. During the election campaign in March,
Mr Berlusconi was critical of the timing of certain investigative
'breakthroughs' by magistrates. Mr Bossi himself rails against persecution
of his party by the 'gang of four' Milan prosecutors.
Mr Borrelli says the investigators are counting on popular support to
maintain the impetus through many years of trials and appeals. The hope is
that people will also start to clean up the smallest cases of corruption
themselves. 'That process hasn't yet taken off,' says Mr Borrelli.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Concern for Bosnian Serbs
</HEADLINE>

   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 41 per cent of Bosnian Serbs live in territory controlled by their
self-proclaimed leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, according to a representative
of the Serb community in Sarajevo. Out of 1.3m Serbs in pre-war
Bosnia-Hercegovina, 600,000 had left the country since the war began, Mr
Goran Simic, president of the Sarajevo-based 'Serb citizens' council' told a
meeting yesterday at London's Institute for War and Peace. A further 100,000
had died, and 200,000 were still living 'under the legitimate Bosnian
government,' 70,000 of them in Sarajevo. The Serb citizens' council was
formed in Sarajevo last March at an assembly of 500 delegates from the
government-held area. Mr Simic said one of the main objectives of his
council was to lobby for amendment of the proposed Moslem-Croat federation
'to include the Serbs as a constituent people.' This proposition had been
well received by the Bosnian parliament, but the government had yet to
respond to it officially.

Poland expects to buy back around a fifth of its Dollars 13bn commercial
debt, according to Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the country's chief debt
negotiator. This is more than the 5 per cent of the debt mooted in talks
with banks for the buy-back operation earlier this year as the country looks
to reduce the stock of debt by as much as it can afford in order to clear
the way for bond issues abroad next year. A buy-back of 5 per cent of the
debt was considered when its price stood at around 50 cents to the dollar.
The current price is 38.5 cents. Mr Krowacki said yesterday he would know
exactly how much of the debt would be bought back once holders of the debt
had responded to Poland's proposal made last weekend to purchase the debt at
between 41 cents and 38 cents to the dollar. The operation is part of a debt
reduction framework agreement negotiated with the London Club of commercial
banks last March.

<TEXT>
Strong growth in domestic demand will cut the surplus on Denmark's current
account from DKr35bn (Pounds 3.6bn) - close to 4 per cent of gross domestic
product - in 1993 to around DKr12bn by 1996, according to a report by the
chairmen of the economic advisory council. They predict an increase in real
private consumption by 5 per cent annually this year and in each of the two
following years, while GDP is expected to increase by about 3 per cent a
year over the same period. The rise will cut the central government budget
deficit from DKr50bn this year to about DKr22bn by 1996 as tax revenues
recover, they forecast.
The report calls for reductions in the country's minimum wage levels and
'entry wages' for first-time employees as the best way to bring about a
lasting reduction in unemployment, currently running at 12.5 per cent. Mr
Mogens Lykketoft, finance minister, was quoted yesterday as saying that he
did not accept the argument. The report also attacked an ambitious
government job-sharing scheme, by which wage-earners can take six months off
on unemployment pay to care for children or undertake job-related education.
The scheme, so far temporary, will cost the equivalent on an extra 1.5
percentage points on the 25 per cent VAT if it is made permanent, the report
said.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Dutch trade surplus up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Netherlands' trade surplus surged to a provisional Fl 23.2bn (Pounds
8.3bn) last year from Fl 9.9bn in 1992, reflecting a rise of nearly 5 per
cent in the value of exports and a slight 0.7 per cent drop in imports. The
central statistical office cautioned, however, that the figures for the two
years are not entirely comparable. With the advent of the European single
market in January 1993, calculations of European imports and exports are now
based largely on figures supplied by the companies themselves, supplemented
by the office's own estimates. Officials said yesterday that even if the
1993 figure were revised later, it was likely to remain above Fl 20bn. As in
previous years, the country's biggest trading partners were Germany and
Belgium.
Inflation in the western German state of Hesse slowed to 0.1 per cent in the
month to mid-May from a 0.3 per cent month-on-month increase in April, the
state statistics office in Wiesbaden said yesterday.
Italy's overall balance of payments recorded a L202bn (Pounds 85m) deficit
in April after L2,290bn the previous month, the foreign exchange office
said. The Bank of Italy's official reserves fell to L91,488bn in April from
L91.957bn in March.
French household spending on durable manufactured goods rose by 1.2 per cent
in April following a rise of 0.6 per cent in March, the national statistics
office said.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Nato rejects Grachev call for new security order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, yesterday urged the
creation of a new European security order involving all European nations,
but Nato was quick to quash hopes it might agree to substantial change.
In a speech to his counterparts in Nato and eastern Europe, Gen Grachev
chided western nations for underestimating the scope of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe, a 52-member group which includes the
US, Canada, all European states and the former Soviet republics.
He called for the CSCE to be granted powers of 'permanent leadership and
co-ordination' over Nato, the European Union and the Commonwealth of
Independent States on security matters.
In response Nato's Deputy Secretary-General Sergio Balanzino said the
alliance would not conclude any formal agreement with Russia on special ties
demanded by Moscow and Russia could not have any right to interfere with
alliance decisions and action.
Nato wanted to build 'step by step' a close relationship with Russia, he
said, but was 'not ready or willing to give anybody a 'droit de regard' or
veto over its actions ..There will never be a clause or understanding
whereby Russia can interfere or have a say in Nato's life ..A formal
document ..is ruled out by the council.'
Gen Grachev had called for regular consultations between Russia and Nato on
'the whole spectrum of European and world security problems'. 'This
mechanism would be a practical step towards forming a viable system of
collective security and stability in Europe under the aegis of the CSCE.'
Diplomats said the appeal was a deft move to recapture the political
initiative and capitalise on euphoria created by Russia's promise to join
Nato's Partnership for Peace plan.
Nato is keen to encourage Russia to forge closer ties with the west after
recent disagreements over allied action in Bosnia and arms control, but it
wants to avoid suggestions of a privileged relationship which might harm the
interests of eastern European states.
Without withdrawing his pledge to join the programme, which calls for joint
exercises and exchange of knowhow, Gen Grachev said a much broader spectrum
of co-operation between Russia and Nato would be mapped out before Russia
signed up to PFP. This contradicted Nato's stress on the need for countries
to sign the PFP entry form first and elaborate details later. Some 18
countries have already joined the scheme.

FT  26 MAY 94 / German retail revival halts: Poor April figures end consumer
spending surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was good while it lasted, but the unexpected surge in west German
consumer spending which gave the economy a forceful boost in the first
quarter came to a sudden stop last month.
The HDE retailers' association yesterday tempered a report of a real 2 per
cent rise in sales during March with a warning that 'deep red' results for
April - not yet ready for release - would squash any hopes that springtime
had arrived in the shops sector. Department stores have calculated that real
sales tumbled 12 per cent last month.
The respected Ifo economics institute reported on Tuesday that its survey of
expectations showed a sharp change of mood among retailers in April after
several months of rising optimism. Order plans were being revised downwards
as prospects for the next six months dimmed and unsold stocks mounted.
On the same day, the federal authorities announced that new road vehicle
registrations in April crashed 24 per cent below March levels and were 16
per cent lower than in the same month last year after three months of
growth.
The effects of the winter buying spree are expected significantly to bolster
official first-quarter growth figures for west Germany, due in the next two
weeks.
In the interim, the Berlin-based DIW institute this week issued an estimate
that gross domestic product rose 1.9 per cent in the year to the end of
March. The forecast is only marginally higher than that of most private
economists. But DIW's analysis that domestic factors alone  - including
heavy private spending - were responsible for the growth is at odds with the
more general view that increasing exports are pulling the economy out of
recession.
Although DIW has developed a reputation for its individualistic views -
improving foreign trade remains the main hope of recovery in most analysts'
eyes - it was not alone in being caught off guard by the early surge in
private demand. The effects on economic performance will provide unexpected
and welcome underpinning for the government's forecast of 1.5 per cent
growth for the full year which has lately won increasing support from
initially sceptical independent economists.
However, events have not gone down so well in the Bundesbank. The monetary
disciplinarians in Frankfurt have been displeased by the sight of people
spending so freely while the economy - by their reckoning - has a long way
to go to overcome its structural problems.
Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank council, warned yesterday
that the vaunted 'special factors' were not the only explanation for
continuing rapid growth in money supply. Potential inflation was lurking
behind the distortions, he said, in an apparent reference to continued heavy
bank lending.
'It is reasonable to assume that a significant amount of spending has been
fuelled by borrowing,' says Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union
Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt. Saving has also dwindled. According to
DIW, spending on private consumption in the first quarter rose twice as fast
as disposable incomes. Mr Reid estimates the average proportion of
disposable income saved fell from 13.2 per cent in the last quarter of 1993
to 11.5 per cent in the first three months of this year.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Paris talks aim to defuse old central European rivalries

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Central Europe's underlying ethnic and cultural rivalries will be under the
spotlight in Paris today at a European Union-sponsored security conference.
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister whose 'Balladur plan'
inspired the 40-nation 'conference on European stability', will open
proceedings aimed at helping would-be EU members settle their unresolved
minority and other disputes before they become full EU members.
The conference, to be chaired by Greece as current president of the EU, is
expected to conclude with a general statement of principles on the need for
negotiated settlements of frontier and ethnic disputes. But the main
business will be conducted at two 'round tables'.
These will concentrate on the specific issues of the disputed Russian
military presence in Latvia and Estonia, rights of Russian-speaking
minorities in the Baltics, and the way in which minority issues affect
broader relations between states in central Europe.
There will be specific reference, for example, to the ethnic Hungarian
minorities in Romania and Slovakia.
Most central European states have shown lukewarm support for the conference,
preferring behind-the-scenes diplomacy and patient, unspectacular
bridge-building. The defeat of right-wing nationalists in the first round of
the Hungarian elections and the removal from power of Slovakia's nationalist
leader, Mr Vladimir Meciar, have already helped to calm relations between
Hungary and Slovakia.
Romania's search for economic stability and respectability has also helped
to cool passions in ethnically-mixed Transylvania.
Poland, with only tiny ethnic minorities left after the predations of Hitler
and geographical boundary shifts imposed by Stalin, has already concluded
bilateral treaties with all seven neighbouring states. The Czechs, while
slightly apprehensive about the growing demands for compensation from ethnic
Germans expelled from Sudetenland in 1945, suspect that raking over ethnic
issues in public is a diversion from removing the economic obstacles to EU
enlargement to the east.
The round tables are supposed to produce bilateral accords of 'good
neighbourliness' which would be endorsed in a concluding session of the
conference and then be registered with the permanent 52-nation Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
The EU has deliberately limited the conference's remit to potential EU
members - the six countries of central Europe, the three Baltic republics,
and Slovenia, the one peaceful fragment of ex-Yugoslavia - because it
expects the prospect of entry will spur these countries into good-neighbour
agreements.
But the conference's EU and French organisers have decided to steer clear of
the area of greatest ethnic tension - the Balkans - because the Yugoslav
imbroglio is being separately tackled by the United Nations and other
international mediators. It will also avoid any minority disputes within or
involving the Twelve.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Brussels points the finger at fiscal laggards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday pointed the finger at EU member states
which it considers are not doing enough to curb budget deficits and restrain
inflation.
Dropping its usual diplomatic language, the Commission singled out France
and Denmark for lax fiscal policy, along with more familiar laggards led by
Spain, Greece, Italy, and Portugal.
The UK, which has introduced record tax increases to curb a Pounds 50bn
budget deficit, escapes criticism on the fiscal side. But Mr John Major's
government receives an unwelcome warning from Brussels about the risks of
inflation.
The criticism appears in an update of the Commission's macroeconomic
guidelines which are intended to serve as a blueprint for the EU to the end
of the century and a framework for achieving a single currency.
Union heads of government approved the first version of the guidelines at
the Brussels summit last December. The latest paper has been adjusted to
take account of the economic recovery now under way in Europe.
Mr Henning Christophersen, the economics commissioner, stressed the
importance of reducing budget deficits. He expressed concern about the
recent rise in long-term interest rates in Europe and said measures should
be taken to reduce them so as not to harm the recovery. The Commission paper
calls for a 'clear confirmation' in member states' 1995 budgets that fiscal
consolidation is under way. It urged Belgium to match its budget targets,
and called on Spain, Portugal and Greece to embark on long-term budget
pruning.
The Commission also noted that in Denmark and France 'it is important to
ensure that the fiscal expansion is reversed as the economy gains momentum'.
On inflation rates, the Commission says Spain, Portugal, Italy and Britain
have yet to decline into the range set by the macroeconomic guidelines. Its
prediction that Italy and the UK 'are expected to approach it significantly
next year' may irritate Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer,
who has already clashed with Brussels over its lower growth forecast for the
UK.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Drachma rises but selling engulfs shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek drachma, bolstered by high interest rates, rose yesterday against
both the D-Mark and the dollar, but banks said the currency crisis was
causing a severe liquidity squeeze. It closed at Dr147.5 to the D-Mark, up
from Dr149 on Tuesday, and at Dr244.4 to the dollar, up from Dr245.1.
However, investor nervousness prompted a wave of selling yesterday on the
Athens stock exchange, fuelled by rumours that the government plans to issue
a one-month treasury bill with an interest rate of more than 30 per cent.
The index dropped by 5.5 per cent to a two-year low, bringing losses for the
week to around 10 per cent. Brokers said many investors were disposing of
mutual fund holdings in order to invest in short-term government paper.
Analysts said government efforts to defend the currency by raising
short-term interest rates to triple-digit figures had proved successful, but
only at the expense of stifling the banking system. The drachma has been
under constant pressure for the past 10 days, since the government decided
to lift capital controls.
Faced with a deepening liquidity crisis, banks have been raising interest
charges on working capital for corporate borrowers from around 23 per cent
to as much 40 per cent. One banker said: 'It's a grim situation. The
interbank market is practically dead after 10 days of pressure and would-be
borrowers are being turned away.'
The National Bank of Greece, the largest state-owned bank, which controls
over a third of total deposits, has started restricting withdrawals to 50
per cent of new deposits.
There is increasing speculation the government will be forced to raise
interest rates sharply on treasury bills, the main instrument for financing
the public sector deficit. A new issue is due next week, when the government
must raise an estimated Dr400bn (Pounds 1.06bn) to meet its debt
obligations.
Meanwhile, the finance ministry issued instructions to state corporations
and pension funds to transfer part of their deposits to the central bank.
The move appeared aimed at ensuring that the government will be able to
cover day-to-day spending needs.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Inflation warning on UK rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK interest rates will have to be raised by a full percentage point in the
coming months if inflation is to be kept below the government's target of 4
per cent, a leading economic research body warned yesterday.
Raising rates might be politically unwelcome for the government, but the new
climate of openness means that the Bank of England increasingly has the
upper hand in setting inflation policy, the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research says.
'(The government) has allowed a situation to develop in which it is
difficult for the bank's advice on interest rate moves to be rejected,' the
report adds, saying the bank is increasingly inclined to approve increases.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Bond and equity prices hit by concern over European rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond and equity prices across Europe fell heavily yesterday as markets
reached the unwelcome conclusion that a 20-month run of falling interest
rates had come to an end.
Prices fell sharply after the Bundesbank called off a planned auction of
four-year notes because of insufficient demand from bond market traders,
which followed warnings from the bank that further cuts in interest rates
were not planned.
At the same time, apprehension returned that the US Federal Reserve might
continue to tighten credit policy, despite having lifted its key interest
rates only last week.
In the UK, the FT-SE 100 Index plummeted in the afternoon as investors
flinched at the prospect of upward pressure on interest rates. It closed
68.4 points, or 2.21 per cent lower, at a 1994 low of 3,020.7.
The CAC-40 index in Paris fell 48.91, or 2.3 per cent, to 2,084.41, while
Frankfurt continued to pay for the recent relative strength of the market.
The Dax index fell 39.95, or 1.8 per cent, to 2,158.77.
Wall Street ignored the unsettled mood in Europe. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which tracked US bond prices throughout the session finished up
10.13 at 3,755.3 after a Treasury auction of new five-year notes was
completed successfully.
The downturn in Europe was touched off by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of
the Bundesbank, who had suggested on Monday that German interest rates might
be left unchanged. Market concerns over this statement were exacerbated
yesterday by a relatively small reduction in money rates at the bank's
weekly securities repurchase auction, used to inject short-term liquidity
into money markets.
The mood soured even more when the Bundesbank called off a planned auction
of four-year notes because of insufficient demand from bond market traders,
disappointed by the outcome of the repurchase auction.
'What happened today is an absolute embarrassment for the Bundesbank and it
has behaved in an amateurish way,' said one analyst in Frankfurt. In his
view, there had been enough demand in the market but the Bundesbank was not
willing to raise funds at the current high yields.
Prices for the June contract of the German government bond future on Liffe,
the London futures and options exchange, fell during trading to the year's
low of 93.3 but recovered slightly later to 93.54, down 0.7 of a point on
the day. The policy-making council of the Bundesbank is due to meet today
for its fortnightly discussion of monetary policy but the market does not
expect the central bank to announce a change in official interest rates.
UK government bonds traded near the year's lows, reaching 103 1/2 in late
trading, down  15/16 . Gilts were also depressed by a higher-than-expected
price realised at the Bank of England's auction of the government's first
convertible gilt since 1987.
In London, pressure on equity prices came from the stock index futures
market where the June contract on the FT-SE 100 fell below 3,000 to a hefty
discount against the stock market. A computer-driven sell-off in stock index
futures appeared to originate from a US securities house.
UK market strategists expressed highly bearish views at the close, pointing
out that the equity market chart forecasters see little support for shares
above the Footsie 2,550 level.
There was little response in London to the announcement that US durable
goods orders for April showed a gain of only 0.1 per cent, suggesting less
pressure for another rise in US interest rates. The dollar also came under
pressure yesterday, prompted by the weaker-than-expected durable goods
orders, closing in London at DM1.6447 against the D-Mark, a pfennig down on
the intra-day high of DM1.6545.
Concern over the signs of a change of official stance on German rates
increased after a Bundesbank council member warned of the 'inflation
potential' of the continued growth of German M3 money supply.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Camelot plans November start for UK lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot, winners of the licence to run the UK national lottery - the first
for more than 150 years - will today push ahead with plans to launch the
multi-billion-pound project in early November.
The consortium, whose members include Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drinks
group, and De La Rue, the bank note printer, forecast total sales of Pounds
32bn during the seven years of the licence and payments of Pounds 9bn to
good causes such as charity and the arts.
Camelot beat seven other groups to win the licence, including the
bookmakers' favourite, the UK Lottery Foundation, put together by Mr Richard
Branson and Lord Young, a former cabinet minister. Unlike the other bidders
Mr Branson, the Virgin chairman, was planning to give all profits to charity
and good causes.
Mr Peter Davis, national lottery director-general, who made the decision to
award the licence, said yesterday: 'Camelot was clearly the all-round best
applicant. I have no doubt about that. They were strong in every
department.'
The decision clearly angered Mr Branson, who said last night he would ask Mr
Davis for an explanation of his decision.
'We feel that he has not taken into account at all the market research that
shows that more people will buy more tickets if they know all the profits
will go to good causes,' Mr Branson said.
The Branson bid predicted total sales of Pounds 37bn over the licence period
with a contribution of Pounds 10.5bn to the government's good causes, which
apart from the arts and charities also include the national heritage, a new
millennium fund and sports. In addition Mr Branson believed a further Pounds
600m would have been raised for other charities of his choosing.
Although the national lottery office did not draw up a formal shortlist,
Camelot was hardest pressed by Lotco, a consortium put together by the Rank
Organisation. Mr Branson came next as a serious candidate, and the other
main contender was a consortium put together by Tattersalls, the Australian
lottery operator, and NM Rothschild.
The Branson bid and the promise to give all the profits away meant that many
of the other bidders had to reduce their profit levels.
It is believed the Camelot profit levels are well under 1 per cent of sales
and probably around 0.6 per cent.
Apart from Cadbury and De La Rue, Camelot includes Racal Electronics; the
computer group ICL; and G-Tech, a US group involved in 62 lotteries around
the world. The partners each have 22.5 per cent of the venture, apart from
ICL with 10 per cent. The lottery tickets will be sold in a wide range of
retail outlets, including post offices.
The selection of weekly jackpots, which could be between Pounds 3m and
Pounds 5m, will be broadcast live, probably on the BBC. Often jackpots will
be shared between two winners so that dozens of millionaires will be created
in the UK every year.
The government has decided that if no one picks the correct six numbers out
of 49 the jackpot can be rolled over but only for a maximum of three times,
ruling out the possibility of Pounds 100m lottery prizes on the American
scale.
Camelot will be having talks with Mr Davis to see whether a Pounds 15m cap
should be put on the top prize.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Pressure on government to accept pension law reform plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will come under pressure today from the Commons social
security committee to accept reforms of occupational pension law drawn up in
the wake of the Maxwell scandal.
The cross-party committee's report, published today, supports many of the
main recommendations of the Goode committee on pensions regulation which
ministers had hoped to water down.
Conservatives on the committee - in order to avoid the report being divided
along partisan lines - have accepted the key Goode recommendation that at
least a third of all scheme trustees be appointed by scheme members.
Ministers fear that if the proposal was implemented it could undermine
occupational pensions because management might question the value of such
schemes which did not have absolute control of the trustees.
Although the government, which is to publish its white paper later this
summer, favours a code of 'best practice', it will find it difficult not to
accept all of the committee's proposals.
The committee also supports Goode's recommendation that employers wishing to
reinvestcash from the schemes should first obtain permission from the
pensions regulator, even if their trust rules specifically permit them to do
so.
However, it argues that the government should alter the tax regime to
eradicate what is widely perceived to be a punitive tax for failing to
remove cash from schemes which are in surplus. It wants to scale down
significantly the tax penalties levied on employers with large cash
surpluses and calls for more equitable treatment for 'early leavers' who can
lose out on their final pension schemes because they have moved job.
The committee wants employers to use more generous means of calculating the
value of the final pension of those who change jobs before retirement. This
would help frequent job leavers to earn a pension equal in value to that of
a worker who stays with a single employer.
Professor Roy Goode identified the treatment of early leavers as the single
most divisive question considered by his committee.
The committee backs the need for a government appointed pensions regulator
and a pensions compensation scheme for fraud and suggests that it should
also cover losses on schemes.
Mr Jeremy Corbyn and Mr Jimmy Wray, two Labour members, voted against some
of the committee's recommendations but pulled back from issuing a minority
report after it backed most of Goode's proposals.

FT  26 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel to launch rights issue at big discount today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel is planning to launch its Pounds 850m rights issue this morning
at a price close to the minimum which would allow its vital Pounds 1.6bn
refinancing to take place.
The issue price is expected to be about 260p for each Eurotunnel unit. This
would be 27 per cent below yesterday's 355p closing market price in London,
a significant discount which reflects the uncertainties about the future
revenues of the Channel tunnel operator.
The expected price is only about 10p above the 250p floor that would permit
Eurotunnel to raise sufficient equity finance to cover its pressing
financial requirements. The company has authority to issue only 350m new
shares.
The rights issue will be Eurotunnel's biggest equity fund raising and one of
the biggest cash calls by a UK company.
Investment institutions have been reluctant to underwrite the share offer.
Their concern is that all earnings from the tunnel will be swallowed by
interest payments on about Pounds 8bn of debt until at least 1998 and there
will be no dividend until 2003.
Eurotunnel's financial advisers, SG Warburg and Banque Indosuez, were
yesterday able to begin getting commitments from institutions to underwrite
the shares after the company's 220 banks gave formal approval to their
Pounds 700m portion of the refinancing, more than a week after the deadline.
The banks are providing senior debt, or a loan which ranks ahead of all
existing facilities.
One fund manager said: 'Frankly, we were not keen to take the underwriting.
However, Warburg can be very persuasive.' Brokers said the underwriting
challenge was made more difficult by the sharp fall yesterday in the UK
stock market. However, the price of Eurotunnel units, an unusual security
twinning UK and French shares, fell only 5p to 355p.
A significant role in supporting the share issue was played by Swiss Banking
Corporation, which had agreed to provide primary underwriting for a third of
the whole share offer. It tried yesterday with SG Warburg and Banque
Indosuez to find sub-underwriters to reduce its exposure.
Without the refinancing, Eurotunnel faced a liquidity crisis, only four
years after it last came close to calling in the receivers. By next month,
it will have exhausted all its cash reserves.
The costs of completing the tunnel were well above original forecasts. Its
problems have been compounded by the late start of freight and passenger
services, which means revenues in early years of operation will be lower
than it had hoped.

FT  25 MAY 94 / New German President Herzog outside Schloss Bellevue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's outgoing President Richard von Weisacker with his successor, Roman
Herzog, and their wives outside the president's residence, Schloss Bellevue,
yesterday. The election of Mr Herzog, a Christian Democrat, sparked fresh
exchanges between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU and the Social Democrats
yesterday. SPD leader Rudolf Scharping struck an unusually shrill tone by
questioning the legitimacy of the electoral college vote because it ignored
opinion polls he said showed more popular support for the SPD's candidate,
Mr Johannes Rau. Kohl branded as hypocritical the SPD's criticism and
challenged the disappointed party either to accept the procedure or to
campaign to change it. He said the SPD were 'poor losers'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cementone shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Cementone fell 16p to 80p yesterday as Mr Alan Clements, chairman,
told the annual meeting that first half profits would be 'materially lower
than market expectations'.
The specialist paints and building chemicals maker came to the market in
January via a reverse takeover of Multitrust, the property investment
company. Its shares, which were placed at 73p, began trading ahead of
expectations at 87p.
Mr Clements said that intense margin pressure from competitors in
conjunction with promotional activities in both the paints and chemicals
market sectors had resulted in a continuing squeeze on margins.
Management had taken action, he said, which had already resulted in margin
and profitability improvements.
He was confident that normal levels of profitability would be restored in
the second half. For the year to December 31 1993 pre-tax profits were
Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 995,046).

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (10): From Graceland to the Smoky
Mountains - Snapshots of some of Tennessee's tourist attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is smaller than you expect: a 1930s copy of an old Southern mansion,
sitting behind iron gates on the outskirts of Memphis. A suburban home for a
successful doctor, perhaps - which is what it was for many years.
But Graceland looms large in the Elvis Presley myth. To the 22-year-old
country boy, it must have seemed the pinnacle of success. He paid Dollars
100,000 for it in 1957 and proceeded to do with it what you would expect of
a 22-year old with sudden wealth: build three television sets into a wall in
the basement and buy a pool table.
Anyone lured here by the tales of garishnesss - mirrors on the ceilings,
carpets on the walls - will be disappointed. These are familiar remnants of
1970s interior decor to anyone who lived through the era. Fans of kitsch
will get more fun across the road at the Elvis Presley car museum, with its
famous convertible pink Cadillac, or the Elvis Presley aircraft, named after
daughter Lisa Marie - or, better yet, just stop at the Elvis Presley
souvenir shops.
Graceland is an exercise in hagiography. But, strangely, there is no music.
Hushed tour parties are ushered around in a reverential silence. There is
also little at Graceland to remind visitors that the greatest career in rock
and roll history disintegrated into farce. There is just one sign, placed in
the glass cases alongside the 1970s sequinned jump suits: 'The image is one
thing, and the human being is another: it is very hard to live up to an
image.'
Nashville may like to call itself Music City USA, but Memphis can lay claim
to a musical history just as rich. It is the home of the blues, a musical
strain that grew up in the Mississippi delta in the 1930s and now one of the
city's biggest leisure industries.
Downtown Memphis, like many other US downtowns, has been subjected to a
succession of building sprees since the 1960s. Some relics remain - the
great pile of the Peabody Hotel, for example - but it takes great
imagination to conjure up the former cotton capital of the Mississippi.
Paddle steamers still navigate the broad sweep of the river, Memphis' most
distinctive feature. But the city is probably better known these days
through the books - and the films of books - of thriller writer John
Grisham, author of The Firm: a modern Southern city, with a giant glass
pyramid sitting surreally on the river banks.
The heart of the Memphis blues history nearly succumbed to the familiar
urban devastation of the 1960s. But Beale Street, the place where the
musical style was born, was given a last-minute reprieve from the
developers. Today, it is a low-rise isolated strip of bars, clubs and
souvenir shops which stands in stark contrast to the development that has
gone on all around. The blues and rock and roll from open doorways fight it
out on the street as bars compete for passers-by. This part of Memphis's
musical history is very much alive.
Old-style charm
The evening sunshine is slanting across the rolling hills of south-eastern
Tennessee. Hidden in the woods on the tops of these hills are more than a
score of large tin sheds, each one housing a mountain of oak casks of
whiskey. Yet you can't legally buy a drink here in Moore County.
The Jack Daniels distillery is Lynchburg's biggest - indeed, its only -
attraction. Its 'sourmash' whiskey - don't make the mistake of calling it
bourbon, it doesn't go down well - was first made here more than a hundred
years ago.
Not much has changed at the distillery, which prides itself on its old-style
Southern charm.
The history of Jack Daniels reads like a battle against the non-drinking
lobby. First, the distillery's Lynchburg saloon was closed, and in 1909
Tennessee got its first 'dry' law, before the rest of the US. The distillery
was packed up and moved to St Louis. The prohibition era did not shut down
the operation completely, but its output was kept in a bonded warehouse, and
made available only for 'medicinal' purposes. It was a good time to be
friends with a doctor.
There have always been ways of getting a drink of whiskey in the South. The
distillery's St Louis neighbours found a way in 1923: they fed a pipe
through into the adjoining warehouse and sucked out 42,800 gallons of the
stuff - replacing it with water, lest anyone should notice the barrels were
running empty.
Roger Brashears' porch is one place in Lynchburg where you can get a proper
drink. The head of marketing and publicity for the distillery, he lives
within a hundred yards of the site. Yet he drives to and from it in his
battered Ford pick-up truck. That's how you can tell a Southern boy, he says
 -only ever walks if it's to get in his pick-up.
Brashears is the embodiment of the Southern charm that Jack Daniels exerts
over its visitors: old-fashioned, laconic, warm. With his braces, his chain
smoking, his steady drawl, perhaps Brashears - and, indeed, the distillery
as a whole - is just a clever artifice constructed for tourists. But after a
glass of his 'sippin' whiskey', you're convinced he's the genuine article.
It doesn't cost anything to go on the tour of the distillery. Says
Brashears: 'We don't charge. But after you've been through here, you'll be
paying for the rest of your life.'
Bus-loads of sightseers
The desk clerk at the Opryland hotel advises you to drive round to another
entrance to get to your room. He takes out a map and writes instructions on
it, but you still manage to get lost.
The complex to the north of the city has become one of Nashville's
most-visited tourist attractions. At night, bus-loads of sightseers are
brought out from town to gawp at the hotel's fountains which, improbably,
dance to taped music. Walking back through the dense tropical undergrowth of
one of the hotel's giant glasshouses, you get stuck behind columns of ageing
sightseers. They are peering up into the trees trying to work out if the
bird songs they can hear are from real birds, or just more recordings. The
local youth population seems to have discovered that the artificial
sub-tropical glades are a good place to hang out.
The hotel - and Gaylord, the company that owns it - is riding high on the
success of country music. In the centre of Nashville, two new shrines to
music are nearing completion. The Ryman, a tabernacle pressed into service
as a country music hall in the middle years of the century, is finally being
fitted out properly for the purpose. The wooden floors and pews, and the
stained glass windows, remain: but this time it will have air conditioning.
Nearby, Gaylord is also putting the finishing touches to the Wildhorse Cafe
 -a restaurant with a wide stage and wooden dance floor. This will provide
more performance fodder for the cable television networks which the company
also runs. If Country proves more than a passing fad, the Wildhorse could
become the Hard Rock of the 1990s: it is a format that Dick Evans, Gaylord's
chief operating officer, hopes to spin out both around the US and
internationally.
A powerful memory
The resentment is still palpable in the foothills of the Great Smoky
Mountains in east Tennessee.
This has become the most-visited state park in the US.
But the displacement caused by its creation is still a powerful memory in
the communities that huddle outside the park gates.
Cades Cove - an enclosed valley deep in the park - supported a large
community in the 1930s. Then, buying up land piecemeal, the state gradually
emptied its wide pastures. Recent structures were knocked down. All that
remains now are the log cabins and white-plank churches of the pioneers who
first settled here, scattered among the woods.
The water-driven mill is being operated by an old man. He is a descendant of
the man who built this mill, and was taught how to run it when still a boy.
Now, in retirement, he is running it for tourists.
He won't offer a view about the fate that has befallen the valley. But the
woman at the door is more forthcoming. She went to school here in the 1930s
 -until the school was torn down and she, like everyone else, was forced
out.
She is still bitter - although it is better that the land has been turned
over to public use, rather than falling into private hands, she adds.
Sarah Ball's father is also a refugee from the park. He sold more than 100
acres and used the money to buy land in the foothills outside the park
gates, at Sevierville. An upright old man, he stops to tell you about it as
you sit on the porch of the Blue Mountain Mist Country Inn. Sarah and her
husband, Norman, have built the inn on part of that land. You can sit on its
porch and muse at the hills while bullfrogs complain in the pond below.
At the top of the mountains, on the border with North Carolina, a tower
rises above the tree-tops.
From here, you can gaze back on Tennessee - the steep slopes below giving
way to the green wrinkles of hills and, far away, scattered towns.
If it was only a little clearer, you feel, you could see clean across the
state to the Mississippi.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (9): First few steps abroad prove
costly, painful - Profile / Federal Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many years from now, the fortunes of Tennessee's biggest private sector
employer will be forged far away - in Europe, largely, and Asia. But if
future prosperity lies abroad, the first steps have been painful ones.
Over the past three years, Federal Express has lost about Dollars 1.2bn,
including restructuring charges, in its attempt to create a world-beating
international package delivery and air freight service. The losses are at
least getting smaller: Dollars 182m last year, on revenues of Dollars 2.1bn,
after a decision at the end of 1992 to cut back operations in Europe.
This year, says Mr Alan Graf, chief financial officer, the company's
international business will finally turn the corner, reaching break-even. In
the long run, he adds, the bulk of the company's profits is likely to come
from abroad.
What happens in the skies over far-off countries is of vital interest in
west Tennessee. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Federal
Express to the local economy. If there is one industry that dominates
Memphis, it is distribution. And if there is one company that dominates the
Memphis distribution industry, it is Federal Express.
The package delivery company's fast growth over the past two decades has
created many thousands of new jobs in the area directly - it now employs
20,000 people - and helped encourage many others to locate their businesses
in or around the city. A distributor based in Memphis can drop its goods off
at the Federal Express hub late in the evening and have them delivered
anywhere in the country by the next morning.
There were two factors that made Federal Express's initial foray into
international markets a disaster. One was its purchase of Flying Tigers, an
airfreight company, just as a slowdown in the worldwide economy hit the
airfreight business hard. 'We knew that the business would be subject to
cyclicality. It was a risk we took with our eyes open, and it cost us some
money,' says Mr Graf.
The second - and more costly - mistake was a misconceived attempt to
recreate in Europe the company's success in its home market. To that end,
Federal Express went about building an extensive network inside Europe - but
then failed to win enough volume to justify the costs.
'We had a belief that we could develop the same synergies and economies of
scale that we had in the US. (But) the size of the market is much smaller in
Europe,' says Mr Graf. Federal Express's meteoric rise in the US, from its
founding in 1972, owes much to the development of just-in-time manufacturing
techniques and new methods of inventory control: customers found it cheaper
to send or received small items from around the country by express mail,
rather than to keep them in stock.
The company bet on the same process sweeping Europe, and was proved wrong.
Also, Federal Express failed to break the strong hold on the European
package delivery business of a number of powerful rivals. 'One of the things
we had hoped for is that people would make a single-carrier choice,' using
the same carrier to ship a package inside Europe that they used to deliver
items to the US, says Mr Michael Glenn, senior vice-president in charge of
marketing and communications. That didn't happen.
The company has now scrapped the attempt to become a regional carrier in
Europe, contenting itself instead with operating a transatlantic service.
The break-through into profitability in the international businesses, when
it comes, will signal an important milestone in the company's history.
Founded in 1972, Federal Express has a dominant share of the overnight
parcel market in the US. Yet that business is getting steadily less
profitable.
For a start, much of the company's business is with big customers who are
able to negotiate large discounts. 'We have no control over pricing in the
US,' says Mr Graf.
A second problem is that many customers are turning away from the most
expensive, and therefore profitable, overnight priority service towards less
costly services.
The decline in margins is evident from the figures. The volume of packages
carried in the US leapt from 312m in 1991 to 406m in 1993 - yet over that
period, the proportion of priority overnight packages dropped from six out
of every 10 pieces carried to five out of every 10. Largely as a result, the
company's revenues in the US grew at a slower rate, from Dollars 5.1bn in
1991 to Dollars 5.7bn last year. Its operating income slid from Dollars 671m
to Dollars 559m.
For all that, the express package delivery business remains a strong growth
business in the US. 'It's difficult to find another business growing at the
same rate,' says Mr Graf.
The key for Federal Express is to bring down its costs for each package
shipped in line with its revenue-per-package - something it failed to do
last year. New technology is the answer. It will also have to avoid the sort
of costly mistakes it has made in the past.
According to Mr Glenn: 'E-mail could have an impact - how much, we don't
know.'
However, Federal Express claims to have already been through the worst,
reducing the pressure on it to respond. 'You can't fax hard goods,' says Mr
Glenn. 'The amount of goods that is still document-related and could be
transmitted another way is very small. We believe we have suffered
substantially all of the dilution already.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (7): A lucrative lift for Nashville -
Martin Dickson investigates the music industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A building surge is under way on Nashville's Music Row, the centre of
America's country music industry, as record companies invest millions of
dollars in new or expanded offices.
Los Angeles-based songwriters have begun checking out the Nashville housing
market because they are thinking of moving there from the West Coast. And in
downtown Nashville, work is under way on an entertainment complex which will
house a country music dance club-concert hall and a television production
centre.
All attest to the extraordinary growth of the past few years in the country
music industry, which is synonymous with Nashville and which is giving a
substantial lift to the Tennessee economy.
Country music's share of US record sales has soared from just 6.8 per cent
in 1989 to 17.5 per cent in 1993. Record revenues have leapt from Dollars
921m to Dollars 1.76bn.
In 1993 more than 41 per cent of the US population tuned their radios to
country stations, compared to 34.2 per cent just two years earlier. The
format has been making big gains outside its traditional base in the
American South.
Boosters in Nashville claim that country stations are now ranked number one
in the ratings in such unlikely northern markets as Seattle, Buffalo and
Baltimore.
Now the industry is making a push to conquer the world: Garth Brooks,
country music's most popular artist, has just been on a European tour, and
Europe's first full-time terrestrial country radio station is starting to
broadcast from London.
It is a lucrative sea-change for Nashville, since after a series of booms in
the 1950s and 1960s, country music became stuck in a rut in the early 1980s.
Dominated by middle-aged stars with a penchant for elaborate, old-fashioned
costumes, playing music with a synthetic, syrupy sound, it faced a downturn
in sales.
The turnround is due to two main forces. The first is a new breed of much
younger musicians with lots of sex appeal, carefully cultivated by the
record companies.
The men tend to be known collectively as 'new country hunks' or 'hat acts,'
because of the cowboy hats many of them favour. They dress in plain,
figure-hugging blue jeans.
Both male and female artists tend to sing songs with a much simpler, more
traditional sound, emphasising fiddles, guitars and a single voice. And
their lyrics have a more contemporary flavour.
For example, Garth Brooks, the biggest phenomenon to hit the industry in
decades, has tackled delicate subjects such as wife-beating and date rape.
Country has been helped by the sheer weakness and fractured nature of other
pop formats. Ageing baby boomers find it easier to relate to country - which
reminds them of early 1970s rock groups such as The Band and The Eagles -
than to rap, grunge or heavy metal.
The second important factor is the growth of cable television in the US,
bringing specialised country channels into homes across the nation, far
beyond the music's traditional heartland.
The Nashville Network, which began in 1983, reaches 60m US homes. It has a
magazine format, mixing music with programmes on other subjects which stir
the soul of rural America, such as bass fishing, pick-up trucks and drag
racing.
Its more recently established sister channel, Country Music Television (CMT)
is in almost 25m US cable homes, a 44 per cent increase in a year, and
reaches more than 38m homes worldwide. CMT broadcasts non-stop country music
pop videos.
Both channels are owned by Nashville-based Gaylord Entertainment, which has
become to country music what Walt Disney is to children's entertainment,
with interests ranging from theme parks to hotels.
At the heart of the Gaylord empire lies the Grand Ole Opry, a folksy country
show broadcast from Nashville ever since 1925. The Opry has played a crucial
role in commercialising country music - which stems from the folk ballads of
18th century immigrants to the Appalachian mountains - and in ensuring that
Nashville is the capital of the business.
The Opry House, where performances are held, is the centrepiece of Gaylord's
Opryland complex, which lies just outside Nashville.
This also includes a theme park revolving around country music and a vast
hotel, particularly popular for conventions, which features enormous
glass-enclosed gardens. Gaylord last year announced plans to spend Dollars
175m to add 979 rooms to the existing 1,891 and create another big glassed
area, called 'The Delta.'
The company is also busy in downtown Nashville. It is responsible for the
new dance hall entertainment complex and is also renovating the interior of
the Ryman Auditorium, a tourist spot which is revered as the home of the
Grand Ole Opry from 1943 to 1974.
The boom is thus having a substantial ripple effect on the wider Nashville
economy, helping the construction, hotel, restaurant and transport
industries.
Eastern Tennessee, for its part, benefits from the presence in the foothills
of the Great Smoky Mountains of Pigeon Forge, home of Dollywood, a 90-acre
theme park owned by the most famous female star of country music, Dolly
Parton.
However, one part of the country music surge has slipped beyond Tennessee's
borders: a thriving strip of music halls has grown up in Branson, Missouri,
a small town deep in the Ozark Mountains, which features old-time country
artists and other popular, middle-of-the-road entertainers.
Some critics argue that the rise of Branson is a rebuke to Nashville, which
should have been sufficiently entrepreneurial to see there was a gap in the
market for old-style acts. The Nashville establishment, for its part, tends
to dismiss Branson as being not genuinely 'country.'
The biggest question facing country is how long the boom can last and
whether it will be followed by a bust. Industry leaders are resigned to a
slowing of the growth rate, but many argue that country is unlikely to
suffer a precipitous decline in US popularity.
Country might also make inroads in overseas markets - although some
observers question whether Europeans will ever warm to such a sentimental,
quintessentially middle-American musical format.
Mr David Hall, general manager of TNN, points out that at the end of each
previous period of growth, industry revenues have remained higher than when
the craze first began, and he expects this long-term pattern to continue.
Whereas in the past the industry was reliant on radio stations to sell its
image, television is a much more powerful medium for keeping America sold on
country.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (8): Excessive brain power - Profile /
Oak Ridge High Technology Facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do you create a new Silicon Valley, or a Research Triangle - the area in
North Carolina circumscribed by three universities and home to many
high-tech companies? If there is an answer, then Tennessee would like to
know it.
The nurturing of high-technology industries has become a priority in the
area around Knoxville, in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. The
region boasts one of the highest concentrations of scientists in the
country. Keeping them employed will provide a stiff challenge in the years
to come.
The area's excessive brain power is centred on Oak Ridge. A Department of
Energy-funded facility operated by contractor Martin Marietta Energy
Systems, Oak Ridge will forever be known as the place where the first atomic
bomb was developed. It has developed skills other than building nuclear
weapons since then: but the ending of the cold war has hit the facility's
budget hard.
Along with pressure to generate new sources of income by commercialising its
technologies, this has forced Oak Ridge to try to turn itself into a centre
for innovation of a different sort, a sort of godfather to new high-tech
industries in and around east Tennessee.
Oak Ridge employs 16,000 people, on an annual budget from the Department of
Energy of Dollars 1.6bn - but is under pressure to cut back.
'Employment levels will drop. Budgets will drop,' says Mr Bill Martin,
vice-president in charge of technology transfer at Martin Marietta. How far
and how fast 'depends on how much private sector money becomes involved.'
In the 1980s, Oak Ridge lost several thousand jobs when its uranium
enrichment plant was closed. It was older and less efficient than similar
operations elsewhere in the US, and shut in the face of overcapacity in the
enrichment business.
The threat now is gradual erosion of the Department of Energy budget rather
than outright closure of facilities.
Oak Ridge's workers are split roughly evenly into three units. A third works
in the area of national security. Oak Ridge has not built an atomic warhead
for three years.
It is charged, though, with maintaining the US's supply of weapons-grade
uranium, and developing the sort of advanced manufacturing techniques used
in making warheads - from the latest machining and inspection technology to
robotics.
Those manufacturing skills, honed in a highly specialised area, are now
being applied to more mundane industries. Two years ago, Oak Ridge began a
project with the state of Tennessee to offer help to small businesses. Last
year, its people worked on 350 projects for private sector manufacturers.
Another third of the employees works on energy conservation and efficiency.
This began more than two decades ago with work on the peaceful use of
nuclear power, and extended into ways to make better and cleaner use of
fossil fuels. Oak Ridge also broadened out into energy conservation, working
on projects such as better insulation materials. Development work extends
from 'roof insulation to devices that enhance the running of refrigerators,'
says Bill Martin.
The final third are involved in environmental technologies. This is one part
of the Oak Ridge operations which has actually grown in the 1990s.
What can these people do to help foster high-tech industries in the region -
and in the process safeguard their own jobs? One aim has been to develop
patentable technologies that can be licensed to companies in the private
sector.
To encourage innovation among its staff, Oak Ridge shares a quarter of the
licensing income it receives with employees.
Since 1984, it has signed 103 such licensing agreements. The income remains
modest - a total of Dollars 2.5m in royalties so far, from commercial sales
of Dollars 100m - but there are some promising developments in the pipeline.
One example is a method for carrying out rapid blood tests, which has been
licensed to a Californian company. Already used to analyse samples from
animals, the process is awaiting approval for use on human blood, and could
eventually find a market in hospitals and doctors' surgeries throughout the
US.
From the wide range of technologies that has been developed at Oak Ridge,
Bill Martin singles out two as having the greatest potential:
instrumentation and advanced materials.
A second aim is to attract private investment to help commercialise
developments begun at Oak Ridge. So far, some Dollars 200m of private
capital has been committed.
The bigger question, though, remains: Can Oak Ridge foster a local high-tech
industry in east Tennessee? Optimists talk about a 'corridor' extending from
Oak Ridge to Knoxville, home of the University of Tennessee - no doubt
hoping to emulate the successful Austin-San Antonio high-tech corridor in
Texas. Much work needs to be done before their dream becomes a reality.
Local chambers of commerce, industrial development boards and marketing
organisations have recently begun research into whether the region has
sufficient infrastructure to sustain a thriving manufacturing base - from
the availability of skilled workers and adequate telephone lines to the
provision of finance. The results will not emerge until this summer.
One significant challenge is to make the staff at Oak Ridge more responsive
to the outside world. The nature of much of their work in the past, and
their location - tucked away in a valley 30 miles from Knoxville - has
encouraged an inward-looking, isolated community.
'There is a tremendous amount of resources in the area,' says Mr Martin.
'Has the region benefited enough from that? No.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (8): EU helps out with 'cohesion' cash -
John McManus looks at investment in transport and developments in the
tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than IPounds 3.5bn will be spent on Ireland's transport infrastructure
and tourism industry over the next five years under the Irish government's
IPounds 20bn National Development Plan.
The money will come from the government, the private sector, and the
European Union which has promised in the region of IPounds 7bn under the
next tranche of cohesion funds.
The first objective of the IPounds 2.6bn investment in transport
infrastructure is to bring Ireland's roads, railways, ports and airports up
to the same standard as its EU partners'.
The main target is the national primary road network, which takes a quarter
of all Irish road traffic. More than IPounds 1.1bn will go to improve the
road links between the important cities, including the road from Dublin to
Belfast.
Spending on secondary and local roads will be much less significant: IPounds
115m will be spent on secondary roads and IPounds 475m on local roads. As a
result, the motorist in Ireland can expect little respite from the potholes
on the smaller rural roads and lanes. (They have become an election issue in
some counties.)
The rolling stock of Iarnrod Eireann, the state railway company, is to be
upgraded, as are the tracks and signal systems on the parts of the Irish
rail network which are included in the EU's Trans European Rail Network -
mainly the links between Dublin and the larger cities and towns.
With the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Ireland is now the only state in the
EU without a direct rail link to the continent. The Irish government has
promised to invest IPounds 100m upgrading strategic ports, including Dublin
and its satellite port of Dun Laoghaire.
No aid is available for improving ferries serving the routes between Ireland
and its EU partners, but the two main ferry companies, Stena Sealink and
Irish Continental Group, have announced ambitious ship building programmes.
In Tasmania, Stena Sealink is constructing one of the world's largest car
carrying catamaran ferries for use on the Irish sea this summer. The new
super-ferry will replace the existing Stena Sea Lynx catamaran service
between Dublin and the Welsh port of Holyhead. It will have capacity for 120
cars and 600 passengers, travel at 50 miles an hour, and Stena promises that
it will cut the sea crossing time by half, to 99 minutes.
Irish Continental has acquired one the the world's largest night ferries,
the IPounds 56m Pride of Bilbao, for use on the routes from Rosslare, in Co
Wexford, to northern France. The company has also commissioned a IPounds 46m
ferry for use on the Dublin-Holyhead route next year, with an option for a
second. The new Dublin-Holyhead ferry will triple the group's freight
capacity on the route, allowing it to cut costs and - according to Mr Eamonn
Rothwell, chief executive of Irish Continental - attract a substantial
amount of the traffic, originating in the Republic, which now exits via the
Northern Irish port of Larne.
A IPounds 340m investment is proposed in the state's airports under the
plan, on top of the IPounds 175m in state aid to the national carrier, Aer
Lingus, which was approved by the EU last December. The money is to meet the
cost of a big restructuring at the airline, which lost IPounds 56m last
year. Aer Lingus has agreed to cut its costs by IPounds 50m and has obtained
permission from the Irish government to fly direct from Dublin to cities in
the US, avoiding the compulsory stop-over at Shannon airport in Co Clare,
for the first time. Aer Lingus has also leased three new Airbus 330 aircraft
for use on the transatlantic routes.
The last 12 months have seen two new airlines enter the fiercely competitive
Dublin to London route. Virgin Atlantic's City Jet - an Irish company
operating a Virgin Atlantic franchise - started flying from Dublin to London
City Airport in January. British Airways Express - a UK company operating a
British Airways franchise - started flying from Dublin to Gatwick last year.
The three airlines already on the route - Aer Lingus, British Midland and
the small independent Ryanair - have all cut fares and cost as competition
intensifies. Aer Lingus's share of the route has fallen from 49 per cent to
39 per cent; a big shake-out is planned.
In a country with more than 16 per cent of its workforce on the dole, most
aspects of the economy are ultimately evaluated in terms of their ability to
create jobs. Ireland's tourism industry is no exception.
The IPounds 1bn investment in tourism over the next five years is expected
to create 35,000 jobs. Mr Matt McNulty, director general of Bord Failte, the
Irish tourist board, believes that it is a realistic aspiration. Five years
ago the board was set the target of doubling tourism revenue from just over
IPounds 1bn and creating 25,000 jobs by the end of 1993. 'Revenue is up 74
per cent and 24,000 jobs have been created, despite the Gulf war and
recession in our main markets,' Mr McNulty says.
Mr McNulty believes that tourism can create jobs more effectively than other
sectors of the economy; he points out that 75 per cent of the net job gains
in Ireland over the past five years have come from tourism. Bord Failte
estimates that the more than 3m tourists visiting Ireland each year spend
about IPounds 1.8bn.
The emphasis over the next five years will be to create 'sustainable tourism
and sustainable jobs' through an intensification of the board's
international marketing effort and extension of the the tourism season.
Ireland's tourist season is only 23 weeks, but the board believes it can be
stretched to 46 weeks by development of off-season 'products' and the
creation of year-round attractions.
More than 30 per cent of the IPounds 580m worth of EU cohesion funding hoped
for by the Irish government for tourism will be spent on international
marketing over the next five years. 'We have not fully exploited any market
 -particularly Germany, which is the world's biggest,' explains Mr McNulty.
Together with the traditional markets of the US, UK and continental Europe,
Bord Failte plans to aim at new markets. Two countries seen as having large
potential are Argentina and South Africa, both of which have strong Irish
connections.
The board's strategy is not to go for 'ethnic' tourism, but to target
countries where Ireland is well known to the whole population because there
is an Irish community there, Mr McNulty explains.
The UK is still a very important market for Ireland; visitors from Britain
made up 1.7m of more than 3m people who visited Ireland last year. The next
biggest markets are continental Europe, with 874,000 visitors, and North
America, with 417,000 visitors.
About IPounds 300,000 will be spent on projects to extend the tourist
season. The rest of the IPounds 1bn will be spent on training, a national
conference centre and other projects.
Mr McNulty believes that initiatives for projects to extend the length of
the tourist season must come from the private sector. 'If we create
something ourselves it is not likely to be sustainable,' he says. 'We have
to let things develop naturally and support them through marketing or grant
aid.' (Citing horse fairs, he points out that there have been many attempts
to develop international horse fairs in Ireland, none of which have been as
successful as the centuries-old horse fair at Ballinasloe in Co Galway, in
the west of Ireland.)
A good example of the type of investment that the board is trying to
encourage is a project to revive a woollen mill at Foxford in Co Mayo, in
the west of Ireland. The mill has been converted into a 'sheep to shop'
experience for tourists, Mr McNulty says. This sort of project is an
integral part of the role he sees for Bord Failte as 'Ireland's economic
agency for tourism.'
There is no doubting his enthusiasm for such projects. With something of the
manner of a proud father, he cannot resist showing visitors to his office in
Dublin an album of before-and-after shots of projects. He feels that he has
a right to be proud: only one of the 300 projects funded in the last five
years has failed - 'and we got nearly all our money back.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (9): Trees planted for the future - Tim
Coone investigates the renaissance of an ancient industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ancient oak forests once covered much of Ireland. Over the centuries they
were gradually laid bare to serve the economic and military ambitions of the
Vikings, then the Normans, and later, to build the British battle fleets of
Tudor, Stuart and Hanoverian kings and queens.
Land that once grew Irish oak - which helped to spread the British empire
from Jamaica to Jaipur - now grows cattle and sheep to build beef and butter
mountains in the EU. Today there is no natural forest left in Ireland.
Moreover, only 7 per cent of the country's land surface is afforested,
compared with an average 24 per cent in the EU.
But Irish forestry is now undergoing a renaissance, thanks to the overhaul
of the EU common agricultural policy, a range of new financial incentives
and a commitment by the Irish government to a big afforestation programme.
Together, these have helped forest plantings grow to some 22,000 hectares a
year. A target of 30,000 hectares a year has been set for the year 2000.
'Forestry will be a mainstream industry here within 30 years with an output
of over IPounds 1bn a year at today's prices,' says Mr Martin Lowery, chief
executive of Coillte, the Irish forestry board.
Encouraged by tax-free grants and incentives, private plantings have grown
30-fold in the past decade, from fewer than 300 hectares a year in the early
1980s to more than 10,000 hectares a year at present.
Proposals to increase the grants by about 50 per cent, with the maximum
levels at IPounds 3,000 per hectare, are currently awaiting approval in
Brussels. In total, some IPounds 40m a year in grants is expected to be
channelled to the forestry sector up to the end of the decade. In addition,
all income from forestry activities has been rated free of corporation and
income tax.
The existing 450,000 hectares of forest in Ireland, 85 per cent of it
conifers, has mostly been planted since the early 1950s; it is only just
beginning to mature. Current output of 2m cubic metres of timber a year is
projected to rise to about 3.5m cubic metres by the end of the decade and
will continue to rise thereafter.
In the longer term, if current planting rates are maintained over the next
20 to 30 years, Mr Lowery believes that a sustainable yield of 12m cubic
metres a year is feasible from a total planted area of 1.5m hectares which
have been identified as being the most suitable for forestry. This would
exceed the UK's current output of some 10m cubic metres a year.
'Forestry is a far better use of EU funds than set-aside payments, because
at least there is a new industry being built up,' Mr Lowery says.
Currently, there are two important industrial developments in preparation,
both of which will once again place Ireland on the map as an exporter of
forest products.
Medite, the US company, is investing IPounds 21m to double output from its
existing plant making medium density fibreboard (MDF). It aims to produce
300,000 cubic metres of MDF a year, using forest thinnings and by-products
from the country's 100 saw-mills as raw material.
Louisiana Pacific Corporation, also of the US, is due to start a joint
venture later this year with Coillte to build an oriented strand board plant
to export to Europe. Together, the two plants located in the Waterford
region of Ireland are expected to absorb most of the residues and pulp wood
coming from the newly-maturing Irish forests up to the end of the decade.
Beyond then, additional processing capacity will be required as well as
additional saw-mills.
But can planting levels reach the government's 30,000 hectare-a-year target?
Mr Lowery admits that obtaining sufficient land is becoming a problem.
Spiralling land prices 'is going to make it difficult,' he says.
Ms Elaine Farrell, head of the forestry division in the Irish Farmers'
Association, says that poor land is currently being sold for forestry in a
range of IPounds 900 to IPounds 2,000 a hectare, and that many farmers are
now finding it difficult to compete with outside investors. More than
three-quarters of private forest plantings are currently done by farmers.
Mr Lowery says that Coillte aims to pay no more than IPounds 1,700 a hectare
for the very best forestry land, and in 1992 paid an average of IPounds
1,313 a hectare. Land prices have risen more than 30 per cent since 1990,
almost three times faster than the general inflation rate.
Mr George O'Malley, managing director of Beltra Forestry, a private company
which plants more than 1,000 hectares a year and manages plantations for
private clients, says the tax incentives and grants available make forestry
investment 'very attractive as long as the cost of the land is not too
high'.
The growing competition for land, however, is resulting in available sites
now more likely to be in parcels of 'hundreds rather than thousands of
acres,' he says.
Meanwhile, opposition is growing from another quarter. Environmentalist
groups are becoming increasingly vocal over the steady encroachment of
sombre blocks of Sitka spruce on the Irish countryside, and are demanding
that a greater variety of tree species be planted and that planning controls
be introduced for new plantations.
The government has responded predictably (by setting up a a committee to
consider the issues), but has signalled that new legislation will probably -
eventually - follow.
Mr Lowery says that Coillte's aim is to reduce Sitka spruce plantings from
just over 80 per cent at present down to 65 per cent, and to increase native
broadleaf species such as oak and beech to around 10 per cent.
Four years ago it began landscaping new plantations. But the
species-diversity problem is that Sitka grows better than any other tree on
low-quality soils, and in Ireland's damp, temperate climate at rates five to
six times faster than in Scandinavia or North America, and at about double
the rate of growth in the UK.
Better quality conifer trees and hardwoods, suitable for joinery and
sawlogs, require better soils, and the best agricultural land can now cost
over IPounds 6,000 a hectare.
The higher grants will undoubtedly have the desired effect of encouraging
increased plantings and greater species diversity, but the danger is that
they might also drive land prices higher still and ultimately dampen
investor enthusiasm in the sector.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (10): Investors get good terms - Angela
Long at the movies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To call the whole country 'Paddywood' is stretching language, but over the
past year there has been a mini-boom in film production in Ireland.
In April some 12 films were in production. Six more were about to start
filming. A London newspaper went slightly wild recently, predicting that
Ireland could become Europe's main site for film production.
Mr Michael Dwyer, film critic of the Irish Times, points out that ever since
1928, when Alfred Hitchcock made Juno and the Paycock in Dublin, Ireland's
rapidly changing light and slowly changing landscape have been irresistible
to directors seeking not just nostalgia but authenticity. What is more, the
1993 Finance Act gives a three-year tax relief on whatever proportion of a
film's investment is Irish, up to IPounds 1m. More recently, the government
has again tinkered with financial incentives, while insisting that share
capital with a minimum three-year payback should be the baseline source of
funds.
Companies such as Farrell Grant Sparks, Dublin accountants (FGS), have taken
advantage of the favourable terms for film investment. FGS has set up a film
production company, which raised IPounds 2m within two weeks. Mr Richard Fox
of FGS says the company, which 'met investor demand for a tax shelter before
the year-end cut-off for individuals on April 5', is now looking for a
project. 'I'd say that, judging by the success of this venture, we would
look at similar ones in the future.'
Internationally, Irish films have a high profile at present, following
American interest in In the Name of the Father, directed by Jim Sheridan,
and last year's Crying Game by Neil Jordan. The prominence of Daniel Day
Lewis, who also starred in Sheridan's previous big success, My Left Foot,
has also called attention to the Irish product.
It should be no surprise if the Irish were to make a success of the film
industry, at least at the creative level. Their seanachai (storytellers) of
old possessed the wild imagination and verbal creativity which later
surfaced in the work of Swift, Beckett and Joyce. Today Ireland is top in
the whole of western Europe for per capita cinema attendance.
In Dublin, the Irish Film Centre, with smart premises in a former Quaker
meeting house in Eustace Street, in the centre of town, attracted 16,000
members in 1993, its first full year of operation. Squabbles about
management and financing spoil its image slightly, but, with several film
development and production companies located in its premises, the IFC
provides an attractive focus for the film buff in the national capital.
So far, most films for main release made in Ireland have tended to be modest
in budget compared to the big spending on Jurassic Park and its lavishly
produced kindred. Yet the success of, for example, Into the West, made by
Dubliner Gabriel Byrne, has shown that there is a market for the 'small'
picture.
'The Irish industry is never going to make Terminator 3, but our films will
always be story-driven - smaller films costing IPounds 3m to IPounds 5m,'
says Mr James Flynn, submissions manager at the Irish Film Board, based in
Galway.
The film board (Bord Scannan in Gaelic) has been receiving about 30 formal
applications for funding each month since it was revived in 1992. This, says
Mr Flynn, is on top of less formal approaches from a wide range of
film-makers.
The government has also been launching initiatives to create the right sort
of skilled labour for film production. Mr Michael Higgins, minister for
arts, announced a 'comprehensive training programme for the film industry'
last October. His department was looking for EU structural funds to assist
the programme, which he said aimed to raise standards in the complete range
of film skills.
While the future for features looks rosy (provided they get a better
critical reception than the recently-released Widow's Peak - despite the
talents of Mia Farrow, Jim Broadbent and Natasha Richardson), the animation
sector has not lived up to its promise of five years ago. After An American
Tail, a charming full-length feature which failed to ignite the box office
in the Aladdin mode, the animation company mainly responsible, Sullivan
Bluth, went bankrupt. The shell of the company was subsequently salvaged by
overseas investment.
Fred Wolf Animation, the Los Angeles based company responsible for the
invasion of the teenage mutant Ninja turtles, has had a Dublin studio since
1989. Most recently, it did all pre- and post-production of the 11-part
television version of the Duchess of York's Budgie the Little Helicopter, to
be seen on ITV.
Mr Eamonn Lawless, Wolf's managing director in Dublin, heads a full-time
staff of 16. 'We are feeling very optimistic, but things are relatively slow
in the industry overall,' he says. 'For full-length features, Dublin would
be a good location because labour and production costs are lower than in the
US.'
But stiff competition from Asia, where labour costs are even lower, is
growing.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (5): An upbeat identity can help -
Inward investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seated in a Shanghai airport lounge not long ago, Mr Allen Neel, Tennessee's
deputy commissioner for economic and community development, could hardly
believe his ears. Country and western music was playing over the piped music
system.
To Mr Neel, this not only proved the worldwide appeal of Tennessee's
best-known export, but it also meant that the chore of marketing Tennessee
to international investors could get a lot easier. After all, he had a state
with an identity: the home of country music.
Amid the clamour of US states seeking investors, a state with an upbeat
musical identity seems to have a helpful advantage. At least it is a
conversation opener. But Tennessee has largely staked its fortunes on other
more solid, un-glitzy attractions: low wages, a central US location, tax
incentives, a modest cost of living and a pro-business, anti-union climate.
Such allures have been sufficient to draw Dollars 12.4bn worth of investment
in just the past five years - more than a quarter of which, Dollars 3.6bn,
was foreign. And, over the past decade or so as the motor industry has moved
increasingly into the US south-east, Tennessee has netted a very sizeable
chunk. Japan's Nissan and General Motors' Saturn chose Tennessee and many of
their suppliers are spread around the state.
'Ten years ago, there wasn't a single auto made in Tennessee,' said Mr Billy
Stair, a top aide to Governor Ned McWherter. 'Today, Tennessee ranks third
(among US states) in autos.'
If state officials have their way, Tennessee will further expand its
automotive investment by capturing suppliers for the plants of BMW and
Mercedes in, respectively, nearby western South Carolina and northern
Alabama. To potential European and other suppliers of BMW and Mercedes,
officials are emphasising that Tennessee is within one day's drive of every
big auto manufacturing plant in the US.
This is part of a larger campaign to attract foreign investment. In an
effort to capitalise on its new direct air link between Tennessee and
London, the state began in April to market itself to more than 100 countries
with a commercial on CNN International.
Yet Tennessee has had two key concerns about its industrial recruitment. It
wants to keep its economy diversified, and it wants to spread the prosperity
that comes from more investment to poorer regions of the state. For
diversification, Tennessee is looking for a variety of non-auto investments,
particularly in high technology. With a substantial scientific community -
largely related to defence work - around Knoxville, Tennessee can offer
brain power.
In the past year, it has created a Science and Technology Council, with the
participation of top defence contractor Martin Marietta, to develop a
strategy about where the state should go in high technology.
It is also in the process 'of thinking through where we are going in
telecommunications,' according to Mr Neel. The state installed an extensive
fibre optic network largely to serve its more sophisticated manufacturers.
But it has yet to determine how best to take advantage of its improved
telecoms ability.
If the state's economic strategy doesn't seem to have caught up with its
potential, this is in part because fast-paced economic progress in Tennessee
is of recent vintage. Only since the arrival of important car industry
investment in the 1980s has Tennessee pulled away from the South's
traditionally languid growth rate.
Between 1982 and 1991, it had long-term employment growth of 18 per cent. In
March, 'Biz', a Dow Jones magazine, ranked Tennessee's economy as the
healthiest among the 12 south-eastern states. An example of Tennessee's
economic fizz is that metropolitan Nashville added 14,000 jobs over the past
year while New York City lost 27,000 and Los Angeles 70,000.
Yet, while the state's unemployment rate today runs about a full point below
the national average, there is concern over economic disparity and a desire
to reduce it.
When Mr McWherter took office seven years ago, much of the job creation had
centred around the four leading cities of Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville and
Chattanooga. Of the state's 95 counties, 40 were determined to be
'economically depressed,' with long-term unemployment rates of more than 12
per cent and per capita incomes of less than 75 per cent of the state
average.
Governor McWherter set out to even out Tennessee's prosperity. He built
roads to physically connect depressed areas with big interstate highways,
and he improved their schools and healthcare facilities. He also offered
special tax incentives to businesses creating jobs in depressed areas.
As a consequence, more than Dollars 1.4bn in private investment went to the
poorest 40 counties during the past seven years, including 163 new
manufacturing plants. Today, state officials say that only two counties have
double-digit unemployment.
This will no doubt be a difficult record to match for whoever wins this
year's gubernatorial election. But officials are hoping that many more
investors, particularly foreign ones, will be humming country and western
tunes.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (4): Third place in US new car
production - Martin Dickson says the motor industry is benefiting from a
trend among manufacturers to look south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Ganbaro]' says a large sign at the trim shop in Nissan's Tennessee car
assembly plant. The Japanese slogan means 'Make it happen' and could stand
as a motto for the Tennessee state motor industry, which has grown from
small beginnings to one of the most significant in the US over the past
decade.
Tennessee has been involved in the motor industry for many years, but its
recent rise to prominence owes much to Nissan, which in October 1980
selected a site at Smyrna, Tennessee, south of Nashville, as the site of its
first vehicle assembly plant in the US. Production began there in June 1983
and it now employs about 6,000.
Then General Motors selected Spring Hill, a tiny rural community hidden away
in the rolling hills south of Nashville, as the manufacturing site for its
new Saturn car, a project designed to show that a US company, starting from
scratch, could build a small vehicle equal to the Japanese competition.
Saturn production began in 1990 and the company now employs more than 7,000.
The presence of the two assembly plants has greatly increased the number of
vehicle parts suppliers in the state. Among the largest are Ford Motor,
which makes vehicle glass, Nippondenso Tennessee, which makes starters and
alternators, TRW, manufacturing air bags, and Harman Automotive, making
mirrors.
Seattle-based Paccar's Peterbilt subsidiary has manufactured trucks in
Nashville for the past 25 years and over that period it has doubled in size
to employ about 1,000 people.
Tyre manufacturers Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber and Japan's Bridgestone-Firestone
both have large manufacturing plants in the state and Bridgestone-Firestone
moved its US headquarters to Nashville from Akron, Ohio at the start of this
decade. Bridgestone, which had long been headquartered in Nashville, had
shifted its headquarters to Akron after merging with Firestone in the late
1980s. But when this merger ran into financial problems, Bridgestone's
management decided to return to Nashville, both to make a fresh start and
have a geographically central location.
This influx means that Tennessee today ranks third in the US in new car
production. It made some 514,000 vehicles, or 8.7 per cent of US production,
in 1993. Admittedly, that is a long way behind Michigan, with 33 per cent of
US production, and Ohio, with 16.2 per cent, but it makes Tennessee the
leading southern car producer, followed by Georgia, with 6.4 per cent, and
Kentucky, where Toyota has a large plant, with 4.5 per cent.
In trucks, Kentucky is the leading southern manufacturer, ranking fourth
with 10 per cent of output, while Tennessee is 13th with just 2.2 per cent.
The state has been one of the prime beneficiaries of a trend among
manufacturers in general, and the car industry in particular, to shift
production from high wage, unionised states in America's northern 'rustbelt'
to the south, where pay is lower, unions are less well entrenched, and
employees retain a strong work ethic.
Other factors helping it attract manufacturing industry include relatively
low taxes, utility costs, and living expenses; an innovative school system;
and a central location, with good transport links to the industrial mid-west
and south-east.
Tennessee lost out in recent tussles among south-eastern states to attract
America's two newest car plants - one being built by BMW in South Carolina
and the other by Mercedes-Benz near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. But both these
states lured the German companies with huge subsidies which have raised
eyebrows in state development agencies across the US.
Still, the Tennessee vehicle parts industry should benefit greatly from the
Mercedes plant, which lies just 150 miles to the south of the state and is
due to produce 65,000 vehicles a year from 1997. Alabama has virtually no
motor industry of its own, and in choosing the Tuscaloosa site Mercedes
expected to draw on Tennessee's supplier base.
But for all its strong growth, the Tennessee motor industry has not been
immune from hiccups. Nissan, which led the Japanese import charge into the
US market in the 1970s, saw its car market share stagnate in the 1980s.
While other Japanese companies enjoyed large market share gains, Nissan
produced dull, boxy cars at its Smyrna plant and sold them through a
lacklustre US dealer network.
Now, however, Nissan is doing much better. After a Dollars 490m capital
spending programme, the Tennessee plant has been manufacturing an
attractively priced, stylishly designed new family sedan, the Altima, which
has enjoyed strong sales.
The Smyrna plant has a capacity of about 450,000 units a year and a
reputation for good labour relations. Apart from Altimas it makes the Sentra
small car, pick-up trucks, and stampings for a mini-van which is
manufactured in conjunction with Ford.
Asked what advice he would give BMW and Mercedes as they prepare to
manufacture in the US, Mr Jerry Benefield, president of the plant, says:
'Localise, localise - labour, parts supply, engineering.' For by local
sourcing a company not only saves costs but also understands the political
and cultural subtleties of the US.
Saturn has also had problems. The plant got off to a dazzling start,
creating an innovative, co-operative labour relations agreement with the
United Auto Workers which has been widely hailed as a model for the
industry. And the Saturn car rapidly became a strong seller, with a
reputation for high quality.
However, the project has cost GM Dollars 5bn, is barely turning a profit and
is facing stiff competition from a new generation of rival small cars.
Production at Spring Hill was trimmed back in March because of heavy stocks
of unsold vehicles but late in April the company said it was returning
output to full capacity.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (6): The aim is to create a competitive
workforce - Barbara Harrison on plans to reform education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1990, 320 Tennessee companies were asked in a survey for their top
recommendation to improve the state's business climate. The overwhelming
answer - by 70 per cent of the companies - was that the most important thing
to do was to improve education.
In Tennessee, as elsewhere in the American South, the poor quality of
education has increasingly been viewed as a barrier to economic progress.
The concern reflects the changing nature of the South's economy - from
low-skilled assembly plants and textile mills to high-tech manufacturing and
higher-skilled service industries.
Tennessee's response was an education reform plan called the 21st Century
Schools Programme. The plan, launched by Governor Ned McWherter in 1992,
includes an infusion of funding, a comprehensive revamping of the way
schools are run - from kindergartens to high schools - and a set of basic
goals that each local school system must meet by the year 2000. The aim is
to create a workforce that can compete nationally and internationally.
Tennessee, like many of its neighbouring southern states, has traditionally
ranked at the bottom of the US education ladder. Its schools were plagued by
high drop-out rates and low scores on national academic achievement tests.
As many as 20 per cent of high school graduates lacked the basic skills
needed to be trained for jobs. Even students who went on to university often
required remedial studies.
Governor McWherter's programme, funded by a 0.5 cent increase in the state
sales tax, has injected funds directly into classroom expenditures, rather
than teacher salary increases.
From the 1992-93 school year through to 1994-95, the state budget will have
put Dollars 504m into the programme, which represents a 45 per cent
increase, said Mr Billy Stair, the governor's top aide on education. By
1997, the programme will have generated some Dollars 900m in new funds for
schools.
The previous governor, Mr Lamar Alexander, who served as George Bush's
education secretary, had already brought some much-needed improvements to
the pay scale for teachers during his tenure from 1978-1986.
But despite the salary rises for teachers, educational achievement still
lagged in the mid-1980s and poor quality schools were increasingly viewed as
the culprits in a growing skills gap.
Business leaders, weary of poorly prepared workers, asked Mr McWherter to
'Give us a high school diploma that has meaning,' recalls Mr Stair.
While it is too early to measure the impact of the 21st Century Schools
Programme with respect to improved examination results or better skill
levels, the infusion of monies has helped to build, renovate and outfit more
classrooms, buy books and computers, provide adequate bus transportation and
equip vocational classes with modern equipment.
To address overcrowding in schools, class size was decreased by the hiring
of 2,100 more teachers. Another 1,400 are expected to be hired over the next
year.
Other aspects of the programme include:
A new 'fair and equitable' funding formula. Given that American schools are
supported by local taxes as well as state and federal monies, the new
formula provides more state money to schools in poorer districts which have
smaller tax revenues. The formula helps remedy the inequality of funding for
schools in rural Tennessee and in urban minority communities.
Higher academic standards. Students in all grades will be tested to assure
they have attained or exceeded the national standards for achievement. To
graduate from high school, students will have to pass a proficiency test for
basic skills.
Increased school accountability. Schools are held accountable for the
achievements of their students. A 'report card' on how the students have
performed in tests at each school is issued to the public. Greater local
decision-making and control. The state has freed its 139 school systems from
3,700 burdensome rules and regulations about how they should be run. And,
while increasing their budgets, the state has refrained from telling them
how they must spend their monies. Instead, the state has demanded that they
attain national achievement standards at a minimum.
If schools fail to perform, they will face sanctions, such as sacking the
district superintendent or the local school board. If they exceed
performance, they are rewarded with extra funds.
The programme, backed in the legislature by both Republicans and Democrats,
has received little criticism. It has also been lauded by national education
experts such as the University of Pennsylvania's Centre for Research and
Evaluation in Social Policy.
But doubts exist that the funding will be sufficient to achieve its goals.
Nonetheless, while performance improvements are still not clearly in
evidence, Tennessee officials believe the programme is already yielding
important results. 'The first and most dramatic change has been just a
change in attitude,' says Mr Wayne Qualls, Tennessee commissioner of
education. 'Local school administrators, principals and school boards now
all say 'We want to make a change.''
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                          School Goals
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tennessee's goals for its schools are consistent with those set by the
federal government for the year 2000. These include:
High school proficiency test pass rates of 90 per cent.
High school graduation rates of 90 per cent.
Academic gains by all students at or above the national norm.
Promotion rates of 97 per cent in kindergarten through 8th Grade, and
Attendance of 95 per cent through Grade 6 and of 93 per cent through
Grade 12.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (5): Last year's gains prove hard to
repeat - John McManus finds that the Dublin stock exchange is experiencing a
mediocre start to the year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dublin was one of the best performing stock markets in Europe last year. It
has had a mediocre 1994 so far.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares is down about 2 per cent on the year to date,
compared with a 51 per cent rise last year in the prolonged bull run
triggered by the devaluation of the Irish pound.
Last year's spectacular gains involved significant catching up by the Dublin
market after two years of under-performing London (which it traditionally
shadows). The market's performance was exaggerated by the low valuations to
which Irish stocks had sunk during 1991 and 1992 - relative to UK stocks -
because of the difference in the interest rates prevailing in Ireland and
the UK.
The valuation differential between the two markets has largely been
eliminated, according to Mr John Conroy, head analyst at Dublin's largest
independent stockbroker, NCR. He predicts that further gains will be
dictated by the performance of London and New York, the two markets which
traditionally give a lead to Dublin.
Mr Conroy believes Irish stocks are still attractive in valuation terms, on
a stock by stock basis, as the outlook for domestic earnings is positive.
Ireland is forecast to have one of the highest growth rates in the EU next
year and government and independent forecasters predict that the Irish gross
national product will grow by more than 4 per cent.
But as in the other European markets, sustained progress will only take
place in Dublin if international equity markets decouple from the bond
markets which have been exerting a negative influence on them for much of
this year.
Last year saw big changes in the investor profile of the Irish stock market.
Turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in 1992 and 1993, and the
subsequent post-devaluation bull run, raised awareness of the Irish market.
The market's increased visibility and the inclusion of 10 of the largest
Irish stocks in the Morgan Stanley Capital Index, has raised the level of
overseas investment in Irish stocks, particularly by US funds.
Although the flow of US investment funds into Europe has been drying up as
US interest rates tick upwards, most Irish analysts believe that US and
overseas investors in the Irish market have taken a medium to long term
view.
'It is a good time to buy Irish stocks, but only if international markets
move ahead - we are not going to move on our own,' Mr Conroy says. The two
big Irish banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, have both attracted international
attention in recent months. They are seen as cheap, relative to the European
sector. Both have strong domestic retail operations, controlling about 70
per cent of the market between them and can expect to benefit, in earnings
terms, from the anticipated growth in the Irish economy.
One of the biggest disadvantages for overseas investors in the Irish market
is lack of stock diversity. AIB, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life, the state's
largest life assurance company, and two industrial stocks, Smurfit and CRH,
account for 54 per cent of the market's total capitalisation of IPounds
12bn. The top 10 listed companies have a total capitalisation of IPounds
9bn.
Despite the expected arrival of two new companies on the exchange this year,
Dublin will continue to suffer from a scarcity of listed large industrial
and retail stocks. The country's largest supermarket chain, the IPounds 900m
Dunne's Store empire, is privately owned. Quinnsworth, the second biggest
retail chain, with a turnover in excess of IPounds 500m, is owned by
Associated British Foods.
The dominance of the market by financial stocks will be increased when
Ireland's largest building society, the Irish Permanent, is floated in the
middle of this year.
The other new entrant to the market is DCC, which is seeking a listing,
having successfully completed the transition from venture capital fund to
industrial holding company over the past 10 years.
Both floats are small in terms of the overall size of the market. DCC is
expected to raise between about IPounds 10m and IPounds 20m through its
flotation. The Irish Permanent may raise up to IPounds 70m.
The biggest challenge facing the Irish stock exchange is the break with the
London stock exchange scheduled for this year. The split is necessary to
comply with the EU investment services directive, which specifies that each
member state must regulate its own securities markets. (Since 1973 the
Dublin stock exchange has been merged with the London stock exchange, which
has effectively regulated the Irish market.) The Irish government is
preparing legislation, the Stock Exchange Act, which will make the central
Bank of Ireland the ultimate regulator of the Irish market.
The Irish stock exchange's handling of two highly publicised incidents last
year is being taken into account in the framing of the new laws. Davy,
Ireland's largest stockbroker, was reprimanded and fined IPounds 150,000 by
the London stock exchange last March for its role in the placing of the
Irish government's 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the food company, in
April 1994. The brokers initially told the government they had succeeded in
placing the shares, but later admitted they had been unable to sell all the
stock and had bought a proportion themselves to avoid embarrassment.
The reasons for the reprimand were not made public - which led to a written
request from the Irish government to Davy for an explanation. The result was
an indication from the Irish government that the new Stock Exchange Act will
insist on greater transparency in the Irish exchange's regulatory
procedures.
The Dublin exchange has also been criticised for failing to protect the
interests of shareholders in the small listed property company CountyGlen,
now the subject of an inquiry by an inspector appointed by the High Court.
The inspector is looking at transactions which involved the expenditure of
almost half of the company's assets of IPounds 2m without the approval of
the company's 1,100 small shareholders. The stock exchange has yet to take
any public disciplinary action.
The new rules for the independent Dublin exchange will provide for more
information about regulatory issues to made public. But they will be
modelled on the London stock exchange's rule book which, according to Mr Tom
Healy, manager of the Irish stock exchange, is being revised.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (7): Discordant dial tone - The
telecommunications and energy sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dial tone for Telecom Eireann (TE) has been somewhat discordant over the
past six months. National unease over raised calling charges gave way to
dismay at a proposed alliance with a giant outsider, Cable &amp; Wireless.
The new chief executive of TE, Mr Alfie Kane, has big problems to solve,
such as about IPounds 900m in debt (with an enormous debt/equity ratio of
about 250 to 1) and thousands more employees than critics say are necessary.
Comparison with Aer Lingus, the national airline - which has faced waves of
union hostility as it tried to correct its overstaffing - is one calculated
to ring unpleasant bells with the management of the semi-state operation.
The big shadow on TE's horizon is January 1, 1998, when the European
telecoms market will be opened up completely (although Ireland, like some of
the smaller EU states, will get special consideration in domestic services).
The level of competition across Europe is something TE could scarcely
survive in its present form.
But TE is having considerable success in its campaign - run jointly with the
Industrial Development Authority's overseas arm - to attract telemarketing
companies. With international charges for business among the lowest in
Europe, Ireland has recently been chosen by Dell computers, Best Western
Hotels, ICT Group and others as a site for operations that will create
hundreds of jobs.
Last year's charging changes aroused opposition, especially from small
businesses, as local or internal national calls bore the brunt of big cuts
for international use. The 'rebalancing', as TE prefers to call it, has led
to an average reduction of 7 per cent in business telephone bills. Further
cuts are on the horizon.
Mr Brendan Hynes, chairman of TE until an abrupt and seemingly acrimonious
departure two years ago, wrote his own analysis of Irish semi-state bodies
(Telecom Eireann, Aer Lingus) earlier this year. Mr Hynes did not mince his
words. 'Telecom Eireann is very inefficient,' he declared. From his
research, he gave figures that reflected badly on the management of the
country's telephone operator.
Irish customers paid an average of IPounds 704 annually for each telephone
line, compared with IPounds 550 in Britain and IPounds 534 elsewhere in
Europe, he said. European telephone companies average one worker for 172
lines, whereas TE has one employee for every 85 (although this has come down
from a figure nearer 40 just a few years ago). Population dispersal cannot
justify this, Mr Hynes says; New Zealand, which has a similar population but
a much greater area, has a line ratio much closer to the European norm than
that of Ireland.
The last National Development Plan turned a deaf ear to TE's calls for funds
for investment, allocating only IPounds 27m from EU structural funds where
IPounds 200m had been sought. This heightened existing suspicions that the
government would prefer TE to link up with a bigger, richer outsider.
However, union opposition and national defensiveness sprang to life when the
government started to talk euphemistically about 'strategic alliances' late
last year. In March, TE received a full proposal from Cable &amp; Wireless to
form a joint venture, with about IPounds 400m on the table.
The minister, Mr Brian Cowen, has instructed the TE board to study the C&amp;W
proposal and report back within six months on its feasibility - and any
other options. He is also considering the establishment of an independent
Irish telecoms authority equipped with enforcement powers, which could be
essential if the scene changes from one serene operator to a cast of dozens
scrabbling for market share.
Mr Cowen's portfolio also includes energy. This is not as contentious an
area as telecoms, but the future could hold some headaches for whoever is in
charge.
Unlike TE, there are no plans to place the energy utilities in public hands,
the minister told the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation recently.
However, the industry should not be complacent - the Electricity Supply
Board (ESB) is currently being 'reviewed'.
ESB, which was founded in 1927, is under the scrutiny of a cost and
competitiveness review announced in February. This, the department says,
will not only help the government decide on ESB applications to have price
rises sanctioned, but also provide the minister 'with a solid regulation for
future reviews of the electricity industry'.
A review of the mining industry and concomitant policy was also announced
late last year (Ireland has 20 per cent of western Europe's supplies of
zinc).
The new gas interconnector linking south-western Scotland with Ireland, at a
site north of Dublin, is now on-line. At a cost of IPounds 290m, IPounds 90m
of which came from the EU, the 290-km pipeline is the Republic's most
significant energy project.
The project involved four construction efforts, including construction of a
gas compressor station in Scotland. Bord Gais, the national gas supplier,
has a security gas agreement with National Power and a gas purchase
agreement with British Gas. Should Ireland find fresh reserves of natural
gas in current exploration, there is provision for surplus supplies to be
exported back to Britain through the same pipeline.
Tax incentives to promote exploration in offshore oilfields have also been
in force for several years. In March Mr Noel Treacy, the Irish energy
minister, awarded five exploration licences to five consortia, covering 28
blocks in the Slyne and Erris troughs.
Last October's National Plan published by the Irish government made a
commitment to promote alternative energy sources. The Electricity Supply
Board (ESB) has been asked to bring 75 megawatts of capacity on line from
such sources as combined heat and power (CHP), small hydro or wind power.
This scheme is now being developed. Peat-fired power stations are also an
option, although the environmental debate over further inroads into
Ireland's famous peat bogs is likely to gain impetus.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (6): Accessible and co-operative -
Favourable legislation has allowed fast growth of offshore funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past two years offshore fund management in Ireland has grown at
such a pace that Dublin now rivals Jersey and Guernsey in terms of the
amount of offshore funds under management.
More than Dollars 9bn in offshore funds is managed in Ireland, almost
entirely by companies based in Dublin's International Financial Services
Centre. This compares with Dollars 2.8bn of overseas funds managed in Dublin
in June 1992, according to official figures.
The main reason behind such rapid growth has been the introduction by the
Irish government of favourable legislation since 1989, and the development
of an International Financial Services Centre in Dublin. Ireland was one of
the first EU states to adopt the UCITS (Undertakings for Collective
Investment in Transferable Securities) directive in 1989. The UCITS
directive allows funds that are regulated in one member state to be marketed
throughout the EU.
Ireland and Luxembourg are the only two EU states where tax exempt managed
funds can make use of this facility, something which has been crucial to
Ireland's recent success in attracting offshore funds.
After deciding to set up an offshore fund in a tax-free zone, the next
factor influencing the decision of where to establish the fund is the
markets in which it will be sold, says Pat McNaughton, managing director of
Morgan Grenfell's Irish fund management subsidiary. 'If you wish to sell to
the public in Europe then setting up where you can avail of the UCITS
directive is a great advantage,' he explains.
Morgan Grenfell decided to set up in Dublin rather than Luxembourg because
it was a more cost-efficient location, particularly from the point of view
of staff costs which are roughly two thirds of those in comparable offshore
locations. The attitude of the workforce was also attractive, according to
Mr McNaughton. 'There is more enthusiasm for work here than in other tax
havens because the others nearly all have full employment,' he says.
Morgan Grenfell's move to Dublin followed the pattern of most of the more
than 40 companies that manage more than 150 funds in Dublin.
In 1991, Morgan Grenfell transferred some existing funds from its operations
in other tax havens to Dublin, in order to establish a base in Ireland from
which to launch new funds and provide custodial services for other fund
managers. Morgan Grenfell now manages funds worth Dollars 1.5bn in Dublin.
Tax incentives are available to companies setting up in the International
Financial Services Centre. It is located on disused docklands near to the
centre of Dublin and companies that obtain an IFSC licence before the end of
1994 can make use of a 10 per cent corporation tax rate until 2005.
Companies that obtain an IFSC licence are expected to establish an office on
the Dockland site but many have not yet done so, preferring to operate out
of cheaper offices elsewhere in Dublin. However, companies that do move to
the docks site can make use of a remission of municipal rates and double
rent relief for 10 years, as well as generous capital allowances.
Although companies that move to the docks site can obtain 25-year leases,
rather than the traditional 35-year lease common in Ireland, most would
still prefer five-year leases, such as those in the US, or the roll-over
indexed leases of three, six or nine years that are available in Europe.
The accessibility and co-operative nature of the Irish regulatory
authorities makes Dublin attractive to foreign funds, says Paul Dobbyn, a
partner in one of Ireland's largest commercial law firms A &amp; L Goodbody. The
main regulatory authority is the central Bank of Ireland and its approach to
the regulation of offshore funds can be characterised as 'putting a lot of
store by the credibility of the funds operator,' says Mr Dobbyn.
'The regulators are very accessible,' agrees Mr Nick Alford, general manager
of GT Asset Management Ireland, the Irish subsidiary of the bank in
Liechtenstein-owned CT Asset Management, which manages 14 funds worth more
than Dollars 1.8bn in Dublin. 'They respond quickly and let you know if they
can help.'
Most funds under management in the IFSC are unit trusts, many constituted so
as to comply with the UCITS directive. However, Irish legislation also
allows for other types of tax-exempt funds that are more attractive to
international investors, including investment companies with variable or
fixed share capital.
Both UCITS investment companies and non-UCITS investment companies are
managed in the IFSC and there are also a number of private funds.
Although the Irish legal and regulatory framework is highly competitive it
could soon lose this edge, warns Mr Dobbyn. Any changes in the law required
to maintain Ireland's competitiveness as a location for offshore fund
management have to go through the normal Irish legislative process, a
drawn-out affair which does not give as high a priority to financial
services legislation as other tax havens - such as the Cayman Islands, where
financial services are of greater significance to the economy.
So far the government has been active and recently it added another type of
investment vehicle to the 'menu' of vehicles which can be operated from the
IFSC. The Irish partnership law is shortly to be amended to allow limited
investment partnerships to operate from the IFSC. The government is
projecting that more than IPounds 100m will be attracted to investment
limited partnerships at the centre once they are operational.
Dublin's other attractions include Ireland's membership of the OECD, which
is important for marketing funds in Japan, and the Irish legal system which,
like the US and British systems, is based on common law. Fund managers can
also get funds listed on the Dublin stock exchange which is part of the
London stock exchange and is similarly regulated. Although the two exchanges
are to split this year, the Irish exchange has indicated that it intends to
continue following the rules of the London exchange.
But the main attraction of Dublin for international fund managers such as GT
and Morgan Grenfell is the workforce. 'The 10 per cent tax rate is just
another bonus,' says Mr McNaughton. Ultimately Morgan Grenfell will
repatriate any profits made in Ireland to its German parent, Deutsche Bank,
and pay tax on it in Germany, he explains.
The Irish government hopes the workforce, and wider aspects of the business
environment, will keep the notoriously mobile offshore fund managers in
Dublin once the corporation tax breaks expire. The funds themselves will
remain tax exempt after 2005.
'We would not have moved here just for the 10 per cent tax,' says Mr
McNaughton. 'The raw materials had to be here. Ultimately the financial
services centre that will win will be the one which provides the proper
skills and people at a reasonable price,' he says.
Companies arriving after 1994 will not be eligible for the 10 per cent
corporation tax incentive but the fund managers who have established
themselves by that time will be able to offer highly competitive custodial
facilities to other fund managers. There are also suggestions that the Irish
government will seek approval from the EU to extend the 1994 deadline, but
as yet no official request has been made.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (3): Radical reforms under way - Richard
Waters finds that healthcare costs threaten state finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Americans want their healthcare like they want their food: all you can get
for Dollars 8.'
The comment, by Joe Powell, chief executive of the Baptist Memorial Hospital
in Memphis, sums up a familiar problem: despite soaring costs, Americans'
expectations of healthcare have not moderated, imposing a drain on those who
foot the bill - among them state governments.
Tennessee is no exception. If left unchecked, spiralling healthcare costs
could wreck the state's finances. Through the Medicaid system, it provided
healthcare to 1m people last year. Unlike other states, though, it has opted
for radical and sweeping reforms in an attempt both to extend coverage of
medical care and to bring down its cost. The experiment could provide an
early pointer to the sort of shake-up that may come for the US as a whole
from the Clinton health plan.
'We were getting big increases in Medicaid every year - no one can sustain
that in a responsible government year after year,' says Governor Ned
McWherter. 'It threatened the financial future and stability of Tennessee.
It was taking away (resources) from education and infrastructure.'
In 1987, the Medicaid system set the state back Dollars 700m and covered
400,000 people - a cost of Dollars 1,750 a head. By last year, the cost had
risen to Dollars 3bn, and the number of people covered to 1m - or Dollars
3,000 for every person covered. Over the same period, the proportion of
Medicaid spending met by the state, as opposed to the federal, government,
remained essentially unchanged.
The state's first attempt to deal with this rising cost was to impose a tax
on providers of healthcare - largely hospitals. This brought in Dollars 500m
last year, but hurt hospitals in rural areas in particular.
Last year, the state acted to break the cycle of ever-higher taxes to match
higher spending. Mr David Manning, the state's director of finance and
administration, says: 'No tax system could keep up with the costs.' Instead
of using its power to tax, the state chose to apply its influence another
way - through its role as a big buyer of healthcare services. 'Governments
don't tend to use their purchasing power enough,' says Mr Manning.
Depending upon your point of view, the result - a scheme known as TennCare -
has either unleashed market forces on the healthcare market in Tennessee, or
has brought state-mandated cost-containment of the most direct nature.
There is no surprise about which line the state's administration takes. 'My
intent in the reform was to put the healthcare providers out in the free
market,' says Mr McWherter. 'They are not accustomed to that.'
The response from physicians and hospitals has been equally predictable. 'We
concur with managed competition - but not with managed cost,' says Mr
Stephen Reynolds, president of the Baptist Memorial Hospital.
Under the new scheme, the state has set a flat annual capitation level of
Dollars 1,600 for each individual covered - that is, the amount it has set
for providing care to each person. The organisations which provide care
don't receive the Dollars 1,600, though - the actual amount being paid is
about Dollars 1,200. The difference, says the state, reflects the taxes
which providers no longer have to pay.
This is much less than the Dollars 3,000-a-person average cost of care last
year. But the new scheme does not pay for long-term and nursing home care,
which remains in Medicaid. This accounted for Dollars 700m of the last
year's Dollars 3bn of spending. Also, the state justifies its capitation
level by reference to a similar scheme it has run for state employees for
several years.
Under TennCare, the local Blue Cross-Blue Shield organisation and a number
of private managed care organisations have competed to sign up people
covered by the scheme. They receive cash for each person they sign up, and
are responsible for buying healthcare from physicians, hospitals and others.
Some managed care groups retain all of the financial risk - others share it
with the healthcare providers.
The imposition of a cost ceiling has been accompanied by an extension of the
scheme to as many as 400,000 people. These are people on low earnings who
have not fallen into the Medicaid net before. So far, about 250,000 of these
people have signed up.
The extension of coverage has agitated hospitals in the state. 'To us, the
mathematics do not work. You can't add 400,000 people and do it for the same
amount as before,' says Mr Reynolds at the Baptist Memorial Hospital.
The state hopes that limiting the amount of money available will act as a
spur to greater efficiency, leading to no reduction in the level of care
provided. In part, says Mr Manning, the result will be a switch from
expensive medical interventions towards more cost-effective methods of care.
'We have in the past limited access to the most cost-effective forms of care
 -primary and preventative care,' he says. 'The basic economics in
capitation encourage healthcare organisations to move towards preventative
care.'
The introduction of the scheme at the beginning of this year was accompanied
by widespread confusion. Patients were left without treatment as many
doctors refused to participate. The problem was particularly acute around
Knoxville, in east Tennessee although now the Blue Cross-Blue Shield network
in the area has returned to 95 per cent of its earlier coverage, says the
state administration.
Most big hospitals agreed to take part from the start, although they
grumbled about doing so. In one hospital, when obstetricians and
anaesthetists refused to treat TennCare patients, the numbers of births by
caesarean section fell sharply, as did the use of anaesthetics in
childbirth. Supporters of the reforms point to this as evidence that
'better' healthcare - a lower rate of surgical intervention and less use of
drugs - has been the result. The doctors who would not participate in the
scheme, and the women who gave birth, may well disagree.
It remains too early to judge how successful the scheme will prove. But it
has at least one powerful virtue: it is different from what went before. As
Mr Joe Powell, head of the Baptist Memorial Hospital, growls: 'Medicaid was
so bad, almost anything is better.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (2): Economy is maintaining its momentum
 -There is steady economic growth at a rate consistently above the national
average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   A broad-based economy
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and the continuing benefits of investment from outside the state - helped
Tennessee to shrug off the nation's shallow recession in the early 1990s.
The same factors are now propelling steady economic growth at a rate
consistently above the national average, in turn supporting a gradual rise
in state-wide living standards towards the US norm.
During 1993, while the US economy as a whole grew at 2.9 per cent, the
Tennessee valley region - covering Tennessee and some rural counties in six
neighbouring states - advanced 6.4 per cent, according to Mr Juan Gonzalez,
a senior economist for the Tennessee Valley Authority.
In the state of Tennessee itself, the number of jobs rose about 4 per cent
during the year, while job growth in the country as a whole reached only 3
per cent. The state's unemployment rate over the same period fell from 6 per
cent to about 5.5 per cent, while the national jobless rate dropped from 7
per cent to 6.5 per cent. Tennessee's unemployment rate has remained below
the US rate for the past three years.
This steady growth owes much to the state's success since the early 1980s in
positioning itself as an attractive manufacturing base. New car plants
operated by Nissan - which began production in 1983 - and General Motors'
Saturn division - 1990 - and the car parts suppliers attracted to the state
by these facilities, have underpinned the growth. The upturn in the US
vehicle industry last year had much to do with the state's overall economic
performance.
Even though Tennessee has failed to win recent 'trophy' facilities - a BMW
plant, being built in South Carolina, and Mercedes-Benz, in Alabama  - its
parts suppliers should still benefit from the strengthening of the car
industry in the Southern states. Now, about 23 per cent of Tennessee's jobs
come from manufacturing, compared with a US average of 16 per cent.
The influx of new jobs came at a vital time. The recession of the early
1980s cost the state one out of every six of its goods-producing jobs,
mostly in the textile and leather industries.
Those jobs have never returned: employment in textile and related industries
has continued to fall, dropping another 15,000 in the past five years to
about 85,000 now.
But while Tennessee's manufacturing sector has bucked the national norm, the
real job growth of the past decade has come - as it has in other states -
from services. And most of those service jobs have come in metropolitan,
rather than rural, areas.
Both Nashville and Memphis, for example, have strong healthcare industries.
Nashville was home to the largest private US hospital group, HCA, until the
company was taken over by Columbia last year.
'Clearly, healthcare has been part of the success of the urban area,' says
Mr John Gnuschke, director of the business and economic research bureau at
Memphis State University.
Memphis, for its part, has developed into an important distribution centre.
Although it has failed to match the explosive development of Nashville in
the past two or three years, it has experienced 'slow steady growth,
associated with slow, steady population growth,' says Mr Gnuschke. Mr John
Kelley, president of First Tennessee Bank, reports 'moderate growth - but
with it has come stability, which isn't all bad.'
Nashville, meanwhile, has benefited from playing host to both the state
government and the country music industry, as well as a disparate range of
service and manufacturing industries. The property US slump of the late
1980s, though hurting Nashville more than other urban centres in the state,
was not as devastating as that experienced by many other US cities - nor was
the over-building as extreme. As a result, Nashville once again has a
thriving construction sector and has regained a strong self-confidence,
buoyed by the growing popularity of country music.
The advantages that have stood the state in good stead over the past decade
may not be sufficient on their own to sustain the momentum. The benefits of
growth - higher personal incomes, for example - are undermining one of the
traditional arguments for basing business in the state: a low-cost
workforce.
By the end of 1992, the average hourly wage in the state was Dollars 10.12,
compared with a US level of Dollars 11.45. The attraction to manufacturers
of non-unionised labour may also be less than is commonly perceived: about
17.5 per cent of workers in manufacturing jobs in the state are unionised,
compared with 21 per cent for the country as a whole.
'Cheap labour is only any good (at attracting jobs) if it is really cheap,'
says Mr Bob Margo, an economics professor at Vanderbilt University in
Nashville.
As wage levels have risen, Tennessee has begun to turn its sights to
better-quality jobs - and in the process discovered that its skills base may
not be adequate. 'What we have to do to get competitive is improve our
education,' says Governor Ned McWherter. Like other Southern states, its
public educational system is straining under years of under-investment. A
recently launched programme to improve standards, particularly in rural
areas, will take years to have an effect.
In the meantime, the quality of the local workforce remains one of the main
concerns of employers in the region. A comment by Mr Lewis Nolan of Schering
Plough's healthcare division, located in Memphis, is typical: The education
system 'needs improvement - we have to do a good deal of remedial education
here,' he says.
There are other, more specific challenges. First, Tennessee's economy could
be more vulnerable than the US as a whole to a rise in the value of the
dollar. According to Mr Gonzalez of the TVA, 14.3 per cent of the area's
jobs are in industries which are vulnerable to import penetration - such as
textiles - compared with 5.6 per cent in the nation as a whole.
Second, both east and west Tennessee face local threats. Each has its share
of poor rural counties, for example, and each has suffered from being far
removed from the perceived centre of state life, in Nashville.
In the eastern part of the state, the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge
facility, which employs 16,000, could shrink fast in the years ahead as its
budget is cut back. Efforts are under way to foster new high-technology
industries in the area, using the extensive skills of Oak Ridge.
'The potential is very great - and the downside (from lost jobs) could be
very bad,' says Mr Richard Riebling, the state's commissioner for economic
development.
Memphis, meanwhile, faces its own challenge from the south: the advent of
river-boat gambling in nearby Tunica county, Mississippi. With Tennessee's
ban on gambling unlikely to be reversed in the near future, Tunica will
become a powerful draw for leisure dollars that were previously spent in
Memphis.
Memphis, like many other US urban centres, is also beginning to feel the
pinch from spending cuts in healthcare: the Baptist Memorial Hospital, the
largest in the area, has cut 1,000 jobs in the past year and a half, and has
some 'pretty significant cost reductions in mind,' says Mr Stephen Reynolds,
the hospital's president.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (3): A few wobbles have not upset the
tandem - The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition is approaching the June
Euro-elections in a confident mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition was formed in January 1993, after the
last general election, some political pundits were predicting that it would
not survive two years.
The 1982-87 Fine Gael-Labour coalition broke down after four years, in
disagreement over economic policy and over Labour's eclipse by its larger,
and conservative partner, Fine Gael.
The last coalition, formed in 1989 by Fianna Fail and the Progressive
Democrats, collapsed in 1992, culminating in the spectacle of the two party
leaders accusing each other of being liars from the witness box of a public
inquiry into the Irish beef industry (the report of which is finally
expected to see the light of day in June this year).
Some early ministerial turf battles aside, the latest coalition partners
have displayed a surprising degree of cohesion though, and are now
approaching the June Euro-elections in confident mood. They are even
contemplating an unprecedented voting pact to make sure that their
candidates get an easy ride to Strasbourg.
The few wobbles that have occurred in public, usually when the word
privatisation has been mentioned, have not yet been sufficient to throw the
tandem out of control.
The latest batch of economic forecasts are confidently predicting strong
growth, low inflation, and rising employment levels up to the end of the
decade. Even the sun has been putting in a strong appearance over the past
month after one of the dreariest and wettest winters on record.
A spokesman for Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said: 'There is a
strong feel-good factor and the government is riding high.
'The coalition is performing well, and if anything should go wrong, we will
simply batten down the hatches and ride it out.'
Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour party leader is in an
equally optimistic mood. 'We are well on course. Unemployment is edging down
and other problem areas such as health, education and housing are
effectively off the political agenda because of the progress that has been
made on all these fronts,' he said.
Public housing starts are well up, 17,000 people have been taken off
hospital waiting lists, and additional resources are being pumped into
education.
If progress has not been as rapid on the jobs front as Labour would have
hoped 'we have at least established our credibility with the markets in the
past two budgets', said Mr Spring.
With so much good news about, the opposition - flap its arms as it may  -
has been unable to unnerve the complacent coalition beast. Fine Gael, the
main opposition party, has still to recover from its miserable performance
in the 1992 elections.
Mr John Bruton, the party leader, with one eye constantly over his shoulder,
wondering where the next challenge to his leadership might come from, has
been unable to do more than snipe at occasional government blunders.
Red faces there have been on government benches - when a promised pot of EU
structural funds turned out to be only three-quarters full, when a
middle-class outcry over a residential property tax sent the finance
minister scurrying back to his calculator and when a whiff of sexual scandal
entered the Dail (parliament) after a Labour minister was publicly
reprimanded by Mr Spring for his 'poor judgement' in having chatted to a
homosexual in his parked car in Dublin's Phoenix Park.
But none of these issues have set coalition knees trembling. Issues that
might, especially in Fianna Fail ranks, such as sorting out the
now-ambiguous legal situation on abortion, and property rights in the event
of divorce being introduced, are being quietly pushed on to the back burner.
A bill to legalise homosexuality was passed last year, however, with barely
a ripple of controversy.
Causing more worries for government programme managers is Ms Mary Harney,
the new leader of the Progressive Democrats (PD - the smaller of the two
conservative opposition parties) and someone who has proved herself to be a
tough and competent performer in the Dail. She is busily creating a higher
profile for the party, and carefully targeting the right-wing vote which
Fine Gael has traditionally monopolised.
Sweeping tax reform, privatisation and a get-tough approach with Northern
Ireland's paramilitaries are the PDs proposals for solving Ireland's
problems. It is not so different from Mr Bruton's message, but somehow
sounds more convincing coming from Ms Harney.
According to Mr Spring, the two crucial political issues that are now facing
the country are unemployment and the continuing crisis in Northern Ireland.
The latter has dominated the political agenda of both Mr Reynolds and Mr
Spring (who is also foreign minister) for most of the past eight months,
although of the two, Mr Reynolds has grabbed most of the limelight.
His joint declaration which was signed last December with Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, succeeded in creating an entirely new framework for
the settling of the Northern Ireland conflict, and simultaneously gave Mr
Reynolds an entirely new framework for projecting his hitherto lacklustre
image.
His handling of the Anglo-Irish negotiations, during which he demonstrated
that he could be a tenacious negotiator in handling Ireland's interests
abroad, at the same time as being prepared to make honourable compromises
and take imaginative and risky initiatives, has greatly boosted his
reputation both at home and abroad.
But there has been genuine disappointment, bordering on a sense of
deception, that Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has so far failed
to grasp the olive branch held out to it.
There is also growing frustration with the mathematics of UK parliamentary
politics - the devastation of the Tories in the British local elections
earlier this month, has raised fears in Dublin that Mr Major will now be
even more beholden to the Ulster Unionists than ever to retain his slim
Commons majority in the face of backbench revolts.
Government priorities are therefore set to shift to the other key issue
identified by Mr Spring - unemployment.
Unfortunately, the job of making any significant inroads into the dole
queues against a backdrop of rising unemployment within the EU is likely to
prove as frustrating as the Northern Ireland peace process.
Those same sunny economic forecasts also predict that long-term unemployment
is likely to remain stubbornly high at 18 per cent until the year 2000.
The coalition has at least three years to run before the next general
election is due, and Mr Spring is confident that it can hold together. He of
course stands to lose most if it fails.
Labour's vote doubled to a record 21 per cent in 1992 as unemployment
figures also reached record highs. Failure to deliver on jobs could see that
vote halve again as easily as it doubled - and the 'new era' Mr Spring
promised for Irish politics 18 months ago may in retrospect appear to have
been a mere flash in the pan.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (4): Polymath of many colours - Michael D.
Higgins, minister for arts, culture and the Irish language, believes in
offering a wide range of cultural choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poet, political scientist, sociologist and socialist, university lecturer
and now minister for arts, culture and the Irish language, Mr Michael D.
Higgins is one of the more colourful figures to have entered the upper
echelons of Ireland's political establishment in recent years.
He is a liberal thinker, author of two well-received books of poetry and
renowned for his erudite and impassioned Dail speeches. Mr Higgins has given
a surge of confidence to Ireland's arts community since his appointment to
the cabinet in January 1993, his first ministerial post.
With an annual budget of more than IPounds 50m, he has increased government
funding for the Irish Arts Council by 25 per cent and secured pre-production
tax breaks and IPounds 16m in funding for the film industry over the next
four years. He is now turning his attention to the music and multimedia
industries.
'I want an active rather than a passive cultural policy, which is open to
diversity and which creates a cultural space to fill the narrowing of the
economic space,' he says.
He quotes approvingly from Edward Said's latest book Culture and
Imperialism, and says he is a firm believer in cultural development as a
stimulant to economic development. He says people across Europe will have to
adjust to greater work flexibility and make more use of their leisure time
in order to deal with unemployment.
'If we have enhanced cultural activity, there will be more alternatives to
use that spare time and people will be more willing to make those
adjustments.' He points to the success of the Irish film industry as proof
that cultural promotion also creates jobs.
He is known for arguing his views forcefully with his EU counterparts in the
European Cultural Council, but he became more widely known outside Ireland
earlier this year for his lifting of the two decade-old broadcasting ban on
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
'I took a lot of flak from all sides for that, but it was done in the
context of the public's right to information and the political censorship
issue. I revoked the ban not to facilitate Sinn Fein but to facilitate the
public,' he says.
A desire to give people a wide range of cultural choices underpins his
arms-length approach to the government-funded arts bodies which come under
his remit. These must have autonomy with responsibility, he says. It is for
government to help create 'the cultural space' within which broadcasters,
artists, writers and musicians have the freedom to innovate. The public, he
insists, does not need to be told by government what to think.
The growing international acclaim of Irish actors, directors, writers and
musicians, bolstered by a string of recent successes with Oscars, the Booker
prize - even a third successive win at the Eurovision Song Contest - shows
how far Irish cultural policy has come from the dark days of the 1930s when
writers such as Joyce, Synge and Beckett, chose exile in order to get
published. Today they would be given grants and live tax-free.
As Mr Higgins finishes his lunch a man comes over to shake his hand. 'I
liked your last book of poems, Minister. Keep it up,' he says. Mr Higgins
confesses he has written 'only four and a half' in the past 18 months.
Nonetheless, Joyce would have been impressed.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (1): Search for a new identity - A
poverty-stricken state has clawed its way up to become one of the more
successful in the 'New South'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The people of Tennessee spend much of the time comparing their state with
other states or cities of the South. 'Not as bad as Mississippi or
Louisiana,' you hear of the educational system. 'Behind Atlanta, but ahead
of Charlotte,' someone says of Nashville.
Perhaps it isn't surprising. A land-locked state which shares its borders
with eight others, Tennessee sits squarely in the middle of the South. It
looks like a fiction created by map makers; a thin wedge cut out of the
underbelly of the US which extends between two distant natural borders - the
Mississippi river to the west, the Appalachian mountains to the east. What
can there be that unites this disparate place?
But there is another reason for the comparisons, the constant assessment and
reassessment of how well Tennessee is doing. The new middle classes in
Tennessee's cities are searching for an identity. Once, the state took its
identity from the land: the cotton fields of the the Mississippi delta, for
example, or the wooded hills of the east.
The importance of cotton - and the textile businesses which it supported -
has receded. Tennessee has suffered the same rural depopulation as much of
the US.
Many of the new jobs are in manufacturing plants, such as carmaking, or
service industries such as healthcare or distribution. Many of the managers
who run these new industries have moved to the state from the north-east of
the country, from the nation's rust belt, or from some far-away country.
Tennessee has been spectacularly successful in attracting overseas companies
in recent years, particularly from Japan and the UK.
Mr Bob Margo of Vanderbilt University in Nashville calls it 'the end of
regional economic identities' in the US.
The transformation has been striking. A poverty-stricken, largely rural
state has clawed its way up from the bottom of the pile to become, in
economic terms, one of the more successful in the 'New South.'
A decade ago, Tennessee ranked 45th out of 50 US states in terms of per
capita income. Now, it is 35th. A recent target set by a new coalition
between business and government agencies, known as Tennessee Tomorrow, is to
reach parity with the national average within 10 years.
It has already come a long way from Roosevelt's 'New Deal' era, when the
Tennessee Valley Authority was created to bring cheap power and, with it,
jobs to an impoverished region. The Corporation for Enterprise Development,
a not-for-profit entity based in Washington DC which compares the economic
performance and prospects of US states, puts Tennessee in the top fifth of
the country in terms of economic vitality - thanks to a diverse economy,
strong inward investment in manufacturing and the competitiveness of its
existing businesses.
Analyses such as these usually put Tennessee ahead of immediate neighbours
Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Arkansas, as well as more distant
Southern rivals such as Florida. But the state's economic growth struggles
to be compared with Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.
While these comparisons are encouraging, others are less flattering. In
particular, Tennessee suffers from a long-standing underinvestment in its
education system, which ranks at least as bad as its Southern neighbours.
The state comes 41st among US states in its high school graduation rate, and
a lowly 47th in terms of the number of heads of households who have had at
least 12 years of education.
Also, Tennesseans have done little to spread their increasing wealth across
the population as a whole. 'Where it (the state) really scores poorly is
equity - there is a great income disparity between urban and rural, and
between the rich and poor,' says Mr Brian Dabson, head of the Corporation
for Enterprise Development.
By the Corporation's measure of income distribution - comparing the incomes
of the most wealthy fifth of the state's population with those of the
poorest - Tennessee ranks 45th in the country.
Also, it retains a regressive taxation system, with a hefty sales tax and no
tax on earned income. Efforts to introduce a state lottery - a move in line
with other states, and one which would raise an estimated Dollars 100m a
year - have fallen foul of Tennessee voters' disapproval of all gambling.
This is, after all, the heart of the Bible Belt.
Much of the poverty that remains is to be found in the countryside. The
growth that has come to the state's biggest cities - Nashville, Memphis,
Chattanooga and Knoxville - has largely failed to spread into other areas.
'We did very well in the 1980s but it was concentrated in urban areas. Rural
areas have suffered,' says Mr John Gnuschke, head of Memphis State
University's centre for business and economic research.
The state administration of Governor Ned McWherter, who this years completes
two terms in office, has made efforts to right the balance. Mr McWherter, a
Democrat who likes to relate how he was born on the kitchen table of a farm
in the north-west of the state, has put rural development high on his
agenda.
An infrastructure programme has added 1,000 miles of new roads since Mr
McWherter took office, linking rural areas with the state's highway system.
Under a new healthcare scheme, Tennessee has this year extended a degree of
medical cover to 400,000 low-income people who did not previously qualify.
And spending on education has been lifted, with a redirection of resources
towards poorer areas.
'Within one or two years, funding will be equalised within one or two per
cent for every girl and boy across Tennessee,' Mr McWherter says.
The question is not whether the administration has targeted the right areas
for development, but rather whether it has done enough. Tennessee continues
to promote itself as an accommodating home for business, with lower wages
than the national average, a more conducive tax regime and fewer trades
union members. It is a message which has brought companies to the state but
the greater prosperity that has resulted has failed to trickle down
sufficiently to alleviate some deep-seated social problems.
'Think of it as another country,' says Mr Margo. 'It has come a long way
from a very, very poor base, and it is continuing to converge. But the last
few yards will be the hardest: they involve the convergence of attitudes.'
Meanwhile, cities such as Nashville and, to a lesser extent, Memphis, are
discovering a new sense of confidence as important centres in their own
right. Memphis, on the far south-eastern tip of the state, is frequently
referred to as 'the biggest city in Mississippi.' It has more in common with
the broad flat region that spans the Mississippi delta than the hilly
central or eastern regions of Tennessee.
Music has brought national recognition to both Nashville, centre of the
country music industry, and Memphis, home of the blues. But members of their
growing middle-class populations, many of them from outside the state, crave
other symbols of their success.
The search for a local identity has found its most obvious outlet in the
pursuit of a big league sports team. For these emerging cities, a big sports
franchise would bring status and exposure nationally, allowing them to stand
their ground against the capitals of neighbouring North Carolina and
Georgia.
'We want to be like Atlanta - we want a team,' says Mr Gnuschke. 'We're
desperate for recognition and acceptance in a national network of successful
cities. We're struggling to keep pace.'
Everywhere you go, the talk is of bringing a big league sports team to
Tennessee. Memphis failed in its attempt to win a football franchise last
year, while Nashville is currently in pursuit of both ice hockey and
basketball teams.
According to Mr Dick Evans, chief operating officer of Gaylord, the
entertainment group: 'This community is starving for professional sports. It
is the largest market in the nation without a franchise.'
Mr Evans, a former head of New York city's Madison Square Garden, is bidding
to bring teams to play in a new 20,000-seat arena under construction in
downtown Nashville. It may not sound much but for Tennesseans, success would
help reinforce the claim that they have finally arrived on the national
stage.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (2): The boat has stayed afloat - Angela
Long examines the economy and employment prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA LONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whither the economy of Ireland? Or should that be 'wither'?
The Republic has advantages in its highly educated, youthful workforce, its
(often perplexingly) healthy economic indicators and its enthusiasm to
attract investment from foreign companies. But nothing can deny its
geography, and after the Channel Tunnel starts operating at last, Ireland
will indeed be the only European Union country without a direct link to the
European land mass.
Well may Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach, claim that while geographically
peripheral, Ireland was 'at the heart of Europe' - as he declared to a
meeting of the Irish Management Institute last month. Dependence on Europe,
primarily the UK, is a fact of life for the Irish economy.
A population of 3m is not enough to sustain a country in isolation, and so
Ireland has to look outwards, which perhaps accounts for the much more
continental feel that Dublin has, for example, than any English city. Often,
because of blood links, the overseas link is with the US.
This year has seen growing optimism for the Irish economy. Predictions of
growth have risen from near 3 per cent at the end of 1993 to between 4 per
cent and 5 per cent. Inflation, at about 2 per cent, is one of the lowest in
the EU, comparable only with France. The punt is healthy, and a leading
stockbroker, Davy, recently predicted that it could reach parity with
sterling by the end of the year.
Exchequer returns, a key indication of how the administration's bookkeeping
is faring, were good, showing a 25 per cent increase in total tax revenue
for the first quarter of 1994. And although Ireland may still be one of the
poorer members of the EU, its relative prosperity is improving: average
income has risen from 60 per cent of the EU average in 1986 to 74 per cent
today.
The Reynolds government, with Mr Bertie Ahern a popular and competent
finance minister, has kept its head and ridden out the currency storm.
Interest rates are fairly stable. The government is entering its second
Programme for Economic and Social Partnership (PESP), which features a
tripartite agreement between itself, the unions and employers, which should
help to restrain wage levels. Public sector pay, however, may prove harder
to control than Mr Reynolds and Mr Ahern have hoped, with civil servants
using provisions for increased pay as a result of work restructuring.
Another awkward acronym to ride with PESP, the PCW, stands for the Programme
for Competitiveness and Work. The name may be clumsy, but these are the
important issues Ireland will have to address.
At present, the PCW has yet to be ratified finally by the unions. The 'Work'
side of any plan will be the real test for the government, because it is not
yet clear whether unemployment - which has been levelling off in recent
months - can be controlled. Certainly enough has been said about tackling
it, but the heart of the problem remains intractable.
The influential Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) published an
upbeat mid-term outlook in April which gave rise to a headline in the Irish
Times: 'The rising international tide could lift the Irish boat'. The ESRI,
working with computer models, predicted an improving economy 'in the
mid-term' - that is, into the next century.
Consumer spending, for example, should rise by 3.5 per cent this year, and
by up to 6.4 per cent in 1995. There has been some sign that the battered
consumer, devastated by the rise in interest rates that preceded the 10 per
cent devaluation of the punt in January 1993, has returned to the high
street. Retail sales have been showing a slight improvement, and there was a
big leap in new car sales in the first quarter, with a 46 per cent increase
on the same period in 1993. However, this is partly due to a reduction in
Vehicle Registration Tax announced in the Budget.
But the ESRI report (by Sara Cantillon, John Curtis, and John FitzGerald,
son of Garret FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach) warned that without a 'major
policy change' long-term employment would remain a grave problem.
A mixed blessing for the country came last November: the Republic's football
team qualified for the World Cup by defeating Northern Ireland. People who
might otherwise have bought a new car or even a house will now be spending
any surplus - or borrowed - cash on a trip to the US, or on a new
wider-screen television for the month of matches.
The ESRI justifies its optimism, in part, by the way in which the Irish
'boat' has managed to stay afloat during recent stormy times, complimenting
its 'robust performance in the face of international recession over the past
couple of years'.
Despite bad conditions last year, the economy managed about 2 per cent
growth. Exports rose by about 8.75 per cent compared with growth in world
trade of only 2.6 per cent. But ESRI sensibly qualifies its cheery view:
'The one uncertainty about the future is that the actual outturn will be
more eventful than the smooth path we have plotted.'
The effect of demographics will be watched with interest. Ireland's high
birth rate has meant a crushing ratio of wage-earners to dependants; the
highest in Europe. For every 10 people at work, there are between 20 and 30
dependants compared with three in, say, Denmark.
'The rate of increase in employment necessary to provide jobs for the young
people entering the labour market in Ireland is 15 times greater than in the
rest of Europe,' wrote Garret FitzGerald recently.
But in the past five years the Irish birthrate has dropped dramatically, as
members of the current generation tailor their families to their pockets and
life styles rather than to the traditional Catholic model: 'as many as
heaven sends.'
The implications of this are many. For example, the ESRI forecast notes that
the population change will have 'traumatic' effects for the teaching
profession, where jobs are already a big issue, and for the health care
sector, which will have to concentrate on an ageing population. Since 1972
employment in health and education services has risen from 90,000 to 140,000
 -according to last month's meeting of the Irish Business and Employers
Congress. These areas are now likely to shrink.
Other job sources will have to be found. The running sore on the Irish
economy for nearly a decade has been unemployment; Ireland has competed with
Spain for the dubious title of having the highest unemployment in the EU.
Last year the Republic suffered about 19 per cent unemployed compared to
Spain's frightful 21 per cent, but since late last year the figures have
been dropping - save for December. (Officials put that down to 'reverse
emigration'.)
The unemployment figure fell in March for the third successive month, with
290,600 people on the live register; 6,500 fewer than a year ago. The
Central Statistical Office's figures for this time last year showed 1.146m
people at work compared with 1.139m in 1992. Much of the rise in employment
has been among female workers. Many women who previously stayed at home to
look after their families are now being forced by circumstance, or liberated
by changing attitudes, to seek work.
Only 18 months ago you could read angry letters written to newspapers by
graduates in Co Galway, complaining of the 'cheek' of married women in
taking jobs. The statistics do show a stasis in the numbers of men at work,
whereas female employment has risen by 55,000 since 1987. Many of these
women are in the services sector - many, too, have lower pay than men, and
inferior conditions.
What is the government doing to create jobs? Tax breaks for small employers
and drives to persuade overseas companies to set up in Ireland are two -
perhaps too common - solutions. The Industrial Development Authority is
campaigning to draw multinationals, and has had success with some
telemarketing companies, creating hundreds of jobs.
But the problem remains; when things go badly for the multinational, as for
any creature on earth, it wants to go home.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Ireland (1): Goal is to be on the fast track to
EMU - As recession lifts, Ireland is in a good position to take advantage of
the upswing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Channel Tunnel linking Britain and France was officially
inaugurated earlier this month, most Irish newspapers were quick to note
that Ireland was now the only EU nation without a land-link to the rest of
the member states.
They lamented the fact that the tunnel would reinforce Ireland's isolation
and warned that Irish goods would find it more difficult to compete with
British ones in Europe's populous heartland. What good are Irish Oscars,
Booker Prizes and successes in the Eurovision song contest if they do not
produce jobs, they asked?
Although Ireland has had some outstanding successes in stealing the European
limelight in music, literature and film over the past year, the frustration
of not being closer to the economic and political pulse of Europe is
strongly felt.
As the European parliamentary elections approach, there are no powerful
Euro-sceptic lobbies or irate backbenchers berating the government for
wanting to be in the fast track to European monetary union (EMU). That goal
is a cross-party objective.
But Irish fears of economic isolation are perhaps overstated.
As the clouds of recession show signs of breaking up, the country appears to
be better positioned than many of its EU partners to take advantage of the
upswing. The Fianna Fail-Labour coalition, now in its second year, has
maintained the central thrust of the economic policy pursued by two previous
governments since 1987 - reduction in the debt/GNP ratio and securing price
stability. A measure of that policy's success is that inflation in 1993 fell
to 1.5 per cent, one of the lowest in the EU.
The crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism towards the end of 1992,
putting pressure on several European currencies including the British pound,
forced the incoming coalition government to accept a 10 per cent devaluation
of the punt within weeks of taking office. Despite the turbulence at the
time, this has had a salutary effect. Interest rates are now at record lows
and heading lower; foreign currency reserves are higher than before the
crisis; exports look likely to hit record new levels and consumer demand is
showing strong signs of recovery. The fiscal deficit is well under control -
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, felt confident enough to give away
IPounds 333m in tax reliefs to the lower-paid in last January's budget,
equivalent to 1.1 per cent of GNP.
Indeed, the budget's underlying assumption of a 3.8 per cent growth rate in
GNP this year is now looking conservative. The latest spate of economic
forecasts from independent analysts put the figure closer to 5 per cent, a
level which is expected to be sustained up to the end of the century. On
that basis, the current budget deficit will be eliminated by 1996, and the
EMU target of reducing the debt/GDP ratio to 60 per cent appears attainable
by the end of the decade. Provided that inflation is not stoked up again,
Ireland has thus positioned itself well to take the fast track to Europe.
Yet there remains a fundamental problem at the heart of economic
policy-making, as Mr Han de Jong, chief economist at Goodbody, Dublin
stockbrokers, points out: 'In conducting exchange rate policy, the
authorities are using a basket of currencies with sterling and the DM as
heavyweights. The foreign exchange market, on the other hand, has
effectively relinked the punt to sterling . . . the perceived poor quality
of economic policy-making in the UK is the core of the problem for the Irish
authorities and constitutes the paradox of Irish policy intentions,' he
said.
While the Irish authorities want Ireland to be among the first to
participate in monetary union, they are being held hostage to the political
fortunes of a UK Conservative party in disarray over Europe. According to Mr
de Jong: 'UK politics is a constant potential threat to (economic)
stability.'
In other economic policy-making areas - notably the deregulation of state
enterprises - Irish freedom of action is subject to internal rather than
external constraints, but still the process has had successes. Aer Lingus,
the state-run airline, has managed to emerge from a big restructuring, aimed
at returning it to profitability, without a crippling labour dispute. Unions
at An Post, the state postal service, have accepted radical changes to work
practices. Both companies are searching for overseas partners.
The rail unions are proving more reluctant to accept change at Iarnrod
Eireann (Irish Rail), the heaviest government loss-maker, but as practically
all of Europe's railways are heavily subsidised, most of the attention will
now focus on Telecom Eireann, the state telecommunications company, and on
whether a proposed link-up with British telecommunications group, Cable &amp;
Wireless, will get the go-ahead from the government. Telecom unions have
indicated that they will support a joint venture with a foreign partner -
but are opposed to one with Cable &amp; Wireless.
The importance of telecommunications to the economy cannot be
over-estimated. Over the past 10 years Ireland's telecommunications services
have improved dramatically. The recent entry of competitors into the
international segment of the market is rapidly bringing down the cost of
calls, adding to the continuing tax attractions of setting up business in
Ireland, not least in the financial service industries.
More than 150 offshore funds totalling some Dollars 9bn are now managed out
of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin, a sector
which has grown rapidly in the past two years. A growing number of funds is
also being listed on the Dublin stock exchange, which itself is attracting
an increasing amount of overseas attention.
Inward industrial investment is also continuing to notch up successes.
Several new projects - in the health care sector, in telemarketing and in
electronics, among others - have been announced since the beginning of the
year. (Generous grants and a low tax regime have helped to attract these,
despite intense competition from, for example, Scotland and Wales.)
Ireland's profile - and its hopes of attracting further investment in both
manufacturing and services - will be raised further next month when its team
travels to the US to play in the finals of football's world cup in Orlando
and New York, accompanied by tens of thousands of supporters.
A flood of Italian tourists to Ireland followed Ireland's participation in
the 1990 World Cup in Italy. A similar effect is hoped for in the US,
traditionally Ireland's main overseas tourist market. An increase in numbers
from the US will be especially welcome in the west of Ireland, which is
having to come to terms with the reform of the EU's common agricultural
policy. This is forcing change in the traditional dairy and beef farming
sectors in favour of new industries such as tourism and forestry.
Planting of new woodlands and forests has accelerated in the past five
years, encouraged by generous grants and incentives which are scheduled to
be increased again soon. A forest products industry is already undergoing
expansion. This is expected to be as important to the economy, in 20 years,
as the food industry is now.
So Ireland's position at the edge of Europe is not the disadvantage it is
frequently made out to be. Its comparative advantages have been recognised
and economic and political stability is fostering a positive climate for
inward investment by companies positioning themselves for growth in the
European market.
Much more would be possible, too, given a satisfactory resolution of the
island of Ireland's most intractable problem - Northern Ireland, an issue
which has absorbed large amounts of ministerial time over the past year.
While prospects for peace in the province have come tantalisingly closer
than at any time in the past 25 years, as a result of talks with the UK
government leading up to the Downing Street Declaration, the government has
had to accept that its suggestion last year that 'peace by Christmas' was
possible was wide of the mark. It may be some way down the road yet.
Nevertheless, even on this issue, there are signs of the same movement,
which, in other areas, is leading to hopes of a more prosperous and stable
future for Ireland in the twenty-first century.

FT  25 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Thorn EMI tumbled 28 to 1068p as it reported full-year profits of
Pounds 326.5m against market forecasts of between Pounds 330m and Pounds
340m. Leisure analysts were also perturbed by growth prospects in the music
division and also in the dividend policy. Forecasts were reined in by around
10 per cent to the Pounds 400m-mark for 1995, with several brokers also
downgrading their stance on the stock.
Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Markets, who retained his long-term positive
position, said that the stock was also suffering from profit-taking after
its good run this year, fuelled in part by the publicity over multimedia.
The two Scottish generators showed the rest of the electricity/generator
sector a clean pair of heels as ther market picked up hints that the
National Grid is to allow Scottish Hydro and Scottish Power to export
electricity to England and Wales on highly favourable termms.
Mr Douglas Falconer, a utilities specialist at Yamaichi, the Japanese-owned
stockbroker, said the news was a strong bull point for the Scottish stocks
which were among his best buys in the sector. Scottish Hydro rose 11 to 366p
and Scottish Power 12 to 379p.
Water shares, meanwhile, extended their recent strong performance,
reflecting persistent hints around the market that the preliminary 'K
factors' indicated to the companies by OfWat, the industry regulator last
Friday, may have been better than the companies expected. Analysts warned,
however, that the negotiating process over the K factors will be hard fought
and not revealed until late July.
The second line water stocks attracted much of the buying interest with
Yorkshire, the sector's best performer on Monday, jumping 13 more to 526p.
Welsh added 18 at 629p, Wessex 14 at 634p and Northumbrian the same to 573p.
Severn Trent was the FT-SE 100's best individual performer, the shares
racing up 11 to 518p. North West Water, reporting this morning and expected
to announce an eight per cent increase in the dividend total, put on 10 to
520p.
Services and marketing group Inchcape tumbled after the chairman warned that
first half profits for the current year would be down on the same period a
year earlier.
The company blamed effects of a strong yen and the downturn in European car
markets, along with other factors, for the decline.
The shares extended an earlier decline and were down 26 at the day's worst
before steadying to finish 21 down at 499p, a six-month low for the stock.
Dealers saw some consolation in the chairman's optimism over second half
trading, which he said should enable maintainance of year-on-year profit
growth.
However My Nyran Scott-Malden at BZW said the decline in the share price was
'overdone given that this is what we expected for the first half'.
Granada was once again undermined by persistent talk suggesting problems
over the merger with LWT. The shares retreated 9 to 508p. Ladbroke suffered
for a second session following its bearish agm statement on Monday. The
shares slid 7 to 175 1/2 p. Forte, on the other hand, was the one bright
light in a maligned leisure sector, adding 4 to 236p on turnover of 2.3m,
following a positive agm the same day. Results from Fairline Boats helped
the shares jump 40 to 435p.
Negative comment on Betterware results on Monday saw the shares come off 14
to 109p. Burton Group was said to be one beneficiary of switching out of
M&amp;S, the shares edging up three-quarters to 59p. Great Universal Stores held
up, slipping just a penny to 613p, on renewed hopes of an imminent share
buy-back.
Strong two-way trading in business services group BET after it reported a
return to profit, brought turnover of 9.3m. The shares closed unchanged at
130 1/2 p.
A stock overhang was reported in both British Aerospace and GKN. The former
eased 7 to 473p, and the latter shed 12 to 588p.
A profits warning from parcel delivery group United Carriers sent the shares
falling sharply. They finished 33 off at 115p.
News that Stena-Sealink has cut its cross-channel ferry prices by 20 per
cent weakened sentiment in rival ferry operator P&amp;O. The shares gave up 18
to 651p, after trade of 3.4m.
International freight management company Ocean Group eased 13 to 273p, after
a gloomy annual meeting at which the chairman repeated a warning on the
uncertain outlook for 1994.
Bargain hunters for Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel saw the shares bounce
5 to 360p, in healthy volume of 1.7m.
Favourable press comment for British Airways' results boosted trading in the
stock. The shares appreciated 8 to 387p, on volume of 6.9m.

<TEXT>
Shares in the The Telegraph, the London-based daily and Sunday newspaper
group, fell sharply to close 17 off at 571p as the Seaq ticker revealed that
various blocks of shares, amounting to around 4.3m shares, had been sold
into the market at 570p.
The shares represented the rump of the big bought deal carried out jointly
last week by Cazenove and Goldman Sachs in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger
Group reduced its holding in the Telegraph group from 66.2 per cent to 56.95
per cent. Earlier yesterday the Seaq ticker revealed that Hollinger's 12.5m
shares had originally been sold to Cazenove/Goldman Sachs at 587p a share.
It had previously been believed that Cazenove/Goldmans had placed the
majority of the Hollinger shares last Thursday.

Disappointing headline results from Marks and Spencer, together with a
cautious statement, saw the shares fall in busy turnover of 8.5m yesterday.
Profits of Pounds 851.5m compared with forecasts of Pounds 865m contained a
surprise increase in the pension contribution. Otherwise analysts declared
themselves fairly satisfied with the underlying performance.
But the shares closed 12 1/2 off at 412p as some investors took their cue
from Marks' remarks that cost price inflation is returning to the retail
market. 'Some institutions think they might have a racier ride in some of
the more undervalued and risky stores stocks,' said one dealer. Analysts
kept their 1995 forecasts in the Pounds 940m to Pounds 960m range, although
a number did lower their performance rating in the light of the company
statement.

<TEXT>
Stock index futures remained in the doldrums as dealers reflected on
weakness in bonds. Once again volumes in both futures and traded options
remained low, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was at 3,103 and initially
gave some hope of an improvement on Monday's poor session. But those soon
faded as active selling said to have been led by Goldman Sachs drove the
contract lower.
The weakness in both UK and German bonds followed the release of worse than
expected German M3 data and prompted further selling of the contract.
In the afternoon, the bounce on Wall Street failed to inspire a similar
response in London, and the June contract again traded at the lower levels
and continued leading the cash market down.
It finished at 3,077, down 8 on its previous finish but at at a 16 point
discount to its fair value premium to cash of about minus 3 points. A slight
recovery in after hours trading saw June end at 3,083. Volume at the close
of business stood at 11,732 contracts.
Turnover in traded options remained poor though it improved on Monday's
meagre levels. A total of 24,647 lots were traded of which 13,119 was in the
FT-SE 100 option and 1,714 in the Euro FT-SE. Stock

FT  25 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 3,100 lost again on interest
rate worries - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London equity market, badly upset by weakness in US securities
overnight, made only very little recovery in late dealings yesterday despite
a brighter opening in both the Dow Average and New York Federal bonds.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index down 19.3 at 3,089.1, only three
points above the day's low. London was following the closing trend in other
European centres where bonds extended earlier losses ahead of the money
market repo auction at the Bundesbank today.
The equity market remained nervous over the outlook for inflation and for
interest rates, and followed the downturn in German and French markets as
they returned from the Whit Monday break to react sharply to comments from
the president of the Bundesbank which had been interpreted as indicating
that falls in German interest rates would now be reined in.
At the same time, the tumble in New York bonds reinforced fears by many
London analysts, including Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, that the
Federal Reserve might still tighten credit policy further, even after last
week's decisive action.
Share prices hung fire at first in London, which had made its response to
the Bundesbank interest rate warning on Monday when other leading European
markets were closed. The Footsie clung on to the important 3,100 benchmark
for the first hour but then turned sharply downwards as US trading houses
began to sell the stock index future.
The slide deepened as markets absorbed news that German M3 money supply had
continued to grow well outside the Bundesbank preferred range in April.
After a brief pause, the setback was renewed as London waited nervously for
New York to open.
When the Dow Average came in higher, showing a 16 point gain in early
trading, London tried to rally. But shares turned down again when UK
government bonds extended losses to close more than a point down at the long
end of the range.
Confidence was not helped by company trading reports. Shares in Marks and
Spencer fell heavily despite record profits as the monarch of the UK high
street retailers warned of tough competitive conditions in Europe and
uncertainty over the UK consumer recovery.
Trading volume was not heavy, however, with only 555.7m shares traded
through the Seaq electronic network. On Monday, when London volume was
curbed by the closure of most European markets, 417.1m shares traded through
Seaq, returning a retail worth of only Pounds 983.6m, one of the lowest
daily totals for the year.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, the measuring rod of the broader market which has
been falling steadily for the past fortnight, shed a further 17.9 to
3,691.4.
Investors clearly remained cautious as the market moved into a week somewhat
lacking in economic pointers from the leading economies. US bond markets
face a series of federal fund raisings this week, but economic data will be
thin until next week when US leading indicators, unemployment and personal
expenditure figures are due.
London analysts were hoping last night that US markets, and also the dollar,
would continue to respond favourably to the resumption of the US - Japan
trade talks which was announced just before London closed yesterday.

FT  25 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities mixed as bond
rally subsides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks finished at mixed levels yesterday after a rally in the bond
market lost steam in the late afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 2.76 higher at 3,745.17 after
climbing by as much as 24 points by midday. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.61 at 454.81 on moderate NYSE volume of 280m shares.
In the secondary markets, an unturn by technology stocks pushed the Nasdaq
composite 6.52 higher to 731.47.
Early in the session, the knock-on effect which has been sweeping through
the US financial markets in recent days was working in favour of stocks. The
previous day, a sharp rise in commodity prices and a softer dollar had
triggered a big sell-off in bonds and a subsequent downturn in stocks.
Yesterday commodity prices eased while the dollar gained ground against the
yen on news that Washington and Tokyo had agreed to resume framework talks
on trade.
In response, the benchmark 30-year government bond was posting solid gains
and stocks followed them higher. But when an afternoon auction of Dollars
17bn two-year notes proved to be a mild disappointment, the long bond
slipped well below its session highs. Stocks mostly finished near their
opening levels.
Equity investors had a smattering of quarterly results to consider but the
outcome was not uniformly favourable.
On the positive side, Dell Computer posted quarterly earnings of 42 cents a
share, against 25 cents a year ago, and its share price jumped Dollars 3 to
Dollars 29 on the news.
The computer sector was generally stronger. IBM advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 63 1/4 and Storage Technology was Dollars 3 1/8 better at Dollars
32. Lotus Development led the Nasdaq technology sector, climbing Dollars 3
1/4 to Dollars 65 1/2 .
On the negative side, Deere, the US farm machinery maker, posted record net
income of Dollars 2.20 in its second quarter, against a restated Dollars
1.30 a year earlier, but the improvement failed to feed through to its share
price. The stock slipped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 72 5/8 after an initial
jump of Dollars 1 1/2 .
The decline was partly because the company warned its production would
likely slow in the second half. The pessimism carried over in other cyclical
stocks. Caterpillar dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 108 1/4 and Alcoa lost
Dollars 1 to Dollars 69 5/8 .
Philip Morris gave back Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 53 3/4 after outperforming
the market during the previous session. With a board meeting scheduled for
today, the company has come under mounting pressure by institutional
investors to spin off its non-tobacco businesses.
In healthcare, Medical Care America jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 27 3/8 . The
company, the largest operator of out-patient clinics in the US, agreed to be
acquired by Columbia HCA Healthcare in a deal valued at Dollars 858m.
Columbia HCA, a leading hospital group, dropped Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 39
1/8 .
Early on, Merck improved Dollars 1 1/2 amid speculation that Lawrence
Bossidy, Allied Signal's chief executive, would take over as the
pharmaceutical group's chairman. Later, after Mr Bossidy issued a denial,
the share price ended up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 30 7/8 .
Canada
Toronto's TSE 300 composite fell 11.40 to 4286.98 in volume of 44.4m.
shares. Trading value declined to CDollars 523.1m from CDollars 644.5m.
All but two of the 14 stock groups ended in negative territory. Golds were
off 1.24 per cent, banks and industrial products fell slightly and mining
and energy were flat. Consumer products rose 1.43 per cent on index.
Northern Telecom fell  5/8 to 42 7/8 . Motorola's Land Mobile Products
Sector extended by two years the pact under which Northern Telecom supplies
it with specialised mobile switching systems. The deal is worth USDollars
100m to Northern Telecom over four years.
Brazil
A mild buying spree sparked by bullish comments from the chairman of
Brazil's debt steering committee spurred stocks to close 1.5 per cent higher
in quiet trading on the Sao Paulo bourse.
The Bovespa index rose 315 to 21,278 in turnover of Cr291.3bn.
Mexico
Equities rose on the back of Telmex ADRs. Investors on the Mexican Stock
Exchange kept a close eye on Telmex's movement in New York and shadowed its
gains. The company's local stocks matched ADR advances and constituted well
over 50 per cent of transactions, traders said.
The IPC index closed up 37.09, or 1.53 per cent, at 2,468.52 in moderately
heavy volume of 175.2m shares.

FT  25 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rising hopes on US trade
talks help Nikkei ahead
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that US and Japanese trade officials had agreed to resume bilateral
framework talks encouraged investors, and share prices ended a volatile
session slightly higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index gained ground for the fifth consecutive day, rising
53.41 to 20,622.12 as the Topix index of all first section stocks advanced
1.41 to 1,655.62. The 225 fell to a day's low of 20,501.00 in the morning
session and peaked at 20,748.75, falling short of 20,781.98, the high for
this year.
Profit-taking depressed share prices in the morning session, but buying by
arbitrageurs, along with foreign and domestic institutional investors pushed
share prices higher. Index-linked selling and profit-taking towards the end
of the session eroded some of the gains.
Volume totalled 550m shares against 388m. The Nikkei 300 index rose 0.17 to
302.67 while gainers led losers by 621 to 421, with 148 unchanged. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.71 to 1,357.63.
Traders were encouraged by active buying on the part of domestic
institutions. However, a Japanese broker said that heavy selling around
21,000 will make it hard for the index to rise much further.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y15,000 to Y842,000, rebounding for
the first time in eight consecutive days. East Japan Railway, on the other
hand, lost ground for the third straight day, falling Y1,000 to Y505,000.
Large capital steels, which led Monday's index rise, eased gently on
profit-taking. Nippon Steel fell Y1 to Y368 and Kawasaki Steel lost Y2 to
Y399. Banks were lower ahead of their earnings announcements tomorrow.
Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y3,230 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost
Y40 to Y1,990.
The likely resumption of the deadlocked US-Japan bilateral trade talks
brought investors' attention back to the automobile sector, which is one of
the central issues on trade between the two countries. Nissan Motor added
Y27 to Y884 and Toyota Motor gained Y60 to Y2,090.
Higher commodity prices pushed up non-ferrous metals, shipping and
shipbuilders. Sumitomo Metal Mining rose Y16 to Y944, Navix Line by Y11 to
Y379 and Hitachi Zosen by Y3 to Y563.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 91.90 to 22,711.49 in volume of 27.2m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y190 to Y6,310 on weak earnings figures
released on Monday.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets were in subdued mood yesterday.
HONG KONG finished weaker on selling triggered by the overnight fall on Wall
Street. However, volume was thin as investors awaited fresh developments on
financing for Hong Kong's airport and US renewal of China's preferred trade
status.
The Hang Seng index slid 99.67 or 1.0 per cent, to 9,490.11 in turnover that
fell to HKDollars 3.9bn from Monday's HKDollars 4.3bn.
SINGAPORE was dragged lower by big falls in index stocks although trading
was mostly subdued. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 36.45 or 1.6
per cent lower at 2,302.86. Yeo Hiap Seng, however, rose 8 cents to SDollars
4.08 in volume of 5.7m as speculators continued to buy amid anticipation of
a takeover by Ng Teng Fong.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly lower as investors worried about the overnight fall
on Wall Street and domestic inflation. The composite index closed 11.84 or
1.2 per cent lower at 987.26 although activity was restricted ahead of a
national holiday today.
TAIPEI saw late selling after earlier attempts at a technical rebound
failed, and the weighted index ended 48.56 lower at 5,769.12, off a high of
5,835. Turnover was a slow TDollars 32.67bn.
The weak performance was attributed to local reports that the Taiwan
exchange planned to downgrade eight shares to the second category from the
first because of their poor profit performance in the past four years. All
eight shares fell, with Taiwan Paper and Oriental Union limit down to
TDollars 28.70 and TDollars 30.10, respectively.
SYDNEY lost some ground in afternoon trade as profit-takers emerged, but
still ended higher on the day in response to firmer gold and resource
prices. The All Ordinaries index finished 11.4 higher at 2,132.4, after a
high of 2,143.6, while the gold marker closed 59.2 or 2.5 per cent ahead at
2,373.3, its highest level since March 29. .
News Corp leapt 29 cents to ADollars 9.29 after announcing a Dollars 500m
joint venture with New World Communications under which Mr Rupert Murdoch's
Fox television network will take 12 stations from its three network rivals.
WELLINGTON was helped ahead by the commodities-inspired rally in Australia,
and the NZSE-40 capital index finished 17.98 higher at 2,156.22 in moderate
volume.
Carter Holt Harvey, which reports annual results today added 12 cents to
NZDollars 3.90 amid market expectations for net profit of NZDollars 310m
against NZDollars 243.5m a year ago.
MANILA eased on profit-taking after Monday's strong but gold issues gained
on the metal's sharp rise overnight. The composite index lost 20.19 to
2,901.98 in volume of 1.78bn shares after Monday's 751.4m.
SHANGHAI's B share index fel 12.46 or 1.6 per cent to 769.56 on
profit-taking by domestic investors after Monday's 4.6 per cent surge.
SEOUL ended mixed as cheaper shares advanced on selective buying while blue
chips continued their consolidation. The composite stock index gained 0.39
to 945.89.
BOMBAY closed lower on renewed selling by speculators affected by the
continuing ban on carry forward trading. The BSE 30-share index lost 32.90
to 3,704.33.

<TEXT>
Continental Europe, Milan and Madrid apart, came back from holiday and
caught up with some painful events; bond markets fell after Monday's losses
in London and bourses followed suit, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT reflected Monday's sharp fall in June bund futures in London, from
95.30 to 94.68 on LIFFE, but dealers were surprised as the Dax index dropped
by 50.93, or 2.3 per cent to 2,198.72 during the official session.
Turnover eased from DM7.2bn to DM7bn. Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in
Frankfurt, said that she had expected a fall of around 20 Dax points to
cover the weakness in bonds following comments from the Bundesbank
president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, which were taken to mean that there would be
no more official German interest rate cuts in the near future. However,
German equities were probably suffering from their outperformance in recent
months.
The Bundesbank added yesterday that April's M3 German money supply grew by
an annualised 15.8 per cent, up from 15.4 per cent a month earlier. After
this, the Dax was unable to hold up against a further drop in bund futures,
indicated at 94.41 in late afternoon, and the Ibis index tested its support
level of 2,180 with a low of 2,177.72 before recovering to close the day at
2,188.01.
PARIS lost a percentage point, a little worse than the European average, and
dealers blamed liquidation of positions on the last day of the May account.
Some of the interest rate-sensitive financials took more than their fair
share of the losses as the CAC-40 index closed 22.11 lower at 2,133.32, Axa
losing FFr39 at FFr1,346 and Suez FFr8 at FFr309.50; but here, too, local
professionals found a domestic reason: profit-taking.
Companies in, or potentially in the news were not popular. Eurotunnel
dropped another FFr1.65 to FFr31.25; Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Securities
said that the market was expecting terms for the company's mammoth rights
issue to be set today.
Some cyclicals, meanwhile, seemed to see a continuation of last week's
switching into more defensive stocks: Alcatel dropped FFr19 at FFr643 and
Michelin FFr7.30 at FFr232.60; the tyre company was exposed to higher US
interest rates, noted Mr Woodcock, who added that the Balladur measures to
stimulate consumption were now expected merely to advance demand from the
second half of this year into the first, leaving the automotive industry
with little benefit over the year as a whole.
ZURICH fell 1.5 per cent in response to worries about the outlook for
interest rates. The SMI index lost 40.7 to 2,692.0 although some late buying
helped the market up from a low of 2,681. Sandoz registered finished SFr24
lower at SFr692 after an early SFr680 in response to the agreed Dollars
3.7bn bid for Gerber Products, the largest maker of baby foods in the US.
Mrs Birgit Kulhoff at UBS in Zurich, who viewed the bid as a positive
development, believed that the link would open the US market for Sandoz
healthcare products, although it would not help Gerber to enter the European
baby food market, which was already crowded. Gerber would, however, benefit
from Sandoz's presence in Asian markets.
Mrs Kulhoff thought that the shares had come under pressure because
investors were unjustifiably worried that the bid price was too high and
that the deal might indicate that Sandoz would no longer be concentrating on
the pharmaceutical side of its business.
Roche certificates, under pressure this month after the group's Dollars
5.3bn bid for Syntex, the US drugs company, lost another SFr105 to SFr6,050.
BK Vision, the investment fund controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking
group, fell SFr30 or 1.9 per cent to SFr1,510 following the announcement
that it recorded a SFr30.1m loss in the first four months of this year after
a SFr9.9m profit during the same 1993 period.
MILAN was under renewed pressure early in the day as foreign and domestic
investors continued to take profits. But local buying emerged late in the
session and the Comit index eased just 2.73 to 755.24.
Fiat was one of the front runners in both directions. The shares were marked
down to L6,510 before rebounding to finish L149 higher on the day at L6,836.
Mediobanca, L501 or 3 per cent lower at L16,211, was hard hit by newspaper
reports that the merchant bank knew of hidden losses at Ferruzzi long before
the information was made public.
Fondiaria, the Ferruzzi group's insurance arm, fell L131 to L15,779 in
response to news that magistrates had questioned a senior executive over
various property deals.
Construction stocks advanced on suggestions that the new Berlusconi
government was considering measures to free public works projects frozen due
to the corruption scandals and the recession. Italcementi rose L460 to
L15,341, Cogefar gained L95 to L2,337, and Calcestruzzi was up L218 at
L12,669.
AMSTERDAM saw early losses reduced as US markets opened firmer and the AEX
index finished 4.48 lower at 408.29.
Chemicals came under pressure on the view that they had been overbought
recently, DSM falling Fl 4 to Fl 132.60 and Akzo Fl 3.40 to Fl 209.30.
Elsevier was Fl 3.20 lower at Fl 175.80 on profit-taking.
News of Sandoz's bid for Gerber sparked buying in Nutricia, the baby and
health foods group that has been viewed as a likely takeover candidate for
some years. The shares, marked Fl 5 higher at one stage, finished Fl 2.50
ahead at Fl 83.00.
MADRID saw some late buying following an upturn on Wall Street, and the
general index closed just 1.39 lower at 336.52.
However, turnover remained subdued at Pta27.3bn and there was still more
life in secondary stocks than in the big blue chips.
ATHENS fell another 3.7 per cent as investors shunned shares and instead
turned their attention to bank repos, currently yielding around 40 per cent
on an annual basis.
The general index fell 32.83 to 854.25 in active volume of 1.8m shares - a
decline of 10 per cent since May 13, when the drachma came under pressure
and the Greek central bank drove interest rates up to defend the currency.
TEL AVIV dropped again following Monday's official interest rate increase,
the Mishtanim index losing 6.53, or 3.3 per cent at 189.67 for an aggregate
fall of around 8 per cent since Sunday morning.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Trade boost for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar finished higher yesterday as markets responded positively to news
that the US and Japan plan to resume framework trade talks, writes Philip
Gawith.
The US currency closed in London at Y104.445, up from Y104.400 on Monday and
an intra-day low of Y103.90. The dollar was also pulled higher against the
D-Mark, finishing in London at DM1.6478 from DM1.6456.
Analysts cautioned that although the resumption of talks was positive, it
was not the same as reaching agreement. But the feeling was that it probably
underpinned the dollar in the short term.
Elsewhere, trade in Europe was fairly quiet following Monday's holiday. The
D-Mark was generally stronger. The Bundesbank announced another variable
rate repo.
The futures markets were again very volatile, with euromarks regaining some
of their recent losses, and eurosterling losing ground.
The announcement by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, that the US
and Japan would end the three-month stalemate in trade talks is significant.
Some analysts trace recent dollar weakness to the collapse of the trade
talks in February.
Although the interim period has been chastening for both parties - Japanese
exporters have been hurt by the strong yen, while the weakness in US bond
markets has been linked to the ailing dollar - the tenor of yesterday's
announcements made clear that a difficult path lies ahead.
Amid all the fine words, Mr Kantor's claim that the Clinton administration
would expand trade with Japan, 'one way or the other', sounded suspiciously
like a threat.
The aim of the trade talks is to try and reduce Japan's Dollars 131bn
bilateral trade surplus. Mr Kantor said Japan had agreed on the need to
stimulate its economy with a 'substantial' macro-economic package, and
reiterated a commitment to bring about a 'highly significant' cut in its
current account surplus.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said the
announcement had 'provided the dollar with some support, but had not been
the catalyst to take out key technical resistance.' He said there were still
sellers of dollars in the market.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at the Bank of America in London,
commented: 'It will be perceived by the market as a further indication that
US policy against the yen has changed.' He said the dollar was probably now
underpinned at Y103.50, but 'you will need to see progress before the market
starts buying the dollar aggressively again.' Mr Hawkins said the lows of
the dollar had probably been seen.
A fairly large drop in the German repo today could lend more support to the
revival of the dollar. But analysts are not predicting it, nor do call money
rates make it likely. Rates firmed to 5.30/5.40 per cent from 5/5.12 on
Friday (German markets were closed on Monday), driven by tighter liquidity
conditions and the recent rise in euromark futures.
With call money above the repo rate of 5.23 per cent, analysts are
predicting a fall of 3-5 basis points in the repo rate. Ms Alison Cottrell,
international economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'After recent
Bundesbank comments - ie no continuation of the step-by-step easing for the
time being, it would be bizarre for Frankfurt immediately to sanction a
sharp fall in the repo rate.'
The case for lower rates was not helped by the release of the April M3
figure, showing that money supply grew, year on year, by 15.8 per cent.
Ironically, the M3 number, which was better than some had expected, was
cited as one reason why euromark futures performed better. The December
contract settled 9 basis points firmer at 94.77. Volumes were again high,
with the December contract trading nearly 60,000 lots.
Other possible factors were short covering and the fact that the Bundesbank
announced a variable rate repo. Some had feared a fixed rate repo as a means
of slowing the recent fall in rates.
Analysts were bemused by the fall in eurosterling futures. The December
contract closed 4 basis points lower at 93.95. One possible explanation was
nervousness ahead of today's gilt auction.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said the market was 'verging on
the schizophrenic'. 'Most traders have never known a market like this,' he
lamented.
In Europe the Danish krone finished at DKr3.916 to the D-Mark from DKr3.911
after poorer than expected inflation data. Year on year consumer prices rose
by 2.1 per cent compared to market expectations of a 1.8 per cent increase.
Mr Cunningham of UBS said the currency weakness reflected the market view
that Denmark might not be able to make the interest rate cuts required to
stimulate growth.
Sterling had a steady day, rising from DM2.4789 to DM2.4856. In the money
markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 1.016bn assistance to clear a
Pounds 1bn shortage.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee stock sales agreed as
surge continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As coffee futures surged to fresh seven-year peaks in London yesterday the
president of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries admitted that
prices had become 'a bit exaggerated'.
Robusta prices at the London Commodity exchange staged another spectacular
rise, putting them 100 per cent above their level at the start of the year.
The July contract reached a high of Dollars 2,480 a tonne before closing
Dollars 52 up at Dollars 2,348. The New York market was also buoyant early
on, the July arabica price touching 141.8 cents a pound, but in late trading
it was 4.15 down at 132.5 cents.
The markets shrugged off news that the ACPC had agreed to release the
remaining 50 per cent of stocks held back under last October's export
retention scheme. These 2m bags will be released between July and September,
although some may be freed in the current quarter to meet demand.
'We have an interest in doing this in the most orderly way so as not to
create problems for the market,' said Mr Rubens Antonio Barbosa, president
of the association and Brazil's ambassador to Britain. He added that the
timing of the release was up to individual countries, although he expected
the 900,000 bags held by central American countries to come on to the market
first.
Mr Barbosa thought the supply shortages that, with falling consumer stocks,
are underpinning prices, would last 'quite some time'. So far there were no
signs that plantings would be stepped up as a result of the price rise.
He stressed the bullish fundamentals for the market but added that 'the
problem' was that prices were now being driven by speculative buying from
hedge and investment funds.
Mr Barbosa declined to be drawn on what would constitute a sensible level
for the market, but pointed out that prices were still below half the levels
they reached in 1986 and 1987. On Monday Mr Guy Alain-Gauze, the Ivory Coast
commodities minister, told the Reuter newes agency that 'an equilibrium
price' for London would be around Dollars 2,000 a tonne.
The president of the ACPC, which has about 30 members representing 90 per
cent of world production, has approached other producing countries such as
Vietnam and Swaziland to encourage them to join.
By abiding by the provisions of the export retention scheme, the ACPC,
created last September, had shown it 'means business', said Mr Barbosa. 'As
time goes by, I think it will be taken increasingly into consideration as a
factor that will affect the market.'
The two-day meeting of the organisation in London agreed to set up three
groups: to promote coffee consumption, to co-ordinate production policies,
and to handle organisational matters.
There were no plans to raise the trigger prices that dictate when export
retention stops and when stocks are released in the light of the vertiginous
rise in prices, Mr Barbosa said. 'If prices drop, we'll see. We'll convene
another meeting.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tomato experiment ready
to bear fruit - Shiraz Sidhva on a PepsiCo project that is helping Punjabi
growers to produce more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Zahura, a village in Punjab's Hoshiarpur district, PepsiCo
fully-automated tomato processing plant is a riot of red as lorry loads of
luscious fruit are pulverised into paste.
This is not only Asia's biggest food processing plant - with a capacity of
650 tonnes a day - but also a test case for the potential of India's nascent
food processing industry, which has attracted domestic and foreign
investment worth over Rs300bn (Pounds 6.35bn) in the past two years, more
than any other sector except power.
Pepsi, which started operations in India two years before the country
embarked on its liberalisation programme in July 1991, was forced to meet a
large export obligation; and the American multinational turned that
obligation into an interesting agricultural experiment that the company
hopes will yield profits soon.
Never having built a processing plant on such a large scale before, the
company had to devise it from scratch. 'We went through a very expensive and
long learning curve, with no validated data to help us,' explains Mr RPS
Dhaliwal, plant manager of Pepsi Foods, the company's Indian subsidiary.
That was five years ago. Today, the plant exports 80 per cent of its 40,000
tonnes-a-year production. It also supplies the Indian subsidiaries of Nestle
and Unilever, for their domestic ketchup brands.
When Pepsi started its Indian operations it faced tremendous hostility from
politicians and farmers alike, especially when the company chose to build
the plant in the Punjab, India's most prosperous agricultural state. Critics
felt strongly that the multinational would exploit farmers in the region for
its own commercial gain. Today, however, those farmers are very happy to
sell their tomatoes to the factory.
Mr Hoshiar Singh, who farms nearby in Tanda, says tomato growers in Sirsa
and Tohana who supply Pepsi are pleased with the way the company deals with
them. According to him, the region has benefitted from better farming
techniques introduced by the company.
'It may be true that a big company makes a lot more money than we do,' he
says. 'But they have taught us how to increase our yield and the commercial
gain is bound to benefit us all.'
The plant, which was built quite cheaply, at a cost of Rs220m, buzzes with
activity during the 65-day season beginning at the end of April, when it
runs to full capacity. Pepsi's biggest challenge at the moment is to make
use of the plant's capacity outside this short season. It is trying to add
ten days to the season by getting supplies from the mountainous Himachal
Pradesh state bordering Punjab and hopes to develop new techniques to extend
it to 110 days. Recently it has diversified into red chilli paste, producing
2,000 tonnes a year for export.
The Pepsi Agro Food Processing Research Institute has taught its suppliers
new cultivation and disease-prevention techniques, helping them to increase
yields from 25 to 30 tonnes a hectare and ensuring that the tomatoes conform
to international standards of colour, texture and flavour.
Two years ago, Pepsi, to use a senior manager's words, 'went berserk' trying
to work out a system whereby farmers would bring only as many tomatoes as
could be processed each day. 'They would land up at the factory with far
more tomatoes than we needed on a particular day and insist we bought them,'
says Mr Muktesh Pant, executive director, exports, now in charge of Pepsi's
Season's Harvest fruit juice venture. But Mr Dhaliwal says that the problems
have been overcome. An in-house nursery provides control over the phasing of
tomatoes. 'We have fine-tuned ourselves to such an extent, that we now issue
quota slips specifying quantities and dates of supply. Our payment system
ensures that farmers get paid at their homes on every 10th day.'
The company says it is not yet making profits. 'But we have maintained our
tomato prices over the last two years,' says Mr Dhaliwal.
Pepsi's plans include using the plant to produce apple and pear puree when
the tomato season is over. It has spent Rs15m to upgrade its facilities,
introducing a small dehydration unit for apples and mushrooms.
The fully-automated plant, imported mostly from Italy, needs not more than
three to four people to operate it. And increased utilisation remains
Pepsi's top priority.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lease rates signal puzzles gold
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gold market is mulling over the possible significance of a fall in gold
lease rates to an all-time low of only 0.6 per cent.
'The market is sending a message - but it is impossible to decipher at
present,' says Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. It may
be at a turning point, he says. But whether it is ready for another leg of
the bull market or whether prices will fall is not clear.
He points out the gold bullion market is particularly liquid at present for
at least four reasons:
Much gold was swapped for US dollars in advance of what was seen as an
inevitable increase in US interest rates at the May 17 meeting of the
Federal Reserve, the US central bank;
More central banks are willing to lend gold and to lend it for longer
(lending in this case meaning that the metal is sold for cash while at the
same time the seller arranges a futures contract to buy it back later);
Producers, usually borrowers of gold, have been buying back forward sales;
And renewed gold futures buying by US funds in May led to extra gold lending
because commercial banks offset futures positions by buying then lending
gold.
Mr Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of American Precious Metals Advisors,
suggests in his latest MetalsFAX newsletter that net sales of gold last year
by central banks and other official bodies amounted to 'a fantastic' 900 to
1,000 tonnes, up from 653 tonnes in 1992, a year that included 400 tonnes
sold by the Dutch central bank.
His estimate is far ahead of that from Gold Fields Minerals Services, which
in its recent annual review put net official sales at 475 tonnes. Mr Nichols
says his estimate reflects 'several hundred tonnes of Saudi Arabian gold
sales in 1993. The Saudis have been large-scale sellers of gold from
'invisible' or unrecorded holdings.'
Mr Nichols also contends that the quantity of gold consumed by the jewellery
industry in the US, and possibly other industrial nations, is 'significantly
greater than generally believed.' He suggests jewellery consumed 2,643
tonnes of gold last year compared with the GFMS estimate of 2,302 tonnes.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: British industrial fishing plan
under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government came under fierce attack yesterday for inviting
applications from fishing vessels to catch capelin, a small fish eaten by
endangered stocks of cod, off Greenland.
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations called the decision
'astonishing' when stocks of white fish had reached virtual collapse.
'This decision is a signal to all that the UK supports industrial fishing
and is in direct contradiction of the government's public stance against
it,' said Mr Richard Banks, the federation's chief executive.
'The wrong signals will now be sent to the European Commission and other
industrial fishing nations, such as Denmark and Norway, that the minister
(Mr Michael Jack) is the champion of industrial fishing.'
The federation said that industrial fishing was widely condemned in the UK
because it denied feedstock to fish and birds and caught young fish before
they had a chance to breed.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds called the move 'a potential
disaster for wildlife'. It said that Greenland cod stocks were at an
all-time low.
'The government should not gamble with long-term fish stocks and important
wildlife populations for short-term commercial gain,' said Dr Patricia
Bradley, RSPB aquatic unit manager.
Mr Jack, fisheries minister, announced the decision last week, saying it was
in response to a request from the fleet. He said the quota for capelin was
based on the best available scientific evidence. 'There is no question of
over-exploitation as the EU's share of the fishery for 1993 was not taken,'
he said.

FT  25 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa hits 6 1/4 -year highs -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<TEXT>
London COCOA futures surged to 6 1/4 -year highs yesterday as investment
fund buying swamped the market, leaving many in the trade wrong-footed.
The July contract closed at Pounds 1,066 a tonne, up Pounds 68, after
touching Pounds 1,085 at one stage. 'It looks very, very good. It's a got a
strong base and the upside potential is a couple of hundred pounds,' one
trader said.
At the London Metal Exchange three months COPPER hit a 16-month peak of
Dollars 2,335 a tonne in the morning, underpinned by speculative buying,
fund interest and short-covering. But profit-taking set in and the price was
trimmed to Dollars 2,296.50, up Dollars 19.50 on balance. Most other LME
contracts lost early gains.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds fall again as hopes fade of further
cuts in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German government bonds suffered further declines yesterday after figures
showed continued rapid growth in the money supply. The June bund future fell
0.30 per cent to 94.38.
The money supply numbers fuelled fears that further cuts in official
interest rates are unlikely, although a small reduction in the minimum repo
rate at the Bundesbank's open-market operation today is expected.
'Today has been a continuation of the sell-off that started on Friday for
the overall market and of the shift in the yield curve that started on
Thursday afternoon,' after comments by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer,
said Mr Karl Haeling, head of the futures and options group at Deutsche Bank
in Frankfurt.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments were taken to mean that there would be no more
official German interest rate cuts in the near future.
'Tietmeyer's comments have triggered a big change in sentiment and investors
have sold the short end and bought long because they are expecting a slowing
down in the easing process,' Mr Haeling said.
Analysts said that there was also some concern about rising commodity prices
although the rises were to some extent a bounce-back from very low levels.
German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 15.8 per cent in April,
up from the 15.4 per cent rise seen in March and still well above the
Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target range.
The bund market took some cheer from the announcement that today's
allocation of securities repurchase agreements, or 'repos', by the
Bundesbank will be at variable rather than fixed rates. A survey of German
money market traders by MMS International forecast a three basis point drop
in the lowest accepted repo rate to 5.20 per cent from last week's 5.23 per
cent.
UK government bonds also fell back ahead of today's convertible gilt auction
as the market tracked developments in bunds.
Today's auction of the new 7.0 per cent 1997 gilt, convertible into 9.0 per
cent 2012 bonds, has not attracted a great deal of interest so far, analysts
said, mainly because of the difficulty of pricing the first convertible gilt
to be issued since 1987.
Analysts said that it was valued at around 100 13/16 in 'when issued'
trading yesterday. A bid-to-cover ratio of about two is expected.
In late trading, the UK long gilt future was down almost  29/32 points at
104 9/16 .
French bonds caught up with Monday's losses in the German market, causing
the notional government bond future to fall 1.12 points from Friday to
120.46.
As expected, the French central bank left its key intervention rate
unchanged at 5.40 per cent and traders are watching the German repo
allocation for further clues on the direction of interest rates.
However, most were betting on only a modest drop in the repo rate, offering
France little scope for further easing.
Japanese government bond futures rose, supported by the successful auction
of the new 3.9 per cent 10-year bonds.
The bid-to-cover ratio of 2.32 reflected healthy demand, especially from
retail investors attracted by the issue price below par, a trader said. The
average issue price was 99.44.
The September JGB futures contract rose 0.27 points to 112.80 in Tokyo and
climbed to 112.91 in London.
US Treasury bonds improved yesterday but prices receded from their session
highs after an afternoon auction of two-year notes failed to generate much
enthusiasm.
Late in the session, the 30-year government bond was  11/32 higher at 86
9/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.396 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 1/4 , yielding 5.897 per cent.
Although the trading week had begun with a big sell-off, the market found
room for optimism early in the session. Monday's downturn mostly reflected a
sharp rise in commodity prices. Yesterday, the market was relieved as the
Commodity Research Bureau index declined, largely because the outlook for
grain harvests had deteriorated.
Concerns over the dollar also eased as news that Washington and Tokyo would
resume framework talks on trade helped the US currency gain ground against
the yen.
The market also rose amid confidence over the prospects for a successful
Treasury auction of two-year notes later in the day. The last government
auction had been a big let-down, and fears of a repeat performance sent a
shiver through the market on Monday.
In the event, the Dollars 17bn issue was awarded at a slightly higher yield
than expected. The mild disappointment raised fresh concerns about today's
Dollars 11bn sale of five-year notes, which are usually more difficult to
digest than the shorter-term paper. As a result, the solid gains struck
early in the session were eroded in the final hours of trading.

A second tranche of the Portuguese Smaller Companies Fund for institutional

Bear Sterns is lead manager. The Portuguese arm of Deutsche Bank and Lisbon
brokers Midas Investimento will assist in the Dollars 50m placement.
A first Dollars 25m tranche of the five-year, closed-end equity fund, which
is traded on the Luxembourg stock exchange, was placed in December. Mr Joao
Rendeiro, chairman of Gerigeste, the fund's managers, said it had so far
gained 15 per cent, compared with 4 per cent for the Portuguese equity
market as a whole.
The fund is focused on non-financial companies. The placing will make it the
second biggest Portuguese equity fund after the broader-based Capital
Portugal Fund.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Institutions on the sidelines

<TEXT>
Two large sterling issues helped the eurobond market creak back into action
after the widespread public holiday closures on Monday. But syndicate
managers found scant cheer, noting that the big institutional players
remained on the sidelines.
Royal Bank of Scotland's Pounds 150m offering of 21-year paper soaked up
what institutional demand there was in the market. The bonds were priced to
yield 125 basis points above the 9 per cent gilt due 2012, the most liquid
equivalent bond.
The issue was aimed at UK groups with long-term investment needs and
represented Royal Bank's first foray into the eurosterling sector since the
middle of last year.
Lead manager UBS said a 'good proportion' of the bonds had been placed but
they would remain in syndicate overnight due to volatility in the gilt
market.
The other big sterling deal was carried out by DSL Finance which issued
Pounds 100m of five-year debt priced to yield 34 basis points above the
relevant gilt. Traders said the pricing was too aggressive. They noted that
the spread on the recent Credit Local offering had widened to 40 basis
points over gilts from a launch spread of 37 basis points.
Later in the afternoon DSL Bank issued Dollars 300m of five-year paper
priced to yield 22 basis points above the equivalent US Treasury.
KfW, Germany's state-owned export financing and development aid bank, tapped
the dragon bond market for the first time when it raised Dollars 300m
through an offering of five-year bonds.
Joint bookrunners Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank said the bonds, which
carry a coupon of 7 per cent, were well received throughout the Asia Pacific
region and added that a number of European names also took up tranches.
However, some London dealers said that, although it was one of the
best-priced deals of the day, the yield spread still widened when it began
to trade. The spread on issue was 24 basis points over five-year Treasuries
but widened later to 27 basis points.
KfW's closeness to German government debt enhanced the appeal of its bonds
to Asian investors: to date the embryonic dragon bond market has largely
been the preserve of non-corporates.
Attractive arbitrage opportunities encouraged Kredietbank, the big Belgian
commercial bank, to launch a CDollars 100m issue of five-year eurobonds. The
borrower is believed to have swapped the proceeds into floating-rate
dollars, achieving a sub-Libor cost of funding. Lead manager ABN Amro said
the bonds were targeted at Belgian retail investors who want to roll over
their Canadian dollar investments which are due to mature in the next month.
Elsewhere, Eurofima's SKr800m launch of five-year bonds offered investors
current-coupon paper in a sector which has seen yields widen by around 250
basis points in recent months.

euroconvertible debentures.
The money was originally to be used to fund the construction of a Dollars

capital.
Bangkok Land president, Mr Anant Kanjanapas, explained that international
demand for euroconvertibles had softened considerably since the rise in US
interest rates.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Suzuki sales suffer at home and
abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weak export markets, particularly in Europe, and low demand for motorcycles
in Japan were behind a 10 per cent drop in pre-tax profits in the year to
end-March to Y18.4bn (Dollars 176.24m) from Y20.5bn last time at Suzuki, the
car and motorcycle manufacturer.
Suzuki, which specialises in smaller cars, reported a 4 per cent decline in
sales to Y1,009bn from Y1,053bn. Net profits declined 12 per cent to Y7bn
from Y8bn.
The yen's appreciation was a large factor behind the deterioration in
overseas revenues which fell by Y12.5bn, Suzuki said.
Suzuki took an appraisal loss of Y2.3bn for its stake in Santana Motor, its
ailing Spanish subsidiary which stopped production in March. The company is
still in negotiations with the Spanish government over Santana's fate,
Suzuki said.
Motorcycle sales were depressed particularly in Japan while demand in Latin
America and China was firm.
In contrast, passenger car sales held up well in the domestic market while
exports, particularly to Europe, were weak.
The company expects sales in the current year to remain flat at about
Y1,000bn and pre-tax profits to fall to Y18bn amid continuing pressures from
the high yen. It also foresees motorcycle and car sales declining further in
unit terms and warns that its financial balance sheet is likely to
deteriorate as a result of its need to refinance outstanding debt issues.
Hino Motors, the Japanese truck and bus manufacturer, yesterday reported a
sharp fall in parent company profits due to the continuing slump in the
Japanese economy and the impact of the strong yen.
Sales in the year to the end of March fell 15 per cent to Y535.5bn from
Y632.3bn while pre-tax profits declined 33 per cent to Y4bn from a previous
Y6bn.
Domestic sales of trucks were particularly hard hit, falling 15 per cent,
while exports were down 3 per cent largely due to the yen's rise.
Hino expects its performance in the current year to improve with pre-tax
profits rising to Y4.5bn.

red

<TEXT>
Seiko, the Japanese watch and clock maker, plunged further into the red
during the year to March 31, reporting a 12-month consolidated pre-tax loss
of Y6.5bn (Dollars 62m) against a deficit of Y3.4bn a year earlier.
The company, which is a world-renowned brand, blamed weak demand for its
core products and the costs of restructuring its overseas operations for the
gloomy financial report.
Revenues of Y334.7bn were down on last year's Y378bn, and earnings per share
slipped to a loss of Y59.61 against a loss of Y49.45 last time.
The final dividend is unchanged at Y5.
Seiko had warned during the year that the recession was having an adverse
affect on sales in the domestic market, in the shape of consumer reluctance
to buy new watches and lower levels of gift purchases by companies.
For the current financial year, Seiko is forecasting a pre-tax loss of Y5bn
on sales of Y360bn.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong yen depresses TDK sales

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TDK Corporation, the world's largest maker of magnetic tapes and a leading
manufacturer of computer products, yesterday reported a slump in earnings
for the year to March 31. Consolidated pre-tax profits fell by 47 per cent
to Y17.8bn (Dollars 170m) as sales declined by 13 per cent to Y457.4bn.
The company attributed most of the collapse to the sharp rise in the yen,
which it said had reduced sales by an estimated Y44.3bn. In response, TDK
was continuing to pursue an aggressive policy of expanding production
overseas, with particular emphasis on Asian operations, it said.
But weak demand in Japan also contributed to the decline. A depressed home
market forced the company to cut prices, and the growth of imports of
low-priced video tapes created an extremely difficult climate.
Among the few bright spots were a rise in orders from the telecommunications
sector and an upturn in the production of audio-visual products in the
second half of the year.
The parent company's pre-tax profit dropped 25 per cent to Y14.4bn on sales
lower by some 9 per cent at Y334.6bn. Weak private sector capital spending
and the strong yen pushed sales of electronic materials and components down
by 6 per cent, while recording media sales dropped by 16 per cent.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Disaster costs hit Japan's
leading non-life insurers

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's leading non-life insurance companies posted weaker profits for the
year to last March due to increased disaster payouts and a decline in
interest income.
Pre-tax profits fell for the leading three companies - Tokio Marine and Fire
Insurance, Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance and Mitsui Marine and Fire
Insurance. However, Sumitomo Marine and Fire Insurance, and Nippon Fire and
Marine Insurance posted increases due to profits from asset sales.
The five companies' total net premium income, the equivalent of sales at
other companies, rose 5.5 per cent to Y3,540bn (Dollars 33.9bn).
Premiums from voluntary motor insurance rose sharply, but income from
compulsory motor insurance premiums declined.
Disaster payouts rose due to the increased typhoons and heavy rains last
year. Tokio paid out Y648.3bn in claims, up 4.9 per cent on a year earlier,
while Yasuda's overall payment rose 4.6 per cent to Y457.5bn.
The insurers said the total balance of bad loans - loans to which borrowers
have not paid interest over six months, and those extended to bankrupt
companies - fell by 11 per cent from the previous year to Y50.5bn.
Yasuda had the highest level of problem loans at Y18.8bn, but 24 per cent
lower than a year earlier, and the highest percentage of bad loans to
outstanding total loans at 2.1 per cent.
Tokio reported a 33 per cent rise in its bad loan balance to Y15.0bn, the
second biggest following Yasuda.
For the full year to next March, the companies, except Sumitomo, expect a
rise in pre-tax profits.
Tokio predicts a 1.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y78bn, while Yasuda
expects its pre-tax earnings to rise 3.2 per cent to Y34bn.

Berjaya, the diversified conglomerate which has rapidly grown into one of
Malaysia's biggest companies, has announced rights issues aimed at raising
MDollars 722m (USDollars 278.85m) to fund several new ventures.
The issue is being split between the Berjaya Group and its main listed unit,
Berjaya Industrial. Berjaya Group, which controls a 58 per cent stake in
Berjaya Industrial, aims to raise more than MDollars 500m by issuing 254m
new shares at MDollars 2 each. Berjaya Industrial aims to raise MDollars
214m by issuing 126m shares at MDollars 1.70 each.
Berjaya said that new investments undertaken by the group had increased its
funding requirements.
Berjaya is controlled by Mr Vincent Tan, a Chinese Malaysian closely
connected with some of Malaysia's senior political figures.
Mr Tan, through Berjaya, has been aggressively expanding his business
interests and is now involved in lottery management schemes in Malaysia and
China, a timber project in the Solomon Islands and numerous resort
developments around the eastern Asia region.
Berjaya, with North West Water of the UK, is undertaking one of Malaysia's
biggest infrastructure projects - a MDollars 6bn national sewerage scheme.
Berjaya is also involved in several light industrial businesses.
One of the group's latest ventures is the Malaysian franchise for the US
'Kenny Rogers Roasters' restaurant chain.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: JVC records pre-tax loss for
third consecutive year

<TEXT>
JVC, the Japanese maker of video cassette recorders and other audio-visual
products, yesterday reported a consolidated pre-tax loss for the third
consecutive year and passed its dividend.
The company cited the strong rise of the yen and weak demand in Japan as key
factors behind a 6 per cent fall in sales to Y726.5bn (Dollars 6.9bn) from
Y768.9bn a year ago and a pre-tax loss of Y26.8bn, against a loss of Y25.5bn
last time. The net loss for the year to March 1994 was Y19.6bn, compared
with Y43.1bn last time.
Sales of the company's mainline audio-visual products suffered from sluggish
consumer spending in Japan while information equipment, such as cordless
phones, also saw a 6 per cent decline.
In terms of regional performance, JVC suffered a fall in demand in Japan.
But sales in Asia were strong and contributed to profits in spite of the
foreign exchange losses the company incurred on the yen's appreciation.
JVC depends on export markets for 50 per cent of its overall sales.
For the parent company alone, JVC posted sales of Y507.7bn, down 1 per cent
from Y513.2bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y19.5bn against a loss of Y26.1bn last
time.
Efforts are being stepped up to restructure the company in a bid to return
to profitability. Business divisions have been reorganised, staff has been
consolidated and inventories have been reduced. New, advanced products such
as the hi-definition VCR are expected to become core products and help boost
profits.
JVC last week announced that its president, Mr Takuro Bojo, would resign to
be replaced by an executive from Matsushita, the consumer electronics
company which owns a 52 per cent stake in JVC.
The company does not see a strong recovery but expects to return to
profitability in the current year, with consolidated sales rising to Y750bn.
On a parent company basis it sees sales rising to Y530bn and pre-tax profits
of Y1bn for this year.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: German metals group faces new
risk provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the German metals, mining and industrial group at the
brink of collapse in January after running up massive losses in oil futures
trading via a New York subsidiary, will have to make further provisions. The
group said last night it would have to cover newly-identified risks in the
US.
It refused to say how big the provisions would be. However, the group made
clear they were needed to cover risks arising in respect of special
contracts between MG Corp, the New York subsidiary which nearly caused
Metallgesellschaft's downfall, and Castle Energy, a small US oil refinery.
Further risks arose because of contracts under which MG Corp agreed to
supply oil and other energy products to industrial customers in the US.
Metallgesellschaft said it would fund the provisions via the sale of its
entire 80 per cent stake in Buderus, an engineering company considered one
of the jewels in the Metallgesellschaft crown. It will also have to dispose
of Lehnkering Montan Transport company and the group's head office site in
the centre of Frankfurt.
Based on the DM1.5bn (Dollars 909m) market value of Buderus, these sales are
likely to raise well in excess of DM1bn. The shares in Buderus will be
placed via a consortium of banks in a way which ensures they are widely
distributed, Metallgesellschaft said.
These revelations, contained in a statement issued after
Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board met yesterday, are likely to shock
investors today. Shares in Germany's 14th largest industrial group have
risen dramatically in recent weeks, reflecting confidence that the worst of
the group's problems have been dealt with by January's DM3.4bn rescue
package.
The disclosure that the 80 per cent stake in Buderus, which has a 25 per
cent market share in the German heating equipment market, will have to go is
likely to prove especially surprising. In February, Mr Kajo Neukirchen,
Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, said there were no plans to sell the
company. Buderus last year made net profits of DM69m and had turnover of
DM2.77bn.
MG Corp's relationship with Castle Energy was characterised by a series of
refining contracts, the most remarkable of which was MG Corp's agreement to
pay Castle a fixed rate of Dollars 5 per barrel above the standard market
price for the benchmark west Texas intermediate crude oil to the year 2000.

Skandia, the Swedish insurer, is in talks with Trygg-Hansa, part of Swedish
insurance group Trygg-Hansa SPP Holdings, about the possible acquisition of
Trygg-Hansa's North American reinsurance operations, AP-DJ reports from
Stockholm.
The sale would be in line with Trygg-Hansa's 1993 decision to discontinue
its international reinsurance business, Skandia said .
The Trygg-Hansa units under consideration were not currently underwriting
any new business, the group said.
If negotiations prove successful, Skandia intends to integrate the units
into its own North American reinsurance operations. It believes this can be
done in a cost-effective manner.

costs fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trelleborg, the Swedish mining and metals group, posted a SKr200m (Dollars
26.08m) swing into the black in the first quarter. The turnround came on the
back of lower financial costs and better results from associate companies.
The figures keep it on track for a positive full-year result after two years
of heavy losses.
Group profit after financial items amounted to SKr8m, compared with a
SKr192m loss a year earlier.
The improvement came in spite of a drop in sales, to SKr4.65bn from
SKr5.66bn, and a deterioration in operating profit to SKr67m from SKr170m.
Adjusted for disposals and restructuring, sales were up 2 per cent and
operating income was SKr95m higher than a year ago.
The group benefited from a SKr5.5bn drop in net debt and lower interest
rates, enabling it to cut financial costs by SKr145m to SKr109m.
It also had a SKr50m contribution from associate companies, instead of the
SKr108m loss it suffered in the first quarter of 1993. This reflected a
better performance at Falconbridge, a nickel producer, and a contribution
from Munksjo, a paper and packaging group.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Columbia/HCA to buy Medical Care
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Columbia/HCA, the US healthcare group which operates the country's largest
chain of hospitals, has announced the acquisition of Medical Care America in
an all-stock transaction valued at Dollars 850m.
The deal marks the latest consolidation among US healthcare providers,
prompted equally by cost pressures and the growing power of managed care
organisations.
Medical Care America owns 96 surgery centres which between them have 504
operating rooms. Columbia/HCA, which was formed in a Dollars 6bn merger last
year, already has 196 acute-care and specialty hospitals.
Columbia/HCA, under chief executive Mr Richard Scott, has been more active
than other US healthcare providers in pursuing mergers. By providing a wide
range of healthcare services, the company hopes to sign up large customers
such as health maintenance organisations, which buy healthcare services in
bulk for their individual members.
The two companies also said a merger would save money by enabling them to
negotiate bigger discounts from suppliers and to cut overheads.
Around 60 per cent of Medical Care America's surgery centres are in areas
also served by one of Columbia/HCA's hospitals. This overlap would help to
reduce costs and make the combined service more attractive to customers, the
two companies said.
The deal follows discussions between the companies about ways of
strengthening an alliance that was already in place. Earlier this year,
Medical Care America sold its Critical Care America home infusion unit, just
18 months after those two companies merged. That deal proved a failure as
the home infusion business came under pricing pressures, slashing Medical
Care's earnings per share from Dollars 1.87 in 1992 to Dollars 1.29 last
year.
Medical Care America's shareholders will receive stock worth Dollars 29 for
each of their existing shares, if Columbia/HCA's stock stays close to its
current price.
The value of the deal would be subject to a sliding scale if Columbia's
share price moved above Dollars 40 or below Dollars 36, with the maximum
price for the acquisition set at Dollars 850m. At mid-day yesterday the
shares were standing at Dollars 39, down  3/4 on Monday's close.
The all-stock deal, which has been approved by both companies' boards, is
subject to approval by Medical Care America's shareholders and regulatory
clearance.

Argus Newspapers, the South African press group in which Mr Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspapers has bought a controlling shareholding, will today
release a pre-listing statement showing unaudited group turnover of R706.7m
(Dollars 193m) for the year to March and earnings of R29m.
Earnings have been adjusted to take account of discontinued operations, such
as the Sunday Star, and the sale of a majority interest in The Sowetan,
South Africa's biggest selling daily, to a consortium of black investors.
The company is forecasting turnover of R795m and earnings of R32.6m for the
current year. In a calculation based on 45.1m shares in issue, audited pro
forma earnings for the year to March were 64 cents a share. Net asset value
was 384 cents a share.
Argus Holdings and JCI directors will retire from the Argus Newspapers board
prior to the listing and Mr Liam Healy and Mr James Parkinson, managing
director and financial director of Independent, will join the board.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ICI India, the Indian subsidiary of the British chemicals group, has
reported a 13-fold increase in annual pre-tax profits to Rs728m (Dollars
23m) for the year to March, due largely to a corporate restructuring which
included the sale of its fertiliser business and a 49 per cent stake in its
fibres operations.
Profits included Rs538m of exceptional gains from the disposals and from the
sale of property in Bombay. The sales also helped the company reduce its
interest charges.
Overall revenues fell to Rs8.8bn from Rs9.7bn because of the disposals but
continuing operations saw revenues rise by 11 per cent and operating profits
by 27 per cent.
The company, which is 51 per cent owned by ICI, has been reorganised partly
in response to the liberalisation of the Indian economy and partly because
of the group restructuring in which pharmaceuticals were spun off into a new
company called Zeneca.
The fertilisers business was sold mainly because the group has also
withdrawn from fertiliser manufacturing.
ICI India said that following the disposals it was committed to expanding
its operations, including paints, catalysts, polyurethanes, agrochemicals
and rubber chemicals.
The company is importing technology from other parts of the group, including
new techniques of catalyst manufacture and of producing vehicle paint. It
would also consider acquisitions.

Maytag, the US home appliance manufacturer, is to sell off its Australian
and New Zealand-based white goods and floorcare appliance operations.
Maytag said it would prefer to float the division's shares on the stock
market. Analysts expect the sale to raise between ADollars 100m (USDollars
73m) and ADollars 150m.
The operations were formerly part of the Hoover group, which was taken over
by Maytag in 1988. Hoover (Australia), based in Sydney, makes and
distributes home appliances under brand names including Hoover and Admiral.
Mr Robert Dunkerley, managing director of Hoover (Australia), said the
businesses had been run 'largely independently' of the US parent. He
expected to finalise agreements permitting the operations to continue
marketing under their established brand names.
Maytag's decision to sell its Australasia operations through a flotation is
the latest in a series of such moves by overseas parents - notably British
companies - operating both in the manufacturing and financial services
spheres.
Pilkington announced similar plans earlier this year, as did Pirelli, the
Italian group, with its Australian cables business.
North Broken Hill Peko has sold its 19.1 per cent stake in base metals group
Pasminco for ADollars 233.1m, or ADollars 52.07m more than book value.
Reuter reports from Melbourne. NBH said that the buyer was CRA and that it
had now successfully completed a process of returning to managed core
businesses.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Merck chief resignation leaves
top job open
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Wygod has resigned from Merck, the US's biggest drugs group, just
four months after being given responsibility for running two-thirds of the
group's operations.
His departure, apparently after he failed to secure the support of the
company's board to succeed Mr Roy Vagelos as chairman, threw further doubts
on the senior management of the group.
Mr Wygod had appeared set for the top job after selling his Medco
Containment Services, a drug distributor, to Merck for Dollars 6bn last
year. In January, the company named him as head of its North American
prescription drug businesses, as well as the Medco operations. A month ago,
however, Merck disclosed that Mr Wygod would not become chairman when Mr
Vagelos retires at the beginning of November.
The departure of Mr Wygod was seen on Wall Street as the result of a clash
of styles in the pharmaceuticals giant. A successful entrepreneur who had
built Medco from scratch into one of a small handful of big pharmacy benefit
managers, Mr Wygod did not fit the normal style of Merck, whose top
executives have generally been appointed from within.
Mr Wygod is leaving to head Synetic, a manufacturer of plastics for
healthcare products. He will also take a 49 per cent interest in the
company, which is being sold by Merck for Dollars 45m.
As the race to succeed Mr Vagelos was throw wider open yesterday, Mr
Lawrence Bossidy, chief executive of Allied Signal and a Merck non-executive
director, was forced to issue a statement that he planned to remain at the
defence contractor. Earlier, speculation that he was about to be named Mr
Vagelos' successor had sent Merck's shares sharply higher.
Merck said it was continuing the search for a new chairman both inside and
outside the company, and that it was well advanced in its deliberations.

<TEXT>
Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest electric power utilities earned
CDollars 643m (USDollars 465.9m) in the first quarter, up 23.7 per cent from
a year earlier, because a harsh winter boosted domestic and export demand.
Electricity sales rose 8.4 per cent by volume and revenues 8.2 per cent to
CDollars 2.3bn. Sales in Quebec rose 3.8 per cent by volume and revenues by
6.4 per cent.
Revenues from power exports, mainly to the US but also other provinces, were
up 4.4 per cent to CDollars 144m.
Spending rose 3.3 per cent mainly because new generating and transmission
equipment came on stream, increasing depreciation and amortisation.
Hydro-Quebec, 100 per cent owned by the Quebec government, invested CDollars
629m in the quarter, down from CDollars 755m a year earlier. Total
investment in 1994 will be CDollars 3.86bn, against CDollars 4bn last time,
mostly for James Bay hydro expansion and for the distribution system.

<TEXT>
Varity Corporation, which makes braking systems and diesel engines for cars
and trucks, reported a rise in first-quarter net income to Dollars 29.4m, or
65 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 505.8m. This compares with Dollars
11m, or 20 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 455.6m in last year's first
quarter to April 30.
During the quarter, Varity agreed to sell its remaining Massey Ferguson farm
equipment operations to Agco for Dollars 310m in cash and 500,000 shares of
Agco stock. The sale should bring an income gain of between Dollars 15m and
Dollars 30m and increase Varity's stockholders' equity by about Dollars
100m.
Varity's first-quarter income, excluding Massey Ferguson's results, was
Dollars 25m, or 55 cents, up from a comparable Dollars 15.1m, or 33 cents, a
year ago. Massey Ferguson saw net income rising to Dollars 4m, against a net
loss of Dollars 4m a year ago. Sales were Dollars 253m, up from Dollars 189m
last year.
Varity's remaining businesses benefited from a 9 per cent increase in North
American vehicle production.

<TEXT>
Deere and Company, the Moline, Illinois-based maker of farm and industrial
equipment, said strength in the North American farm sector boosted
second-quarter net income to Dollars 189.3m, or Dollars 2.20 a share.
In last year's second quarter the group recorded income of Dollars 101m, or
Dollars 1.30 a share.
Deere's other equipment operations, which include ground care and lawn
machines and construction equipment, also improved with the generally
strengthening North American economy. Its worldwide sales for the quarter
jumped 17 per cent, to Dollars 2.46bn, from Dollars 2.10bn a year ago.
Although analysts had expected strong second-quarter results, Deere's share
price rose Dollars  1/2 , after the results were released, but closed down
Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 72 5/8 in New York.
Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said that in response to strong retail demand,
Deere has increased its North American production schedules. '1994 worldwide
production tonnage is now anticipated to be 16 per cent higher than 1993
output, up from our prior estimate of 13 per cent,' he said.
However, the company warned that production in the second half would drop
below first-half levels, reflecting normal holiday shutdowns and re-tooling
for a new tractor line.
'North American retail sales activity during the first two quarters of 1994
provides a sound base for operations during the remainder of the year,' Mr
Becherer said.
'For 1994, the US Department of Agriculture has projected substantial
increases in planted acreages of corn and soyabeans, and is forecasting that
farm net cash income will be at one of the highest levels in history.'
He said that while Europe's long-term downward trend in sales of
agricultural equipment is likely to continue, Deere expects its 1994
European sales to be about equal to 1993.

Massey Ferguson's results, reported separately as discontinued operations,
showed that the farm equipment business improved, with net income rising to
Dollars 4m in the first quarter, against a net loss of Dollars 4m a year
ago. Sales were Dollars 253m, up from Dollars 189m last year.
Varity's remaining businesses benefited from a 9 per cent increase in North
American vehicle production. Its Kelsey-Hayes automotive products group
generated Dollars 27m in operating income on sales of Dollars 355m, up from
Dollars 25m on sales of Dollars 302m in last year's first quarter.
The Perkins Engine division saw operating income rise to Dollars 13m, from
Dollars 8m a year ago, with sales advancing to Dollars 180m, from Dollars
158m in the first quarter of 1993.
'Varity is off to a good start this year,' said Mr Victor Rice, Varity
chairman. 'With the recently announced sale of Massey Ferguson, we are now
positioned to focus on generating even more value for our shareholders from
our core businesses of supplying automotive braking systems and diesel
engines to customers worldwide.'

Digital Equipment Corporation, the US computer maker hit by losses and

'The Asia-Pacific part of the world has a very distinct role to play in the
company's path to recovery because it is the fastest-growing, and it's a
place where we have very good operations,' said Mr Bobby Choonavala,
president of Digital Equipment Asia Pacific.
The losses were mainly due to the company's switch to new product lines
during the past two years, he said.
The group has suffered losses of more than Dollars 3bn over the past three

Mr Martin Wygod has resigned as chairman of Merck's Medco Containment
Services unit and as a member of the Merck board, Reuter reports from
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.
Merck, the US drug manufacturer, said Mr Wygod would serve as a consultant
to it and Medco under a multi-year contract.
'Now that the integration of Medco and Merck has been substantially
completed, I have decided to pursue other business and philanthropic
interests,' Mr Wygod said.
'I believe that Merck, as a result of its merger with Medco, now has a
strong competitive advantage in the changing environment of pharmaceutical
care.'
Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, said: 'While we regret Marty's decision
to move on, we understand his desire to pursue other interests. We are
indebted to Marty for his role in bringing together Merck and Medco.'
Mr Vagelos continued: 'The integration of the businesses is essentially
completed and a strong management team of Medco and Merck people is in
place.'

Rogers Cablesystems, Canada's biggest cable-TV operator, is to co-operate
with Microsoft to install the US software group's new interactive television
software, known as Tiger.
Tiger is one of several competing software systems being developed, which
will deliver video-on-demand, shopping, education and other services to
cable-TV subscribers.
Rogers has signed a letter of intent to license the Tiger system, and take
part in early testing of Microsoft's operating system for interactive
broadband cable networks. TCI, the biggest US cable-TV operator, has signed
a similar deal with Microsoft.
Rogers said it was attracted to the Microsoft system by its open
architecture and cost. Microsoft claims Tiger can deliver interactive
programming for about a tenth of the cost of rival technologies.
The system is based on personal-computer technology rather than mainframes.
Microsoft's rivals doubt whether PC-type hardware can provide the
communications and processing power for a network of cable-TV subscribers.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mack Trucks forecasts return to
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mack Trucks, the US subsidiary of France's Renault Vehicules Industriels,
should record a profit this year after five years of losses, Mr Elios
Pascual, chairman, said yesterday.
According to Mr Pascual, productivity gains and restructuring measures,
combined with the upturn in the US truck market, should mean a net profit of
Dollars 20m-Dollars 25m this year. This compares with a loss of Dollars 36m
in 1993, and a net deficit of Dollars 182m the previous year.
'In less than three years Mack has gone from monthly losses of about Dollars
20m to a profit of Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m in March and April, having returned
to profit in February,' said Mr Pascual.
He said the company was now able to contribute to the results of RVI, the
truck and bus arm of the state-owned Renault group.
The recovery in results partly reflects an upturn in demand and prices in
the US. Sales are expected to increase to about Dollars 2bn this year,
compared with Dollars 1.7bn in 1993.
But Mr Pascual said the improvement mainly reflected the restructuring at
the group, which he said would allow a sustained, rather than a cyclical,
recovery.
'We now need to sell about 20,000 vehicles to break even, compared with
40,000 three years ago,' he said. This was achieved through cost cutting,
productivity gains, and the closure of some factories.
Purchasing costs have been reduced by between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent a
year, according to Mr Pascual, while productivity has increased by 41 per
cent over the past three years.
He added that the cyclical nature of the US market meant it was necessary to
continue improving productivity.
'The market can decline just as quickly as it has recovered,' he said,
forecasting a fall in the market from next year. But he pointed out that the
company was aiming to reduce its break-even production point to 17,000
vehicles by the end of the year and to 15,000 at the end of 1995.
Despite the company's cost-cutting measures, however, Mr Pascual said the
company had maintained its investment in new products and R&amp;D.
'Between 1994 and 1997 we will invest Dollars 40m-Dollars 45m a year,' he
said. The group will also develop its commercial network in the western US
and in Mexico.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Shareholders delay Moulinex
shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moulinex, the troubled French household electricals company, yesterday faced
a last-minute hitch in the completion of its long-awaited financial
restructuring package when its shareholders postponed until this afternoon a
vote on bringing in a new investor.
The company, which also disclosed that it sustained an unexpectedly heavy
net loss of FFr550m (Dollars 97.7m) in its last financial year to March 31,
yesterday morning announced plans for a FFr1bn rights issue. But it can only
proceed with the issue after its shareholders have appointed the new
investor.
Moulinex, which is controlled by Finap, a company owned by its founders and
employees, has for months been in negotiations with prospective investors.
It has received firm offers from Glen Dimplex, an Irish competitor, and
Euris, a French investment consortium.
The Moulinex workforce earlier this year voiced its opposition to the Glen
Dimplex offer on the grounds that it could lead to job losses. Moreover the
company's executives last week voted in favour of accepting the Euris bid.
The completion of the financial restructuring will end years of uncertainty
for Moulinex which has been in deep difficulty since its acquisition in 1991
of Krups, a German competitor. The Krups deal made sense in strategic terms
as it enabled Moulinex, best known for food processors and Swan kettles, to
expand into new product sectors such as expresso coffee machines.
But the Krups acquisition also left Moulinex with heavy debts on the eve of
the economic recession. The company fell into the red in the 1992-93
financial year with a net loss of FFr115m on sales of FFr8.22bn, only to
sustain even heavier losses last year.
Moulinex, which has made dramatic cuts in its workforce to try to stabilise
its finances, said it had been forced to make provisions of roughly FFr500m
in the 1993-94 financial year.

unveiled

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden is to offer domestic investors a maximum of 47.5m shares in next
month's sale of up to 82.2m shares in Pharmacia, one of Europe's top 10
pharmaceuticals groups.
The balance of the issue will go to international institutions, taking
foreign ownership in the group above 15 per cent from its current 6 per
cent.
The figures were revealed yesterday when the prospectus for Sweden's largest
privatisation was published. The state plans to sell up to 47.4 per cent of
the votes in Pharmacia, but will retain 10.1 per cent to ensure ownership
stability. The issue is expected to bring in around SKr10bn (Dollars 1.3bn),
based on the company's SKr125 share price.
The government wants to make Pharmacia a 'people's share'. It aims to ensure
that each private Swedish investor gets at least 50 shares at a
SKr10-per-share discount to the institutional price.
The issue size has been set at 72m shares - 40m for the public and 32m for
institutions - but it will rise to 82.2m if the demand is there. The offer
is also subject to a clawback arrangement, meaning institutions could end up
with only 24.5m shares.
The state intends to offer 10m shares in the US, 9.5m in the UK, 7.5m in the
Nordic region and 5m in continental Europe, although final allocations will
depend on demand and pricing. The institutional price, to be set through a
book-building process, will be published on June 17.
Volvo, the Swedish vehicle group, holds a 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia
which it intends to sell in 1996.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Big jump in first quarter at
Incentive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising demand and improved competitiveness provided the impetus for a big
jump in first-quarter results at Incentive, the industrial and investment
group controlled by the Wallenberg family.
Profits before financial items rose 51 per cent to SKr130m (Dollars 16.9m)
from SKr86m, excluding associate companies. Sales rose 12 per cent to
SKr3.35bn, while orders were 11 per cent higher at SKr3.65bn.
Last month, Incentive paid SKr3.7bn to acquire a 44 per cent stake in Cardo,
the Swedish investment group. It then launched a bid for the rest of the
group in a move to secure control of Gambro, the medical equipment
specialist.
The group forecast higher profits per share in 1994, even though the Cardo
purchase will lift interest expenses and goodwill amortisation. Last year,
profit per share was SKr6.75. Mr Mikael Lilius, president, said demand was
increasing in Europe, North America and Asia.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bosch-Siemens casts eye over new
ground - Herbert Worner speaks to Andrew Baxter about expansion in and out
of Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HERBERT WORNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Herbert Worner concedes it is fashionable to knock manufacturing in
Germany as too costly and uncompetitive. However, the president and chief
executive of Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate says: 'We would not go along with that
on a general basis.'
The wisdom, or otherwise, of manufacturing in Germany is an important issue
for Mr Worner. Bosch-Siemens is the most German and least global of the big
three white goods producers in Europe - Electrolux of Sweden is market
leader and Whirlpool of the US is in third place.
Mr Worner wants to change that, at least partially, and says Bosch-Siemens
is developing a better manufacturing base to support his plans.
The group has been working behind the scenes to reduce its domestic
production costs and raise productivity. A re-organisation that began in
1991 and was completed last summer has significantly reduced costs, says Mr
Worner.
Over the past three or four years, he says, the company's components
sourcing policy has changed fundamentally. 'We used to buy much more in
Germany,' he says. If the quality is good, Bosch-Siemens is now open to
buying components in the UK, Italy and Spain.
Recently, it has been holding 'buyers' meetings' in Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Russia and the Ukraine, where potential parts suppliers are shown
a complete machine and asked whether they can supply components.
Mr Worner sees two very good reasons why Bosch-Siemens will continue
manufacturing at its five plants in Germany. First, in an industry where
economies of scale are vital to manufacturing competitiveness, the group can
boast the world's biggest plants in a number of product lines.
Secondly, labour costs may be higher in Germany than elsewhere in Europe,
but there are logistical advantages to manufacturing in a country which
accounts for one-third of the DM45bn (Dollars 27.3bn) west European white
goods market, and where Bosch has a market share of more than 30 per cent.
Bosch-Siemens has even been expanding its German manufacturing. A new
factory at Nauen in eastern Germany will start producing 400,000 driers a
year from next year, and manufacturing of cooker hobs is being added at the
Bretten factory south of Frankfurt. Any further expansion of manufacturing
will, however, be outside Germany.
Already, Bosch-Siemens has five factories in Spain - the legacy of two
important Spanish acquisitions in 1988 and 1989 - one in Greece, and one in
Slovenia making small appliances. A washing machine plant at Lodz, Poland,
is due to start production at the beginning of next year.
It is not hard to see why Bosch-Siemens is now looking beyond Germany. The
strength of the D-Mark and the recession in many European countries means
that, out of total sales of DM6.66bn last year, non-German turnover dipped
to 42 per cent, compared with 50 per cent in 1989 and 1990.
In western Europe, Dr Worner wants to raise Bosch-Siemens' share of the
market from 15 per cent to between 18 and 19 per cent within five years. He
says: 'We can now better work on those markets in Europe where our market
shares are relatively low.'
In eastern Europe, he thinks Bosch-Siemens can raise its sales from DM150m
this year to between DM500m and DM600m in five years, mainly in Russia,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
He is also keen to expand Bosch-Siemens' position in Asia, where current
sales of DM70m-DM80m could be multiplied in the next few years. As a first
step, the group has signed a letter of intent with a Chinese company to
produce washing machines and, ultimately, other white goods there.
Meanwhile, Bosch-Siemens' Spanish companies are being used as a springboard
to the Latin American market.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander outlines Banesto
assets sale plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander, which acquired Banesto last month, intends to sell the bulk
of the collapsed group's foreign banking interests over the next few months,
according to Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman.
Confirming expectations, he also told a parliamentary hearing in Madrid that
he would dispose of Banesto's corporate interests, which include mining,
construction, battery manufacture and media interests.
Mr Botn was making his first public statement on the future of Banesto since
Santander acquired the group for Dollars 2bn on April 26, in the largest
domestic takeover. His evidence to the legislators suggested a strategy
weighted towards stripping the assets of Banesto rather than consolidating
them within Santander.
However, Santander will retain Banco Totta e Azores, the Portuguese bank,
which Mr Botn said was a 'high-value' asset and one of the 'main reasons'
behind his decision to acquire Banesto. He intends to discuss the future of
BTA with the Portuguese authorities next week.
The Lisbon government contests the size of Banesto's holding in BTA.
Although Banesto directly holds just under 25 per cent of the Portuguese
bank's stock, it is estimated to control some 50 per cent of its equity
through nominee shareholders. Santander already owns a Portuguese banking
group, Banco de Comercio e Industria, BCI.
Mr Botn said bluntly he intended to sell Banesto's industrial assets 'in an
orderly and prudent fashion . . . without surprises . . . and never at
knockdown prices'. Companies in Banesto's industrial holding include Tudor,
the battery producer, the mining group Asturiana de Zinc and the
construction company Agroman.
Banesto's new owners will, in addition, put up for sale the bank's media
interests, the most important of which are minority shareholdings in the
Antena 3 television network and in the El Mundo newspaper group. Bankers
Trust, the US investment bank, has been given the mandate for the media
disposals.
Mr Botn said Banesto's international banking subsidiaries - Banesto Banking
Corporation in the US, Banesto Chile Bank, Banesto Banco Uruguay, and Banco
Shaw in Argentina - were 'of little importance'. They would either be
absorbed by the Santander group, which has subsidiary banks in Chile and the
US, or sold 'to whoever pays the right price'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Derivative losses cost Dell
Dollars 15m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dell Computer has announced an after-tax loss of Dollars 15.6m after
misjudging the trend of European and Japanese interest rates. It joins a
list of US companies which have reported losses on derivative instruments in
recent weeks.
Dell believed that medium-term European and Japanese bond yields would fall,
reflecting the pressure on economies in those countries, at a time when US
interest rates were rising. In the event, bond yields around the world
jumped as the US Treasury ratchetted up short-term interest rates.
'We anticipated the US rate movement - we had that spot on. What we didn't
anticipate is what that would mean to other finance ministries around the
world,' said Mr Tom Meredith, chief financial officer.
The losses were incurred in the company's investment portfolio, which at the
end of last year was valued at Dollars 313m. Dell used derivative
instruments to boost its returns from these investments. According to Mr
Meredith, such instruments have added more than Dollars 10m to investment
income in the past three years.
Dell's investment strategy involved it writing (or selling) options and
swaptions (options which give the buyer the right to enter a swap agreement
in the future), said Mr Meredith. Writing options in this way is generally
considered a high-risk exercise for a non-financial company, since the
potential losses are difficult to hedge.
The company said it had closed more than half of the derivatives positions
in its investment portfolio, and planned to close the rest by the end of its
third quarter, at the beginning of November.
'We have decided to discontinue this level of exposure, and we do not intend
to engage in derivatives for investment purposes in the future,' Mr Michael
Dell, chairman and chief executive, said.
Dell also announced an unrelated Dollars 10.7m loss on its investment
portfolio linked to a change in accounting practice.
The losses reduced the company's net income in the three months to May 1 to
Dollars 18.9m, compared with Dollars 10.2m a year before.

FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney investors set for
debt vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday called its shareholders
to an extra-ordinary general meeting on June 8 to vote on proposals for a
FFr13bn (Dollars 2.3bn) emergency financial restructuring.
The meeting, which will be held at the EuroDisneyland theme park on the
northern outskirts of Paris, will be something of a formality. Walt Disney,
the US entertainment company that orchestrated the restructuring, owns 49
per cent of Euro Disney's equity, thereby ensuring that the proposals will
be approved.
However, the meeting is expected to be stormy, as it offers a rare
opportunity for Euro Disney's other investors to air their views.
These investors, many of whom have sustained heavy losses on the steep fall
in Euro Disney's shares, face dramatic dilution in the value of their
holdings because of the FFr6bn rights issue which is a key part of the
restructuring.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Supermarket price war hits Jeyes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeyes Group shares plunged 11 per cent yesterday to 335p as the household
products manufacturer warned shareholders that the supermarket price war in
the UK was taking a toll on first half profits.
The warning comes less than a week household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman
issued its own grim trading statement. It is also Jeyes's second warning in
less than a year, following the gloomy statement in June which wiped 28 per
cent off the group's market value.
Mr Jimmy Moir, chief executive, said the UK business had been particularly
affected by increased demand for generic products and aggressive
discounting. Britain represents some 50 per cent of Jeyes profits.
Margins are estimated to have fallen from between 8 and 10 per cent to about
6 to 8 per cent.
Jeyes's cost-cutting programme has also been more expensive and slower to
implement than had previously been expected, Mr Moir said. The benefits
would not now feed through until the second half. Globol in Germany and the
other international businesses were trading according to expectations, the
group said.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Lasmo board comes under attack: Chairman reiterates call for
small shareholders to reject bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the oil exploration company, yesterday took its battle to fight off a
hostile bid from fellow explorer Enterprise Oil directly to its
share-holders.
The prospect that even relatively small investors may play a decisive role
in determining Lasmo's fate meant that Mr Rudolf Agnew, chairman, and Mr Joe
Darby, chief executive, had to be particularly persuasive in convincing
those who attended the meeting at London's Barbican of the wisdom of
rejecting Enterprise's overtures.
Mr Agnew dismissed as 'junk paper' the Pounds 1.4bn Enterprise bid, which so
far does not have a cash sweetener.
'The Enterprise bid is a nonsense. There is no reason why Lasmo's
shareholders should give away their bright future to solve another company's
internal problems,' he said.
The new chairman also dismissed concerns expressed by one shareholder that
there might be some truth to Enterprise allegations that Lasmo will remain
financ-ially weak in spite of its recent rights issue.
'We're in good nick,' he said.
Mr Agnew had more problems when another shareholder recited a litany of
alleged violations of the Cadbury code on corporate governance.
In a statement which was warmly received from the floor, the shareholder
criticised the rolling contracts enjoyed by some directors.
He also questioned whether 'overtime' provisions for the chairman and deputy
chairman amounting to Pounds 700 a day were warranted.
A suggestion that Lasmo's directors freeze their salaries and other forms of
compensation until the dividend could be raised substantially was also
warmly received from the floor, in sharp contrast to the icy glare from Mr
Agnew.
He accused the elderly shareholder of being an 'effective' propaganda tool
for the 'opposition'.
He also claimed that Lasmo conformed to the Cadbury code, although he made
no secret of his distaste for many aspects of it. 'Much of Cadbury is linked
to an economy in marked decline,' he said.
Mr Agnew said he would look at the idea of freezing directors' salaries,
although he 'was not sure what it might accomplish'.
As for his own role, he was prepared to leave if that is what shareholders
wanted. After all, he said, 'I don't have to work for you.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Towles, the clothing manufacturer, saw losses increase from Pounds 146,000
to Pounds 236,000 in the year to February 28.
The result was disappointing, directors said, mainly because of a poor
performance at HE Godkin's leisure wear activities.
The company was also the main factor in group turnover falling to Pounds
15.7m (Pounds 16.2m). Losses per share were 7.71p (4.38p) but the board
proposes to maintain the single, final payment of 0.25p.

flotation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Orion Publishing Group, the general book publisher which in 1992 acquired
George Weidenfeld Holdings, has announced that it is planning a stock market
flotation.
To that end, it has completed a Pounds 4m funding package, led by Baring
Communications Equity, Europe's newest and largest media fund, to reduce its
borrowings and provide working capital. It has also appointed as
non-executive chairman Sir John Cuckney, chairman either previously or
currently of many companies including Westland, 3i, Maxwell Pensioners Trust
and Royal Insurance. Orion was co-founded at the end of 1991 by Mr Peter
Roche, Ms Rosemary Cheetham and Mr Anthony Cheetham, now its chief
executive.
Orion stated that its operating profits more than doubled from Pounds
268,000 to Pounds 583,000 in 1993.
Leading the sales increase were Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy, Alan Clark's
Diaries, Maeve Binchy's The Copper Beech and Nigel Mansell's Mansell and
Williams.
The paperback division contributed a first-time Pounds 3.7m to the sales
figure; sales in the Orion division grew to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.1m).

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lep may partly float US arm to cut debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lep Group, the lossmaking freight forwarding and security group restructured
by its banks in 1992, is considering a partial US flotation of its American
security business to reduce its Pounds 400m of debt.
Mr David James, the company doctor who was brought in as chairman by the
banks, said he was 'mindful of the opportunity for a major refinancing' of
National Guardian given the 'very favourable market conditions'.
He said that electronic security companies, of which National Guardian is
one of the top four in the US, have been accorded high share ratings on Wall
Street, partly because of strong market growth following the bombing of the
World Trade Centre.
He stressed that the group would not consider floating off the whole of the
subsidiary and had turned away potential trade buyers.
National Guardian increased its operating profit from Pounds 13m to Pounds
19.9m last year, on turnover of Pounds 127.9m (Pounds 100.2m), helping to
push the group operating figure to Pounds 29.9m (Pounds 24.9m). The banks'
debt-for-equity swap in 1992 cut Lep's interest bill to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds
48.1m), reducing the pre-tax loss from Pounds 38.3m to Pounds 15.6m.
The freight forwarding division made its first net profit since 1988 with
the North American and Asia Pacific businesses performing well and signs of
recovery in Europe.
The company repeated previous warnings that there would be no return to
dividend payments for the foreseeable future. Losses per share were cut to
2.1p (9.7p).
Group borrowings rose to Pounds 410m (Pounds 386m) because of
crystallisation of bank guarantees, the rise in the dollar and acquisitions
by National Guardian. But debt will be reduced by Pounds 87.5m following
January's sale of Swiss Bank House.
Shareholders' funds fell to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 45.3m) compared with a
market value of Pounds 43.8m with the shares unchanged at 4 3/4 p.
Mr James said that the subsidiaries' profits would have to advance further
for their realisation price to make 'a significant impact on core debt'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest buoys Hozelock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hozelock, the garden equipment manufacturer, doubled pre-tax profits in its
first half, reflecting the benefits of last November's flotation.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 26 rose from Pounds 967,000 to
Pounds 2.02m.
At the operating level, profits were ahead 18 per cent at Pounds 2.06m,
compared with Pounds 1.74m. Turnover advanced by 8 per cent, from Pounds
13.2m to Pounds 14.3m.
Net interest payable fell to Pounds 36,000 (Pounds 774,000). The group,
which realised Pounds 4m from the flotation after paying back debt, ended
the half with net cash of Pounds 3m.
Mr Donald Potter, finance director, said the company traditionally
encountered the heaviest demands on working capital at the end of March. But
it had negotiated better payment terms from its suppliers, and had brought
forward some payments by customers.
Shares in the group closed yesterday at 250p, 2p up on the day and level
with the flotation pricing.
Mr David Codling, chief executive, said the group had taken a record 67 per
cent of the core UK watering market, with sales ahead 12 per cent. The
aquatics division, which makes pond equipment, lifted sales by 54 per cent.
The group will move into its new factory at Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands,
in early July, giving it time to settle in during the low point of the
manufacturing year.
Mr Codling described the move as 'like moving from the Dark Ages to the
modern age'.
Earnings per share were 5.3p (2.6p). A maiden interim dividend of 2.3p is
declared.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Butte future aided by fresh funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Butte Mining, the UK company whose main activity is
prosecuting US lawsuits - it is seeking damages of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds
670m) from former managers and promoters - looked more secure yesterday, the
directors stated, after the promise of an inflow of fresh funds and hopes of
a favourable US appeals court hearing.
Butte's former Australian subsidiary, Vam, which is now called Hillgrove
Gold, has completed a fund-raising exercise which will result in the UK
company receiving about ADollars 500,000 (Pounds 244,000) in debt
repayments.
Mr Graham Andrews, Butte's finance director, said the company also intended
to sell its remaining 5 per cent stake in Hillgrove Gold to raise about
another ADollars 350,000 (Pounds 171,000).
The proceeds would partly be used to pay Butte's former Australian legal
advisers - its last debt not related to the US court cases - and this would
leave the company with about Pounds 200,000.
Mr Andrews said that the US appeals court hearing should result in the judge
in Montana, where Butte is prosecuting its cases, soon starting pre-trial
processes which might lead to the full hearing in 1995.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Metro Radio doubles to Pounds 1.65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong turnover growth and control of operating costs helped Metro Radio
Group, the USM-quoted radio station operator, report pre-tax profits more
than doubled from Pounds 797,000 to Pounds 1.65m for the six months to
end-March.
The outcome was struck on turnover up by 26 per cent from Pounds 8m to
Pounds 10.1m. The interim dividend, which is raised from 1.5p to 2.25p, is
covered nearly three times by earnings per share of 6.48p (3.13p).
Advertising revenues were up 39 per cent nationally, and 27 per cent
overall. The company attributed this to greater economic confidence and
radio's growing credibility as an advertising medium.
The company said the second half had begun strongly and it expected the full
year to show significant growth. However, because national advertising
revenue began improving in last year's second half, directors said it would
be unrealistic to expect the full year to show such large percentage rises
as the interim results.
Cashflow resulting from the growth in profitability in recent months has
enabled the group to reduce its medium term loan from Pounds 1.9m at
end-September 1993 to Pounds 1m at March 31.
A further Pounds 500,000 will be repaid on May 31 and Mr John Josephs,
managing director, said he expected the company would have no borrowings by
the year end.
Metro, which operates seven independent radio stations in north-east England
and Yorkshire, said it intends bidding for one of the two new London FM
licences.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: United Carriers unsettled by warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in United Carriers fell sharply yesterday as it became the latest
company to issue a profit warning shortly after going public.
The shares dropped 33p to 115p, compared with the February flotation price
of 153p, after the parcel and freight company admitted to having suffered an
'exceptionally tough' April.
As a result it predicted that this year's profits would be 'somewhat less'
than 1993's figure of Pounds 4.1m. Analysts had been expecting at least
Pounds 4.8m.
The group said that trading in February and March had been in line with
expectations but that in April the parcels and freight business had seen
volumes down by about 5 per cent on last year.
'The fall arose from a significant reduction in volumes from the underlying
customer base as well as a net loss of business arising from competitive
pressures.' In particular, it is thought that United lost market share to
Lynx, the NCF subsidiary, after failing to respond to price cuts.
United said that during May it has gradually begun to reduce the volume
shortfall, in part by securing new business. It added, however, that it was
unlikely that the shortfall in the parcels and freight business will be
recouped during the remainder of 1994 with the company predicting flat
volumes compared with 1993.
Trading in the rest of the group, notably in the specialist transport and
distribution businesses, has exceeded expectations, but this has not been
sufficient to make up for the shortfall elsewhere.
Directors sold about Pounds 4.5m of shares in the February placing, which
was sponsored by Lazards with UBS acting as broker.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Automotive Precision valued at Pounds 40.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Automotive Precision Holdings, the precision engineering company,
were priced at 100p yesterday valuing the group, which exports 93 per cent
of its production, at Pounds 40.8m.
Automotive Precision, based in Tonbridge, Kent, is coming to market via a
placing of 10.2m shares with institutional investors by Beeson Gregory. The
shares are due to begin trading on May 31.
The company, which manufactures high precision components for the
international automotive industry, was the subject of a Pounds 6m management
buy-out from Hunting, the defence, aviation and oil group, in December 1990.
About 80 per cent of its exports go to customers in the US including
Chrysler and Detroit Diesel.
Some 80 per cent of turnover is covered by rolling contracts of between two
and four years and the customer base has doubled since 1992.
Last year the group reported profits before non-recurring items of Pounds
4.99m (Pounds 4.2m) on turnover of Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 17.1m). Pre-tax
profits slipped to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 2.59m) after remuneration payments
of Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 1.24m).
The bulk of the shares being placed, some 9.71m, are being sold by the five
members of the buy-out team. The remaining 500,000 shares are being issued
by the company to cover the costs of the placing.
The management, led by Mr Stefan Petszaft, managing director, will retain
roughly a 70 per cent stake in the group, but plan to reduce this. The
managers had initially planned to retain a 50 to 55 per cent stake but
scaled down the sale because of the condition of the market.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Casket rises to Pounds 3.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand from abroad helped Casket, Britain's second-largest bicycle
manufacturer, boost annual pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 3.6m.
The company, which claims 25 per cent of the UK market, increased exports by
26 per cent. Profits for the year to end-March were also helped by the
Pounds 1.3m acquisition of a German bicycle company in November, which
contributed Pounds 395,000 at the pre-tax level. Sales were 8 per cent
higher at Pounds 103.8m.
Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said the underlying bicycle business had
shown like-for-like growth of 18.5 per cent in the year. Demand for Casket's
range of brands had been particularly strong in Germany, France and Ireland,
he said.
The results included the final costs of a long-running legal action over
accounting practices at Kingsley &amp; Forester, a clothing company merged with
Casket in 1988. The group incurred net exceptional costs of Pounds 453,000,
bringing the total costs of the six-year suit to about Pounds 650,000.
The final dividend is increased to 0.7p making a 1.1p (0.8p) total. Earnings
rose by 26 per cent to 3.19p.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Low-level response to CLS offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The intermediaries offer for CLS Holdings, the property company owned by the
Swedish Mortstedt family, has been only 15 per cent subscribed.
The London-focused property investment company had fully underwritten an
offer of 45.05m new shares at 111p, subject to clawback to cover
applications for the 11.26m shares offered to intermediaries. Applications
were received for 1.64m shares.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dawson seeks Pounds 45m after heavy losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile group, yesterday announced
a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise more than Pounds 45m as it plunged into the
red after provisions for the closure of its US fleece and jersey business.
More than 39m shares will be issued at 120p. Yesterday they closed at 150p,
up 6p on the day.
Pre-tax losses for the year to March 26 were Pounds 95.4m, after a provision
of Pounds 50m and goodwill written off of Pounds 56.4m. There was a profit
of Pounds 32.1m in the comparable period.
Turnover was Pounds 443.1m (Pounds 431.7m), including Pounds 58.3m (Pounds
76.2m) from the discontinued US activities. Operating profits of Pounds
18.8m (Pounds 37.2m) took account of losses of Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 2.71m)
from the US operations.
Sir Ronald Miller, executive chairman, said market conditions had been
appalling. 'As a small player we did not stand a chance.'
The closure of the division soaked up Pounds 38m of the provision.
The remaining Pounds 12m was for Dawson Home Fashions, a maker of shower
curtains and bath mats, which was hit by imports. The provision would cover
its sale, which is under discussion, or its restructuring if the sale fell
through, Dawson said.
Dawson Home Fashions incurred its first loss last year, of Pounds 2.9m on
sales Pounds 57.3m, compared with a previous profit of Pounds 4.6m on sales
of Pounds 59.5m.
Operating profits from continuing operations, excluding Dawson Home
Fashions, were ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 35.2m). Sir Ronald
said: 'We can see enormous potential coming through.'
Losses per share were 64.6p, compared with earnings of 13.3p. A final
dividend of 1.5p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 3p (9p).
The proceeds from the rights issue will be used to develop and expand the
core businesses, particularly the international branded clothing business
and the Morgan thermal underwear business in the US. The group will also
reduce borrowings and redeem up to Pounds 27.9m of 9.375 per cent
convertible preference shares.
Gearing at March 26 was 67.4 per cent if the convertible shares are treated
as liabilities; 37.4 per cent if they are treated as equity. Pro forma net
gearing would be 20.1 per cent.
The rights issue would have the effect of restoring shareholders funds,
which fell from Pounds 163.4m to Pounds 115.1m at March 26, to Pounds
160.5m.
The issue has been underwritten by Samuel Montagu, Goldman Sachs and Noble
Grossart. Broker to the issue is Cazenove.
COMMENT
The figures are horrendous, but were well flagged at the beginning of March.
It could be argued that there is no need for the rights issue as the
remaining operations are cash generative. On the other hand the underlying
businesses look undervalued, with pencilled-in profits of a little less than
Pounds 30m giving a prospective multiple of 13.5. In the final analysis
shareholders will simply have to ask themselves if the management that got
into such a mess deserves backing.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fairline powers ahead to Pounds 350,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fairline Boats, the Peterborough-based luxury powerboat maker, more than
doubled interim profits as UK sales rose 29 per cent and some export markets
improved.
Profits rose from Pounds 161,000 to Pounds 350,000 pre-tax for the six
months to the end of March.
Optimistic that the second half would show a similar rate of growth, the
company declared a 40 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 5p
(3.575p), payable from earnings per share of 6.74p (3p). The shares closed
up 40p at 435p.
Sales rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 15.2m) of which direct
exports, up 12 per cent, accounted for 70 per cent and additional foreign
sales by UK distributors accounted for an estimated 20 per cent.
Mr Sam Newington, chairman, said conditions had been better than he had
expected although confidence in some overseas markets 'is not as strong as
we would like'.
Although sales to Germany have been holding up, the French and Italian
market had proved 'tricky', he said. But improving consumer confidence in
the domestic market and continental Europe was leading to higher sales.
The company hopes to raise margins by reducing the number of models and
holding down raw material costs which account for 60 per cent of production
costs.
The order book stands at about Pounds 10m, more than 50 per cent higher than
a year ago. Two new models will be launched at the Southampton Boat Show in
September to supplement the four introduced in the last 12 months.
Increased production is likely to be met by re-opening of one of the group's
factories near Peterborough. Net cash at the end of the six months was
Pounds 2m.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: French buy for Coutts Consulting - Placing
and open offer to fund GBA purchase for up to FFr85.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coutts Consulting Group, the career consultancy, outplacement and
residential training company, yesterday agreed to acquire GBA Group of
France for a maximum FFr85.9m (Pounds 10.1m).
The proposed acquisition of GBA, one of the leading outplacement and career
counselling groups in France with 130 employees, will consolidate Coutts'
position as Europe's largest outplacement group with 33 offices in six
countries.
Mr Stephen Johnson, chief executive, said the deal would enable the expanded
group to serve its multinational clients across Europe better. He said the
expansion of outplacement operations into continental Europe had been a
vital element in the strategy for developing the group.
Coutts will pay an initial FFr47.2m, including FFr39.7m in cash, with the
balance satisfied through the issue of 971,366 shares to the vendors. Up to
a further Pounds 4.5m will be paid subject to GBA meeting profit targets in
1994 and 1995.
GBA reported pre-tax profits of FFr7.7m for 1993.
The acquisition will be funded in part through a placing and open offer at
85p designed to raise Pounds 6.4m including Pounds 1.1m net of new money.
The shares are being offered on the basis of 8 new shares for every 29
existing shares and 13.137 new shares for every 100 convertible preference
shares.
The 7.56m new shares have been conditionally placed with institutional
shareholders by Collins Stewart, subject to claw-back. Coutts' shares closed
unchanged yesterday at 91p.
Part of the proceeds of the share issue will be used to pay Pounds 730,000
of dividend arrears on convertible preference shares, enabling the group to
resume dividend payments on the ordinary shares at the interim stage later
this year.
The company has undergone a substantial restructuring over the past 30
months, including replacing Mr Barry Topple, its chief executive, and
appointing Sir Kit McMahon, former chairman of Midland Bank, as
non-executive chairman.
Following the acquisition and the completion of the sale of Winkfield Place,
the group's vacant Berkshire property, for Pounds 1.4m due at the end of
May, the enlarged group will have net borrowings of Pounds 4m, equivalent to
gearing of about 50 per cent.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Readicut advances to Pounds 20.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Readicut International, the household textile, carpeting and yarn company,
lifted pre-tax profits by 8.7 per cent to Pounds 20.9m for the year ended
March 31.
Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, yesterday described conditions in the
group's markets as 'far from ideal'. UK recovery was irregular, margins
remained under pressure, the US recovery was slow and Europe was still in
recession.
Total turnover moved ahead from Pounds 235m to Pounds 238m. The latest
figure includes Pounds 36.4m from discontinued operations, compared with
Pounds 43.9m last time.
The pre-tax profits included Pounds 3.9m from the disposal last month of
Firth Furnishings, a maker of car carpets, and the sale last October of
Readicut Wool, the distributor of rug kits, knitting yarn and handicraft
products.
This compared with profits of Pounds 4.2m from disposals in the previous
year, when pre-tax profits were Pounds 19.2m.
In the key carpet division operating profits were up from Pounds 3.78m to
Pounds 6.73m on sales of Pounds 88.4m (Pounds 81.3m). Mr Shaw said profits
at Firth Carpets moved from Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 2.1m on the back of a
20 per cent rise in contract carpet sales.
The group lifted capital spending from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 14.5m during
the year, and is planning to spend Pounds 15.2m in the current year.
Earnings per share were ahead from 7.5p to 7.84p. An unchanged final
dividend of 2.81p is proposed, maintaining the total for the year at 3.44p.
COMMENT
This was a solid set of results, in a difficult year, from a well-managed
company that has successfully got out of its non-core, low-margin
businesses. Profits this year are expected to be about Pounds 18.5m, giving
a prospective multiple of 15 - not cheap, but a good share to hold in the
textiles sector. The unchanged dividend looks a bit mean for a group that
ended the year with net cash of Pounds 10.1m. The question now is: what is
it going to buy?

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: TeleWest takes on Pounds 195m debt for
Scottish cable networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TeleWest Communications, the largest cable television operator in the UK,
has borrowed Pounds 195m to complete its Scottish cable networks.
The eight franchises in the central belt of Scotland cover 632,000 homes
ranging from Edinburgh and Perth to Dundee, Motherwell and Livingston.
The loan facility, which matures in December 2003, was arranged by Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce and is underwritten by CIBC, Bank of New York, The
Bank of Nova Scotia, British Linen Bank, First National Bank of Boston and
The Toronto Dominion Bank.
The loan is structured in two tranches, one of which has recourse to
TeleWest's shareholders, Tele-Communications and US West.
TeleWest said Edinburgh was one of its best franchises for both television
and telephone services. The other Scottish franchises were bought from Post
Newsweek late last year.
TeleWest has announced its intention to float on both the London Stock
Exchange and the Nasdaq market in the US later this summer. The float will
be the first by a UK cable group and is likely to value the company at about
Pounds 1.7bn.
TeleWest owns and operates 16 cable franchises and has minority interests in
three other companies which operate seven further franchises.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cash-rich M&amp;S earmarks Pounds 1bn for store
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer said yesterday that it was accelerating its expansion
programme and expected to spend more than Pounds 1bn over the next three
years.
The company said annual capital spending would rise from last year's Pounds
281m, and might reach Pounds 450m if the right opportunities were available.
Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman, said: 'There really isn't any constraint.
We have got plenty of cash and we are in an aggressive mood regarding
expansion.'
Comparatively little would go on new UK stores. M&amp;S eventually plans 25
out-of-town centres, but already has 17. Rather more would be spent on
expanding existing town-centre stores.
Sir Richard said stores now needed between 80,000 sq ft and 120,000 sq ft of
space to accommodate the full range of clothing, food and furnishings, but
added that many were smaller.
The second focus for expansion would be continental Europe, where sales rose
3 per cent last year to Pounds 243.3m although profits slipped from Pounds
27.3m to Pounds 27.1m in a difficult trading climate.
The emphasis would be on France and Spain, with new stores opening on the
Rue de Rivoli in Paris, and in Valencia.
The third focus would be east Asia, where sales grew 38 per cent to Pounds
56.6m, and profits 43 per cent to Pounds 15.2m.
Sir Richard expected his main task as chairman would be building the
business in continental Europe, leaving east Asia for his successor. But the
company's stores in Hong Kong and elsewhere have exceeded all expectations,
forcing him to move more quickly.
In addition to south-east Asia, the company is under pressure to take its
retailing expertise into Japan and China - in the former from trading
companies, and in the latter from the government.
Sir Richard said both markets offered huge opportunities, but start-up costs
were high and caution would characterise M&amp;S's approach.
In the US, the emphasis was on bringing the performance of Brooks Bros up to
the standard of the rest of the group.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BTR gives directors up to 17% more pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of BTR, the industrial conglomerate, have received basic salary
increases for this year of up to 17 per cent. And it has emerged that an
unusual guarantee has been given to chief executive Mr Alan Jackson: his
salary cannot be cut.
A clause in Mr Jackson's contract states that his annual pay review 'shall
not result in payment of salary less than that paid during the 12-month
period preceding such review'.
The rises took effect on January 1 and so did not feature in the 1993 annual
report, published last month.
BTR, which holds its annual meeting in London tomorrow, reported a 19 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds 1.28bn and increased its
full-year dividend by 13 per cent to 12.25p. The consensus City forecast is
for a 12 per cent increase in profits this year.
Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, has the largest increase. A Pounds
30,000 - or 17.6 per cent - pay rise takes her basic salary to Pounds
200,000. Mr Jackson has received an 8.4 per cent rise, taking his annual pay
to ADollars 1.23m (Pounds 600,000). His service agreement is with BTR Nylex,
an Australian company in which BTR has a 60 per cent stake.
Mr Norman Ireland, BTR's chairman, will be paid Pounds 213,830 this year for
a three-day week, slightly less than received by Sir Owen Green, the
previous chairman, in his final year.
Mr Michael Smith earns a basic salary of Pounds 281,000 and has a contract
which guarantees him a three-year notice period. This remains in place
despite recent moves by institutions to limit notice periods to one year. Mr
Robert Fairclough, whose salary has been increased from Dollars 705,000 to
Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 500,000), has a similar clause but his contract runs
only until September 1996.
There is also likely to be shareholder concern over a Dollars 3.5m payment
made to Mr Edgar Sharp, formerly president of BTR Inc, the main US
subsidiary. About Dollars 1m of this was paid to Mr Sharp before December 31
1990, with the rest going into a pension trust which he was eligible to
receive from January 1 this year.
The company said that the payment 'has been paid in accordance with his
contract'. Mr Sharp is to remain with BTR as a non-executive director after
his contract ends in June.
BTR declined to comment on the rises yesterday.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees deal with Thames
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Tele-vision has proposed a programming-making alliance
with Thames Television, the independent production company now owned by
Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the Financial Times.
YTT would like to make programmes with Thames for sale to international
markets.
The Leeds-based ITV company, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 4.6m (profit Pounds 3.6m) for the six months to March 31, is also
linking up with large advertisers to make programmes.
A new drama series, The Wanderer, which was 80 per cent financed by Procter
&amp; Gamble and was turned down by the ITV network centre has instead been sold
to Sky Television.
Increasing programme production, particularly for new markets outside the
ITV network, is one of the strategies being pursued by Mr Ward Thomas, YTT's
chairman.
At the same time he is trying to increase the company's share of ITV
advertising. Last year its reached a low of just below 10 per cent.
By cutting costs the ITV company, which paid a total in licence payments up
from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 30.4m to the Independent Television Commission,
lifted operating profits from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 24.7m.
Mr Thomas said that the advertising deal problems were now a matter of
history. Settlements had now been made in full with all advertisers and the
company now had an ungeared balance sheet.
Analysts were now looking at pre-tax profits of between Pounds 5m to Pounds
7m for the full year.
Mr Thomas said he 'looked forward with confidence to a measured and
improving share of the total advertising cake and a consequential
improvement in revenue through the rest of the year'.
Turnover fell from Pounds 126m last time to Pounds 107.7m as advertising
revenue dropped by Pounds 20m. Some of the leeway was made up by significant
job losses. Staff costs fell from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 17.8m. Losses per
share were 6.1p (3.3p earnings). The company is declaring a nominal interim
dividend of 0.1p (3.3p).
The shares closed yesterday down 7p at 312p.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional treatment revised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET has agreed to amend the treatment of exceptional items in its 1993
report and accounts following discussions with the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog.
The effect will be to eliminate a series of separately itemised exceptional
items totalling Pounds 76m on the face of the profit and loss account and
re-allocate them.
The adjustment comes after discussions with one of the largest companies the
panel has examined. Other large cases include British Gas and Trafalgar
House.
The review panel said yesterday it acknowledged BET had disclosed the nature
of the exceptional items in the notes to the accounts. However, it 'felt
that this did not fulfil the requirement of the standard that these items
should be shown on the profit and loss account under the statutory format
headings to which they relate'.
In a revised note to the accounts, BET has had to re-allocate the
exceptional items between cost of sales and administrative expenses.
The panel is believed to have been concerned about the presentation of the
exceptional items in boxes and comments in the chairman's statement which
drew attention away from the pre-tax profit line stressed in FRS 3.
BET said last night: 'This was a technical detail probably of most interest
to those in the accounting profession. The analysts did not ask one question
about it this morning.'
It said it had adopted FRS 3 earlier than many companies and there was a
lack of clarity about how it should be implemented at the time. It believed
its original treatment was more helpful in showing its underlying
performance.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BET ends year Pounds 92m in black -
Restructuring complete but difficult trading conditions persist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services group which over-expanded by acquisition during
the 1980s, said its restructuring was complete, but warned that pressure on
margins and difficult trading conditions persisted across much of the group.
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said: 'We expect to see earnings improvement
coming from better productivity rather than increased selling prices.'
BET made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 92m in the year to April 2, compared
with a loss of Pounds 9.8m in the previous year, which included Pounds 76m
of exceptional costs.
Restructuring costs of Pounds 42m were incurred this time, of which Pounds
34m had already been provided for.
Turnover fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.97bn, in spite of a Pounds 61m
favourable currency effect, mainly because of divestments. The group said a
further 17 non-core businesses had been sold during the year, and the
disposal programme was now complete.
Mr Clark added: 'I said when appointed that it would take three years - and
it has. We have gone from 160 disparate profit centres to a set of four
focused businesses.'
BET had net cash of Pounds 67m at the year-end, compared with debts of more
than Pounds 1bn when Mr Clark and his new team arrived.
The chief executive said his priority would be to invest in organic growth
and 'bolt-on' acquisitions, although he would consider a bigger purchase 'if
the right one came along'.
The group said the speed of its success in improving performance would
depend on efforts to improve productivity and marketing skills. Higher
productivity would enable it to offset inflation and price pressure, while
the marketing programme was aimed at developing value-added services in new
areas.
Operating profit from business services rose from Pounds 14.1m to Pounds
31.8m, although the previous figure was depressed by the Pounds 11.5m share
of the Pounds 76m exceptional item allotted to the division. BET said the
underlying 24 per cent growth in operating profits was helped by margin
improvements in UK cleaning and security services and US personnel services.
Distribution services turned in an operating profit of Pounds 30.8m, against
Pounds 9.3m, or Pounds 20.8m minus Pounds 11.5m of exceptionals. Underlying
growth of 48 per cent comprised rises of Pounds 5m from the US, Pounds 3m
from Europe and Pounds 2m from Africa.
Plant services increased operating profit to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 15.8m), or
Pounds 26.5m minus Pounds 10.7m of exceptionals. Lower margins led to the 29
per cent fall in underlying performance, in spite of a good showing in the
US.
Textile services' operating profits rose from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 35.4m,
or Pounds 28.1m minus Pounds 22.5m of exceptionals. BET said improved
margins from this business caused the 26 per cent increase in underlying
profitability.
Earnings per share of 6.9p compared with losses of 4p last time. A final
dividend of 2.25p maintains the total at 3.25p.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI at Pounds 327m and disposals
planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI said yesterday that it was negotiating to sell its security
business and part of its defence subsidiary.
A sale of the businesses could precipitate a demerger of its core music and
rental divisions.
The group said it was interested in entering book publishing, if it could
find the right company to acquire.
Thorn yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 326.5m for the year to
March 31. That compared with a restated Pounds 273.5m last time, but fell
below market expectations.
The shares fell 28p to Pounds 10.68.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, said the group was in 'detailed negotiations'
to sell a majority stake in its security business. Thorn would retain a
minority interest, he said.
He added that the group was negotiating to sell part of its lossmaking
defence business, which has been on the market for several years.
Sir Colin said the negotiations were with a continental European defence
group. Negotiations with GEC have taken place on several occasions over the
past few years.
Sir Colin said about Pounds 400m of turnover came from activities regarded
as peripheral. Thorn was currently negotiating to sell businesses
representing just over half that amount. Total turnover for 1993-94 was
Pounds 4.3bn, compared with Pounds 4.5bn last time.
Mr Simon Duffy, finance director, said the group was interested in moving
into book publishing, a field in which it could use its expertise in
copyright management.
He added: 'We're looking at opportunities in the book publishing business.
It's got to be available, it's got to be the right fit and the right price.'
The group has renamed its rental business Thorn Group, differentiating it
more clearly from EMI Music. Thorn Group is run from the UK, while the music
subsidiary has its headquarters in New York.
Sir Colin said yesterday that splitting the two divisions could only be
considered when the peripheral businesses have been sold.
Mr Duffy said that once this had happened, media or film companies which
were not in the music business might be interested in linking up with EMI.
Operating profits were Pounds 382.5m, compared with Pounds 379.3m. Music
profits were Pounds 246.1m (Pounds 196.9m) and those for rental Pounds
130.2m (Pounds 115.3m).
The recommended final dividend is 25p, bringing the total pay-out to 34p
(32p). Fully diluted earnings per share were 47.7p (43p).
Sir Colin said the increased dividend reflected the group's confidence in
its prospects during the current year.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cassell shares placed at 143p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Cassell, best known as a publisher of dictionaries and reference
books, have been placed at 143p, giving the group a market capitalisation of
Pounds 10.5m - considerably less than the figure of Pounds 15m mooted when
the plan to float was unveiled in early April.
Mr Philip Sturrock, chairman, said: 'We are pleased to have got it away in
present market conditions. I believe a lot of floats have been pulled. We
felt it was better to price it keenly and carry on.'
A total of 6.27m Cassell shares were placed with institutions by
Charterhouse Bank, with Charterhouse Tilney acting as broker, at 13 times
historic earnings. Trading will begin on June 2.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Scarce capital chases the swings of the cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The switch from last year's apparent global abundance of capital to this
year's developing scarcity has been sharp, but not at all unusual in terms
of past cycles.
This week global long-term interest rates have edged up again after a short
respite. As for short-term markets, there has already been a flip up in
dollar rates and most economists in the UK now appear to believe that
sterling rates have bottomed. Worse for sentiment, the comfortable
assumption that continental European short-term rates would continue the
trend downwards for a considerable period was called into question by
remarks made by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, on Monday. Only
in Japan do interest rates seem thoroughly subdued - but, even there, the
laws of arithmetic state that there is little downside from 2 per cent.
The background to all this is economic acceleration. Last year's capital
market frolics were conducted in the context of OECD growth of only about
1.2 per cent, and zero outside the US. But this year the OECD growth rate
should be fairly close to the long-term average of about 2.4 per cent.
Meanwhile the dynamic Asian economies are surging ahead at around 8 per
cent; by 1995 the global growth rate may be 4 per cent.
From the global investor's point of view the challenge is that the worldwide
cycle is a composite of many different national cycles. Although out of
phase, they are linked by international capital flows to a degree not seen
in recent history. Thus German long-term interest rates have gone up this
year even though this move would not yet be justified by the domestic cycle.
Financial theory says that in a recession, idle capital drains out of the
productive economy and tends to push up the value of financial assets. With
recovery, money is sucked back into working capital and eventually into
rising fixed investment. Bond yields rise and prices therefore fall, though
equity prices are subsequently sustained in a rising trend for a number of
months because of the positive pull of rising profits and dividends.
Later in the cycle there is a buoyant demand for real assets, including
property and commodities. Finally, late cycle inflationary pressures lead to
bull markets in inflation hedges and collectables, ranging from gold to old
masters.
This chronology has been clearly displayed in the dollar markets, with long
bonds peaking out last October and the stock market in early February. Now
the bull market has shifted to commodities with the CRB Futures Index, for
instance, up 12 per cent over the past year. As is characteristic of a
cyclical bull market, the rise in prices of many commodities - such as
apparently abundant base metals, for instance - is often difficult to
justify on fundamentals, but it reflects a combination of inventory building
by industry and trend-chasing by speculators. Only some time later may the
excitement spread to gold, which is up a bare 3 per cent over the past 12
months.
Meanwhile bonds are suffering. Real interest rates on bonds are now becoming
very high, because of shifts in the delicate balance of global financial
flows. In pressurising the Japanese to stimulate their economy, the
Americans are also threatening the major source of global savings.
Big public sector deficits are too prevalent. Whether the pressures within
the global financial markets produce a serious crunch will depend on whether
the borrowing governments can tighten their budgets and neatly withdraw from
the capital markets as recovery gathers pace.
The immediate message is that the climate has fundamentally changed. We may
not be in a fully fledged bear market, but the balance has shifted and
securities markets are no longer being buoyed by liquidity surpluses.
Instead they are liable to be hit by obscure selling pressures as various
market participants (such as the hedge funds last winter) are forced to
liquidate or redirect resources. Issues are trickier to launchand flows into
mutual funds are moderating.
Short-term opportunities may be cyclically scarce, but on the other hand
long-term investors are once again finding value - in high real yields, for
instance - that will satisfy their realistic funding objectives.

FT  25 MAY 94 / US watchdog looks at use of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The pressure on US companies to reveal more about their use of derivative
financial instruments grew yesterday as it emerged that the Securities and
Exchange Commission had written to a number of companies asking them for
more information about their activities in this area.
News of the SEC's request comes ahead of an appearance today by the agency's
chairman, Mr Arthur Levitt, before the House of Representative's
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. Mr Edward Markey, the
subcommittee's chairman, is planning legislation on derivatives.
The SEC's letter is believed to have been directed to some of the largest
users of derivatives, instruments which companies use to reduce exposure to
exchange or interest rate fluctuations.
In recent weeks reported losses, most notably from Procter &amp; Gamble, has led
to concern that in some cases derivatives have increased the risks companies
are running, rather than reduced them.
Yesterday Dell Computer announced an after-tax loss of Dollars 15.6m (Pounds
10.4m) after it misjudged the trend of European and Japanese interest rates
and incurred losses on its investment portfolio which used derivatives.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting regulations,
is also pressing US companies for extra disclosure. The body has released
draft disclosure rules, and hopes to have a final version in place to apply
to companies whose financial years end in December.
The FASB's draft requires companies to explain the objectives of their use
of derivatives, and the instruments and hedging strategies they use.
The spotlight that has been turned on to the use of derivatives - and the
attention paid to every loss incurred, whether or not such instruments have
enhanced companies' profits in the past - has scared most big companies away
from talking publicly about this area. 'It's like asking them about their
marital relations,' said one auditor with a big US accounting firm.
Several companies are believed to have commissioned external reviews of
their derivatives portfolios, to reassure themselves that they do not have
losses in this area as well.
A report last week from the US General Accounting Office last week called
for more regulation of the way companies use such financial instruments.

FT  25 MAY 94 / M&amp;S extends its retailing lead: Pre-tax rise of 16% at lower
end of forecasts - Pounds 1bn expansion planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marks and Spencer yesterday extended its lead as the UK's most profitable
retailer, announcing a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
851.5m.
The company also said it planned to spend more than Pounds 1bn in the next
three years on stepping up expansion in the UK, continental Europe and east
Asia, and was looking at opening stores in China and Japan.
Last year, Marks and Spencer's profit of Pounds 736.5m was only just ahead
of J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer. But with Sainsbury this
year reporting only Pounds 369m after exceptional charges - or Pounds 777m
before these - M&amp;S's lead was unchallenged.
'We have shown we can deliver profitable growth in this country and
overseas, consistently,' said Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman. 'If we can do
that in the kind of recession we have been through, we think we are in good
shape for the years ahead.'
But M&amp;S shares fell 12 1/2 p to 412p on what was seen as a cautious results
statement - warning that cost inflation might re-emerge later this year -
and disappointment that profits were at the lower end of expectations. They
were reduced by a Pounds 16m increase in pension costs.
Group turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 6.54bn, and operating profits
18 per cent to Pounds 873.4m.
Sir Richard said the improvement resulted from M&amp;S's strategy of offering
'outstanding value' by improving product quality and trimming some prices,
particularly in food. That had been made possible by cutting costs and
investing in information technology, which allowed the group to cut its
gross margin while maintaining its net margin.
Resulting volume increases had benefited both M&amp;S and its suppliers, which
were able to operate at maximum efficiency.
UK clothing sales had increased 7.5 per cent in a market which grew only 4.5
per cent, and food sales had increased 7.1 per cent, against growth in the
market of 5.9 per cent.
Total UK turnover grew 9.5 per cent to Pounds 5.48bn, and operating profits
18 per cent to Pounds 809.9m. The group's financial services business also
showed double-figure increases in sales and profits.
Growth rates outside the UK were even faster. Total sales in north America,
continental Europe and east Asia increased 16 per cent to Pounds 852.3m, and
profits 13 per cent to Pounds 63.5m.
Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 20.9p, and the company is
recommending a final dividend of 6.7p, giving a total of 9.2p - a 14 per
cent increase.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Inchcape shares shed 21p after profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Inchcape fell 21p to 499p yesterday after the UK-based motors,
marketing and services group warned that profits in the first six months of
this year would be below last year's.
Sir David Plastow, chairman, said that - as in 1993 - the group was
suffering from the strengthening of the yen and the Japanese recession, the
downturn in continental European motor markets and austerity measures in
China. He told yesterday's annual meeting: 'Not much has changed since then
and, in particular, we have yet to gain any significant respite from the
yen's strength.'
Nonetheless, the chairman was cautiously optimistic that Inchcape could
achieve sufficient progress in the second half to be able to maintain the
group's record of year-on-year profit growth. Last year Inchcape made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 272m. Analysts downgraded their forecasts to
between Pounds 255m and Pounds 270m.
Sir David said the group's performance in the early months of this year had
varied. Motor imports and distribution continued to suffer from the strong
yen and the depressed continental car markets. 'However, the Asian
businesses generally continue to perform well although, as previously
announced, we no longer benefit from the joint venture in Hong Kong,
exporting Toyota vehicles into China,' he said.
This joint venture came to an end at the turn of the year, having
contributed Pounds 14m to group profits in 1993, of which nearly Pounds 11m
was earned in the first half.
The group's marketing business stream had improved its performance in 1994
and the remedial action taken, particularly in Malaysia and Taiwan, were
paying dividends. However, Japan, in spite of signs of improvement,
continued to be a challenging economy for most of the group's marketing
businesses.
'Insurance services, shipping services and testing services have continued
to make good progress, and although the western retailing environment is
still depressed, buying services is recovering,' said the chairman.
Last month Inchcape made a Pounds 176.6m agreed bid for Hogg Group, which it
hopes to merge with its own insurance broking subsidiary, Bain Clarkson, to
create the seventh largest insurance broker in the world.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Low price prompts LCH to pull float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Pounds 150m flotation of London Capital Holdings, the property
investment company, was pulled yesterday in the face of a weak stock market
and investor indigestion at the Pounds 930m of capital raised in the listed
property sector this year.
The issue was to be launched this morning, but Citibank was not prepared to
accept the price at which advisers said its shares would have to be sold.
They had planned to raise more than Pounds 100m from the combined sale of up
to 70 per cent of Citibank's holding and Pounds 15m of new shares. However,
it is believed that Warburg Securities recommended the share offer should be
made at a 10 to 15 per cent discount to the company's Pounds 160m net asset
value, in line with other recent issues.
The property sector was the star performer of the stock market last year,
sparking a proliferation of flotation candidates.
Capital Shopping Centres, the first property flotation of the year, was
offered at a 13 per cent premium to its asset value, but it received an
unenthusiastic response. Since then, values have fallen, while competition
has intensified, with CLS Holdings, Pillar Properties and Argent Group all
launching offers in the past fortnight.
Mr Jeffrey Heintz, Citibank's representative on the LCH board, said: 'We
weren't prepared to chase the market down for the sake of doing a deal.'
LCH has Pounds 245m of gross assets, and is wholly owned by Citibank. Mr
Heintz said the bank would review its options. These include relaunching the
issue later this year, selling the property portfolio directly, or a private
placement with institutions.
The offer was being sponsored by Baring Brothers, with Warburg as brokers.
LCH was formed from the remnants of Randsworth Trust, which was taken
private in 1989 at the peak of the market, but subsequently had to be
rescued by its banker - Citibank.
The company has a portfolio of West End of London properties, but the
management has suffered from the fact that Citibank was restricted from
putting new capital into the business. This left the joint managing
directors, Mr Nigel Kempner and Mr Stephen Musgrave, with little scope in
the rising market, other than to improve the quality of existing properties.

FT  25 MAY 94 / US and Japan agree to resume trade talks: Breakthrough has
muted welcome in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan yesterday agreed to resume negotiations on a trade
'framework' which Washington expects will produce increased exports in
specific sectors and a reduction of Japan's trade surplus.
Agreement was announced after five days of talks in Washington and a phone
call between President Bill Clinton and prime minister Tsutomu Hata. They
congratulated each other on ending three months of stand-off and vowed to
strengthen the bilateral relationship.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said sectoral talks would begin
immediately on cars and car parts, insurance and government procurement. He
also hopes to launch discussions 'as soon as possible' in other disputed
areas, such as financial services, glass and intellectual property.
The agreement reflects an improved political climate between the two
countries. It has become apparent that the failure of the February 11 summit
between President Clinton and Japan's then prime minister, Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, resulted from deep suspicion on both sides. The Japanese thought
the US was pressing them to accept fixed market shares, as it did in the
case of semiconductors; the US thought Tokyo was once again negotiating a
meaningless deal which would not produce results.
It was Mr Hata - then foreign minister - who remarked that the US would not
trust Japan unless it agreed to numerical indicators, while Japan would not
trust the US if it did. Turbulence in the foreign exchange markets and the
prospect that the entire relationship was in trouble forced both sides to
work out their differences.
Their dispute had centred on a US demand for market-opening agreements that
contained 'objective criteria' to measure progress. 'We have confirmed that
we are not seeking numerical targets,' Mr Kantor said.
'Objective criteria will provide the basis for deciding if the agreements
succeed or fail to meet their purpose to achieve concrete results.' Each
group of sector negotiators will work out a set of objective criteria. In
Tokyo, officials were guarded in their view of the breakthrough and stressed
that the agreement was only one step towards resolving a wide array of
issues over which Japan and the US remain at odds.
Mr Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister, said in announcing the latest agreement
that the two sides had agreed not to use numerical targets as 'objective
criteria' for measuring progress in opening Japan's markets. Mr Kakizawa
said, in his view, the US would not impose sanctions based on such criteria.
Japanese business leaders welcomed the breakthrough. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda,
chairman of Toyota Motor and chairman-elect of Keidanren, Japan's Federation
of Economic Organisations, said the resumption of the talks was welcome but
the issue of greater imports of foreign vehicle parts should be decided by
private industry.
US officials have said they would like to reach sectoral agreements in time
for them to be signed at the Group of Seven summit in July. However, Mr
Kantor said the new framework did not contain a timetable for reaching
specific agreements. 'Both countries are committed to moving as quickly as
possible.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Tighter conditions urged for executive pay deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executive directors' contracts should bar them from receiving payment if
they are dismissed for poor performance, a leading shareholders' group urged
yesterday.
The Association of British Insurers, whose members form a significant
portion of UK institutional investors, makes the suggestion in guidelines
designed to encourage linking executive pay with a company's long-term
performance.
Among other guidelines, the ABI suggests that executives should have to wait
at least three to five years before being allowed to exercise share options
and that contracts should require that a portion of cash bonuses be used to
buy company stock.
'Remuneration committees have a central role and responsibility in requiring
that demanding targets be set in such schemes and that the rewards relate
realistically and responsibly to performance in the context of such
targets,' the ABI said. 'If the remuneration committee appears to fail to
measure up to its responsibilities, shareholders should . . . ask for
comment or explanation.'
The guidelines urge an annual review of bonus arrangements and full
disclosure of the terms to shareholders.
Criticism of executive pay has focused not only on the very high rewards
involved but also on the structure of remuneration packages which grant
substantial amounts for short-term share price improvements.
Shareholders have argued that large cash bonuses for directors based on a
single year's improvement do little to encourage companies to invest heavily
for the future.
'Any board that wants to look at the long-term performance should welcome
these guidelines,' said Mr Huw Jones, chairman-elect of the ABI's investment
committee.
Bonus arrangements which link cash awards to a single year's improvement in
say, earnings per share, could discourage executives from making greater
investment in research and development, Mr Jones noted.
The guidelines, developed over two years after consultations with leading
industrialists, were also endorsed by the National Association of Pension
Funds, the UK's other leading shareholder group.
Some members of the NAPF's investment committee said, however, they would
have preferred tougher stipulations barring executives from 'rolling'
contracts which are automatically renewed every three years.

FT  25 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BET
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BET's management claims to have nursed the company back to corporate health,
but it is a shadow of its former self. Since 1990 shareholders' funds have
halved to Pounds 260m despite a Pounds 200m rescue rights issue, the
dividend has fallen by 75 per cent and turnover has fallen by a quarter.
Profits have more than halved, notwithstanding last year's recovery.
Admittedly the group has net cash on its balance sheet and the focus has
sharpened to four basic business areas. But Mr John Clark, the chief
executive who masterminded the surgery, must now put some flesh back on the
bones.
It will be a daunting task. Though BET has managed 14.7 per cent margins in
its textile cleaning services, margins on other activities such as contract
cleaning and security personnel services are slow to recover. Plant hire,
which consumes more than its fair share of capital, looks a particular drag.
Nor does the newly sanitised balance sheet offer much scope for funding
acquisitions with cash, especially since capital spending is at last being
permitted to increase. Given the problems it faced at the outset, the
management may be forgiven for some sense of satisfaction. Yet its optimism
must be tempered by the board's decision to defer increasing a dividend
which is more than twice covered.

FT  25 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be some value in combining a music business with a book publisher.
But Thorn EMI will have to work hard to convince investors of the benefits
if it does decide to acquire a publisher. There are obviously similarities
between music and books. They both involve handling creative talent and have
similar distribution systems. What is more, several of the other music
majors - Warner, MCA and Bertelsmann - are also in books.
But none of this amounts to a compelling case. Thorn will need to show not
merely that book and music distribution systems are similar but that
combining them could cut costs. It will also need to show that the group's
skills in managing intellectual property can be transferred from one area to
the other. Otherwise, shareholders will be worried that the group's
resources could be squandered.
The sums involved could be large. One indication is that Thorn would be
happy for interest cover, currently 10, to fall to three or four. To get to
such a level, net debt would have to rise by Pounds 600m or more. Before
Thorn embarked on a big publishing acquisition, investors would probably
also want to see earnings in the existing business moving ahead. The 3.4 per
cent increase in adjusted earnings per share in the last financial year was
hardly much to crow about.
Meanwhile, a demerger of the music and rental businesses inches forward. The
rechristening of the rental side as the Thorn Group is a step in that
direction. But chairman Sir Colin Southgate thinks a split cannot take place
until the troubled defence interests are sold. Given that these have been on
the block since 1989, a quick disposal cannot be guaranteed.

FT  25 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank always has an excuse for the explosion in M3 money supply.
This time it is the particularly ingenious one that broad money is being
swollen by the size of the central bank's own profits. But, after April's
annualised increase of 15.8 per cent, it will take a miracle for the 1994
target to be met. The aggregate would have to shrink by DM5bn between now
and the end of the year to hit even the top of the target.
By July at the latest the bank must confront this reality. Then its council
is scheduled to review progress towards meeting this year's target. It has
numerous options: it could ignore the overshoot, suspend the target
temporarily, scrap it altogether, rebase it to a different period that
excludes the tax-related inflows at the end of last year, choose another
aggregate on which to focus, or raise the target ceiling. None of these,
however, will restore the Bundesbank's flagging credibility with the bond
market.
Perhaps it would have been different if the bank had not itself made such a
fetish of the M3 target. One of its hopes at the time of the last rate cut
was that lower short term rates would encourage investors to move further
out along the yield curve. There is little evidence of this so far, despite
the sharp steepening of the curve since the start of the year. The worry
spreading outward from the US is one factor. But the Bundesbank's inability
to get a grip on the money supply is also likely to hold Germany's bond
market back, especially now there is a whiff of economic recovery in the
air.

FT  25 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Full marks for M&amp;S
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has become a stock market tradition to greet Marks and Spencer's full
year results by marking down its shares. Last year worries about the
company's annual pay award were behind the fall. While M&amp;S has delivered on
its promise that higher pay would be earned through productivity gains,
yesterday's figures contained an unexpected Pounds 16m pension charge. Since
that amounts to 2 per cent of profits and is likely to be repeated, it could
be argued that the 3 per cent fall in the shares yesterday is a rational
response. Yet M&amp;S's management has little control over the pension charge.
In areas which matter there is no reason for disappointment.
Turnover growth in the UK of 9 per cent over the full year - and rather more
in the second half - is ample evidence that the 'outstanding value' campaign
has got the top line moving again. Market share has been increased at the
right point in the cycle, without giving anything away in terms of margin.
Rising raw materials costs may squeeze margins this year, but productivity
gains leave M&amp;S well placed to cope. Doubters who predicted that its food
business would be ravaged by price competition from the supermarket giants
have also been firmly rebutted.
If M&amp;S has a problem - other than the irritation of another poor performance
in Canada - it is deciding how to invest its cash flow. After the chastening
experience with Brooks Brothers an acquisition looks unlikely. The financial
services business can support itself and overseas capital spending of Pounds
63m is not enough to stop M&amp;S accumulating cash. A credible solution on that
score would reinforce the group's formidable momentum.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Leading Article: A manifesto for business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's long-awaited white paper on competitiveness will seriously
disappoint those expecting original insights into the factors underlying the
country's industrial performance or radical innovations in policy. Indeed,
much of it reads like a self-justifying compilation of measures already in
place or planned, and one which fails to counter the anxieties recently
expressed by, among others, the Commons trade and industry committee. As
such, it is likely to be dismissed by many, including some on the government
benches, as a damp squib.
However, the document is not without merit. First, it is pleasing that
ministers recognise that their separate departmental actions affect a wide
range of business activities and have sought to draw up an audit of their
impact. Quite how the government intends to achieve the necessary
co-ordination across Whitehall over the longer term is less clear. The
Treasury, in particular, is often rightly accused of ignoring the impact of
its policies on business and wealth creation.
Secondly, the document is to be commended for what it does not say. It
wisely eschews big new spending on industrial support. It also steers clear
of sectoral intervention and picking winners. It is encouraging that the
government now appears to accept that these approaches offer no solutions,
but more often create problems by retarding essential adjustment.
In reality, that acceptance has been imposed by circumstance. Any temptation
to embark on a big spending spree is constrained by the budget deficit and
the government's commitment to maintaining stable macro-economic policies.
Likewise, scope for action is circumscribed by the shift to Brussels of
control over trade policy, public procurement rules and, increasingly,
competition policy. Without these weapons, the arsenal of classic
interventionism which some ministers enjoy promising their political
followers is largely denuded.
Mild dirigisme
The other limiting factor is the wide spread of opinions within the
government's own ranks. These range from advocacy of mild dirigisme to heavy
reliance on deregulation. Read as a political manifesto, which it is in
part, the white paper is an attempt to bridge these two extremes.
Inevitably, that has produced a minimalist result, marked more by laundry
lists of unexceptionable proposals than by truly innovative thinking.
That said, what prescriptions does the white paper have to offer? Most
concern small business and education and training. In the former area, the
proposal to encourage faster payment of bills, initially by insisting on
more disclosure, is welcome. Increased emphasis on advisory services will be
good news for consultants, though it is unclear how far it meets small
firms' actual needs. But at least, this type of support seems unlikely to do
much harm.
The white paper correctly recognises the central importance of education and
training in raising skill levels. Much remains to be done in delivering on
government initiatives such as the reform of the national curriculum and the
introduction of new vocational qualifications. One priority rightly
identified is the need to tackle the shortcomings of GNVQs, the new
vocational qualifications widely criticised for their lack of rigour.
Learning credits
There are some new proposals on training, notably the extension of the
'modern apprenticeship' scheme to all 18-19 year olds. This welcome move
shows that the government has listened to constructive comments on its
earlier plans. Much more radical is the idea of learning credits, vouchers
that would allow young people to make their own choices in education and
training after school. Credits would keep schools, colleges and other
providers of education and training on their toes. And they would boost
parity of esteem between academic, technical and vocational education by
providing the same form of finance for each. The government should press
ahead with its promised study of the potential for credits, and mount pilot
schemes.
However, it is regrettable that more has not been done to strengthen the
role of Training and Enterprise Councils in education and training. Mergers
between Tecs and chambers of commerce are now permitted, and the developing
network of one-stop shops will help to strengthen their position. But to
acquire the strength of German chambers, they need clearer strategic purpose
and more financial and operational independence from government.
The most positive achievement of the white paper is that it sets out clearly
the government's thinking on industrial policy and wealth creation. At a
time of mounting debate on these issues, business and the public needs to
know where it stands. The result falls far short of being a 'blueprint for
industrial success', as some ministers suggest. That is an implausible claim
for any government to make, above all one which has held office for 15
years. Like a blueprint, however, the effectiveness of the measures set out
yesterday will hinge as much on their execution as on their design. The
government's priority must be to press ahead firmly with implementation,
above all in the field of training and education.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Wrong attitude to human rights: The debate on renewal of
China's MFN status has sparked a covert discussion about political reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has described his decision on the renewal of China's
privileged trade access to the US market as one of the most critical of his
administration. In China itself, the Most Favoured Nation status issue is
regarded as hardly less important.
Both the US and Chinese leaderships appear to sense that the ruling on MFN
renewal due by June 3 will mark something of a watershed in Sino-US
relations: that much more is at stake than simply two-way trade running at
about Dollars 40bn annually.
Not least of the vexed questions facing the Clinton administration is how,
in the longer term, it might deal with human rights and China. Unless a way
is found to cope with the issue within the broader relationship, it will
continue to fester, threatening an increasingly important commercial and
strategic partnership.
While the White House has conducted a high-profile and sometimes agonising
debate with itself over MFN renewal, Chinese officials have appeared at one
in their determination to secure an extension without making significant
concessions to western pressures on human rights. Mr Clinton in granting MFN
last year called for 'overall significant improvement' in China's human
rights behaviour, including greater respect for the universal declaration on
human rights.
But China's appearance of unyielding unity of purpose on MFN tells only part
of the story. No less than in the outside world, MFN renewal has encouraged
fairly widespread discussion in China about questions such as relations with
the west, economic liberalisation and political change, and most crucially
about the best means of harnessing western pressures to achieve desirable
political reform.
This debate, because of China's lack of open discussion, is furtive. It is
certainly not ventilated in the official press, but among scholars,
dissidents and even some of the more liberal members of the Communist party
these are lively issues and ones that go to the heart of how Chinese society
might evolve.
Mr Clinton and his advisers may not fully appreciate the implications for
China's internal development and its relations with the west. But many
Chinese intellectuals antipathetic to the Communist regime hope that MFN is
granted and moreover that trade and human rights issues are de-linked. They
are frankly critical of what they regard as the US use of the blunt trade
instrument in its well-meaning efforts to achieve progress on human rights.
Typical of those who hold such views is Mr Cui Wenhua, an historian and
television scriptwriter, who lost his job over his involvement in the June
1989 pro-democracy protests and who professes no love for the communist
rulers.
'If the world seeks to isolate China, it will only slow down the process of
liberalisation,' he says. 'Since the world cannot totally ignore China, it
should try to engage it more fully.'
These may appear naive views given that the Communist party shows little
sign of yielding any ground to its opponents and indeed has recently been
cracking down even harder on dissidents; but it is also true that China is
in the middle of a process of economic liberalisation and opening to the
outside world unprecedented in its history.
This opening, which differs markedly from past contact with foreign
influences in that it has not been forced on China, is introducing western
ideas and values to a receptive audience among an urban elite, an increasing
number of whom have travelled and lived abroad.
Notions of individual rights, democracy and basic freedoms which are taken
for granted in the west have tremendous appeal for younger Chinese
intellectuals, but inevitably this embrace of western ideas leads to
conflict with an older generation of scholars who believe that Confucian
ideals of filial obedience and respect for authority should prevail.
Yang Dongping, a researcher at the Beijing Polytechnic and commentator on
changes in Chinese society, says that both sides of the debate look to
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan to prove their point. The younger
generation attributes the success of these south-east Asian tigers to market
economics and relative democratic freedoms, while older scholars choose to
believe that Confucianism has underpinned their advancement.
Where the views of the two sides converge is on the pace of desirable change
in China to avoid what an albeit thin veneer of politically literate Chinese
fear most: chaos. 'Most people, including the younger generation, understand
it will take more than a day to adapt western ideas and values,' says Mr
Yang.
This ill-defined majority among the politically aware would in turn part
company with hard-core dissidents such as Wei Jingsheng, the pro-democracy
activist recently detained for questioning in connection with unspecified
'new crimes'.
Mr Wei believes, according to his friends, in 'making haste' in pursuit of
political change. He also favours, as he made clear in a conversation early
this year with an official US human rights envoy, continued and even
increased western pressure on China to bring about such change.
In his contacts with Mr John Shattuck, the US assistant secretary of state
for human rights, Mr Wei was committing what in the eyes of the regime was a
virtually unpardonable sin known as li tong waiguo, literally maintaining
illicit relations with a foreign country, or to employ the colloquial
western description, washing one's dirty linen in public.
Other leaders of the 1989 protests such as Liu Xiaobo, the philosopher and
writer, also advocate continued western pressure on questions such as MFN,
though Mr Liu is in favour of renewal. 'Without pressure from the
international community,' he observes, 'the Chinese government would be
rampant (in its treatment of dissidents),' he says.
Among international human rights activists, who are frustrated by what they
perceive as the Clinton administration's cynical handling of the MFN issue
and a drift away from sanctions, a similar view prevails. Robin Munro of the
Human Rights Watch/Asia believes that 'pressure is the only thing that
works' when it comes to forcing the Chinese to recognise western concerns
over human rights.
Mr Munro, whose organisation compiles the most comprehensive dossier of
China's human rights transgressions, dismisses what he describes as a
'mantra' argument that economic change will inevitably spawn political
reform. 'This is a pious hope,' he says. 'It does not connect with reality.'
In contrast, even those critics with the gloomiest perspective would concede
that profound change is afoot, although they would differ on where it is
leading. While there has been a significant improvement in Chinese living
standards in many areas, the country's rulers continue to discourage
thoughts of political liberalisation.
The historian Mr Cui has no doubt that quite apart from impressive material
advances, a more important change is that of the 'heart'. 'Chinese citizens
have emerged from being slaves of the dark ages to citizens with some modern
thoughts, and this should be the springboard for greater change in the
future,' he says.
He cites by way of example of changes afoot, the Communist party decision to
embrace what it describes as a 'socialist market economy'. 'In reality the
word 'socialist' does not mean anything,' Mr Cui observes. 'A market economy
is a market economy. As long as you allow the market to exist this will
produce changes of ownership and interest that will eventually lead to
political diversification.'
This latter development is one that disturbs China's communist rulers. They
understand that having embarked on a far-reaching programme of economic
reform they are riding a tiger whose behaviour will be far from predictable,
and that economic and social change is, in any case, loosening central
control.
But the leadership also appreciates that as far as economic reform is
concerned there is no turning back without risking the fate that has
befallen the Communist party of the former Soviet Union, which failed to
adapt to change and paid the price.
Chinese officials are fond of the bicycle metaphor when describing China's
current circumstances: if you stop pedalling, they say, you will fall over.
This in turn raises the question of whether China's leaders are pedalling
fast enough to cope with the demands of a restive population at a time of
rapid economic and social change.
These worries about the unknown - China in its economic reform has entered
uncharted waters - are in turn prompting a re-emphasis on political
stability, a crackdown on dissent such as the recent arrest of prominent
dissident Wei Jingsheng, and restrictions on the media's ability to
ventilate conflicting political viewpoints.
Since the Communist party's policymaking central committee approved an
adventurous package of economic reforms last November, China's leaders,
including premier Li Peng, have laid heavy emphasis on the need to maintain
stability as the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen massacre looms.
They have sought this while navigating their way through a testing phase
involving a painful rationalisation of overmanned and loss-making state
enterprises.
In this difficult period Beijing is grappling with twin threats: workers
laid off from state industries, and a peasantry - surplus rural labour
numbers between 100m and 200m - made anxious and angry by a widening gap
between rich and poor, country and city.
Compared with these challenges, dissident activity, while it might be
eye-catching in the west, is hardly the problem that looms largest in
Beijing's concerns. Among China's rulers there is always the residual fear
that dissidents will make common cause with disaffected elements in the
cities and countryside - as the Communist revolutionaries did in the 1920s.
Permeating Chinese official concerns at almost all levels at present is also
the failing health of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and worries about a
potentially difficult transition to a new generation of leaders. Preparation
for an uncertain future without Deng is one of the factors prompting the
present crackdown on dissent by a nervous leadership.
These uncertain times present challenges as well as opportunities for the
west in the management of its fractious relationship with a modernising
China. The Clinton administration, because of its growing economic and
strategic relationship with China, is in a unique position to influence
developments, but constructive engagement will not be easy and conflict over
human rights issues is certain to persist.
The west's patience is certain to be tested not only over human rights but
also over problems such as trade liberalisation, copyright infringements and
disagreement over arms sales. But for the US, there would seem to be little
alternative to seeking a more predictable relationship with China - one that
does not become hostage to the annual politicking involved in MFN renewal.
While the US is poised to extend China's priviledged trade access to the
American market for another year, it will be doing so in the knowledge that
Beijing has hardly fulfilled requirements laid down by Mr Clinton for
improvements in human rights.
China will have won this round but what is important for the west, notably
the US, is that it seeks other avenues in future that are not so potentially
disruptive to the broader commercial relationship.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Leading Article: The cost of saving energy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In creating the Energy Saving Trust, UK government ministers thought they
had found a winner: a tool for bringing about expensive environmental
improvements that would also be popular. But the trust has been stalled by a
row over its funding, which has also exposed the confused state of the
government's plans for energy conservation.
The trust is intended to subsidise household improvements such as low-energy
light bulbs, efficient boilers and insulation for lofts and walls. The costs
 -some Pounds 400m a year by the end of the decade - will be passed on to
gas and electricity customers, even if they have not benefited.
At least, that was the plan. Today Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director general
of Ofgas, the regulator, is likely to tell a parliamentary select committee,
for the third time, why she will not allow these costs to be passed on to
gas customers. She is right to insist that the government should not use
regulators to levy taxes, and to point out that the impact would be
regressive, falling proportionally harder on poorer families.
But the row obscures the broader questions of whether Britain needs to
promote energy conservation, and if it does, whether the trust is the right
tool.
Curbing emissions
The government's main argument for energy saving is that the UK committed
itself at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to curbing emissions of carbon dioxide
from fossil fuels. The Rio targets are questionable - scientists are
uncertain of the threat of global warming - but countries feel that
precautions are warranted.
In giving its backing to Rio, the government has not weighed up the costs of
cutting emissions against the value of the global benefit. It has tended to
imply that saving energy is always worthwhile, whatever the cost. But even
if the aim is justified, ministers put too much weight on the trust: they
want it to generate a quarter of the savings needed to meet the Rio targets.
Funding aside, the trust was never likely to be up to the task. It lacks the
administration to disburse Pounds 400m a year in parcels of several hundred
pounds, let alone to identify which households should benefit.
Sharp price rises
Instead, the more appropriate tool for curbing carbon emissions - though one
the government may feel is politically inaccessible - is further sharp
energy price rises.
The better argument for the trust's existence is that some household energy
conservation measures pay for themselves quickly. The trust says that all of
its schemes would cover their costs within five years, but that the public
is deterred from adopting these measures by ignorance and by the initial
spending needed. It estimates that 90 per cent of households lack at least a
quarter of the energy saving measures which it recommends.
To the extent that the trust can overcome those barriers, it has a
justifiable role, although a smaller one than it now envisages. It also
needs to direct its cash towards those who can least afford to pay.
But the trust's funds should come from taxpayers, not from consumers. Energy
conservation costs money; the government should not use rhetoric and the
regulatory system to usher through a disguised and regressive tax.

<TEXT>
Not many media tycoons would turn to one of their competitors when looking
for a non-executive director. But then Tony O'Reilly, owner of 60 per cent
of the Irish Press, is not yet playing in the first division - which may
explain why he has added Ben Bradlee, the legendary editor of the Washington
Post, to the board of his Independent Newspapers.
O'Reilly, who sat on the Washington Post board until very recently, is one
of those people who think that the Post is the greatest paper in the world.
Adding the Post's 72-year-old vice-
president-at-large to his board ought to give him a bit more credibility
with the hacks - if not with fellow newspaper proprietor Conrad Black, who
has been quoted as saying that O'Reilly can 'schmooze his way with the
bankers, but there's an element of horse feathers'.

Powell Duffryn's interest in bidding for British Coal's South Wales
operations has the kind of historic ring that would surround, for example,
attempts to rehabilitate descendants of the tsars in Russia.
After all, Powell Duffryn was the biggest British coal company controlling
more than 60 pits and employing more than 32,000 miners before the industry
was nationalised in 1946. The company was detested, not least for its
decision to 'encourage' miners to dig bigger lumps of coal by equipping them
with tools resembling pitchforks rather than shovels.
Like Russia's monarchists, though, the company has durable roots. About 150
years ago, its founder, Thomas Powell, introduced the first locomotives to
the Welsh coalfields and founded a coal-shipping business which, to this
day, is one of its main activities.
Its influence persisted even after nationalisation - the National Coal
Board's first chairman was Lord Hyndley, the company's former managing
director, and another PD man was the NCB's first director for marketing.
Subsequently, it formed a joint international mining consultancy with the
Coal Board and even opened a travel agency which served the Coal Board's
staff. There will be those in south Wales who will view its return with as
much enthusiasm as the Russian serfs would welcome a tsarist revival.

Investment bankers at leading Eurobond houses await the return of Kari Nars
with some trepidation.
Finland's head of treasury management has been on a three-year secondment to
the EBRD, but is due back at his desk next month. Nicknamed 'Basis-Point
Billy', his talent for driving a hard bargain is not easily forgotten.
However, Finland was blessed with a triple-A foreign currency credit rating
in those days, so syndicate managers had little choice but to suffer his
tough market tactics, his curt telephone manner and his endless
name-dropping.
During his absence, the country has lost one of its three As, and investor
appetite for its paper is correspondingly less keen. At the same time, his
easy-going deputy, Veikko Kantola, is reckoned to have made a good fist of a
difficult job and to have won over syndicate managers by distributing
business fairly. Surely Basis Point Billy isn't going to have to reinvent
himself as Percentage Point Paul?

FT  25 MAY 94 / Danger in safe havens: Quarrelling Kurdish parties must look
to Iraqi democratsfor assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'success' of Operation Provide Comfort, which established northern Iraq
as a 'safe haven', off limits to Saddam Hussein's forces, has come to be
taken for granted: the one clear demonstration that international force can
be used to humanitarian effect, given a clear objective and the political
will to pursue it. The Kurds of Iraq having been out of the headlines for
some time, it is assumed that, with them at least, all must be well.
Alas, not so. The latest news is that they have fallen out among themselves.
Since early this month there has been fighting in many parts of Iraqi
Kurdistan between the two main Kurdish parties: the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) of Massoud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)
led by Jalal Talabani.
The rivalry between these two parties is deep-seated, going back to the
1960s when the original KDP split because Mr Barzani's father, a charismatic
tribal leader, quarrelled with the urban intellectuals, including Mr
Talabani, who controlled the party structure. Broadly speaking, the Barzanis
dominate the northern area along the Turkish border, and have had good
relations with successive regimes in Iran, while Mr Talabani's followers are
strongest in the southern area around Sulaimaniyya, and have tended to
support fellow Kurds demanding autonomy in Iran and Turkey.
The two groups' co-operation in holding elections in the safe haven in 1992,
and in administering it on a 50:50 basis since then, has astonished those
familiar with their earlier history. It began to unravel last winter when
there was fierce fighting between the PUK and an Islamic group backed by
Iran. Mr Barzani intervened to stop the fighting, and in the process
quarrelled with Mr Jabar Farman, a PUK military leader who is defence
minister in the nominally united administration.
Since then Mr Barzani has been pressing for Mr Farman's resignation, and it
appears Mr Farman may have been largely responsible for the escalation of
what started on May 1 as a local vendetta about a piece of land into a
general conflict between the two parties. They have now virtually
partitioned the haven, forcibly closing down each other's offices in their
respective territories.
While the conflict is essentially intra-Kurdish, it has no doubt been
exacerbated by the haven's isolation and its lack of clear political
perspectives. The Iranian regime, always ambivalent about this experiment in
democracy on its frontiers, is now openly hostile to it, and to the PUK in
particular. Meanwhile the Turkish army is engaged in an all-out effort to
stamp out the guerrillas of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) on their side
of the frontier. Many civilians have fled from Turkey into Iraq, by the same
mountain paths used by Iraqi Kurds to reach Turkey three years ago.
At that time Mr Talabani established a good relationship with the then
Turkish president, Turgut Ozal, and acted as unofficial mediator between him
and the PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who lives in Lebanon under Syrian
protection. In March last year Mr Ocalan declared a ceasefire, saying he
wanted to convert the PKK into a non-violent political movement, working for
Kurdish rights within Turkey. But after Ozal's death a month later the
ceasefire soon broke down. Since then the violence in south-eastern Turkey
has escalated, and the Turks suspect Mr Talabani's followers of helping the
PKK.
Last week the Turkish air force bombed a PKK camp 70 miles inside Iraq in an
area controlled by Mr Talabani's party. Mr Talabani himself, meanwhile, is
in Damascus, apparently unable or unwilling to pass through Turkey on his
way back to Iraqi Kurdistan, where his presence is needed to impose
discipline on his followers and restore a working relationship with Mr
Barzani.
The haven in northern Iraq is also isolated economically. It is blockaded by
Saddam from the south and is subject to UN sanctions on the grounds that it
is part of Iraq. By the same twisted logic Mr John Major, the British prime
minister - who could claim to be the architect of the safe haven - explained
in a recent letter to Lord Avebury, the Liberal peer, that it would be
'impossible' to station UN human rights monitors in northern Iraq 'without
the permission of the Iraqi government'. To do so, he said, 'would call into
question the territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq, as
recognised by the United Nations'.
Surely he should have thought of that in 1991 when he sent British troops
into northern Iraq to secure the safe haven, but told them to stop at the
36th parallel. In so doing he helped create a de facto Kurdish state, but
one whose leaders have had the wisdom not to declare independence. In
inviting human rights monitors, whose brief would be to monitor the
situation in Iraq as a whole, those leaders are reaffirming the haven as a
liberated area of Iraq, not an independent state. And in this month's
fighting it is the Iraqi National Congress (INC), based in Kurdistan but
composed mainly of Arab opponents of Saddam from southern and central Iraq,
which has been accepted as an honest broker by both Kurdish parties and has
had some success in negotiating ceasefires.
One good result of this sad episode is that Kurds have acquired respect for
the INC and have seen that Arab Iraqis can play a constructive role, even in
Kurdish affairs. The Kurdish parties, which both belong to the INC, should
now place themselves formally under its authority, and the west should
recognise it as the legitimate alternative to Saddam. From then on,
sanctions should be applied only to the parts of Iraq which are still under
Saddam's control.

Sir, While Andrew Jack correctly points out that the student recruitment to
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has fallen
steadily over recent years ('You don't have to be Australian but it helps',
May 19), his statement that among the different accountancy qualifications,
'management accountancy reigns supreme' is not borne out by the facts.
Last year, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants registered
more than 22,500 students - more than 8,500 of them in the UK - up 7.5 per
cent on the previous year; and more than 14,000 overseas - up 22 per cent.
These figures are more than five times those of the ICAEW and more than
double those of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.
Moreover, while there may be some in the profession who are still living in
the 'halcyon' days of the 1980s and who do need to indulge in more 'soul
searching' on the scope for revisions to future training and recruitment,
the ACCA has successfully introduced streamlined examination structures and
competence-based training requirements, aimed at imparting skills that
employers now want their accountants to possess.
It is the responsibility of those in the profession who have not yet come to
terms with today's reality to learn from those who have.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tony Hawkins' hopeful article ('Harare sows seeds for an investment
harvest', May 18) about the improving investment conditions in Zimbabwe
resulting from exchange control and foreign exchange liberalisation, price
deregulation, privatisation of some state companies, and freeing of interest
rates did not refer to his previous article ('Zimbabwe cancels controversial
land leases', May 5) on Zimbabwe which featured a radically different theme.
In that article, it was noted that 72 leases of farms expropriated from
white farmers, theoretically for resettlement of landless peasants, had in
fact been allotted to senior politicians (such as the head of the air force
and the former agriculture minister). The article noted that businessmen
(were) . . . concerned that the Zimbabwe investment promotion conference in
London on May 19 would have been undermined by the controversy', so the
leases were cancelled. Indeed, I should think that the fear of expropriation
of investments (with the possible subsequent donation of same to
politicians) would not be assuaged by any amount of exchange control
liberalisation or price deregulation.

Commission. Welcome though a league table of the performance of member
states in adopting EU single-market legislation might be, it is not the
adoption but the implementation and enforcement which matters.
Countries with legal systems that allow them to 'copy out' numerous
directives into national law en bloc have little difficulty in adopting EU
legislation. The flaws and gaps in the single market occur where the
legislation has been transposed but fails to be executed on the ground. UK
regulators appear to be among the most efficient in Europe. This is where a
league table would be really useful.

FT  25 MAY 94 / One option they don't want: US and UK companies are angry at
plans to give more information in accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public hearings convened by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board do
not normally attract capacity crowds. But when the standards-setting body
held a meeting in San Jose, California, recently, 3,000 managers and
employees protested outside and a band attempted to drown out the
proceedings.
The board's 100-page technical document known as '127-C', published last
June, has proved highly controversial. Its subject is the one accounting
topic guaranteed to provoke ire among companies on both sides of the
Atlantic: the disclosure and treatment in accounts of the details of
executive compensation - and in particular options, which are rights to buy
shares at a fixed price in the future.
Business is coming under increasing pressure in both the US and UK. Last
week, the UK Accounting Standards Board, the national standards-setting
body, issued draft recommendations that urge companies to disclose full
details of the options they grant to directors.
In the US, its counterpart, the FASB, reconvenes next month to draft revised
proposals. These would require companies for the first time to treat options
granted to senior executives as a cost to be set against profits.
Concern about executive pay packages has risen as a growing number of top
managers are remunerated not only with salary and perks, but also with
options. The intention is to provide a form of performance-related pay.
Directors exercise their options only if the value of the shares on the
stock market rises above the fixed price at which they are entitled to buy
them. The greater the difference, the more profitable are the options,
giving executives the incentive to run the company in a way that boosts the
share price.
But many companies now complain that draft requirements from accounting
standards bodies will jeopardise their future growth, by forcing them to
stop awarding options. This, in turn, would make it more difficult to hire
the best people, they argue.
'You would never have thought this level of reaction would have come out of
a proposed accounting standard,' says Stephen Zeff, professor of accounting
at Rice University in Texas. 'The debate is extraordinarily emotional. To
listen to company executives you would think this was the Doomsday
scenario.'
Last week's guidance from the Urgent Issues Task Force, a subcommittee of
the UK Accounting Standards Board, was an attempt to close a loophole which
has allowed companies to disclose far less about options in their accounts
than the law intended - and less than their counterparts in the US have to
reveal.
It follows growing pressure for disclosure from investors. The report of the
Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance,
published at the end of 1992, called for full disclosure of directors'
remuneration.
While a few UK companies have begun to make detailed disclosures on options
 -such as British Petroleum and Reuters - most make it impossible for
shareholders to see how much directors are being paid in this way.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the UK Accounting Standards Board, says the
aim of the draft guidelines is for sufficient disclosure to provide readers
of accounts with a 'do-it-yourself kit' of information, from which they can
calculate the value of options being granted to directors.
The guidelines call for companies to show the total number of share options
granted, as well as the number awarded to each director. They call for
publication of the date and price at which the options can be exercised and
when they expire. They also recommend that, if any options have been taken
up during the financial year, companies should disclose the market price of
the shares on the day when they were exercised.
However, in contrast to most standards issued by the board, the share
options guidelines are only advisory and cannot be enforced by the Financial
Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog. The board hoped to make
them mandatory, but it recently ran into a legal hitch: the existing law
does not require disclosure of remuneration unless it can be precisely
valued.
'The law says that if you are paid Pounds 100 plus a sheep and you cannot
value the sheep, you are not required to say you are paid Pounds 100 plus a
sheep. You can just say you are paid Pounds 100,' says Mr Tweedie.
Options defy precise valuation. Directors cannot sell them immediately, and
their final value is dependent on the share price - which may be highly
volatile - at the time when they can be exercised. If the company collapses,
or the share price at the time of exercise is less than the fixed price at
which they were granted, they are worthless.
This difficulty also lies at the heart of the current debate in the US.
There have long been requirements for companies to disclose the number and
exercise price of share options in the proxy statements, which are sent to
shareholders before a vote. Two years ago, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the US market watchdog, tightened the rules to stop companies
burying the information in the small print.
However, the FASB proposals go much further. The draft accounting standard
issued last summer argues that options are a charge to the company and
should therefore be taken as a cost, which would correspondingly reduce
earnings - the single financial measure most used to assess corporate
performance.
Ms Diana Willis, FASB's project manager for stock options, is confident that
there are mathematical models which are sufficiently precise to place a more
realistic value on options. 'There will never be one definitive method of
valuation, but we all know that the existing value of zero is wrong,' she
says.
She points out that there are many other numbers in financial statements
which cannot be precisely measured but which are included, such as
post-retirement benefits. 'Accounting is not very precise once you get past
what cash you have,' she says.
However, business has been almost universally opposed to FASB's proposals.
No sector is more upset than the new high-technology companies, such as
those based in northern California, which say, because they are unable to
pay high salaries, the recommendations will jeopardise their only way to
attract the best workers. Others accuse FASB of jumping on the current
bandwagon of criticism of excessive executive pay.
Even the large accountancy firms, which initially supported the FASB
proposals, have now turned against them - Mr Walter Schuetze, the chief
accountant of the SEC, denounced the firms in a speech in January for losing
their independence and acting as 'cheerleaders for their clients'.
Surprised by the public reaction, the seven-member FASB board meets again
next month, and hopes to produce a final version of its standard by early
next year. The indications are that it is still firmly behind its proposals.
Meanwhile, the politicians - responding to business pressure - have joined
the growing ranks of critics. A senate resolution has urged FASB to drop its
proposals, and a draft bill now in Congress mandates the SEC to ignore them
even if they are issued, which would render them ineffective.
Mr Dennis Beresford, FASB's chairman, remains committed. 'We are not going
to back down simply because of political pressure,' he says. 'The board is
still strongly convinced that options have a value and there is a way to
value them. There have been some questions about how appropriate is the
valuation method we discussed before, but we are going to try our best to
come up with a reasonable approach.'
Shareholders in the UK looking for greater disclosure of the costs of
options are unlikely to receive any such strong reassurance. The Accounting
Standards Board's proposals are likely to be republished within two months,
virtually unaltered. There is little sign in the short term that the
Department of Trade and Industry or the stock exchange will change the
regulations in order to make such disclosures mandatory.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU generics at a disadvantage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GREG PERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'Price wars over name-dropping' (May 18), Daniel Green
points out that this year's expiry of US patents on many branded
pharmaceuticals will result in a rapid increase in the supply of generic
medicines.
While this is good news for US-based pharmaceutical companies supplying
generics, it brings no joy to EU-based generic companies which operate under
more restrictive patent laws. Under US law, generic companies can develop
and register their products in advance of patent expiry and thus put their
products on the market the day after patent expiry. Generic companies
operating under EU laws are usually only allowed to begin product
development or authorisation procedures after patent expiry (see my letter
published in the FT, October 18 1993).
This restriction not only limits EU generic manufacturers from competing
equally with US companies in the US market but also ensures that in the
European pharmaceutical market, generic competition will not be anywhere as
intense as Daniel Green depicted for the US market.

Sir, I note that Michael Thompson-Noel 'hurled himself out of London down
the motorway to Solsbury Hill very close to Bath' to support the protest
against the proposed by-pass (Hawks &amp; Handsaws, May 21/22).
Surely those who are concerned about road building 'madness' should set an
example by leaving their cars at home whenever possible. Why did he not use
public transport from London to Bath - and then proceed the short distance
from Bath by road?

FT  25 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Monopoly policy no less tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBIN AARONSON and Mr ROBERT YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Rice ('Watchdog barks but the MMC moves on', May 17) suggests
that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has adopted a less
interventionist approach since its 1989 report on beer was overruled by the
government. May we, as two of the authors of the beer report, point out that
the MMC has recently taken an equally tough line on another major industry?
Last August's report on gas recommended enforced division of British Gas's
trading arm from its transportation business - hardly evidence of a 'relaxed
policy'.
Some of the recent criticism of the MMC appears to ignore the legal
framework in which it operates. The Fair Trading Act permits the MMC to make
recommendations only where it finds a situation to be 'against the public
interest'. In other words, there is no presumption that refusal to supply,
tying of retail outlets, or any other practice is prohibited unless it can
be shown to be positively good for consumers (as would be the case in
European law). The presumption is that such practices are permitted unless
they can be shown to be positively bad.
We might not agree with every recent decision the MMC has made, but we are
not convinced that there has been a change of policy or even approach.
What would be very disturbing, however, would be any suggestion that the
MMC's independence from political pressure was at risk. The great strength
of UK competition policy is the major role it gives to an independent body
with a statutory duty to publish its findings for all to see. This goes a
long way towards de-politicising decisions on particular cases. Any threat
to this independence should be strongly resisted.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Arts: Palm goes to pulp - Cannes' winning film seems a
shameful crawl to Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The science of Palmistry suffered a major setback when the top prize at
Cannes went to America's Pulp Fiction. There we all were, clutching our
Pernods and tipping Zhang Yimou's To Live or Kieslowski's Red, when, lo] -
nothing doing. The golden frond was bestowed on the new film from Quentin
'Reservoir Dogs' Tarantino.
With Eastwood as jury president we should have been prepared. Pulp Fiction
is a 2 1/2 -hour gangster romp in which various members of a starry cast
(Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel) have their days
made by various stabbings, shootings and summary executions. S-and-M,
torture and drugs are also on the menu. Indeed if you want to anthologise
one scene for the book of 'Great Throw-Up Moments In Hollywood Cinema', it
must be that in which gangster's moll Miss Thurman, having OD'd on heroin,
has a needleful of adrenalin thrust in her chest by a desperate
escort-bodyguard (Travolta), anxious that she should not die while he is on
the job.
How the Palais roared. Likewise when the kidnapped young black has his
brains scattered over the car. Or when Mr Big (also black) is captured and
raped by a pair of Los Angelenos running neo-Nazism's answer to Sainsbury's
Homebase.
The virtue of Reservoir Dogs was that it kept wiping the smile off our
faces. One moment you were giggling, the next you were all but passing out.
But Pulp Fiction is a string of ill-connected stories about the underworld
held together, if at all, by the sick wit of its gifted writer-director.
The prize seems another shameful crawl to Hollywood from a festival that not
long ago golden-palmed America three years in a row for unworthy films and
is now, post-Gatt, anxious for another bout of kissing and making up;
although I decline to name the part of Hollywood's anatomy that it might be
kissing.
Other hand-outs were more just. Kieslowski's prizelessness was greeted with
indignation by many critics, though not this one: I thought Red the weakest
of his trilogy films. Instead Zhang Yimou's hunk of history about China To
Live, reported on last week, shared the runner-up Special Jury Prize with
Nikita Mikhalkov's Burned By The Sun, jostling with Tarantino in the last
busy weekend.
The Russian film-maker is becoming the festival world's duty dark horse.
Three years ago he came from nowhere to seize the Venice Golden Lion with
Urga. Now he blends Chekhovian chamber drama with Stalin-era historical
tragicomedy - this is another 2 1/2 -hour piece in a festival where we could
all have filed overtime claims - in a film that is a small triumph of art
over obstacle.
Main obstacle is audience resistance to what seems initially yet another
Cherry Orchard-ish elegy about the idle rich socked by a changing zeitgeist.
Mikhalkov himself plays the central Colonel, at play with his family in a
summer dacha while Uncle Joe Stalin gears up for his 1936 purges. But there
is an oddness and energising sinisterness even in these scenes of sunlight,
Chopin and cotton dresses. Who is the young family friend who arrives
disguised as a blind man? Why are there so many mock-suicide games?
Finally the film tears the idyll with a vengeance. Just like the chauffered
car jolting our hero down the country lane towards his eventual gulag, this
plush movie vehicle ends up showing it has lively springs and a feel for the
road. And Mikhalkov, if he had not won a prize for the movie, could have won
it for a performance that grows from the subtle to the bravura.
The Best Actor prize went instead to Ge You, gauntly memorable in To Live.
And the Best Actress was Virna Lisi - good lord, surely we remember her as a
vacuous Italian starlet of the 1960s? - playing Catherine de Medici in
France's La Reine Margot.
Lisi's was not the only identity change at Cannes. A number of directors
kept turning into actors and vice versa. Tarantino and Mikhalkov both jumped
in front of the camera when not shouting 'Action]' behind it. Roman Polanski
burgled several scenes from co-star Depardieu in Tornatore's A Simple
Formality. And the Best Director prize went to a man better known, at least
in the Eternal City, as a performer: Roman comedian Nanni Moretti who, as
per my last report, enchanted le tout Cannes with Dear Diary.
And talking of toucans, there should have been a prize for the large-beaked
tropical bird on an adjoining hotel rooftop who kept waking me each morning
in time for the dreaded 8.30. press show. 'Bonjour]', it cried, sharp on
7.45. And then something, I insisted to friends, that sounded like 'Serie
noire] Serie noir] . . .' Only later did I realise that the bird was giving
me a tip. Serie Noir is the French title for Pulp Fiction.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Arts: Mose in Egitto - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Royal Opera the Midland Bank Proms, now a great institution,
recommenced on Monday with a new production of rare Rossini. Mose in Egitto
(Moses in Egypt) was composed for the Lent season at the Teatro San Carlo in
1818. Hence its subject, and its billing as an 'azione tragica-sacra' -
though Rossini and his librettist Tottola had laced the Old Testament story
with a conventional love-interest: a pre-echo of the Aida situation, indeed,
but non-triangular.
In fact the work was played at Covent Garden in 1833 as a sacred oratorio,
with interpolated bits from Handel's Israelites in Egypt (and the
'love-interest' presumably trimmed). For Paris, the composer re-jigged and
elaborated the piece in 1827 as Mose et Pharaon, which went on to enjoy a
long popularity. This time the Royal Opera has preferred the Neapolitan
original, with only Rossini's 1819 additions. The production comes from
Bologna, with its conductor Paolo Olmi; the Teatro San Carlo has
collaborated on the version used. The director and the designer are one man,
Hugo de Ana.
That seemed to be part of the trouble on Monday, when Mose seemed
excessively tame for its length. Italians understand rocky landscapes very
well; de Ana's sets revel in great expanses of high-quality mock rock (never
mind the visible seams, feel the depth]) and evoke an oppressively parched
land. The enslaved Israelites are dressed as gypsy nomads; their Egyptian
overlords have shaven heads, strangely elongated to accommodate the singers'
hair under their skullcaps. (My companion remarked how much they resembled
the other-planet family in Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth.)
For all the tribal confrontations, however, the director de Ana contrives
little but static, formal patterns. A sinuous quartet of bare-breasted
dancers enlivens the action a bit, but there is rarely any sense of real
menace or danger. Nor does he give his principals much help: even in their
longest and most fraught numbers, he fixes them in languid art nouveau
poses, more decorative than dramatic. Authoritative singing and conducting
might easily make up the gap - but there was the rub, at least on this first
night.
Olmi was tasteful to a fault. A square beat, innocent of anything like
spontaneity or urgency; the orchestral attack soft-edged (characteristically
crisp Rossini dotted-notes were regularly smoothed into bland triplets);
none of the stark gravitas that the best of Rossini's score deserves and
needs. Its grandest passages involve not only some far-sighted chromatics,
but bold, obsessive play with single phrases, almost symphonic - which its
first audiences recognised as Teutonic 'learnedness' far beyond the Italian
norm. Olmi left all of that under-pointed, mild, ineffectual.
At least Ruggero Raimondi's Moses enjoyed ringing support from his four
trombones, though they nearly swallowed him towards the end when he was
audibly tiring. His majestic declamation is still splendid; but his bass was
cramped at the top, and effortful when negotiating the recurrent 'turns' in
his opening music. Simone Alaimo's Pharaoh - the competing bass here,
younger and lighter of timbre - maintained his sharp, energetic bite all the
way. He is a major asset to the show.
As his son and heir Osiride, inconveniently enamoured of an Israelite
maiden, the American tenor Bruce Ford sounded merely careful and correct
throughout Act 1, probably discouraged by the low prevailing temperature. It
took the distraught, non-confessional Act 2 duet with his father to show
this already distinguished Rossinian at full expressive stretch, secure at
the risky vocal heights of his role.
That might have been crowned by his next duet, in abortive flight with his
inamorata Elcia; but it wasn't, because his Elcia is the young
competition-winner Anna Caterina Antonacci. Her soprano boasts a lovely
clear ring, is beautifully even throughout its range, and gracefully adept
with all the ornamentation - but so far, too carefully polished and placid
to register any crises of loyalty or passion. When somebody cried 'Brava]'
after her main aria, I thought that kind of him; nonetheless, what she still
needs is a rudely demanding conductor-dramatist. Overnight, she might become
a far more exciting artist.
Fortunately for the opera, we had the mezzo Ann Murray in the secondary role
of the Pharaoh's wife, an anxious sympathiser with the Israelites - to spell
out what is embedded in Rossini's 'serious' music. She did that superbly. In
the less grateful role of Elcia's confidante Patricia Bardon leaves a
disproportionately vivid stamp. With still thinner material, Philip Doghan
makes something of the nasty High Priest. The tenor Aaron, who ought surely
to be more silver-tongued than anybody, sounded out-of-sorts and fragile.
What with his choked delivery and Raimondi's rusty creaks, the famous final
Prayer scored only a tame modicum of its proper effect. We wanted more.

(another Prom) and 31, June 3, 6, 8 and 11

It never rains but it pours. After all those nights when there was nothing
to watch comes a night chock-a-block with tempting offers. Sharpe is the
first of three more cannon-and-cleavage dramas, each two hours long. Sean
Bean plays the title role of a maverick soldier in Wellington's army during
the Napoleonic wars (8.00 ITV). The first in a six-part series of half-hour
documentaries, Baby It's You, explains how a baby achieves more in its first
two years than in the rest of its life (8.30 C4). This week's 'Screen Two'
is Men Of The Month and Douglas Hodge, familiar from 'Middlemarch', 'Capital
City' and much else, plays one of four men whose lives are connected with 'a
women's erotic magazine' as the BBC puts it (9.00 BBC2). Inside Story goes
to Gateshead to study burglary from the point of view of the burgled, the
burglars, and the police (9.30 BBC1). ITV begins a four-part documentary
series called The Windsors which, for once, is not primarily about Di and
Charles, or Fergie and whatsisname. It begins with George V changing his
name (10.45).

FT  25 MAY 94 / Arts: At last, first with the news - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that television was about to become the mainstay of journalism and
that, willy nilly, newspapers would have to turn to the provision of
background material, comment and colour, was in great favour 30 years ago.
Nothing very much seemed to happen, however, and the subject went out of
fashion. Yet slowly television did expand its journalistic capacity and
techniques, and the subject matter it was able and willing to deal with, and
now (looking beyond this week's strike by BBC journalists) we are seeing the
success of something awfully like the revolution discussed in the 1960s -
though now nobody seems to be paying much attention.
An interesting example occurred last Thursday. At 9.30 in the True Stories
slot Channel 4 had screened a long documentary by Nicholas Broomfield, who
in a previous programme had shown himself spending a long time failing to
get an interview with South African right-winger Eugene Terreblanche. Since
that seemed to amuse people Broomfield used the same idea again, but this
time his subject was Margaret Thatcher.
While other people got themselves onto the press list, gained access to the
lunches on her book promotion tour and so on, Broomfield showed himself
failing at every turn. He made the reason fairly clear: he is inept. Seeking
an interview with Mark Thatcher, Broomfield was asked for his telephone
number but was unable to remember the name of his hotel, let alone the phone
number. His journalism comes from the 'Hey mum look at me' school of studied
naivety. Roger Cook, whose Cook Report on ITV had offered a lacklustre item
on steroids earlier in the evening, sometimes seems in danger of joining the
same school.
However, it was the programme after the Broomfield fiasco which was
interesting. Instead of the billed item on the health service at 11.05,
Channel 4 rushed into the schedule a Dispatches Special about Robert Black,
the man who, earlier that day, had been given 10 life sentences for
murdering young girls. Obviously made in preparation for the ending of the
trial, the programme contained a mass of background information on Black's
life and upbringing, and clear indications that he may have been responsible
for many more murders. Some details of the programme's content and technique
were highly questionable: did the relatives of one victim really need to
hear Black's description of what he did to her? And given the emotional
nature of the case was it necessary to add mood music and heartbeat sound
effects? What cannot be questioned is the speed with which television
brought this material to the public. No doubt the viewing figures for an
unscheduled programme late on Channel 4 were low, but the fact remains that
television was several hours ahead of the newspapers.
Last night in Assignment on BBC2 George Alagiah, who did such admirable work
for BBC News in Somalia, reported on the 'reign of terror' in another
African country in the 1970s when, as Alagiah said, 'ethnic origin alone was
enough to put you in prison' and 150,000 people were killed. Not South
Africa, of course, where deaths were a tiny fraction of that figure, but
Ethiopia under the regime of Col. Mengistu. This may not have been the
clearest or most technically polished programme of its sort ever made, but
it is the first I have seen to give a detailed account of the Mengistu
pogrom. Moreover, if there has been a report with anything like this detail
in the British press I have missed it.
Furthermore, although I have certainly seen newspaper reports about the
activities of Dame Shirley Porter and her Conservative colleagues on
Westminster City Council, I have never read an account with the detail that
last week's Panorama provided. This was the programme notoriously pulled
from the schedule immediately before the local elections, and it was not
hard to see why there had been nervousness. No punches were pulled, the word
'gerrymandering' was used frequently, and no viewer can have been left in
doubt that the programme makers' believed there had been deliberate wrong
doing.
The final sentence in commentary stated that Conservative party chairman
Kenneth Baker portrayed the result of Dame Shirley's successful local
election campaign as 'a victory for prudent and efficient local government'
but that in truth her victory 'had largely been bought from the public
purse'. Assuming the preceding statements were all reliable, the programme
certainly justified that conclusion and it is a pity that it was not
broadcast as a public service before the local elections rather than after.
Nevertheless the most significant fact is that the BBC did not, to adopt the
language of The Bill, bottle out. John Birt's first major task at the BBC
was to overhaul, combine and expand the news and current affairs departments
(to reorganise BBC journalism in other words) - and, some say, to introduce
rigid hierarchical control and a uniform approach. Opponents of 'Birtism'
claim that it smacks of both Stalinism and Thatcherism, and that,
intentionally or not, it serves the interests of Conservative governments.
It would seem difficult to square that argument with the Panorama in
question. In the long term the sheer expansion of television journalism,
partly resulting from the Birt reforms, partly from the general
proliferation of television, will surely prove more significant than any
supposed political slant.
Yet however extensive television reporting might become, the medium would
continue to be a poor relation in the world of journalism while it lacked
the techniques, and to a large extent perhaps the will, to deal also in
opinion. But these days even that is changing, albeit in a fairly small way
so far, and chiefly on Channel 4. Frederic Raphael's attack on 'rightsism' -
the special rights claimed by women, homosexuals, black people and so on -
in last week's Without Walls on Channel 4 was a particularly significant
straw in the wind since it ran counter to the political correctness which
tends to dominate thinking in these areas on television.
Gratifyingly there appears to be no tendency at present for television to
drive newspapers out of business. But the expansion and development in
television journalism discussed at such length 30 years ago does seem
finally to be happening.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Energy efficient tomatoes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Cantelo Nurseries, one of Britain's biggest tomato producers, wanted to
save on its huge energy costs, it turned to the country with supreme
expertise in glasshouse production - the Netherlands.
Herman Van Den Ende, a Dutch consultant, was brought in to design an
energy-efficient system for the Taunton-based glasshouse that produces 2m
kilos of tomatoes a year.
The system, which stores waste heat from day-time use to heat the tomato
plants during the cooler night hours, won Cantelo a Pounds 500 award for
energy management this week from Adas, the UK government's agricultural
development and advisory service, as part of its campaign to cut the Pounds
320m annual energy bill on English farms.
Horticulture accounts for by far the largest bills in the agricultural
sector because of the high costs of heating greenhouses. Cantelo's annual
energy bill amounts to just over Pounds 200,000, or about 30 per cent of its
non-labour running costs. But Van Den Ende says this would have been 15 per
cent higher before the installation of flue-gas condensers that are attached
to the gas-fired water boilers to recapture most of the heat that would
otherwise escape.
Tomatoes need temperatures of about 20'F by day and 15'F at night. Because
of the storage system, the nurseries can afford to burn more heat during the
day to produce more of the carbon dioxide that the plants require to grow -
and thus increase production.
'We should get a 5 to 10 per cent increase in yields,' says Kevin Hamilton,
general manager.
Smaller farms might not want to invest in new equipment to save energy, but
that does not matter, according to Adas. 'Simple economy measures can lead
to energy savings of 10 per cent or more,' says Gareth Ellis, energy
consultant.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: A bigger splash on the canals
 -Jane Martinson on plans to boost British Waterways Board's income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Waterways Board, the nationalised body which runs Britain's
canals, plans to turn people's desire to mess about by the river into
profit.
With a leisure and tourism strategy launched by Robert Atkins, environment
minister, today, the board appeals for 'imaginative partnerships' to
increase the money-making potential of its most popular sites.
Such developments would have to satisfy the board's commitment to conserving
the heritage and environment of the land and buildings it controls,
including more than 2,000 listed structures and ancient monuments and 64
sites of special scientific interest.
A private bill before parliament defines the board's statutory duties with
regard to maintaining environmental conservation.
'We have to appreciate that many people enjoy going to the canals to
'gongoozle' - to simply watch the wildlife and canal life go by,' says Simon
Salem, marketing and communications manager. 'Our aim is to increase
everybody's enjoyment of this natural resource.'
Another aim is to increase profits. The board earns 40 per cent of its
annual running costs of Pounds 87m, the rest coming from subsidies. Profits
from leisure and tourism contribute 25 per cent of that earned income, a
percentage the board wants to increase. Market research has suggested there
is potential for this, says Salem.
Possible developments include leisure facilities such as tea shops, small
museums or playgrounds. Financial incentives will be considered for suitable
proposals and extensive consultation with local interest groups is planned.
The board hopes to capitalise on the 158m visits made to British canals each
year by more than 7m people. It plans to improve access for particular
interest groups such as anglers and boaters and attract some of the 47 per
cent of the population who live within five miles of a BWB canal.
Popular sites which regularly attract in excess of 200,000 visitors each
year, says Salem, would particularly benefit from further development. 'We
see tourism, and particularly the day trip side, as a key growth area,' he
adds. 'At the same time, we are aware that plans have got to be balanced.
Our main aim is to conserve our heritage.'
He says 'sensitive' proposals would be welcomed. Fast food chains and vast
car parking space would not. Plans are particularly welcome in inner cities
where canals are vital 'green lungs'.
Today's launch follows a report on the board by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in January which made 48 recommendations for improvement,
including cost control and more active marketing of leisure facilities.
Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said: 'BWB has changed from a
centralised organisation orientated towards administering a grant to one
developing a strong commercial outlook.'
But he added that the MMC felt BWB could continue to improve its efficiency
and the quality of its services, and expected BWB to be able to generate
higher net revenue.
The board supplied half the funding needed for a Pounds 1.5m refurbishment
of grade two listed canal warehouses in Burnley last year in partnership
with Lancashire county council. The site is to be used for mixed commercial
and leisure development.
In developing its strategy, the board has taken advice from the National
Trust, the charity which operates a business arm known as National Trust
Enterprise and which saw a large increase in membership in the 1980s. The
board is considering a membership scheme which could include a magazine and
lecture programmes.
Bernard Henderson, the board's chairman, says: 'Of course, it's early days
but we certainly think that the National Trust is a template which deserves
study. We have two main responsibilities - to provide facilities for people
to enjoy the environment and to improve it.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: A last resort by the seaside -
As oil companies drill closer to land, Robert Corzine looks at how they are
stepping up safeguards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santa Barbara is not one of the twin towns listed on the sign outside the
municipal limits of Christchurch, one of the prosperous resort and
retirement communities which line England's south coast.
But an event that took place off the US west coast 25 years ago has a
particular relevance to residents of environmentally sensitive seaside areas
in the UK such as Christchurch. In 1969, a blow-out at an offshore
production platform left 30 miles of beach near Santa Barbara, one of
southern California's main tourist destinations, covered in oil pollution.
The impact of the spill on public opinion was such that development of the
state's rich offshore oilfields was curtailed for decades, while the
political fallout from it is felt even now. Hazel O'Leary, US energy
secretary, recently confirmed that residents of coastal states still have a
virtual veto over new offshore oil developments.
The Santa Barbara spill has also had a lasting effect on how the
international oil industry operates in sensitive coastal areas, including
those in the UK. Over the next few years, oil companies plan to increase
inshore exploration drilling, encouraged by coastal discoveries such as the
Wytch Farm oilfield near Poole in Dorset and the Liverpool Bay natural gas
field. In last year's 14th licensing round, the government included a large
number of inshore blocks, many of which are located near well-known coastal
beauty spots, important fishing or breeding grounds, or in areas which
support endangered species.
But the special requirements of operating inshore often conflict with
established ways of working in the North Sea, according to Geoff Nicholson,
manager of near-shore exploration projects for Elf Enterprise, a joint
venture between Elf Aquitaine of France and Enterprise Oil, the biggest UK
independent. It has been active in Poole Bay on the south coast and is about
to begin exploration in the Irish Sea, 15 miles off Anglesey.
'The industry likes to move fast and with few constraints,' he says. In the
North Sea, the sudden availability of a drilling rig at an attractive rate
can cause companies to alter plans overnight. In the exploration phase, oil
companies also tend to operate at an arm's length through specialist
contractors.
'But you can't operate like that inshore,' says Nicholson. 'Long periods of
consultation with local governments and community groups are necessary
before actual operations, such as seismic surveys or drilling, can begin.'
Senior Elf executives say it is as important to understand the
'geo-political aspects' of England's south coast as it is of south Yemen or
the other remote locations in which the oil industry operates.
Elf's emphasis on the careful identification and cultivation of community
groups is no accident. In 1992, its initial exploration efforts in Poole Bay
ended in angry confrontations at sea between seismic survey ships and local
fishermen.
The company had reached an early agreement on compensating those who fished
for crab and lobster. But it struggled to reach an understanding with the
trawlermen. 'We first had to define who was a fisherman,' says Nicholson.
'In the winter someone might be a painter and decorator, but in summer they
might do a little fishing.'
In addition, some political pressure groups saw the chance to use Elf's
dispute with the fishermen to their own advantage. Elf eventually had to pay
out more than Pounds 1m in compensation to the fishermen. 'We had to solve
the dispute on the run and in a very unsatisfactory way,' concedes
Nicholson.
The problems of dealing with 10 different fishing associations persuaded the
company to set up and fund a forum in which to channel problems. It also
provides a mechanism for arbitration.
The fragmented nature of the fishing industry made it the most difficult for
Elf to deal with. But many other groups also saw the company as a threat.
Some were concerned that even the hint of an oil spill offshore in summer
could do long-lasting damage to the area's important tourist industry.
Others simply did not want oil companies operating in their back yard. 'I
don't care if you drink your bloody oil,' was the attitude of one resident
at a public meeting.
Late last year, Elf drilled an exploratory well, the results of which it has
yet to divulge. The licence for Poole Bay was issued in an earlier round,
but Elf observed many of the environmental conditions set by the government
for 14th round licences.
Seabed studies were carried out both before and after drilling to determine
if there was any damage to marine life. A narrower than usual well was
specified to cut down on the amount of rock cuttings brought to the surface.
Water-based drilling muds were used when possible in preference to oil-based
ones to lubricate the drill bit.
Rock cuttings brought to the surface were cleaned before being dispersed
over a wide area - rather than piled on the sea bottom - to avoid smothering
fish feeding grounds. And the normal stand-by safety vessel was augmented by
one carrying a chemical dispersant and booms to contain any spills.
Local officials say such precautions have made inshore exploration drilling
acceptable to the public. But they say the prospect of permanent platforms
within sight of land is no more acceptable now than in 1988 when a British
Petroleum proposal to build an artificial island off Wytch Farm to tap the
offshore extension of the field triggered a storm of protest along the south
coast.
New technology, in the form of horizontal drilling from a land base to a
point more than 5km offshore, solved BP's problem. But technology is
unlikely to offer a solution in all cases. At some time in the next few
years an inshore discovery could be made that will test whether coastal
residents in the UK have a similar power of veto as their counterparts in
California.

FT  25 MAY 94 / People: Gurr's taskforce of one sets sail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What does life hold in store for a man who stops being chief executive of a
Training and Enterprise Council? He could always become chief executive of a
set of islands.
Indeed, Andrew Gurr, chief executive of the North and mid-Cheshire Tec, is
to take up his new post as chief executive of the Falkland Islands
government, in Port Stanley in September, replacing Ronald Sampson, who has
completed an extended five-year contract.
Gurr, 49, who joined the Tec after spending many years in industry, says
that running a Tec demands a complex range of skills which are applicable to
his new job. 'The key to the job is running the government as a business,
while stimulating local entrepreneurship and ensuring sustainable growth in
the economy,' he says.
The Falkland Islands government selected Gurr - who will assume the role of
acting governor when the governor is absent from the island - from over 250
applicants; it says it considered that he met the requirements of the
Islands' rapidly evolving economy and society.

FT  25 MAY 94 / People: Why Rogerson will need more energy at British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Rogerson, finance director at British Gas, was yesterday given
strategic responsibility for British Gas TransCo, the new corporate entity
into which the transportation and storage division of the company has been
placed.
His appointment is the first of a number of such moves which will result in
British Gas executive directors being given responsibility for a portfolio
of operations.
The moves are part of a wide-ranging restructuring of British Gas in
preparation for the phased introduction of domestic competition from 1996.
Rogerson, who was brought into the company in 1992 from ICI, said he
welcomed 'direct involvement' in the operational side of the business. He
hoped his new role would allow him to bring greater 'financial discipline to
commercial decisions'.
Harry Moulson will continue as managing director of TransCo, with day-to-day
responsibility for its operations, while Rogerson concentrates on strategic
issues.
Rogerson described TransCo as the 'backbone' of British Gas operations, and
the core of its business profitability. There was no linkage between his
appointment and recent market rumours that British Gas is considering
divesting the gas trading and divisions, he said.
Rogerson will continue with his current financial responsibilities until a
successor can be named, probably within a 'few months'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / People: Sweeney looking to raise BBA's profile
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Being the public face of British banks might be thought an unattractive
task, given the degree of opprobrium the industry now attracts. Yet Tim
Sweeney says he was keen to become director general of the British Bankers'
Association.
Sweeney, a 49-year-old career Bank of England man, will take over from Lord
Inchyra, the current director general, who retires at the end of September
after six years. He says that he has yet to decide how to develop the
association.
Providing a stronger public lobbying voice for banks will be an important
part of his task, since some BBA member banks have looked enviously at the
comparatively high public profile achieved by the Building Societies
Association.
The BBA was formed in 1919 as a forum for the banks in the august forum of
the Committee of London and Scottish Bankers to talk to their provincial
counterparts; it became the main UK banking body when the CLSB disappeared
in 1991.
Lord Inchyra oversaw that reform, and the abolition of two-tier membership
two years ago to allow foreign banks parity with the UK ones. 'The interest
and loyalty of some of the foreign banks was starting to wear a bit thin,'
says Inchyra.
Running the BBA involves an assortment of duties, from carrying out research
and lobbying for its 320 members, to providing a voice for British banks.
The latter role has grown in importance as criticism of banks has
intensified.
Sweeney, who is currently responsible for deploying and developing the
Bank's graduate staff after spells in banking supervision and in money
markets, says he feels 'the voice of banking deserves to be heard'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / People: Leathes joins board in Warburg reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Simon Leathes, 46, chief financial officer of S G Warburg, has joined the
board of the S G Warburg Group. His promotion is the latest sign that the
next generation of managers is moving into place at Britain's biggest
merchant banking group.
Leathes, a chartered accountant who joined Warburg in 1980 from Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, effectively replaces Michael Gore, 56, who had been finance
director since the formation of the group in 1986. Gore, who remains a group
vice chairman, handed over most of his financial responsibilities to Leathes
just over a year ago when he moved to Tokyo to head the group's Asia/Pacific
business.
Although Sir David Scholey, 58, continues as chairman of the S G Warburg
Group, several of the senior figures involved in the 1986 merger of Mercury
Securities, Akroyd &amp; Smithers, Rowe &amp; Pitman and Mullens &amp; Co, have retired.
Peter Stormonth Darling, 61, who headed the Mercury Asset Management
business for many years, retired last year and handed over to Hugh
Stevenson, 51. Next month, Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, 59, former senior partner
of Rowe &amp; Pitman, retires as chairman of S G Warburg Securities and a vice
chairman of the group.
He will remain a non-executive director but hands over the chairmanship of S
G Warburg Securities to Nicholas Verey, 51, the deputy chairman. Verey,
whose cousin David heads Lazard Brothers, is a former Rowe &amp; Pitman partner.
Meanwhile, Dutchman Herman van der Wyck, 60, is handing over the
chairmanship of S G Warburg &amp; Co, the merchant bank, to Derek Higgs, 50, the
deputy chairman. Van der Wyck remains a vice chairman of the group and
becomes chairman of S G Warburg International, a newly-formed company which
will concentrate on the development of the group's international business.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Management: Dizzy pace of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trend for UK companies to allow their subsidiaries greater autonomy
looks set to continue. But the move to political correctness in the
boardroom is proceeding at an even dizzier pace.
This emerges from a survey of company structures and group management styles
among 270 finance directors of leading UK quoted companies by the venture
capital group 3i.
The report* says most respondents (71 per cent) identify their companies
with the 'strategic control' model, where short-term financial performance
and long-term strategies are of equal concern to the centre; 16 per cent
said that their management style could best be characterised as 'financial
control' (the centre's primary role is to set strict financial targets while
delegating strategic decisions); and 15 per cent said they had adopted a
'strategic planning' model (where the centre aims to shape the strategies of
the group as a whole).
A surprising issue raised by the research is how to describe these
'increasingly autonomous operating companies'. The authors say 'the term
'subsidiary', though accurate, is no longer 'politically correct''. The
reason why, however, is left to readers' imagination.
As for future corporate trends, most respondents expect a cut in the size of
head offices; a majority now employ less than 1 per cent of their total
staff at headquarters. Further elimination of middle management tiers is
predicted; as is the growing need for managers to be technically qualified
and the need to build structures and training.
Improvements in information technology will 'allow more control' but
'require greater accountability of operating companies'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Management: Prunes can be good for you - David Blackwell
reports on a Yorkshire recipe for long-distance takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Running a prune production operation in California from a converted silk
mill in Bradford, England, might seem a recipe for disaster.
But it was thanks largely to the acquisition of the Californian dried fruit
business of Del Monte last July that Yorkshire Food Group, the UK food
processing company, almost doubled its pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.1m in its
first year as a public company.
'We were not fazed by 5,000 miles,' insists Mike Firth, 47, Yorkshire Food's
chairman and chief executive, who has built the group from a sugar packing
operation started in 1974 with a Pounds 3,000 bank loan.
Given the distances involved, Yorkshire was determined to do its homework
from the outset. The company spent Pounds 2m on professional fees - and sent
an acquistion team to Fresno - to investigate the prospective Dried Fruit
purchase in early 1993. 'When we arrived with our management team which was
formed during the negotiations, we knew more than anyone in Del Monte -
people were asking us the questions,' says Firth.
Once inside, Yorkshire started imposing a proper business structure on a
company which hitherto had been supplying dried fruits into the American Del
Monte sales and distribution system (and as such formed only 5 per cent of
the fruit giant's operations).
Yorkshire put in a team of five, including David Morgan, chief financial
officer, who was to remain for two years. It concentrated on the financial,
systems and logistics sides of the business.
The priority was to install a financial reporting system. Yorkshire quickly
discovered, though, that often the best way to learn is through experience.
Faced with one of the worst prune crops for years, the new owners were
forced to meet demand by buying in supplies from Bulgaria, Chile and
Argentina.
'The nice thing about having a few problems is you get to know your business
a bit better and you also get the chance to see how people react to those
problems,' says Firth. The group has now spread the source of its prunes
across all three of the growing areas in the San Joachim Valley, minimising
the risk of crop failure.
Yorkshire, however, avoided the temptation to try to change everything.
Allan Giddings, divisional director of the US operation, points out that the
group has not tried to impose UK sales practices. 'We have kept the US sales
team - we are not saying this is how to sell, this is who you should sell
to.' Furthermore, Yorkshire surprised the US farmers by showing them its
accounts.
'We displaced gossip and rumour with hard financial fact. Then Allan rolls
up and takes them their cheque in person,' says Paul Haley, Yorkshire's
finance director, adding that a US chief executive, based in New York, would
be unlikely to turn up at a farm.
Yorkshire, which was floated on the stock market in March last year, was no
newcomer to the takeover business and had learned lessons from its previous
experience.
It had moved seriously into the fruit and nut sector with the Pounds 12m
purchase of Scotia Haven, Berisford International's loss-making dried fruit
packaging business in Warrington in 1991. Here it had sent in an acquisition
team of five for six months: by the time it left, Pounds 7m had been taken
out out of working capital through reduced stocks and improved efficiency.
Yorkshire was also already in California, having bought Treehouse Farms,
Berisford's Californian almond processor, in 1992. The acquisition of
Treehouse marked a move into downstream processing, with manufacturing plant
to clean and cut the almonds. A roaster has since been added.
Despite being described by Firth as 'a relatively simple business',
Yorkshire believes in keeping a close eye on the operation. Giddings, who
spent six months in California when Treehouse was first bought, now spends
10 days in every month there.
Yorkshire has tried to motivate Treehouse's existing management by making
its members feel part of the Yorkshire team. The latter's ethos is strongly
quality driven.
Both Giddings and Firth have operational backgrounds from Mars, which they
believe gave them a global perspective and a strong insight into customer
needs.
'It's not just price and production - we have to talk technology,' says
Giddings. The added value of the company's products lies in ensuring the
ingredients supplied are of top quality, he says. Technical teams from
Cadbury, Safeway and other customers have visited the Del Monte operation to
ensure that there will be no stones or stems in the product.
The group is also using computer technology to reduce the distance between
its operations. It is close to having a full network information system
which will enable staff at head office to look into any of its companies'
financial positions in real time. Firth says Bradford will then be as
immediate as the local management, able to send a fax to reach California
before staff there arrive for work.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Management: When managers carry guns - Lonrho's private army
has shown how a company can protect itself in the face of war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During Mozambique's 17-year civil war, which finally ended with the signing
of a peace accord in October 1992, the toughest battalion belonged to
neither the government nor the insurgent rebel forces. Commanded by Gurkhas,
it was recruited by Roland 'Tiny' Rowland to guard Lonrho's vast cotton
estates in an even vaster and lawless land.
As Mozambique's biggest foreign investor and partner of Samora Machel's
Marxist government, Lonrho's Dollars 80m-operation (Pounds 53m) was an
obvious target for rebels.
The Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) had already crippled much of the
economy: electricity pylons were blown up; railways sabotaged; land mines
made travel impossible along many routes; whole villages were burned and
their men marched into the bush.
With government forces fully engaged in fighting Renamo, private farmers had
no choice but to organise their own security. In the Limpopo Valley, great
triple stacks of concertina wire surrounded Lonrho's 2,000-ha cotton farm at
Chokwe. Watchtowers and tanks guarded the perimeter. The main buildings
became fortresses. 'All our managers were used to farming with a gun on
their back,' says John Hewlett, Lonrho's managing director in Mozambique.
'They were mostly Boers or white Rhodesians, and they were excellent at
their jobs.'
These battle-hardened managers were backed by a militia of 1,400 men. Every
morning, Hewlett recalls, tractors on the Chokwe estate would leave in
convoys of five, guarded by 50 militias. The farming was planned with
military precision.
Routines were changed daily to foil surprise attacks. The working parties
maintained constant radio contact with their headquarters during their
solitary expeditions into the cotton fields. Despite the war, Chokwe's
2,000ha of irrigated farmland achieved Africa's highest cotton yields in
1989: 20,000 tonnes were produced.
Lomaco, the joint-venture with the government, also became the biggest
tomato grower in the southern hemisphere. At a tremendous cost. Hewlett says
Lonrho's security outlays in Mozambique consumed 30 per cent of the
company's operating costs - about Dollars 1m a year, not counting production
losses due to sabotage.
Lonrho also operates a pipeline in Mozambique, which supplies Zimbabwe with
95 per cent of its fuel. During the war, it was guarded by Zimbabwean
troops. 'But we had the best-trained force in the country,' Hewlett says of
Lonrho's private army. 'Occasionally there were full-blown battles with
Renamo. Once 16 guerrillas were killed.'
One attack in the early 1990s, however, changed Hewlett's mind about the
feasibility of running militarised farms in a civil war. The rebels came at
dawn, 200-strong. They drove a herd of cattle towards the perimeter fence,
raising clouds of dust. A tree was hurled over the barbed wire, the cattle
surged across in a wild stampede, and the rebels charged in.
In a matter of minutes Renamo blew up Dollars 500,000 of chemicals and
irrigation pipes. Offices were torched; trucks doused with petrol. Hewlett
later found his radio operator burned to death at his station. 'I realised
then that we couldn't fight them any longer,' Hewlett recalls. 'I took
photos of all the death and destruction and showed them to Tiny at a board
meeting in London. I told him: the war has to stop.'
There are those who believe that peace would not have returned to Mozambique
had Lonrho not been involved. Rowland is credited with arranging the first
meeting between Joaquim Chissano, who became president after Samora Machel's
fatal plane crash in 1986, and Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama. Shortly after
their talks in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, a peace accord was signed
in Rome.
Against all expectations, the agreement has held. The country is due to hold
its first multi-party elections in October. Now that the war is over, Lonrho
is at least making money out of Renamo's attempts to transform itself into a
respectable political party. Many of Renamo's cadres are being housed in
Lonrho's Cardoso Hotel in Maputo, at the United Nations' expense.
Lonrho has also supplied Renamo with vehicles, computers and office
equipment. The company Gurkhas are being employed as sappers in another
fast-growing business: the clearance of land mines. Nobody knows how many
lie beneath Mozambique's roads and fields - estimates vary from several
hundred thousand to 2m.
Lonrho is one of the companies involved in mine clearance, and a start has
been made on routes essential to the distribution of humanitarian aid.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Recruitment: Empowerment in Virgin territory - Middle
managers feel threatened by their new role as 'willing helpers' / Personnel
directors choose psychometric testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How many management, employment and recruitment words are we expected to
absorb before we throw away the dictionary of American business terms?
Hardly a month goes by without another supposedly new idea embodied in a
freshly coined word creeps stealthily out of the software like a tarantula
out of a banana crate, arousing a mixture of terror and curiosity.
The jargon has encroached steadily into the management schools, so much so
that it has spawned an industry in expensive seminars held to explain what
it all means.
Empowerment is one such concept that received the seminar treatment last
week at an Economist conference in London. It has also been subjected to
scrutiny by the Harbridge Consulting Group, which has just produced a report
called Empowerment: what organisations really do.
Harbridge has attempted to discover what empowerment means and how it is
being adopted in the UK. Most of the organisations it surveyed had reduced
their employees in the last five years. In practice it found that
empowerment often meant individuals being asked to perform functions
traditionally undertaken by management, one reason why most middle managers
questioned in the survey felt threatened by the idea.
In companies where the concept had been widely adopted, says the Harbridge
report, the managerial role had to change to that of a 'willing helper'.
Managers not letting go was the most widely cited impediment to its
implementation.
One of the most important factors quoted by individuals expected to take
more responsibility for decision making was a promise that their job would
not be on the line if they made a mistake.
Some companies, said the report, were employing empowerment without
realising it. This applied to Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways,
according to Nick Potts, its personnel director. He told the Economist
seminar that empowerment 'typically exists naturally with youth, vigour and
smallness in organisations'. The company had shunned empire-builders or
specialists in its early days. Creating empires and classic organisational
structures, he said, were the biggest barriers to empowerment.
As the business grew the company realised that staff, by default, had been
given the freedom to make decisions and influence company direction. 'We
learned that people who decide and act, produce more profit than people who
wait for instructions,' he said.
The three youngest directors, he noted, all had arts backgrounds. Paul
Griffiths, the commercial director, had a degree in music and raced
motorcycles, Steve Ridgeway, marketing director, was a boating enthusiast.
Potts himself used to be an opera singer.
'We realised we had a lot of artists in all positions. This, I suppose, is
not surprising as creativity, flair and imagination are very important in
the Virgin culture,' said Potts.
He might have been over-egging his point. What he didn't say was that the
board is loaded with experienced airline people and as Virgin itself
admitted: 'Griffiths was taken on for his 15 years airline experience, not
for his ability to play the fiddle.'
The company began to look for people who had done 'interesting things' or
had career breaks. It sought out emotional people and looked for risk takers
on the basis that 'entrepreneurial business is one huge gamble'.
Again this should have been qualified. Risk-taking attributes would not
apply to flying staff, nor would they seem apparent in Nigel Primrose, the
finance director, who is a chartered accountant.
Potts argued that a gambling instinct was useful when trying to maximise
revenue per seat on each flight. 'The gamble is when to release seats and at
what price. Clearly there is no point in having the highest fares and no
passengers or vice versa, a full plane where the ticket sales don't cover
the costs.'
Instead of expecting staff to use statistics to dictate decisions, the
company preferred them to become 'immersed in the job, build up this
knowledge through experience and gut feel, and then gamble on your
instincts.
'We have found these people make the best revenue managers. We trust their
judgements and let them make the calls.'
Rather than just plugging gaps, recruitment was viewed strategically and
undertaken by the best people in the company, said Potts. Spotting and
assessing, even 'scavenging' for talent, he said, 'is the most important
thing you can do for a business - so you should invest a considerable amount
of time doing it'.
Virgin is currently doing just that, recruiting about 700 staff, mostly
cabin crew, as it expands its route network.
So what are personnel directors doing to find the best people? The Institute
of Personnel Management commissioned a Mori poll of 123 UK personnel
directors to find out what recruitment methods they employed.
The result shows that psychometric testing - the science of measuring
abilities or personality traits - has overtaken panel interviewing as the
favourite selection technique of personnel directors.
When asked which ones they used, among seven types of recruitment
techniques, some 105 of the directors questioned - the biggest response to
any of the techniques - said they used psychometric testing.
Panel interviewing, used by 99 of them, was pushed into second place above
meeting the partner of the applicant, used by 34. Fourteen of the directors
said they tested applicants with a problem calculated to induce stress or
surprise and two of them went in for graphology, the study of handwriting.
None of them used cranial assessment or astrology, the two other techniques
in the questionnaire.
Asked to rate the success of the methods on a scale of nought to 10, the
most popular rating for both panel interviews and psychometric testing was
seven, from just less than a third of respondents, although the testing just
had the edge in popularity over interviews.
Breaking down the responses into four sectors - industrial, financial,
business and the public sector - panel interviews were rated most highly
among the public sector. Employers in the public sector also placed more
store than any of the others on psychometric testing for achieving
successful results. This is not so surprising since testing has been long
established in the public sector, particularly in the Civil Service.
Of the 14 directors who used the stress/surprise technique in an interview,
10 of them gave it six, seven or eight out of 10.
Industrial employers scored highest when asked to rate meeting the
applicant's partner. This may surprise some who would question how much
influence a wife, husband or partner should have on their other half's job
prospects.
The ratings for graphology were statistically useless but intriguing none
the less. Both respondents who used it were directors of financial services
companies. One of them reported that it was not at all successful in finding
good recruits and the other gave it a rating of five.
The IPM is currently formulating a policy on graphology in recruitment.
While it has yet to make a formal pronouncement, the signs are that it will
come down against it.
Research carried out by the institute has failed to discover any evidence
that it is an accurate predictor of someone's personality. This will be bad
news for S G Warburg, the merchant bank, which has been using it for years.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Safety worries over
sell-off are dismissed - Air traffic control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday set the stage for the first full privatisation of a
country's air traffic control system by proposing to sell the Civil Aviation
Authority's National Air Traffic Services (NATS).
After a one-month consultation period with the aviation industry, the
government hopes to have the legislation passed in the next parliamentary
session and to launch the flotation of NATS at the end of next year or early
in 1996.
Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA),
said the privatisation of NATS would probably be similar to the flotation of
other UK utilities.
Shares in the new company, which would become a privatised contractor to the
CAA, would be offered to the public, aimed at small shareholders as well as
big institutions and corporate investors.
However, a limit is expected to be set on the number of shares that big
groups would be able to buy in the privatised company, Mr Chataway said. The
move would be designed to limit shareholdings by large air traffic control
users such as airlines and airport operators.
The government is also likely to impose a limit on foreign shareholdings.
Both British Airways and British Midland Airways welcomed the government's
proposals, which they said would give the privatised NATS access to capital
markets and greater impetus to improve and modernise the country's air
traffic control infrastructure.
But Sir Michael Bishop, British Midland's chairman, said the government
would have to consider 'very carefully' the impact on airline competition of
allowing airlines to take ownership of NATS. 'We oppose the majority control
of NATS by any airline or group of airlines,' he said.
BAA, the airports operator, said that it would not be interested in taking a
stake in NATS.
Mr Chataway said that splitting the CAA's regulatory activities and its air
traffic control arm would provide greater transparency between regulation
and air traffic control services.
But the main reason for privatisation was to give NATS access to financial
markets so that it could secure its heavy funding needs to modernise and
expand air traffic control services. Investment at NATS is running at Pounds
150m a year compared with only Pounds 20m 10 years ago.
NATS plans to invest around Pounds 650m over the next five years and to
concentrate its operations at two new centres: the en-route centre at
Swanwick, Hampshire, and a Scottish Centre at Prestwick, Ayrshire.
The privatised company would absorb 5,500 of the CAA's current staff of
7,000. NATS' annual turnover is about Pounds 500m, with the bulk of its
income drawn from the provision of en route, approach and airport traffic
control services.
Mr Chataway said the CAA was keen to see the Ministry of Defence continuing
joint operation with NATS. At present there are about 400 MoD staff
integrated in air traffic control operations including some 300 military
controllers. The relationship could continue with a contract between the MoD
and NATS.
Mr Chataway said the CAA was satisfied that privatisation would not
adversely affect the safety of air transport. 'It is difficult to believe
that private is inherently more dangerous than public,' he said, adding that
both BA and BAA had been no less safe since privatisation.
However, ever since privatisation was first mooted, critics have warned of
the potential safety implications of turning over air traffic control to the
private sector. Some air traffic controllers also warned this month that
they would fight 'tooth and nail' against privatisation.

Public companies will have to state their bill-paying policies in directors'
reports, and government departments will have to abide by Confederation of
British Industry guidelines on payment.
But the government has decided not to introduce legislation to give
companies a statutory right to interest on overdue debts because there was
'no clear mandate from the business community'.
Unless there is 'a significant improvement within the next two years' the
government will review the case for legislation, the white paper says.
The decision pleased as many smaller-business lobby groups as it angered.
The Federation of Small Businesses, which with the CBI cautioned against
legislation, welcomed the move. 'This is a good outcome,' the federation
said. 'We had been concerned that large companies would have used a
statutory right for their own benefit.'
Reports on payment records could 'form the basis of a blacklist - a shame
list' that would encourage the bad payers to improve their record.
The Forum of Private Business, which represents 21,000 smaller businesses
and led the campaign for legislation, said the white paper was 'a charter
for cheats'.
At any time about Pounds 50bn of overdue debts is outstanding. About Pounds
17bn of that is owed to small and medium-size companies, according to Lord
Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank. Many companies will seek
to negotiate a price discount in return for paying on time.
The white paper recognises the extent of the problem of late payment.
Overall consultations had shown there was a narrow margin in favour of
legislation 'but there was much concern about the negative impact that it
might have on small businesses'.
The paper also says the government will work with the business community to
develop a proposal for a British standard for prompt pay-ment.
It will also make legal changes to streamline and simplify court procedures
for debt recovery and review the possibility of increasing the scope of
small-claims procedures to cover collection of debts.
The government said the 'major need is to bring about a change in business
culture and hence shorter payment times' but that the 'public sector must
give a lead'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Right to advice backed by
extra Pounds 87m over 3 years - Careers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Careers Service will receive an extra Pounds 87m over three years to
provide advice and education in schools, but the government has spelt out in
greater detail than previously what it expects in return.
For the first time it has specified at what ages guidance and advice should
be given independently, with the aim of providing young people with better
signposts at a time when career options are being offered.
Advice will be given at the ages of 13, 15 and at 17 (for those still in
full-time education).
For the first time, young people will have an 'entitlement' to such
guidance, and it details the sort of information that will have to be given
to parents after interviews.
Until recently the service concentrated on advising and placing 16-year-old
school-leavers in jobs, with schools making help available on course
choices. This will now be provided by the Careers Service. The government
last year transferred the duty in England and Wales of providing a careers
service from local education authorities to the employment secretary.
The employment department is inviting bids from local interests, including
education authorities and Training and Enterprise Councils, which manage
government training schemes, to run the service.
Mr Rob Stokes, president of the Institute of Careers Advisers, said he
welcomed the new entitlements. He said surveys had shown a deterioration in
careers guidance and advice. He estimated that if the Careers Service chose
to spend the extra money on advisers, then some 900 more could be recruited.
He said: 'We also welcome the fact that the government wants advice to be
independent at a time when impartial advice is very necessary. It could be
in the financial interests of schools for example, to persuade young people
to stay on at school.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Vocational courses move
back into the classroom - Qualifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The educational task set out is among the most revolutionary attempted in
the past 50 years - to put vocational courses back into secondary schools
and to give every pupil experience of the workplace before they are 16.
The aim is to develop a coherent 'vocational path' for children beyond the
age of 14, reversing the trend against school-based vocational education
dating back to before the second world war. 'By the year 2000 the
16-year-old school-leaver will be as dead as the dodo,' said Mr John Patten,
education secretary.
However, few of the measures are new. They broadly confirm or reinforce
existing policies, notably those set out in the Dearing report on the school
curriculum published in January and since accepted by the government.
Two new policies concern work experience and careers guidance for pupils in
England and Wales - broadly similar policies will be introduced in Scotland,
allowing for the differences in structures:
In the year before GCSEs all pupils are to receive a week of work
experience, and all pupils aged 16 to 18 in full-time education will receive
another week. The government has given the 128 local Education and Business
Partnerships the job of meeting the objective, in conjunction with schools.
Over three years to 1997/98, Pounds 23m will be provided to help fulfil this
goal.
Pupils will be guaranteed independent careers guidance between the ages of
11 and 18, and in particular at three points: at 13 on GCSE options; at 15
on post-16 choices; and at 17 on post-18 options.
Until now the Careers Service has concentrated on advising and placing
16-year-old school-leavers, with advice on educational options left to
schools and colleges. The move is likely to be welcomed by pupils and
parents unsure of the maze of qualifications and institutions offering
education or training.
The guarantee is to be phased in over the three years to 1997/98, at a cost
of Pounds 87m to the government, as part of its restructuring of the careers
service.
Although the decision to create post-14 'vocational paths' in schools is not
new, the paper spells out in more detail than previously the form they will
take.
A new 'general diploma' will be introduced from next year in England and
Wales, awarded to 16-year-olds gaining GCSEs at grades A to C in English,
maths, science and two other subjects, or vocational equivalents. The new
vocational options are intended particularly for the 60 per cent of
16-year-olds who fail to gain five GCSE passes at grades A to C.
The vocational component of the 'general diploma' is likely to take the form
of 'part one general national vocational qualifications' (GNVQs). Pupils
will chose from a range of subjects, from manufacturing to leisure and
tourism, and each GNVQ will count as two GCSEs. The first courses will be
piloted next year.
The 'part one GNVQs' are intended to lead on to 'intermediate' or 'advanced'
level GNVQs, the latter with A-level status. The reform will take GNVQs into
schools to a degree not envisaged before the Dearing report, when they were
seen primarily as post-16 qualifications geared largely to those with low
achievement levels at GCSE.
Although post-16 GNVQs were launched only two years ago and have become
widely available only this year, there are 88,000 pupils on such courses -
about one in seven of all post-16 students.
A Pounds 5m-a-year voucher scheme is to be introduced to provide new head
teachers with management skills. An estimated 2,000 teachers a year will
receive vouchers to a value of Pounds 2,500 over two years.
Employers' organisations and teachers' associations generally welcomed the
moves. However, concern was voiced at funding implications and the danger
that GNVQs would be seen as 'second best'.

The government yesterday had to back down on its pledge of 'moves towards
early introduction of digital broadcasting'.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said studies were continuing
on how to launch an analogue Channel 5 without prejudicing development of
digital terrestrial television. In a clear hint that Channel 5 is
increasingly likely to get the go-ahead, Mr Brooke said the sentence in the
white paper had been overtaken by his answer.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Rules on health and
safety tidied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six sets of health and safety regulations will replace 100 old ones in line
with proposals made by the Health and Safety Commission yesterday, Richard
Donkin writes. The proposals, however, appear to be more of a tidying-up
exercise than the removal of red tape heralded by the government.
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, welcomed the proposals which,
he said, would 'in no way reduce our health and safety standards'.
The government contention that business was being tethered by too many
regulations, however, did not appear to be supported by the HSC report. It
quoted a survey which showed that most companies thought the existing law
was reasonable and more than 80 per cent of them had no suggestions to make
about changes. The commission said there was confusion about regulations,
and that some businesses had been advised by consultants or suppliers that
there were requirements to be met where none existed.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Employers and unions give
welcome to apprentice plan - Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers and union leaders welcomed the announcement of the extension of
the 'modern apprenticeship' to students leaving full-time education aged 18
and over.
The initiative, called the 'accelerated modern apprenticeship', builds on
the scheme announced last November.
The original scheme is aimed at 16-year-olds who have left full-time
education and it intends to offer high-quality training to technician and
supervisory levels - areas where the UK has a severe shortage of workers.
The government will provide an additional Pounds 107m for the accelerated
scheme, if industry provides the training places.
The Engineering Training Authority, one of 14 organisations which is
piloting the original scheme, said yesterday: 'This new development is one
we have been calling for. Because there are higher staying-on rates, the
pool of young people we can draw from at 16 is becoming smaller.
In addition, as far as engineering is concerned we welcome people who can
draw upon a sound education up to the age of 18.'
The modern apprenticeship, which is about to be piloted in 14 industrial
sectors, will offer higher-quality training than is generally available to
young people on Youth Training.
The initiative announced yesterday will raise the number of people being
trained to NVQ level 3, the vocational equivalent of two A-levels, from
150,000 to about 200,000.
A number of organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry,
were expecting the government to make a significant announcement on progress
towards introducing training credits, or vouchers, to all people aged 16 to
19. -
Criticisms over the content and structure of new vocational qualifications
will be addressed in a review of all National Vocational Qualifications and
General National Vocational Qualifications, to be completed by April 1996.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Business flights may use
RAF base - Airports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering allowing business and general aircraft to use
the Royal Air Force airfield at Northolt, west London.
The white paper said the government would seek views for developing civil
aviation at the RAF airfield because of the increasing pressure on
facilities for general and business aviation in south-east England.
BAA, the airports operator, said it would welcome a move to transfer general
aviation and business services from nearby Heathrow to Northolt as long as
it was beneficial to all.
Heathrow airport is heavily congested, and take-off and landing slots have
become a rare commodity. Slots are granted to business users at Heathrow
only if they are not required by commercial airlines, or if an airliner
fails to show up.
An additional problem is that a small jet takes up two slots so as not to be
caught up in the slipstream of larger aircraft.
BAA also sought to discourage business jets using Heathrow at peak times by
charging a small aircraft the same landing fees as a 400-seater jumbo during
busy periods. This has led to a 7 per cent fall in the number of business
aircraft flights into Heathrow between 1992 and 1993.
There are also proposals to transfer the Queen's flight from RAF Benson in
Oxfordshire to Northolt, which already serves as a base for VIP flights for
royalty and government officials.
Plans to expand civil aircraft services at Northolt are expected to spark
fierce local opposition on the grounds of noise.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: 'Our share of world trade
in services has continued to fall' - The problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scattered through the 163 pages of the government's competitiveness white
paper is a frank assessment of the UK economy's relative standing.
The authors say: 'The white paper sets out the government's view of the UK's
competitive position. It provides, in a time span outside the normal cut and
thrust of party politics, an assessment of the UK's relative strengths and
weaknesses - those factors which fundamentally determine a nation's
international standing.'
Therein lies its originality. As the paper itself acknowledges, most of the
policy discussion describes initiatives which the government has already
announced. But governments, especially those which have been in power for 15
years, are not in the habit of subjecting themselves to a critical audit.
The paper also stresses that the white paper will be updated and that the
ministerial group on competitiveness, which has helped to draw it up, will
remain in existence.
'At the head of this approach is a recognition that the UK needs a culture
of continuing improvement. Competitiveness is dynamic. We cannot ever afford
to stand still. For as we change and innovate, the outside world also
changes,' the paper says.
The authors have had to negotiate a fine line between being honest about the
UK's problems while remaining positive about how they have been tackled over
the past 15 years. Similarly, the authors have attempted to justify limited
intervention by the government without undermining the government's belief
in free markets.
Both of these issues are tackled in the first chapter - Setting the Scene -
as is the question of 'What is Competitiveness?'.
The economic landscape, says the white paper, is changing before our eyes.
The economies of the countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development now produce only around half of world output as the non-OECD
countries, such as the Asian 'tigers', catch up. 'Hong Kong and Singapore
now have average incomes which match those of the UK.'
International trade has been one of the main forces behind faster growth
since the second world war. Trade barriers are continuing to fall. These
changes will increase living standards throughout the world but will also
increase competition. 'The rapid spread of capitalism, the opening of closed
economies and the removal of rigid systems of central planning could bring a
low cost labour force of 1.2bn people on to world markets as producers as
well as consumers.'
Advances in technology and communications, and rapid changes in demographic
structure, will also shape economic growth in the coming decades.
Amid these changes, what does it mean for a nation to be competitive? The
paper quotes approvingly the OECD definition: '. . . the degree to which a
nation can, under free and fair market conditions, produce goods and
services which meet the test of international markets, while simultaneously
maintaining and expanding the real incomes of its people over the long
term'.
The analysis then traces the weaknesses in UK performance back to the end of
the 19th century. After 1945 Britain's standard of living rose faster than
ever before 'but other countries did still better'.
The 1980s saw a marked improvement. 'Manufacturing productivity grew faster
than the US, France and Germany. Our share of the volume of world trade
stabilised after decades of decline. Our overall growth rate was similar to
France, Germany and Italy. The climate of industrial relations was
transformed and the business sector invested a similar proportion of its
value-added to our major competitors. There was also a dramatic rise in the
number of small firms. At the end of 1991 there were 900,000.'
But there are no grounds for complacency. 'The improvements of the 1980s
mean that we are now back in touch with the leaders, but there remains a lot
of ground to make up . . . Although we have many world beating companies,
average productivity levels in manufacturing have not yet risen to those of
our major competitors . . . And our overall share of world trade in services
has continued to fall.' GDP per head placed the UK in 16th position in 1993
among OECD countries, up from 18th position in 1991.
Is manufacturing special? The paper says that all sectors of the economy are
important but continues: 'A competitive manufacturing sector is essential
for our long-term prosperity . . . Manufacturing is a major employer and a 1
per cent change in exports of manufactures would be balanced by a 3 per cent
change in the exports of services.'
And what is the government's role? 'Business - not governments - create
wealth . . . The government's role is to create the conditions in which
firms throughout the economy can improve competitiveness by providing the
stable macroeconomic environment which enables business to plan ahead with
confidence, making markets work more efficiently and broadening the
influence of market disciplines on resource allocation, pursuing tax
policies which encourage enterprise and do not hinder economic efficiency,
and improving value for money in those services which are best provided by
the public sector.'
That is not all. In a more interventionist passage the paper talks about
regulating to reduce uncertainty and adds: 'Where markets do not work well
in delivering the goods and services that people want, the government has a
positive and pro-active role to play. It has a central role in areas
critical to the process of wealth creation.'
The paper goes on to justify government intervention in education, funding
research and development, the supply of capital to small companies, removing
barriers to employment and encouraging employers to train their workforces.
The section on education and training and the section on management contain
the white paper's sharpest criticism of past UK performance. 'We have to aim
higher than in the past. We have to develop the self-confidence and self
esteem which make good citizens and good workers. We have to demand respect
and rewards for vocational education and training as well as academic study.
Above all, we have to give all our people - not just some of them - every
opportunity to give of their best . . . For too long the UK's levels of
participation and achievement have dragged us down the international
education and training league.'
Employment, by contrast, is largely a success story according to the white
paper. Industrial relations has dramatically improved and the labour market
is more flexible. There are worries that unemployment remains 'uncomfortably
high' and that earnings grew faster than justified by improved performance
in the 1980s. But the paper says the position is now improving on both
fronts and adds that low non-wage labour costs remain an important
competitive advantage.
On management and innovation the paper says that, by any standards, the
management of some UK companies equals or exceeds that of its international
competitors. 'But overall national performance is determined not by the
standard of the best but by the average. It is here that the UK lags behind
the competition.' The paper also cites a report from the Cranfield European
Enterprise Centre which found a large 'perception gap' among UK managers who
considered themselves the best in Europe but were considered third out of
five countries by managers in other countries. Responsibility for improving
management performance lies with companies but the government can help by
disseminating best practice, improving management education, and providing
access to appropriate business services, the paper says.
On innovation, too, while some companies and sectors are world class, too
many are not. The need for improvement shows in a number of ways: 'Total UK
expenditure on research and development has declined relative to our main
competitors . . . The UK has a declining share of US patents . . . Technical
qualifications tend to be less common and less well rewarded than in other
countries.'
On finance for business the paper says the UK financial system is among the
most sophisticated in the world but adds 'there have been expressions of
concern over the supply of finance to industry'. The tone here is neutral -
the government reporting complaints rather than endorsing them - and
includes: inflexibility in dividend payments; excessive reliance on
overdrafts; small businesses complaining that banks place too much emphasis
on security; and late payment. But the paper does also note various
initiatives to improve corporate governance, to encourage the supply of
long-term finance, and to improve the financing of small- and medium-sized
businesses.
The paper deals with several other areas. The section on the macroeconomic
framework stresses the need to keep inflation and public debt low.
On the European dimension, the paper praises the European Union's single
market initiative but warns that the EU is becoming over-prescriptive in
some areas.
The section on 'Fair and Open Markets' covers trade policy, state aids,
export promotion and inward and outward investment. 'Communications and
Infrastructure' deals with telecommunications, broadcasting, transport and
other utilities. Other chapters include London, Regeneration, Commercial
Framework (regulation and law, and taxation), the Business of Government,
and Public Purchasing.
In conclusion the paper states: 'This white paper is, in effect, a snapshot
of the work in hand across government. It shows a formidable agenda of
action and initiatives. It reveals the comprehensive nature of the
government's work and how it can support wealth creation.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Cook says 'bankrupt'
scheme will soon lose gloss - Opposition rection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, denounced the
competitiveness white paper as a 'bankrupt statement from a government on
the verge of liquidation'.
To cheers from Labour backbenchers who mocked and ridiculed Mr Heseltine
throughout his statement, Mr Cook maintained that there was not one new idea
in the 160 pages.
He said the need to restore the competitiveness of industry exposed the 15
'wasted years' of Tory rule.
Mr Cook acknowledged that glitzy presentation had put the white paper in the
'coffee table class', but forecast that the gloss would rub off very easily.
He complained that the document did not contain one new measure to stimulate
research and development, and did nothing to tackle the crisis in the
defence industries by helping them to convert to civilian output.
The statement was also rated a flop by Mr Don Foster, for the Liberal
Democrats, who suggested that the manner in which it had been delivered must
have damaged Mr Heseltine's leadership ambitions and provided some
short-term security for Mr John Major.
Mr Foster said the white paper offered no substantial support for small
businesses, which arethe engine room of recovery.
Mr Heseltine told his critics the white paper built on economic strengths
which did not exist in the early 1980s.
Mr Cook also condemned cuts in health and safety provision and insisted
'competitiveness cannot be built on taking greater risks with the
workforce'.
This charge was rebutted by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, who
stressed that the government was implementing recommendations agreed by
representatives of the TUC serving on the health and safety commission.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Manifesto wins praise but
more action is urged - The industry view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry representatives welcomed a manifesto for industry, but were
disappointed at the shortage of new initiatives.
They claimed the thrust of the paper was the outcome of their lobbying
efforts, and welcomed it as a clear statement of the government's industrial
policy and a frank analysis of Britain's competitive position.
But Mr Heseltine's emphasis on the government's priorities rather than on
new initiatives brought warnings that the value of the paper would come only
in the measures that followed it.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'This year's Budget will show whether the government is seriously
committed to the priorities set out in the white paper.'
The few areas where new measures were outlined prompted a mixed reaction.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers'
Federation, said the additional resources for apprenticeships were of
'paramount importance' to manufacturing industry.
But others were less fulsome in their praise of the renewed emphasis on
technical training.
Mr Patrick McHugh, manufacturing industry partner on the consultancy side of
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'Training and education support needs to be
targeted at senior management if it is to give British industry a
competitive edge in business.'
There was also criticism of the role of the government's single-market
compliance unit, set up to help exporters to European Union countries find
their way through legal systems abroad. The unit will concentrate on
'working for tighter new rules'. This was of little use to manufacturers who
wanted help as problems arose, said Mr McHugh.
However, the paper's declarations on the importance of de-regulation brought
congratulations from the vigorously free-market Institute of Directors.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, described the government's proposals
as having 'put business back on track to create an enterprise Britain'.
The EEF was more uncertain of the paper's overall merits, with Mr Mackenzie
pointing to the remaining 'strategic vacuum in many areas of UK industrial
policy, including transport and infrastructure'.
Mr Graham Thelwall-Jones, chairman of Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, said
industry needed cheaper money. The government would achieve more long-range
planning and investment if it paid more attention to avoiding future wide
fluctuation of interest rates.
There also needed to be greater recognition of the energy cost burdens borne
by British industry, said Mr John Cox, director-general of the Chemical
Industries Association.
He described the paper's reference to the benefits of privatisation of
electricity and gas as 'complacent'.
Meanwhile, a number of trade bodies expressed disappointment at the absence
of any measures to strengthen channels of communication between themselves
and the government.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: DTI rejects main
proposals in MPs' report - Committee's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main recommendations of the Commons trade and industry committee are
rejected in the white paper, although Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, said he agreed with most of its analysis.
Mr Richard Caborn, the Labour chairman of the committee, said: 'The white
paper may accept the analysis of our report but it is a million miles apart
in terms of the prognosis for significantly improving Britain's long-term
competitiveness.'
But Mr Heseltine made it clear the government was unable to accept some of
the committee's proposals because they would have proved too costly to
implement.
The contrast between the white paper and the select committee's report
includes the following:
The committee called for direct government action to eradicate City
short-termism by controlling hostile takeovers, restraining excessive
dividend payouts and taking steps to control over-generous pay to
direc-tors.
The white paper, while acknowledging concern over the high proportion of
profits that British companies distribute as dividends, says it does not
mean there is a 'malfunction in the market'.
The issue is whether capital is best left in the hands of companies or
returned to shareholders. But the white paper takes no view as to which is
preferable.
The committee urged ministers to stamp out deficiencies in training and
education.
It suggested a move towards the imposition of a levy on employers, offering
tax incentives, and transferring control of training from the Department of
Employment to the Department of Trade and industry.
The white paper ignores the call for a training levy and the committee's
recommendation that the DTI should be responsible for training.
The committee called for a significant increase in research and development
spending, particularly in specific leading industries such as aerospace.
Although the white paper underlines the importance of R&amp;D it makes no
specific pledges to increase spending on industries such as aerospace.
The committee recommended improving the funding of small business through
tax changes, and called for better understanding of the importance of
manufacturing by setting out national targets for growth in productivity.
The white paper dismisses the need for economic targets.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Clarke curbs Heseltine
ambitions - Political view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine has never been prone to understatement. So his claim
yesterday that he had produced a 'formidable agenda for change and
improvement across the public and private sectors' was unsurprising.
But after five months of work by the cabinet's most senior ministers, the
white paper disclosed a more complex reality. The ministers have analysed
the problems facing the British economy. They have come up with a number of
small but worthwhile initiatives.
But they are still uncertain - and in many cases divided - on the overall
prescription. The finished product bore the marks of a document which had
seen the initial ambitions of Mr Heseltine firmly reined in by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor.
The central political point the government was determined to make was that
it cares about business and it cares about the ability of British companies
to compete in the world.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, thinks his predecessor got it wrong
during the 1980s when initial indifference towards the country's
manufacturing base later turned into malign neglect. He believes the
competitive challenge to Europe from the so-called Asian 'tigers' is still
seriously underestimated. He admires the innovative culture which allows the
US constantly to regenerate its economy.
From that perspective it was essential to present a detailed analysis of the
problems facing industry and an audit of the impact on business of
government policies.
The analysis in the white paper is its strongest point. It is the most
comprehensive study of the performance of British industry and its
relationship with government since 1979. The idea that it is entirely for
the markets to decide what and how much Britain sells abroad has been
quietly buried.
Mr Heseltine and Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, are long-time
political allies. Between them - and with the strong support of the prime
minister - they have added substance to the recognition that high-quality
education and training is critical to the success of British industry.
Among others in the cabinet committee who contributed enthusiastically to
the project were Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, and Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary.
But the Treasury was less impressed. From the outset it suspected Mr
Heseltine of clinging to the interventionist ambitions he formulated during
the 1980s. Mr Clarke insisted that the white paper could not pre-empt any
decisions in the forthcoming public spending round. He made it clear that he
was not interested in any grandiose industrial strategy.
The Treasury was also hesitant about the whole concept of competitiveness.
It was keen on the document's essentially liberal approach to de-regulation,
privatisation and open markets.
But economic orthodoxy says that, while companies can improve their
competitiveness, nations cannot. The Treasury would have preferred a
'productivity' white paper. The result, ministers acknowledged last night,
was a document which acknowledges that government has a vital role in
underpinning industrial success, but remains unsure of where to draw the
line between support and intervention.
The cabinet committee which produced the white paper will become a permanent
fixture. Mr Major stressed that he was looking to the long term.
Competitiveness is not an issue that will go away. But the government will
have to decide whether it wants a policy for industry or an industrial
policy.

FT  25 MAY 94 / C&amp;G defends Lloyds bid from legal challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Building Societies Act 1986 was not a 'comprehensive code' covering all
aspects of transferring the business of a society to another organisation,
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, was told yesterday.
The argument opened the High Court legal challenge to Lloyds Bank's Pounds
1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, which is opposed by
the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator.
Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, counsel for C&amp;G, highlighted three main points at
issue - whether it was lawful for anyone except a society and its successor
company to be party to a transfer agreement; whether it was lawful for a
payment to be made in consideration of a transfer where it was not expressly
permitted by the act; and - assuming a third party was allowed to make such
payments - whether the act allowed them to be made to members of less than
two years' standing.
There were significant differences, he said, between the 'distribution of
funds' described and restricted by the legislation, which came from the
assets of a society or its successor company, and the payments that would be
made if the Lloyds agreed bid succeeded.
C&amp;G's assets would not be depleted at all by the Lloyds Pounds 1.8bn offer,
he said.
He argued that the provisions of the 1986 act should not be read as
forbidding any payment or involvement in the transfer of the business of a
society that it did not explicitly allow.
'It should not be taken as prohibiting everything, however beneficial, that
it does not permit,' he told the court. The relevant part of the act did not
deal with the conduct of third parties, and their position had not been
addressed in the parliamentary debates on the legislation.
The commission had interpreted the act 'in a highly restrictive fashion', so
any society in the position of C&amp;G was 'likely to end up having a stand-up
argument with the commission on certain fundamental questions of law'.
Mr Sumption acknowledged that during the passage of the legislation
ministers had identified two possible problems they were keen to avoid; that
of a society's members taking a decision on the basis of a short-term
financial gain, and that of speculative flows of deposits between societies
on the basis of rumours about unannounced takeovers.
He argued, however, that the primary defence which ministers envisaged
against these mischiefs was not the restriction on those to whom payments
could be made, but the very high level of support required from voting
members of a society for the takeover of its business by any outside
organisation.
The commission's argument will be put today.

Reorganisation of local government may jeopardise the effective management
of rights of way and areas of outstanding natural beauty, the Countryside
Commission warned yesterday.
The commission, which advises the government on the English landscape, told
Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, that the move
to unitary authorities could lead to a fragmentation of specialist
countryside teams.
'Where counties are split up, we shall hope to see robust arrangements put
into place for joint work on strategic planning and countryside management,'
the commission said. It has set a target for local authorities to ensure
that all 120,000 miles of public rights of way in England are open and
clearly marked by the year 2000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's 'single-minded' focus on reducing the unemployment total is
having negative consequences for public finances and economic well-being,
says Labour MP Mr Frank Field.
Mr Field today calls for an 'employment audit' of government policy to stop
it from creating a welfare dependency. He makes his call in a conference
paper to mark the 50th anniversary of the full employment white paper.
He points to increased expenditure on family credit, in-work benefit, and
the growth of invalidity benefit as the cost of reducing unemployment.
'Tax revenues should be rising and welfare spending falling as those
previously unemployed begin work. That process is less marked during the
current recovery,' says Mr Field.

International, the collapsed conglomerate formerly controlled by Mr Asil
Nadir.
The scheme will examine the professional and business conduct, efficiency
and competence of Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm which was auditor to
Polly Peck.
It said it would also examine the work of members of the UK professional
accountancy bodies belonging to Erdal, an accountancy firm based in Cyprus
which audited Polly Peck's local subsidiaries, and any members of the bodies
involved or engaged in the management of Polly Peck.
It said Mr Michael Chance, the executive counsel of the scheme, would
investigate the case and decide whether there were grounds for a complaint,
which would lead to a disciplinary tribunal.

Post Office workers are to be balloted on industrial action in protest at
closures of main offices, the main postal union decided yesterday.
More than 11,000 members of the Union of Communication Workers will vote on
action including strikes.
The move was agreed at the union's annual conference in Bournemouth where
delegates heard that 750 main post offices have closed in the past five
years as counter services have been franchised out to shops or supermarkets.
The move has led to the loss of 6,000 jobs, although there have been no

FT  25 MAY 94 / Major intends to reduce Brussels legislative role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government disclosed yesterday that it wants to break the European
Commission's monopoly on initiating legislation, as ministers stepped up
their attacks on further European integration.
In a speech to the European Policy Forum Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the
Foreign Office minister, said the present arrangements could be replaced by
one which downgraded the commission's role.
Looking to the 1996 intergovernmental conference, Mr Heathcoat-Amory
suggested the Council of Ministers could annually agree a programme of
European Union legislation after consulting the commission and the European
parliament. This would tilt the balance of power away from Brussels and back
towards governments.
His comments came as other senior ministers confirmed that the government
was to fight the June 9 European elections on an unequivocal platform of
defending British sovereignty.
But the opening days of the campaign - with Mr John Major putting defence of
Britain's veto at the heart of his policy - caused some alarm in the
pro-European wing of the party.
The pro-Europeans warned that Mr Major risked making the mistake made by the
then prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1989 when she waged a hostile
campaign against Brussels. The tenor of that campaign persuaded many
Conservative supporters not to vote.
But ministers insisted that the present campaign was in tune with the mood
of the electorate, apparently confirmed by private opinion polling.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor and one of the cabinet's firmest
pro-Europeans, defended the tenor of the campaign as an attack on the
ambitions of the Labour party's socialist allies in the EU to create a
centralised superstate.
But concerns voiced earlier in the week by Sir Edward Heath, the former
prime minister, that the government was slipping into indiscriminate attacks
on the EU were echoed by several Tory backbenchers.
By contrast prominent Tory Euro-sceptics said they were 'delighted' by the
approach adopted by Mr Major and expected him to stick to that position
after the elections.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Opposition urges farming policy shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour and the Liberal Democrats yesterday called for radical reform of the
European Union's 'wasteful' Pounds 30bn Common Agricultural Policy.
Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, said the CAP was 'a
shocking and unjustifiable waste of money for Britain's taxpayers'.
He said: 'Taxes are being wasted to build up beef mountains, butter
mountains, lakes of wine, and in easy money for farmers to do nothing. The
CAP is an ill-targeted investment which no longer serves the interest of
farmers or rural communities.'
Mr Strang said there was strong support among the Socialist Group in the
European parliament to reform the policy, which was given only a brief
mention in the group's joint manifesto.
He said Labour supported maintaining the EU's external tariff wall, which
offers protection to European farmers against imports from other
agricultural producers.
The party would also argue for the continuation of limited schemes, such as
one which helps farmers on poor land in hilly areas.
Labour is seeking an end, however, to intervention buying - which creates
food mountains - and export subsidies, which encourage dumping of cheap food
on world markets.
The party will also press for an end to the controversial set-aside system,
under which farmers are paid for not growing food on specified land.
A Liberal Democrat policy paper, Reclaiming the Countryside, calls for
replacement of the policy with a Common Rural Policy based on direct
payments to farmers related to specified economic, environmental and social
goals.
Mr Paul Tyler, the party's rural affairs spokesman, said farmers knew that
the existing system could not last. He said the Pounds 840m-a-year cost of
the UK set-aside programme was 'largely wasted'.
The size of the paper - it is two pages larger than the party's manifesto at
32 pages - reflects the importance of a credible rural policy to the party
if it is to make its long-awaited electoral breakthrough.
The Liberal Democrats' best chance of making headway lies across a swathe of
Tory-held territory in rural southern England, where it hopes to convince
Labour voters the election is 'a two-horse race'.
In a clear pitch for the 'green' vote, the paper says a central aim of the
proposed reforms is 'to contribute to the objective of environmental
sustainability'.
Mr Tyler also sought to attract rural voters by claiming that the
government's plans to liberalise the Post Office demonstrated the
Conservatives' 'complacency on rural issues'.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, dismissed the proposals to
reform the policy. She said that neither party 'truly understands
countryside concerns'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Leadership Contest: Blair seeks to repair ripped social
fabric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a curious venue for the man who may be the next leader of the Labour
party. In the neo-something splendour of a Westminster hotel ballroom, Mr
Tony Blair yesterday addressed academics, social workers and community
police officers. His host was the free-market think-tank, the Institute of
Economic Affairs. His subject: crime and the family.
Mr Blair had made it clear that his first speech since the death of John
Smith was not to be seen as the opening shot in his leadership campaign.
Formally, that must wait until after the European elections.
But Mr Gordon Brown, his friend and rival for the modernisers' ticket, had
already staked out his claim at the Welsh Labour conference.
Mr Brown, who looks less likely by the day to step aside for Mr Blair, plans
another important speech this weekend. Mr John Prescott, determined to stand
as a candidate of the left, will put his case in an address tomorrow to the
Prison Officers' Association.
So the narrow remit of Mr Blair's subject and his feigned irritation with
the television cameras did not prevent the 41-year-old shadow home secretary
from setting out his ideological stall.
His reputation as one of Labour's leading 'modernisers' rests on his efforts
during the past few years to construct a new philosophical compass for the
party.
Like the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s, he judges that if a
political party puts in place a firm strategic framework for its ambitions,
the detailed policymaking tends to look after itself.
His thesis yesterday was straightforward.
For the past 15 years the prevailing ideology had been one that promoted the
interests of the individual above everything else. It has been based on a
fundamental flaw. Thatcherism, Mr Blair contended, missed the point that the
individual cannot escape from the environment in which he or she lives.
Unfettered liberalism produced an atomised society.
Mass unemployment, crime, drug abuse, poor education and poverty were all
signs that the social fabric had been ripped apart. To take the specific
example the IEA conference was addressing, individual security had been
severely curtailed by rising crime. People could not prosper without a
stable, cohesive society.
Mr Blair offered the Labour modernisers' prescription. It was not a return
to the centralist collectivism of earlier stages of socialism: 'The task of
the left is not to replace this crude individualism with old notions of an
overbearing paternalistic state.'
Nor was it based on the simplistic notion that individuals could escape
responsibility for their actions by pinning the blame for anti-social
behaviour on unemployment or poverty. Rights brought responsibilities.
Instead, Labour wanted social action - through private-sector and voluntary,
as well as government initiatives - as the route to individual opportunity.
Housing, education and social policies would be tailored to that central
ambition. The audience applauded warmly. Mr Blair must hope that his own
party will be as receptive.

FT  25 MAY 94 / MPs to step up attack on PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on Mr Joe Palmer, chairman of the planned watchdog to protect the
private investor, is set to increase today with the publication of a report
from the cross-party Commons Treasury committee.
The MPs' report on the Personal Investment Authority, which is due to become
operational in mid July, contains highly critical comments. However, the
government's continued backing for the PIA was underlined yesterday by Mr
Anthony Nelson, a junior Treasury minister.
He said that it was time for independent financial advisers to press ahead
with their applications to join the new regulator.
The strength of the criticisms was signalled by one MP who had not taken
part in the questioning of the PIA chairman by the committee.
'I think Mr Palmer will be forced to resign after he reads our criticism of
the PIA,' he said.
It appears that the risk that the committee might split along party lines,
undermining the force of its recommendations, led Tory members to agree to
toughen the report's criticism of the PIA after what was described as an
'acrimonious' meeting on Monday.
Mr Palmer and Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, appeared twice before
the committee during its inquiry into financial regulation.
Mr Palmer came under fire from Labour members for the regulatory record of
Legal &amp; General of which he was formerly chief executive.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Water worries hit Tory hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative candidates in south-west England are putting pressure on the
government over the area's high water charges, which they fear could cost
them seats in next month's European elections.
Water charges in Devon and Cornwall are 50 per cent above the national
average, and Liberal Democrats, who expect to do well in the area, are
campaigning strongly on the issue.
Mr Christopher Beazley, Tory MEP for Cornwall and West Plymouth, has asked
Mr John Major, the prime minister, to introduce a national levy on water
charges to pay for anti-pollution measures. Mr Beazley has also held
discussions with Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary.
Cornwall Conservatives also suggest that polluting companies could be
required to pay surcharges for funding coastal clean-up operations.
South West Water, which covers Devon and Cornwall, is involved in a Pounds
2bn clean-up operation, to meet European environmental directives.
Water charges in the south-west have aroused fierce opposition, and rose by
12.5 per cent this year.
Liberal Democrats describe the issue as 'the south-west's poll tax', arguing
that 3 per cent of the UK population is being asked to pay for cleaning 30
per cent of the coastline. Party activists last year collected 30,000
signatures for a petition against the charges.
Mr Robin Teverson, Liberal Democrat candidate for Cornwall, said:
'Privatisation has forced water bills through the roof, whilst South West
Water continue to make big profits.'
Mr Major, who opened the Conservatives' national campaign at a meeting with
activists in south-east Cornwall on Monday, refused to be drawn by
journalists on the issue.
He said: 'There's a problem with water. We are looking at it, but I can't
give you a promise today.'
He added that water prices had fallen in real terms since privatisation, and
that several other products did not have a uniform price across the country.
Mr Beazley said water was not merely a 'regional resource', and the area's
tourism industry, used by people from the rest of the UK, was dependent on
an effective coastal clean-up.
'We need some form of national levy to help pay for this programme,' he
said, adding that the government 'still had some work to do' before it
decided how best to pay for the clean-up operation.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Insults fly from all sides in Euro-campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, DAVID OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European election campaign degenerated into a slanging match yesterday
as Labour dismissed the Tory manifesto as 'a tissue of lies' and Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor, said Labour policies would 'do Britain down and do
Britain in'. Amid growing indications that the campaign will be one of the
dirtiest on record, Labour also accused the Conservatives of seeking to
exploit racial tensions and breaking promises in its last European
manifesto.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused the Conservatives of
putting long-term British interests in jeopardy and lampooned Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, as the government's 'perennial Jeeves'.
Addressing a rally in the south-west, Mr Ashdown said Mr Hurd's efforts to
reconcile the Conservative party's deep divisions on Europe had made his
actions 'more and more distant from what we know he believes in'.
The exchanges were in sharp contrast to the decorous debate in the week
after the death of John Smith when politicians on all sides called for a
less confrontational style.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the Conservative
manifesto contained 26 lies about Labour, including claims that it would
ease immigration controls and abandon Britain's veto in the Council of
Ministers.
He accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, of pandering to xenophobic
cabinet ministers, and described him as 'a junkie hooked on Tory Central
Office lies'.
He said it was difficult to recall a party document as 'mendacious' as the
Tory manifesto, and warned: 'This is a prime minister and a government that
will lie whenever they think it will be to their political advantage.'
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said the Conservative
allegations about Labour's immigration proposals contrasted sharply with the
government's decision to allow wealthy foreigners to bypass immigration
controls.
'It is a nice irony that they are playing the race card on the same day that
they are giving the green light to drug barons to come into the country,' he
said.
Mr Clarke claimed that Labour would undermine British sovereignty by
abandoning the British veto on European Union tax and immigration
initiatives.
Labour has denied that it would abandon the veto in 'areas of key national
interest', although its manifesto envisages greater use of qualified
majority voting on social and environmental matters.
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, said the Liberal Democrat
manifesto committed Mr Ashdown's party to abolishing Britain's veto in
Europe and introducing comprehensive EU rules on immigration.
In the Commons, Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, drew attention
to a pledge in the Conservative manifesto for the 1989 European election,
which ruled out the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and
power.
Mr Major accused Labour politicians of 'trying to duck and dodge and weave
because they know the British people will not stand for their policies on
Europe'.
Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, last night
issued an emphatic statement of his party's traditional federalist stance,
John Authers writes.
He said in St Ives, Cornwall, that the EU would be 'stultified' if it did
not abandon the national veto in favour of qualified majority voting. 'Are
we really so un-self-confident in the new community of 16 that we worry all
the time we are going to find ourselves so isolated on an item of policy
that we stand alone?' he asked.
Federalism, he said, would mean devolving all European decisions to the
lowest level possible.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Accountancy TV did not cover costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountancy Television, the defunct training service for accountants, was
not able even to cover its production and marketing costs, the receivers
said yesterday.
The service generated accumulated losses of Pounds 2.2m according to details
of the draft management accounts for the year to December 31 last year,
which were distributed to creditors earlier this month.
Mr Lee Manning of Buchler Phillips, one of the joint receivers, said it was
unlikely that any unsecured creditors would receive dividends, because there
would probably not be enough money to pay off a charge worth nearly Pounds
60,000 over the assets secured last year by Lloyds Bank.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Premiers to discuss Ulster security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish prime ministers are to meet at Downing Street tomorrow
to review cross-border security and progress on their Northern Ireland peace
initiative.
The meeting follows a renewed surge of violence by both the IRA and loyalist
paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and a failed but potentially devastating
bomb attack in Dublin last weekend by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force.
Dublin officials said that tomorrow's meeting had been arranged before the
upsurge in violence, to coincide with other functions the Irish prime
minister has planned in London and Oxford.
New security measures are expected to include additional police checkpoints
on roads north of Dublin and leading from the border. Police and army chiefs
were in talks throughout yesterday and the army said that additional troops
'will be available to support the Gardai as required'.
Up to 2,000 of Ireland's 13,000 troops are deployed on border security
duties at any one time, supported by helicopters, spotter planes and
bomb-disposal teams.
On average some 35 checkpoints on border roads are manned by army personnel
every day, and more than 30 patrols per day are carried out along the
border.
Any movements of commercial explosives - from the time they enter the
country to their moment of detonation - are escorted and monitored by army
personnel.
Yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, sought to
emphasise that next month's European election should not be treated in the
province as a referendum on the Downing Street Declaration.
Launching the Conservative party manifesto in Belfast, Sir Patrick said the
election mattered because it was about 'our jobs and our identity'.
He said Britain's opt-out from the 'suffocating' social chapter of the
Maastricht treaty meant more jobs for Ulster, a region plagued by high
unemployment.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Truck owner is fined after deaths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The owner of a heavy truck which went out of control on a steep hill causing
the death of six people was fined Pounds 5,000 by Halifax magistrates
yesterday.
It was the maximum fine that could be imposed on Fewston Transport of
Skipton, which pleaded guilty to using a heavy goods vehicle with defective
brakes.
Mr Richard Hodgson, prosecuting, said the truck was inspected after the
crash and excessive wear was found on most of the brake drums and shoes. It
was indicative of a general lack of attention and adjustment to them.
Mr Stephen Kirkbright, defending, said the inexperience of the driver, Mr
Derek Waterworth, who died in the crash, might have been a factor in the
accident on the main street of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, last
September.
Mr Waterworth, of Bradford, was working as an agency driver for the company
when his 10-tonne, eight-wheel truck, carrying 20 tonnes of stone, crashed
into a BT van. The truck and van crashed into a row of shops killing both
drivers, three women and the two-year-old daughter of one of the women.
Mr Kirkbright conceded that the braking systems on all eight wheels were
defective but said that the company had a system of inspection far better
than that recommended by the makers.
Mr Kirkbright said the brakes were working properly - a driver behind Mr
Waterworth had almost run into him when he braked sharply only minutes
before the fatal crash. 'There is no evidence that the brakes were applied
at all,' Mr Kirkbright said.
The company was also ordered to pay Pounds 100 costs. Two similar charges
were withdrawn against the firm's managing director, Mr Anthony Eyers, of
Fewston, Harrogate, and his transport manager, Mr Eric Preston, of Skipton,
following a guilty plea on behalf of Fewston.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A majority of financial services companies will increase spending on
information technology this year for the first time since 1989, in spite of
numerous project failures, a survey by the consultancy Price Waterhouse has
found, Alan Cane writes.
The survey of 82 organisations with annual IT budgets ranging from less than
Pounds 5m to more than Pounds 10m found that 57 per cent expected to
increase their rate of IT spending. Last year only 30 per cent predicted a
rise in spending.
The survey also revealed a high rate of project failure, with a quarter of
respondents admitting that most projects had been delivered late or over
budget.
IT project failures have increased as companies have used technologies to
attempt to seize competitive advantage, often without a clear understanding
of what is involved.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Radio station numbers may surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Radio Authority yesterday offered the possibility of licensing as many
as 150 new commercial radio services in the UK - virtually doubling the
existing number of services.
The new stations, which could go on air from the beginning of 1996, will be
a mixture of large metropolitan stations and more local services.
The authority, the regulatory body for commercial radio, rejected a plea
that the new frequencies between 105MHz and 108MHz should be used to create
a fourth national commercial radio network.
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which won a national medium-wave
frequency for its 1215 pop station, lobbied heavily for a new national FM
station.
The option chosen will allow up to two new FM services in most large
metropolitan areas and a number of local services.
The authority said yesterday that its chosen option offered the greatest
flexibility and would also accommodate 'a wide variety of types of radio
service, while at the same time broadening choice for the largest number of
listeners'.
Lord Chalfont, chairman of the authority, said the mixture of licences
advertised would depend on demand.
Commercial radio is expanding fast in the UK. Five new regional stations
begin broadcasting on September 1, and applications for four new London
stations close next month.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Channel 4 safety net 'will cost it Pounds 500m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 claimed yesterday that it will pay ITV companies Pounds 500m over
10 years unless the funding formula linking the two channels is removed.
Sir Michael Bishop, the Channel 4 chairman, said yesterday that a funding
formula 'designed as an insurance policy for Channel 4 has turned into a
golden goose windfall for ITV, creating a substantial liability for the
channel it was designed to protect'.
The complex formula set out in the 1990 Broadcasting Act was designed to
protect Channel 4's remit for innovative programming and provide a safety
net when the channel started selling its advertising in competition with
ITV.
The act requires that all revenue earned by Channel 4 above 14 per cent of
total non-satellite television advertising should be divided. Half goes to
ITV to provide a safety net, 25 per cent is kept by Channel 4 and 25 per
cent goes into a reserve fund.
'The mechanism was cobbled together at the last minute. We were never
consulted,' Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, said yesterday.
He conceded that Channel 4 had asked for some form of safety net in case of
diminished advertising.
Last year Channel 4 paid the ITV companies Pounds 38.2m and this year the
figure is expected to be Pounds 50m. Channel 4 said Pounds 38m amounted to
the channel's entire drama budget.
Mr Grade said that his channel would never need the safety net so the money
was going straight into ITV profits. He demands a funding change by the
beginning of next year.
Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Association, said yesterday that 'it
would be absolutely wrong to try to unpick one part of the Broadcasting
Act'.
Estimates of money that would come to ITV from Channel 4 had been a factor
in bids for new licences.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Ferry group plans two rail bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sea Containers, the container and Hoverspeed ferries group, plans to bid for
two British Rail franchises, but on terms which fall outside the
government's guidelines.
The group would make its offers conditional on obtaining a long lease on the
rail track concerned and on acquiring its own rolling stock. Bids on these
terms would be regarded as 'non-compliant' but would still have to be
considered by Mr Roger Salmon, the rail franchising director.
Normally the government would require train operators to rent track from
Railtrack, the company created to own track and signalling. It also expects
most operators to lease their rolling stock.
Sea Containers is considering bids for BR's Great Western franchise running
from London Paddington and the South West Trains franchise from London
Waterloo.
The franchises would complement Sea Containers' ferry operations between the
mainland and the Isle of Wight.
The franchises, which are expected to attract management buy-out bids, are
in the first round of BR routes to be privatised in 1995.
'We would want to lease our own right of way for 99 years, effectively for
ever, and maintain the track and signalling ourselves,' said Mr James
Sherwood, president of Sea Containers. 'We would also ultimately want to
supply our own rolling stock though we would start by leasing BR stock.'
Mr Sherwood, whose company owns the Orient Express train service, the only
private passenger service to run on BR track, has called for 50-year
franchises, instead of the periods of seven to 15 years suggested by the
government.
He described the Treasury decision to seek a 5.6 per cent return, rising to
8 per cent, on BR's assets as 'absurd'. 'The government should have written
down BR's asset values, to create a company with a sensible capital base.'
The present franchising framework, involving leased rolling stock and rented
track and stations, appeared to have been designed to attract management
buy-out teams. He added: 'The railway network will run down because no one
will be putting any capital in. You can't really control your destiny
because you could lose your franchise at any moment. BR staff will form
groups and take over franchises with Pounds 100 of capital. They will just
be selling their expertise.'
If Sea Containers won a franchise it would seek cost reductions and increase
the marketing of train services. 'We would put on all the usual pressures to
get an efficient transport system,' Mr Sherwood said.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Lloyd's confident on solvency tests: Annual meeting told of
'an improving trend'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London will pass its annual solvency tests later this year in
spite of recent losses, Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of the insurance
market, said yesterday.
He told the annual meeting - which was low-key in comparison with some
recent gatherings - that he had 'no doubt at all' Lloyd's would be able to
pass the tests in August.
'We are going to be able to pass; we have been through the methodology with
the Department of Trade and Industry and they are comfortable with the way
we are proceeding,' Mr Middleton told some 1,350 Names, the individuals
whose assets have traditionally supported the market.
He said Lloyd's had used computers to forecast the impact of the 1991 loss
on Names.
Losses for the 1991 year - reported last week in line with its three-year
accounting system - amount to Pounds 2.05bn, and have led to repeated
allegations by critics that the market's ability to pass solvency will be
impaired.
Cumulative losses since 1988 amount to about Pounds 7bn and Lloyd's expects
to report a fifth consecutive year of losses when it announces its results
for 1992 next year.
The market must pass two solvency tests each year. The first, which Mr
Middleton described as 'the more critical in the eyes of the DTI', compares
the overall level of premium income received by the market with the level of
its reserves.
The second matches the assets and liabilities of individual Names with any
shortfalls 'earmarked' from the Central Fund, which pays claims when Names
cannot meet their obligations.
A leaflet distributed outside the meeting yesterday by the Parliamentary
Lobby Group, an action group of loss-makers, repeated forecasts of impending
insolvency, arguing that Lloyd's 'will be wound up. The only question is
when.' But the sentiments were not echoed to any appreciable extent inside
the meeting.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said its 1991 result showed the
'beginnings of an improving trend which will carry on through 1992 to good
profits in 1993'.
The meeting was also told that Lloyd's was exploring ways in which Names
forced to reschedule their debts through so-called 'hardship' arrangements
could have direct access to any compensation won from legal action against
their agents. Names in hardship transfer all their assets to Lloyd's but are
allowed to retain an income of about Pounds 17,000 a year - net of tax and
mortgage payments - and to live in a 'modest' home, typically valued at
about Pounds 150,000.
In return they agree to hand any recoveries from legal action to Lloyd's.
The new arrangements could help those who have used all their assets to pay
losses and have insufficient funds to generate an income.
Mr Middleton said after the meeting that 102 of the 266 writs issued against
Names failing to pay losses had been withdrawn.
Several Names speaking from the floor were critical of the market, although
those protesting at alleged failure by Lloyd's in the early 1980s to
disseminate information about asbestos-related losses among Names received
the greatest applause. Mr Rowland said Lloyd's had already investigated
these allegations and 'innuendo and gossip wasn't enough to mount
inquiries'.
Other loss-makers repeated allegations of incompetence and negligence,
already the subject of legal action.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Superbug horror infects public imagination: Clive Cookson
reports on evidence that helps to allay anxieties about an unusual strain of
bacteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mutant flesh-eating superbugs, capable of killing a healthy adult within
hours, are rampaging through Britain.
Or, to put it another way, the media is indulging in one of its periodic
frenzies of terrifying the public with a medical horror story.
The facts feeding the hype are that seven people in the Gloucester area have
suffered from a virulent infection by an unusual strain of Streptococcus A
bacteria this year. The infection causes 'necrotising fasciitis', a
condition similar to gangrene which rapidly destroys tissue.
Three people died, three recovered after surgery and antibiotic treatment,
and the seventh, a 45-year-old woman, is in a critical condition in
Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.
Publicity about the cases, combined with an official alert issued by the
government's Public Health Laboratory Service, has brought reports of at
least six more cases of necrotising fasciitis - three fatal - in other parts
of Britain.
A woman died yesterday at Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, south-west
London; she had apparently been infected while undergoing a Caesarean
section. Mr Terry Bowden, a 39-year-old builder, died earlier this year in
Lewisham Hospital, south-east London, 36 hours after noticing a swelling on
his leg.
But in Stirlingshire Mrs Roseann Millar, a 41-year-old nurse, survived after
emergency surgery to remove a large amount of muscle around her stomach.
Yesterday health officials said fears of a horrifying new epidemic were
misplaced.
Dr Christopher Bartlett, director of the PHLS Communicable Disease
Surveillance Centre, said: 'Public anxiety should be allayed by the fact
that we have examined all indicators of streptococcal infection in the
country and these are demonstrating no change in either numbers or patterns
of infection.'
He added: 'Clusters as reported from Gloucester are unusual but have been
reported elsewhere in the world and may be no more than chance occurrences.
'However, all appropriate microbiological and epidemiological investigations
are being conducted.'
Evidence that the Gloucester cluster is a coincidence, rather than a
spreading infection, comes from genetic investigation of the seven cases.
This shows that they were all caused by slightly different sub-types of
Streptococcus A bacteria.
Scientific tests have not yet shown whether the cases of necrotising
fasciitis in other parts of the country are linked in any way.
Streptococcus A is a widespread germ whose symptoms in today's
industrialised societies are usually no worse than a sore throat. But it can
release toxins which cause a range of far more serious diseases, including
not only gangrene but also pneumonia, toxic shock and rheumatic fever.
Puerperal fever, once Britain's main killer of women after childbirth, was
caused by streptococcus.
Professor Donald Ritchie, an expert on microbial genetics at Liverpool
University, says new strains of streptococcus arise through the action of
'phages' - viruses that infect bacteria and carry genes between them.
Scientists believe that the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria
may be giving virulent strains more scope to evolve. But they say it is
extremely unlikely a new 'super-strep', capable of living up to this week's
newspaper headlines, has suddenly emerged.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Minister sees early end to Malaysia ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Malaysian governments are 'definitely on the way to solving'
the trade rift between the two countries, Mr Richard Needham, the trade
minister, said yesterday.
At the end of February Malaysia imposed a ban on giving government contracts
to British companies in retaliation for critical reports in the British
media about the Kuala Lumpur government.
'They went out of their way to make us welcome,' said Mr Needham, after
meetings in Malaysia with senior officials. 'They even offered us scones and
cream tea. It was real strawberry jam. We are definitely on the way to
solving the problem.'
Mr Needham, who arrived on a surprise visit on Monday, said it was not a
question of whether the ban would be lifted, more when. He is due to report
back to London today.
Malaysian officials also feel that the ban on British companies will be
lifted 'in a matter of weeks rather than months', according to one senior
finance ministry official. Malaysia has been one of the biggest markets in
the Far East for British goods and services in recent years. When it imposed
its ban the Malaysian government said that up to Pounds 4bn worth of
contracts with British companies could be affected.
Mr Needham has met Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, Mr Anwar
Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister, and Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the trade
minister. He brought a letter from Mr Major to Dr Mahathir and is believed
to have proposed setting up consultative groups on subjects ranging from the
transfer of technology to education and healthcare.
'We have to set up a system through which we can understand their
sensitivities and they can learn about our problems,' said Mr Needham. 'We
need to build a far closer relationship.'
The main focus of Malaysian anger was an article in The Sunday Times
alleging that a British company had been involved in negotiations to offer
bribes to Dr Mahathir in exchange for a multi-million-pound contract. Dr
Mahathir accused The Sunday Times - and the British media in general - of
telling lies. 'All I want is the truth,' he said. 'But the British media is
incapable of telling the truth.'
Mr Needham is due to return to Kuala Lumpur as leader of a British trade
delegation in just over a week.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Underwriter admits his testimony was 'nonsense'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former underwriter yesterday contradicted testimony he had given to an
internal inquiry into the heavy losses of the Gooda Walker syndicates at the
Lloyd's insurance market.
Mr Anthony Willard, who was lead underwriter for Gooda Walker syndicate 299
during most of the 1980s, said in the High Court that information he had
given to a loss-review committee investigation headed by Mr Kieran Poynter
three years ago was 'nonsense'.
He was describing the details of his approach to assessing and providing for
potential losses incurred on the insurance syndicate, which specialised in
marine risks.
The evidence came in the second week of his cross-examination in the case
brought against Gooda Walker by 3,095 of its lossmaking Names - the
individuals whose assets have traditionally underwritten the market.
Last Thursday, during a highly strained morning of testimony, he said he had
been put under pressure to mislead Names in estimates of losses, which he
had refused to do.
He said he had conducted estimates of losses before the Piper Alpha oil
platform disaster, in contradiction to his testimony to the Poynter
committee read to the court.
He also dismissed as 'nonsense' his previous comments to the committee about
how much of an allowance he traditionally made for losses. 'I made a
mistake,' he said.
He said he stood by his estimates of losses on syndicate 299, but he had
doubts about those made by 'some people' at the agency of the losses
incurred on syndicate 298.

FT  25 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Companies asked to join China fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Human Rights Watch, a worldwide organisation, has for the past five months
been holding 'quiet conversations' with dozens of multinational companies in
the US, Europe and Asia with the aim of developing a set of principles which
they could voluntarily employ to improve human rights in China.
The effort began in January as the US administration was warning Beijing it
must make efforts to improve its human rights record or risk losing its Most
Favoured Nation status. China mostly ignored the warning, and President Bill
Clinton has until June 3 to decide what action to take.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, told the president on
Monday China had complied with only some of the conditions, but he
recommended very limited sanctions.
Human Rights Watch's Asia arm said there had been a 'significant overall
deterioration' of human rights in China where the government has 'opted for
a policy of conspicuous crackdown . . . and wide-ranging repressions'.
Mr Richard Dicker, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch, said: 'It now
appears likely that some approach to the corporate community to take
voluntary measures will figure into the Clinton administration's MFN
resolution package. The issue is how in a discreet low-key, effective way
(companies) can use their presence and influence for the betterment of human
rights, which is clearly in their long-term interest.'
Human Rights Watch has developed five proposed measures:
Prevention of the inadvertent use of prison products or forced labour
products in their production process.
Prohibition of mandatory political indoctrination sessions on company
premises.
Adoption of an employment policy which bars discrimination on the basis of
political beliefs.
Protection of employees' rights to free expression and association.
Conveying concerns about human rights violations to relevant authorities.
Many businesses have been cool to proposals for a code like the Sullivan
Principles which were employed in South Africa.
Mr Cal Cohen, one of the leading Washington lobbyists for renewal of MFN,
said in the case of South Africa, the effort was a global one; in the case
of China, only the US is interested in human rights.
'If we as a government ask companies to convey political sentiments, we will
be seen as government representatives rather than business. We might then
accomplish less,' he said.

FT  25 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US test for a 'dead fish' theory - Uruguay
Round ratification brings Congress another 'crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As that unschooled baseballer Yogi Berra might have said, it was deja vu all
over again when last week House Speaker Tom Foley warned that Congress faced
'a very real crisis' over ratification of the Uruguay Round international
trade deal.
Nine months ago it was the North American Free Trade Agreement that was in
jeopardy. Then President Bill Clinton's administration put allits efforts
into securing Nafta passage; impassioned presidential speeches, a
vice-presidential debate, and a frantic round of political horse-trading
ended in a stunning victory two months later.
Although President Clinton's power to pull off more victories ought not be
under-estimated, passage this year of the implementing legislation for the
Gatt agreement now seems almost as improbable as did the Nafta victory last
year. Obstacles to passage seem to be mounting instead of shrinking.
Mr Foley and his colleagues see as the chief impediment the need to raise
Dollars 10bn-Dollars 14bn over the next five years and perhaps as much as
Dollars 40bn over the next decade to compensate for the tariff revenue lost
under the Uruguay Round deal. Budget rules require this to be done either by
programme cuts or taxes.
The alternative is a congressional waiver to be granted on the grounds that
the US would raise more revenue through increased trade than it would lose
by the tariff cuts. A waiver must garner 60 votes in the Senate and a
majority in the House; that alone would be a formidable but not impossible
task.
'If we do a waiver, the press will instantly say the Clinton administration
is abandoning its focus on fiscal discipline. The long bond will go up
another  3/4 of a point,' an administration official said. Neither
Republicans nor Democrats have been able to agree among themselves about
whether or how to cut programmes or raise fees. So the administration sent
Congress a list of possible actions which included a 4 per cent revenue tax
on radio and television stations, a Dollars 3.1bn cut in farm programmes, a
Dollars 600m gambling tax, a Dollars 500m tax on parking space fringe
benefits and Dollars 200m for taxing chemicals under clean air rules. It is,
a long-time Washington lawyer said, 'a parade of horribles, designed to get
everyone mad' - or in the waiver camp.
Passage of the Uruguay Round deal faces other formidable obstacles. Business
has been distracted by the need to lobby over renewal of China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status. Lobbyists complain about chaos in the
administration's policy-making and lack of vision; the president has yet to
announce if or what kind of 'fast track' negotiating authority he will seek.
There are worries that the influential Congressman Dan Rostenkowski,
chairman of the House ways and means committee, will be indicted for
criminal misuse of funds and have to step aside at a crucial time for
passage of trade legislation, health insurance and welfare reform.
There is strong Republican opposition to Gatt's subsidies agreement that
legitimises government aid for research and development, regional
development and environmental compliance. Angriest of all is Missouri
Senator John Danforth, who represents the aircraft manufacturer McDonnell
Douglas, which has been hurt by subsidies to Airbus, the European aircraft
consortium. He says he will oppose the Gatt deal unless the administration
organises a side agreement, signed by the EU, Canada and Japan, which would
limit subsidies.
The round's most committed foes, led by Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate, argue that the new World Trade Organisation, the more permanent
successor to Gatt, threatens US sovereignty on trade matters. That charge
cuts across the political spectrum and appeals to arch-conservatives such as
Congressman Newt Gingrich, the House minority whip.
A ruling this week against the US by a Gatt dispute settlement panel gives
the opposition new ammunition. The decision found that US actions to protect
dolphins under US Marine Mammal Protection Act are inconsistent with Gatt.
'It was helpful for Gatt to reveal its hand again and make vividly clear
what is in store for US environmental and consumer laws,' said Ms Lori
Wallach of Mr Nader's Public Citizen. 'Many laws will be found Gatt-illegal
and then Congress must either eliminate the laws or face perpetual trade
sanctions.'
Mr Kantor's response to the panel decision was to complain about Gatt
secrecy and demand that all the relevant documents in the case be made
public.
Ms Wallach issued a derisive response about 'Gatt spin control' which
concluded that 'releasing the documents now is too late to affect the legal
and political reality of the Gatt ruling'.
Partly out of fear that opposition will just harden if there is a delay, the
administration is trying to repeat its Nafta triumph.
No cabinet member lets a speech go by without plugging the Gatt deal.
Ms Wallach sees this as confirmation of her 'dead fish' theory. 'If you have
a dead fish, you want to get it out of the sun as soon as possible before it
begins to stink,' she argues.
'This Gatt deal is the biggest dead fish to hit Congress in a long time.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / World Trade News: UK business wants our man in Havana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The improvement in relations between Britain and the government of Fidel
Castro indicates growing opportunities perceived by British business in
Cuba.
It follows the opening by the Cuban government to foreign investment as part
of its desperate search for hard currency since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, its main supplier of financial support.
The growing contacts between the two governments are reflected in the visit
of a Cuban parliamentary mission, including Mr Ricardo Alarcon, often
described as Mr Castro's number two, to London this week. Junior trade
minister Patrick McLoughlin is due to become the first British minister to
visit Cuba since at least the 1970s when he goes to Havana in September.
The decision to send a minister to Havana has not been taken lightly, since
it is bound to incur some US displeasure. It is the latest manifestation of
the differences between Washington and London over the Cuban question,
following the strong British representations against US legislation that
tightened the embargo on Castro by making it tougher for the subsidiaries of
US companies to do business in the US. UK companies were forbidden to comply
with this law.
It shows that the Foreign Office has reached the conclusion that Castro and
his government are likely to be around for some time despite the country's
severe economic difficulties. 'A year ago there was a real question over
whether there would be a violent upheaval,' said one British official. 'Now
that seems less likely.'
UK officials say the closer ties reflect a British interest in a peaceful
transition in Cuba, which will be encouraged by development of trade and
investment links. There is also, they say, a long-standing interest in the
stability of the Caribbean in view of the location of British territories
such as the Cayman Islands nearby.
The shift also follows the stepping down as foreign office minister last
year of Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, who was strongly opposed to moving closer to
the Castro regime. His successor, Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, is meeting Mr
Alarcon this week.
But the real driving force behind the move is the growing interest by UK
business in Cuba, a market of 11m people from which the US is excluded by
the economic embargo. While there is some scepticism in Whitehall that
Castro will ever allow hugely profitable joint ventures, there has been
enthusiastic support for closer ties from businesses attached to the
Caribbean Trade Advisory Group (Caritag), which has led unofficial trade
missions to Havana.
Mr David Jessop, Caritag director, said agreements currently being
negotiated by UK companies involved significant sums in the agriculture,
tourism, mining and other sectors. He declined to be more specific since the
decision to invest usually involved main board decisions because of the
difficulties of the US embargo.
However, most involved say negotiations are not easy - the rules of the game
are sometimes changed by the government and each joint venture must be
referred to the council of ministers for permission.
UK companies have been slower than their counterparts elsewhere in exploring
the market. The Dutch bank, ING, has established a joint venture with the
Cuban group, Acemex, to open a bank aimed at financing Cuban trade. The
Netherlands Caribbean Bank, to be based in Curacao, will soon open a
representative office in Havana - the first foreign bank representation in
the country. ING officials say they hope business will be sufficient to
justify a branch there.

<TEXT>
Four Moslem fundamentalists convicted of bombing the World Trade Centre were
each sentenced yesterday to 240 years in prison by a judge who called them
sneaks and cowards, Reuter rports from New York.
US District Judge Kevin Duffy said 180 years of each sentence against Ahmad
Ajaj, Mohammad Salameh, Nidal Ayyad and Mahmud Abouhalima was based on life
expectancy of six people who died in the blast.
The February 26 1993 car bomb injured over 1,000 people and caused hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of damage. The fatal blast shocked the nation
with the realisation that the US was no longer safe from such violence.
The defendants were convicted on March 4 by a Manhattan federal jury of
conspiracy resulting in death and destruction.

<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund yesterday announced that Mr Richard Erb
would be stepping down next week after 10 years as its deputy managing
director.
The number two slot at the Washington-based IMF, which is normally within
the US's gift while the top post is filled by a European, will be taken by
Mr Stanley Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a former chief economist at the World Bank, the IMF's sister
institution.
The IMF is also considering a management restructuring that could give it
three deputy managing directors under Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing
director, in the same way that the World Bank has placed three managing
directors under its president, Mr Lewis Preston.
But officials are still debating how to make clear that Mr Fischer, as the
US appointee, would be the principal deputy, and how to avoid simply adding
an extra layer of bureaucracy.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Clinton in drive over healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton plans to meet congressional leaders of the Democratic
party today to revive prospects of passing healthcare reform legislation,
writes George Graham.
With healthcare reform bogged down in five congressional committees, Mr
Clinton wants to 'keep everybody focused on the endgame,' a White House
official said.
Mr Clinton is also expected to meet all the Democratic members of Congress
this evening, although the subjects may spread wider than healthcare.
Despite some small breakthroughs, progress has proved agonisingly slow. All
five committees seem likely to miss the informal deadline Mr Clinton had set
of completing drafting work before next week's recess.
Many officials in Washington doubt whether it will be possible to pass a
comprehensive reform this year. Prospects next year, after likely Republican
gains in November elections, would be even slimmer.
However, Senator George Mitchell, Democratic leader in the Senate, said:
'Going from the general to the specific is always difficult, but none of
this is insurmountable if there is good faith.'

FT  25 MAY 94 / Venezuela alters dollar auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's central bank has abandoned the system introduced this month to
ration sales of dollars to banks and exchange houses. The system had led to
a growing gap between the official exchange rate for the bolivar, determined
by central bank sales of dollars, and that on the parallel market.
Yesterday the central bank began using a Dutch auction system, under which
banks and exchange houses offer bids each business day for a specific volume
of US dollars they wish to purchase. The monetary authorities then decide on
a minimum price, and provide dollars to all bidders who have offered the
minimum price or above.
The central bank's main goals are to slow the depreciation of the bolivar
and lower pressure on the country's international reserves, which have
fallen sharply since the beginning of the year.
Since May 2, the official value of the bolivar fell 9 per cent against the
dollar, but, on the parallel market, the decline was more than 24 per cent.
Mr Chip Brown, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York City, said that
the new system, 'if properly managed, should help to stabilise the bolivar
and bring it closer to parity.'
The previous system used a weighted average to determine the dollar's price
each day, and placed a strict limit on the resale margin for foreign
exchange obtained from the central bank. There are no limits on resale
margins under the new plan.
Venezuela depends heavily on imported food and industrial inputs - and
currency depreciation therefore feeds straight into cost-of-living
increases. The bolivar's devaluation alone is expected to push inflation
this year to 60 per cent or more, compared with 46 per cent in 1993.
Under the system just abandoned, which was introduced on May 4, demand for
dollars from the central bank was greater than what the bank was willing to
supply. Foreign and domestic companies complained they were unable to get
foreign exchange needed to pay for imports and meet other international
obligations and warned of shortages as the flow of imports slowed.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Foreign banks accept US curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European and Japanese banks appear to be ready to drop their opposition to
controversial restrictions on foreign-owned banks in US legislation designed
to remove barriers stopping banks in the US from opening branches outside
their home states.
Interstate branching legislation has passed both houses of Congress, but the
Senate version of the bill would restrict foreign banks from opening new
branches in the US unless they operate through a separately incorporated
subsidiary.
The US treasury, the European Commission and some House members have argued
this would breach the principle of national treatment by imposing more
restrictions on foreign banks than on their US counterparts, and could
rebound against US banks seeking to operate abroad.
In Europe, for example, US banks may open a branch directly in all EU
countries without setting up a subsidiary.
But most international banks appear to have concluded that the practical
consequences of the restrictions would be small, and they have not been
pressing their finance ministries to intervene actively in the dispute.
Many banks have also decided they would rather undergo these limited
restrictions than engage in an all-out fight that could strengthen calls in
the Senate for foreign bank branches to be subjected to the requirements of
deposit insurance and of the Community Reinvestment Act. This requires banks
to lend a certain proportion of their resources to deprived areas.
Foreign banks that wish to set up a branch network in the US have usually
chosen to do so by buying a US subsidiary.
Senate concern is driven by evidence that foreign banks have been able to
increase their market share in the US because they do not bear the costs of
deposit insurance and CRA compliance.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Defiant Uruguay leader holds out for free market: Setbacks
have not deflected President Lacalle's vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Luis Alberto Lacalle, now well into his last year in office, has
had his share of setbacks.
As the head of Uruguay's minority conservative government since he took
office in March 1990, he has been deserted by allies, weathered numerous
defeats in Congress, and suffered eight general strikes and a humiliating
referendum defeat in 1992 that dealt a severe blow to his privatisation
plans.
This has not stopped him from plugging away at market-oriented economic
policies, in spite of their apparent unpopularity with the electorate.
The government has been selling state assets not covered by the December
1992 referendum verdict, when 72 per cent of voters opposed the sale of five
enterprises including the telephone company.
By the year-end, it will have reprivatised the last of the four banks
absorbed by the previous government, and the last meat packing plant. It is
evaluating an offer to buy the state airline, Pluna, inviting bids for the
government gas company in Montevideo and restructuring the ungainly state
oil, cement and alcohol conglomerate.
It has ended the government monopoly of the insurance business, and pushed
through port reform. It has promoted a bill which will mean full legal
autonomy for the central bank and is making another push - with the help of
the World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank - to reduce the size of
the country's bloated and inefficient civil service.
All this has won the government plaudits outside the country. The Economist
Intelligence Unit decided recently to improve the country's political risk
rating because of 'continued efforts at structural reform by the Lacalle
administration - and its partial successes - despite a hostile congress.'
Inside the country the efforts of Mr Lacalle, who is forbidden under the
constitution to stand for successive terms, go largely unsung.
His Partido Nacional is trailing in the opinion polls ahead of November's
elections, behind both the centrist Colorado party and its candidate, former
president Julio Maria Sanguinetti, and the left-wing Frente Amplio.
Mr Lacalle can claim that his policies have led to economic growth of 15 per
cent since he took office, rising investment rates, an increase in real
incomes of one-fifth and a much-reduced budget deficit.
Mr Ignacio de Posadas, the finance minister, says last year the economy grew
about 2 1/2 per cent, and the government is tentatively forecasting 2 per
cent for 1994 - though this could be higher if the Brazilian economy
continues to improve.
Inflation fell to 53 per cent last year, half the rate when the
administration came to power. The rate has since fallen to 44 per cent, and
the target for the year end is 30 per cent, says the minister.
He says the government will show a small budget deficit this year, despite a
spate of strikes from government employees for higher salaries, but it will
be the lowest budget deficit in an election year for at least 70 years.
Criticised as an unfeeling free-marketeer, Mr Lacalle emphasises that he has
overseen important increases in social spending.
He has almost doubled the health budget to Dollars 170m (Pounds 113m) since
taking office and increased education spending by two-thirds to Dollars
300m.
His opponents say investment rates are still too low and point to a growing
trade deficit. The 1993 deficit was Dollars 679m, almost double the previous
year's. Yet according to Mr de Posadas, capital flows into the country
remain positive and little affected by the interest rate increases in the
US.
While the president can claim some victories in his campaign to modernise
the state, he has lost the most important battles - the big privatisations
and reform of social security.
Social security is Uruguay's sacred cow: the country was among the first to
introduce a welfare state and voters are keen to hold on to their
privileges. The ratio of the working population to the dependent population
is one of the lowest in the world - 1:4 or 1:5 - and the cost of supporting
the system grows yearly. Pensions and social security account for 14-15 per
cent of GDP and more than half the government budget. Because pensions are
indexed to the previous year's inflation rate, when inflation goes down it
implies a bigger burden on the treasury.
Politicians on all sides agree, though some will say so only in private,
that social security is in dire need of reform, but few will court
unpopularity to push it through.
On this issue, the government has now thrown in the towel. 'The only thing
we've really given up on is the social security reform,' says Mr de Posadas.
The government has made four attempts to get congressional approval for an
overhaul of the system, but succeeded only in making minor adjustments.
Mr Lacalle insists that this is an issue that will not go away. Whoever
succeeds him will have to adopt the policies he has struggled to implement.
'The next government will have to tackle this issue. If the trend continues,
it will become unbearable by 1996-97.'

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Starship Enterprise, the spaceship that boldly went where no one had gone
before in the television series Star Trek, was yesterday laid up on planet
Earth after a decision by its owner to end its weekly forays into the
cosmos.
Paramount Communications, the US entertainment group that made the first
Star Trek series and its sequel, Star Trek: The Next Generation, has
cancelled the television series because it believes it can make more money
out of the concept by reserving it for blockbuster movies.
Star Trek has been one of the most successful programmes in television
history. The first series - a low-budget affair with wobbly scenery and
unconvincing special effects - ran for only 79 episodes between 1966 and
1969, but it built up a cult following that spread its popularity around the
world and gave rise to almost incessant re-runs.
In 1987 Paramount launched Star Trek: The Next Generation, a new series
based on the original concept but featuring high-technology special effects
and a new cast.
Some Star Trek fans were disappointed by the politically correct tenor of
the new series. While the crew of the original Starship Enterprise tried
hard to be open-minded about civilisations differing from their own, they
could usually be relied on to fail, blasting non-conforming species into
annihilation.
In contrast, the crew of the Next Generation's Enterprise seemed all too
understanding.
Even so, the Next Generation succeeded in becoming one of the most-watched
programmes on US television, drawing a regular audience of about 30m.
It was also one of Paramount's biggest money makers.
The last episode, a two-hour special entitled 'All Good Things  ..' brought
the 178-episode series to an end on Monday night

FT  25 MAY 94 / Japanese try to block Antarctic whaling ban: Quotas in
limited sanctuary area proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has sought to block a comprehensive whale sanctuary for the Antarctic
Ocean by proposing a partial ban in a more limited area.
The sanctuary is the main topic of debate at the annual meeting of the
International Whaling Commission, held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and a
vote is expected later this week.
The Japanese proposal would create a sanctuary for all but minke whales in
the Antarctic waters, which could be hunted when and if the current
moratorium on whale killings is replaced with a programme of strictly
enforced quotas for the number of whales that can be killed.
The Japanese plan was dismissed by environmentalists as a cynical ploy,
since they say minke whales are the only whales abundant enough in the
Antarctic to be of commercial interest. 'The majority of the Commissioners
see this for what it is,' said Mr Mike Sutton, vice-president at World Wide
Fund For Nature. 'This does not create a sanctuary at all.'
The Japanese amendment came as support for a complete ban on whaling
covering all of Antarctica appeared to be gaining momentum, with
environmentalists confident that they would obtain the necessary
three-quarters support of the 40 member countries of the International
Whaling Commission.
France has proposed that all commercial whaling be prohibited south of 40
degrees latitude. Chile has offered an amendment that would reduce the size
of the sanctuary so it would not infringe its own waters. The Chile
amendment accepts almost all of the sanctuary proposed by France and appears
acceptable to many member countries.
Commercial whaling is currently prohibited under an eight-year moratorium,
although it is violated by Norway.
The Japanese and Norwegians believe the moratorium should be replaced by
quotas, set so as not to endanger population levels of whale species. The
Japanese and Norwegians are generally supported by some Caribbean countries
and south Pacific states.
The US is expected to submit a resolution that would expressly prohibit
individual countries using sustainable quotas calculated by the Scientific
Committee of the Whaling Commission to justify unilateral hunting. The US
and other member countries say the quotas should only be adopted when a
comprehensive programme is in place that permits observation and inspection
of whale hunters.
Some environmentalists are concerned that the information on which quotas
are calculated may be faulty. Earlier this year it was reported that the
former Soviet Union had under-reported the amount of whales it killed.
The scientific committee of the whaling commission said its models can cope
with misreporting of catches of up to 50 per cent each year. It said that if
misreporting was greater than 50 per cent further trials would be necessary.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Japan offers limited sanctuary for whales: Compromise aimed
at averting Antarctic ban
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PUERTO VALLARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan, faced with a possible ban on whaling in its traditional South Sea
hunting grounds, has countered with a compromise proposal to establish a
whale sanctuary in part of the Antarctic Ocean, Reuter reports from Puerto
Vallarta.
Japan presented its plan to the International Whaling Commission's annual
conference held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, as an alternative to a French
proposal to create a no-hunting zone covering all of Antarctica and
stretching halfway to the equator.
The French proposal needs the support of three-quarters of the approximately
40 commission member nations attending the five-day meeting if it is to be
adopted.
Delegates and observers predicted the vote, expected later in the week,
would be close.
The Japanese plan would eventually allow whalers to capture up to 4,000
minke whales in the seas outside the sanctuary once the commission
establishes a scheme to regulate and monitor the hunt.
Minke whales have survived in greater numbers than other whales because,
although they are larger than elephants, they are smaller than the great
whales and were consequently hunted less in previous decades.
The whaling commission estimates there are 760,000 minke whales, but it has
imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling for the past eight years pending
the passage of the so-called Revised Management Plan.
Despite the ban, Japanese whalers are permitted by the commission to capture
up to 330 minke whales in the Antarctic under a 12-year research programme.
The whale meat eventually ends up in Japanese markets, where it fetches
Dollars 50 a pound.
Norway, which protested against the moratorium, resumed commercial whaling
last year and killed more than 200 whales.
The current situation frustrates environmental groups and other opponents of
the whale hunt as well as whalers, who accuse the whaling commission of
taking up animal rights and neglecting its original mandate to regulate
whaling.
'Our proposal provides a scientific basis for a sanctuary,' said Mr Kazuo
Shima, head of Japan's delegation to the commission.
Supporters of the French plan to create a giant whale sanctuary in the
Antarctic said on Monday that they had lined up nearly all the votes they
needed.
'We're pretty sure of 18 or 19 votes, and another four or five look good,'
said Ms Cassandra Phillips, an Antarctic specialist with the environmental
organisation, WWF World Wide Fund for Nature. 'On the whole, we're pretty
optimistic.'
Ms Phillips said around 21 votes would be needed to overcome the votes of
seven IWC members expected to oppose the proposal.
Environmental groups accuse Japan of buying the votes of its whaling
commission allies, mostly poor Caribbean and South Pacific states with no
whaling industries, with aid.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Cotton supply crisis alarms Beijing: Tony Walker reports on
how the boll worm threatens thousands of jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's political leaders are being obliged to take seriously a cotton
supply crisis that has forced a slowdown in production or closure of dozens
of textile mills and is threatening the livelihood of thousands of employees
in the textile sector - one of the country's biggest employers.
Such is the concern that Mr Zhu Rongji, China's senior vice premier in
charge of the economy, in meetings with provincial officials recently
identified countering the disastrous drop in cotton production as a main
priority for the government.
People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reported this month that the
crisis was particularly severe in central Henan province, which is both a
big producer and consumer of cotton. Disorderly markets are affecting the
textile sector throughout the country.
China's legal daily newspaper yesterday identified another serious problem
facing the textile industry. It quoted a government survey which showed that
in 220 large state cotton mills, the quality of cotton supplied had
droppeddramatically over the past year or so.
'That in such a short period of time, the quality of cotton should drop to
such a degree is unprecedented,' the paper said.
China's experiment with pilot free markets in two provinces and the
decentralisation of cotton marketing nationwide - cotton is the one
commodity whose supply and price is still controlled - appears to have
failed, and the authorities have moved to re-assert central control.
In Wuhan in central Hubei province, the city's No 1 Cotton Mill, one of
China's most modern mills, is beset by chronic supply problems. Its manager,
Mr Zhang Bao Xin, says he is never certain from one week to the next whether
it will be possible to maintain production.
In Sichuan province in the south-west of the country, one third of cotton
mills have been closed because of lack of supply, according to newspaper
reports. This touches the issue of labour unrest in the provinces, which is
also of concern to Mr Zhu.
Consumers are facing difficulties on two fronts: first, domestic production
is flagging because of cotton disease in its northern producing areas, and
second, prices are high internationally.
The price has rocketed from some 52 cents a pound last year to the present
price of about 80 cents a pound. Poor crops in India, Pakistan and China are
forcing the price up.
People's Daily, under a headline 'Where on earth has the cotton gone?'
reported a widespread leakage into the open market of cotton earmarked for
textile mills from state warehouses.
The newspaper did not allege directly that corruption among state officials
had caused supply problems, but hard-pressed textile factory managers are in
no doubt that unscrupulous officials are profiting personally from the
worsening shortage.
Mr Zhang of the Wuhan No 1 Cotton Mill called for a freeing of the cotton
market to enable 'fair competition' for scarce supplies. He described his
dealings with the provincial supply depot which operates under the Ministry
of Internal Trade as a source of 'daily frustration and daily anger'.
He said officials of the local 'Cotton and Jute Corporation' were
'overlords' of the cotton trade.
The problems can be traced most immediately to the slide in land planted to
cotton. In 1993, about 5m hectares were planted, compared with 6.5m hectares
two years earlier.
That in turn had a big impact on production, with 3.7m tonnes harvested last
year, compared with 5.6m tonnes in 1991.
Infestation - especially in the northern regions which account for about 75
per cent of production - of the cotton boll worm (no relation to the weevil)
has been one of the main causes of lost cotton acreage.
Farmers have been turning to grain and soya beans to avoid the risk of
losing all to this worm, which is reportedly beyond the control of
pesticides.
Estimates of land sown to cotton this year are around the same as 1993;
although Xinjiang in China's far west is continuing to extend areas under
cotton by about 17 per cent a year. Xinjiang expects to plant about 670,000
hectares this year.
Chinese officials have until now been loath to admit the extent of the
crisis and have not been beyond inflating production figures. Western
agricultural attaches say attempts to paint a 'rosy picture' of cotton
production reflect concerns that the extent of the debacle might serve to
add further to pressures on international cotton prices.
The crisis is certain to be fuelling discussion in Beijing about alternative
ways of bringing order to the market and ensuring adequate supplies to the
textile sector, one of China's main exporters.
In the longer term the establishment of a genuine free market would seem to
be the best solution, but in the meantime, and with demand far outstripping
supply, the authorities need to find ways of encouraging farmers to sow
greater areas.
If China is to maintain its output of textiles, it would seem to have little
choice but to begin increasing imports.

FT  25 MAY 94 / South Yemenis vow to resist

Political leaders in south Yemen yesterday acknowledged that north Yemeni
forces had made military gains, but vowed to resist further encroachments by
the government of General Ali Abdullah Saleh.
They said their forces were being consolidated in preparation for a counter
offensive against Gen Saleh's regime.
Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh, president of the newly announced Democratic Republic
of Yemen, conceded on Monday that northern forces had captured the strategic
town of Ataq, in Shabwa province 300km north east of Aden.
But he said that irregular forces in the region could be expected to contain
any further northern advances from the town. That view was supported by Mr
Abdul Rahman Ali al-Jifri, vice-president of the new republic. Mr Jifri, who
represents Shabwa in the five-man presidential council, said that guerrilla
forces were being mobilised and would start a counter-offensive within days.
Both leaders flatly rejected the idea that Gen Saleh's forces would be able
to take Aden, stronghold of the south. Mr Beidh claimed on Monday that
southern forces were still in control of al-Anad, a key defensive position
60km to the north of Aden. Al-Anad - the name means 'stubborn' - has seen
intensive fighting for the past week, with both northern and southern
leaders claiming victory.
Southern officers said they had staged a tactical withdrawal from al-Anad on
Sunday, luring northern forces from the nearby mountains and shelling them
with heavy artillery as they entered the 500 sq km camp. Journalists who
visited the battle scene yesterday confirmed that northern forces had still
not secured al-Anad and that fighting continued around it.
Other southern leaders said that mistrust of the Yemen Socialist party,
which ruled the south for 23 years after independence from Britain, had
prevented formation of a united front against the north. This however, had
changed in the past week with reassurances from the socialists about
power-sharing and formation of a coalition government.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Japanese bank governor sees growth barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday several
negative factors threatened to impede the country's economic recovery.
Speaking to the house of representatives' budget committee, Mr Mieno cited
trade frictions with the US, the accompanying rise in the value of the yen,
corporate balance sheet adjustment and the pace of labour-shedding as
factors that might weaken the upturn.
But the governor said the foundations for economic recovery were being laid,
largely as a result of stock adjustment, company restructuring and the
effects of past fiscal and monetary policy.
The strong performance in certain overseas markets, in particular the US,
gave added grounds for optimism. He said the central bank would continue to
monitor economic conditions closely to determine whether the small glimmers
of recovery appeared to be spreading.
The remarks did nothing to dispel growing market speculation that another
cut in official interest rates is in the offing. In the last fortnight, the
bank has allowed key money market rates to fall. Overnight interest rates
have dropped by one fifth of a percentage point and now stand at a fraction
over 2 per cent.
But the bank has so far baulked at a cut in the more symbolically important
official discount rate from its current all-time low of 1.75 per cent.
Such a move would send a much clearer signal of a looser monetary policy to
financial markets, something the bank has been anxious to avoid, opting
instead for a policy of easing by stealth.
Many analysts believe the markets have now discounted a cut in official
interest rates, and this has helped relieve some of the upward pressure on
the yen.
If the bank fails to cut rates as expected, the pressure on the Japanese
currency is likely to revive, threatening again to push it through the Y100
to the dollar level.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Mandela pleases business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Such has been the revolution in the economic rhetoric of the African
National Congress that President Nelson Mandela might have drawn yesterday's
state of the nation address to the multi-racial parliament from a textbook
on financial and fiscal orthodoxy.
It has come more likely, however, from the pen of Finance Minister Derek
Keys, source of all orthodoxy in the previous National party government, and
now trusted adviser to Mr Mandela.
Gone are the days when ANC leaders sent markets into hysterics with comments
about repudiating debt or nationalising industry. In the words of one
leading businessman, 'they sound more and more like Tories all the time'.
Given that the speech seems to have been aimed primarily at calming white
fears and reassuring overseas investors - far more than at the domestic
constituency, which was promised little of concrete substance - it is
scarcely surprising that the business community reacted well.
The credibility and cost of the government's Reconstruction and Development
Programme can only be tested over time. But it is hard to fault its
intentions, as outlined in yesterday's speech: over the five year span of
the RDP, government consumption expenditure will be held at constant levels
in real terms and the budget deficit will continue to decline from last
year's levels of 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product; some R2.5bn (Pounds
450M) will be dedicated to the RDP in the first budget, to be unveiled on
June 22, but this will come entirely from rationalising and redirecting
government expenditure, not from additional borrowing or a rise in general
taxation. Though there could be a temporary rise in taxation in later years,
Mr Mandela committed himself to avoid a 'permanently higher general level of
taxation'.
The catalogue of prudent commitments is long. Monetary policy will remain on
its recent steady course (and Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals will remain
in his post to ensure that it does); the battle to cut inflation will
continue; the private sector will play a central role in generating growth
and government will create an investment climate conducive to new
investment.
No one knows whether these commitments will survive the pressure to deliver
on the RDP's promises, which include building 1m new houses over the next
five years, and supplying electricity to 2.5m more among a host of other
social service improvements. But Mr Mandela's approach appears to be both
cautious and gradual: saving R2.5bn on the first year's budget will be
difficult but probably not impossible, and is far more realistic than
earlier estimates. Minister Keys says it represents 3 per cent of the
budget, which can be covered by the current attrition rate in the civil
service.
Further productivity improvements in the civil service to fund a government
commitment rising to R10bn in the fifth year of the programme (a cumulative
commitment of some R37bn over five years) is likely to prove far more
difficult. Mr Mandela has promised to protect white civil servants' jobs
while at the same time advancing blacks through the service and the cost of
nine new provincial bureaucracies will further burden central government.
Furthermore, ANC ministers seem to have unrealistic expectations of the
speed with which the government's efficiency can be improved.
But Mr Keys seems content to let the new government learn its own lessons
about feasibility. He suggested yesterday that Minister without Portfolio
Jay Naidoo, charged with implementing the RDP, would find it nearly
impossible to spend the R2.5bn allocated in the forthcoming budget, and this
would temper demands for further funds in subsequent years.
Ultimately, Mr Mandela may face the prospect of breaking promises to his
people, or busting through deficit barriers.

About 200 Moslems have died in a stampede during the annual haj pilgrimage
to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, Reuter reports from Dubai.
The deaths occurred on Monday during a ritual in which pilgrims go to Mina,
15km from Mecca, to throw stones at three piles of rocks which symbolise the
devil. It was not clear what triggered the stampede. Most victims were said
to be from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Africa.
The official Saudi press agency quoted the Ministry of Health as saying 829
pilgrims had died during the haj of old age, heart ailments and other
causes, including an unspecified number killed by 'intense crowding'.
This year's haj has also seen confrontations between the Saudi authorities,
who ban all political activity at the pilgrimage, and Iranians determined to
hold political rallies.

FT  25 MAY 94 / UN finds Rwandan haemorrhage unstaunchable: Leslie Crawford
on few hopes of an end to the massacre of civilians on the day UN envoy
flies into Kigali
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A special UN envoy was flown into the eye of the Rwandan storm yesterday
with a mission to broker a ceasefire between government and rebel troops
that could bring an end to the indiscriminate massacre of civilians in
Rwanda.
Tutsi rebels and the Hutu army continued to fight for control of the
capital, Kigali, as Mr Iqbal Riza, the UN envoy, tried to reach a central
hotel for talks with representatives of the Rwandan government. A truce
agreed between rebels and the army for the duration of Mr Riza's visit
collapsed on Monday.
However, Reuter reported out of Kigali yesterday afternoon that UN officials
had said bombardments of the centre of the city halted just before Mr Riza
arrived. But sporadic mortar bomb blasts and clashes between rebel and
government troops shook other areas of the capital.
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) guerrillas control the airport and outskirts
of the capital, while the city centre is held by the army or Hutu militias.
Mr Riza is trying to negotiate conditions under which a 5,500-strong UN
force would be allowed to enter Rwanda to protect civilians and deliver
humanitarian aid.
The ethnic bloodbath in Rwanda, sparked by President Juvenal Habyarimana's
death in an air crash seven weeks ago, has claimed the lives of half a
million people, most of them members of the minority Tutsi tribe, according
to aid agencies. More than 1m people - an eighth of the population - are
estimated to be displaced and in need of food, medical aid, and protection
from gangs of murderers who still roam the countryside.
Tens of thousands of decomposing corpses from Rwanda's killing fields have
been washed into Lake Victoria. Authorities in neighbouring Uganda fear the
outbreak of disease in the districts bordering the lake. They say they have
buried more than 27,000 corpses in mass graves.
The Rwandan mission ordered by the UN Security Council last week faces
several immediate problems. No country has yet volunteered troops, though
Italy's defence minister said on Monday his country would be willing to do
so.
The UN has not spelled out how it is to secure safe havens for civilians and
deliver humanitarian assistance in the midst of the civil war. Without a
ceasefire and negotiations to halt the slaughter, many believe the UN's
presence in Rwanda would be futile.
Having withdrawn its peace-keepers when the butchery began seven weeks ago,
the UN faces charges of providing too little, too late.
In the eyes of the Tutsi-led rebel movement, the UN's reputation has been
tarnished by its decision to abandon civilian Tutsis to their fate. At the
same time, government forces accuse the UN of allowing the rebels to shelter
behind UN positions as they advance with their assault on the capital. This
may explain why the UN garrison in Kigali came under fire this week.
Sandwiched between the warring parties, the UN forces in Rwanda, like their
ill-fated colleagues in Somalia, risk losing their neutrality, and therefore
their effectiveness.
Both the Rwandan army and the RPF have said they would fire upon UN troops
if they got in the way of the fighting.
Australia was yesterday the latest country to decline a UN request for
specialist troops, including engineers, signallers and medical teams, saying
it would not send soldiers to Rwanda until their safety could be assured.
In Nairobi, Mr Theogen Ruvasingwa, the secretary-general of the RPF, cast
doubt on the UN's ability to alleviate the suffering in Rwanda.
'The UN's first response was to pack their bags and go. The latest UN
response has come too late,' he said. 'The UN will not be able to restore
law and order in Rwanda. That is the task of the RPF.'
Mr Ruvasingwa pledged to continue fighting until 'the machinery responsible
for the genocide in Rwanda is totally crippled'. The tardiness of the UN
response, and doubts about the effectiveness of a military intervention,
have prompted certain African nations to mediate a political solution to the
Rwandan conflict.
Tanzania, which is sheltering more than 300,000 Rwandan refugees, has twice
failed to bring the warring sides together in the past month. Plans to hold
a summit of regional heads of state next week have also been postponed,
according to Mr Shani Lweno of the Tanzanian foreign ministry.
'We are holding more consultations; there are no easy answers to the Rwandan
conflict,' Mr Lweno said yesterday.
Diplomats in the region, however, believe the RPF is unlikely to agree to a
new peace accord while it retains the military advantage.
But a rebel victory would not necessarily allow it to govern. The Tutsi-led
RPF would have difficulty imposing its rule on the majority Hutu population
in the wake of the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi civilians by
Hutu militias. Even Hutus who have not been involved in the tribal bloodbath
fear Tutsi retaliation.
Although the Rwandan conflict has the potential to destabilise neighbouring
Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda, all of which have populations of ethnic Hutus
and Tutsis, regional governments have ruled out an African military
intervention to end the conflict.
Mark Suzman adds from Johannesburg: In his state of the nation address
yesterday South Africa's President Nelson Mandela mentioned Rwanda, as well
as Angola and Mozambique, as countries where South African assistance might
help the peace process.
However defence and foreign affairs officials are known to be strongly
against military involvement in the conflict and a government press
secretary, who last week implied that South Africa was on the verge of
sending troops to Rwanda, was publicly reprimanded.

The Court of Auditors, the European Union's main financial watchdog, suffers
from 'top heavy' senior management and is not professional enough in
fighting fraud in the EU budget, Mr Jo Carey, a former UK Treasury official
and expert on EU finances, said yesterday. In evidence to the House of
Lords' European communities committee, Mr Carey criticised the EU's 'quite
unintelligible' financial controls and said the lack of accountability of
many senior officials encouraged waste. Many experts believe waste totals at
least 5 per cent of EU spending, with much of the fraud due to abuse of farm
subsidies. Mr Carey said the court's efforts to pinpoint fraud ranged from
reports akin to 'slightly haphazard investigative journalism' to documents
which were rigorously argued and 'objective and relevant to policy'.

Spain's economy and finance minister Mr Pedro Solbes indicated yesterday
that disgraced former Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio could escape a
prison sentence in connection with tax evasion. Parliamentary sources said
Mr Solbes told a private congress hearing yesterday that Mr Rubio had
apparently failed to pay Pta13m (Pounds 62,800) in tax in 1988, a total
below the Pta15m threshold which makes evaders liable to a jail term. Mr
Rubio, who was released last week on Pta15m bail after a fortnight in
prison, allegedly kept secret the profits of a portfolio account managed at
the time he was central bank governor by the failed Banco Ibercorp. Mr
Solbes told the legislators that an intitial investigation into Ibercorp, a
financial group which managed the assets of wealthy and fashionable
Spaniards, had uncovered a complicated network of shell companies that
masked the identities of its clients and the nature of their investments.

Italy's state airline plans to cut up to 3,500 office and ground staff jobs
in the next four years as part of a rescue package, trade union officials
said yesterday. They said Alitalia, which lost Dollars 200m last year and a
further Dollars 110m in the first three months of 1994, aimed to lose 1,500
jobs by the end of 1995 and the rest by 1997. At present, the group employs
20,000 people.
A management report to the company's unions this week depicted the airline
as heavily overstaffed and its structure as too bureaucratic and rigid. The
managing director Mr Roberto Schisano has said the airline is in such bad
shape that without drastic action Alitalia had only 500 days to live. 'The
plan has a logic to it,' said Angelo Braggio, national secretary of the
FIT-CISL trades union. 'To leave things as they are would quite simply lead
to the airline being liquidated.' In return for backing the plan, unions
want the state to guarantee a loan of nearly Dollars 1bn to recapitalise the
airline.

<TEXT>
Austria's economy will growth at about 1.5 per cent this year, although
expansion is likely to pick up to 2.4 per cent next year, according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This follows a 0.4
per cent fall in gross domestic product in 1993. In its annual report on the
Austrian economy, published yesterday, the OECD said sluggish recovery among
principal European trading partners was likely to limit the scale of the
upturn. Additionally, Austrian exports are forecast to lose market share
abroad as a result of the delayed effect on competitiveness of the
appreciation of the schilling. The recovery of corporate investment will
probably remain weak, the OECD said. Although a stimulus to business
investment should come from further interest rate cuts and corporate tax
reform, the impact might take time to come through. The OECD forecasts
inflation as measured by the GDP price deflator will fall to 2.8 per cent
this year and 2.4 per cent in 1995 from 3.7 per cent in 1993.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Privatisation to devastate jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation in Europe could cost more than 800,000 jobs by 1999 as
sheltered nationalised industries face tougher competition, a study by six
European economic research institutes warns today. The Ereco network of
research institutes says that more than 120 companies in the European Union
and the European Free Trade Association, employing more than 3.5m people and
with annual sales of Ecu400bn (Pounds 308bn), are candidates for
privatisation. Ereco's forecast suggests more than one in five of the labour
force in these companies will lose their jobs. The job losses would be
concentrated in France, where 290,000 are expected to go, while Italy would
lose 180,000 and Germany 140,000. Many jobs will disappear in
telecommunications, an estimated 268,000, followed by energy (250,000) and
transport (77,000).
The Ereco estimates are based on Britain's experience of privatisation and
subsequent corporate restructuring. UK privatised industries including
British Telecom, British Gas, British Airways, British Steel and the
electricity supply companies shed more than 300,000 jobs in the 1980s. It
predicts that more than 1.1m jobs could be lost if restructuring is
especially severe. But 'perhaps only 500,000 jobs will be shed' if output
growth turns out to be particularly strong in the newly privatised
industries or if governments take action to save jobs.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Danish inflation reaches 2.1%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong recovery under way in the Danish economy was reflected in a
significant increase in consumer prices in April. The index rose by 0.4 per
cent from March and by 2.1 per cent from April of last year. In the 12
months to April 1993 prices increased by only 1.1 per cent. The increase
over the past 12 months, however, has been predicted by the government,
which expects consumer prices in 1994 to increase 2.0 per cent from last
year. This compares with an increase of 1.2 per cent from 1992-3. The
government last week adjusted its economic forecasts upwards, predicting an
increase in GDP of 4.0 per cent this year, with private consumption to rise
by 4.8 per cent and business investment by 10.4 per cent in constant price
terms. The strong growth is expected to continue in 1995, the government
said. Hillary Barnes, Copenhagen.
Inflation in the European Union was 3.2 per cent a year in April, unchanged
from March, but marginally down from the 3.4 per cent rate a year earlier,
according to Eurostat, the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Italy's merchandise trade account with other EU countries saw a surplus of
L1,026bn in February compared with a surplus of L506bn in February 1993, the
Italian statistical agency, Istat, reported yesterday. It also reported
March industrial output 0.7 per cent higher than March 1993.

FT  25 MAY 94 / France and Balladur, on recovery road: David Buchan on clear
signs of an economic and popularity pick-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur now has something more sustaining to buoy him up than
the traditional bark cigarettes and fermented manioc he had to smoke and
drink last weekend with French Guyana Indians on an improbable European
election swing through France's territories in the New World.
On his return he found confirmation both of the recent recovery in his
popularity in a Journal du Dimanche poll - which showed 47 per cent of
French people were 'satisfied' with him as prime minister as against 44 per
cent who were 'discontented' - and of the recent pick-up in the French
economy.
The lesson which Mr Balladur will almost certainly draw from this is that
his best bet for the presidential election next year is to sit tight
politically, avoid a repeat of his controversial education and labour market
reforms of earlier this spring, and count on economic recovery to continue
steadily into 1995.
Insee, the government statistics agency, said last week it had enough
evidence in from industrialists' order books and investment intentions, and
from consumers' car and house purchases, to predict a 0.9 per cent growth in
the first half of this year. Even in the unlikely event that the recovery
flattened out entirely in the second half of the year, the 'carry-over'
effect of this spring recovery would still give the country year-on-year
average growth of 1.3 per cent over 1993.
Insee provided still greater psychological comfort by scrapping its gloomy
forecast of last Christmas that France's record 12.2 per cent jobless rate
would be half a percentage point higher still by mid-1994. The agency noted
that the service sector in France was at last performing as in most other
advanced post-industrial societies by hiring enough people to absorb job
losses in manufacturing and newcomers on to the labour market.
Non-agricultural employment rose by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of
1994.
There are other signs that French companies and households are shaking off
their hesitancy about the future.
After cutting spending on new plant and equipment by 17 per cent last year,
company managers have told Insee and the Bank of France in repeated surveys
that this year they intend to increase investment by up to 2 per cent
globally.
They need to do this - not to expand capacity (only 80.6 per cent of which
was used in the first quarter of this year) but to modernise it. Low
domestic inflation and demand, coupled with improved terms of trade, more
than offset last year's 5 per cent appreciation of the franc against the
weighted average of the currencies of its six leading European partners, and
gave France a FFr90bn (Pounds 10.5bn) trade surplus in 1993.
But as Europe came off the top of the German reunification boom, capital
spending fell successively in France in 1991-93. 'Only a powerful revival in
investment', a recent Paribas bank report claimed, 'is capable of enabling
France to hang on to the benefits of the structural improvement in its trade
balance.'
Few French companies will need to go to the banks to fund new investment.
Their rate of self-financing has risen from 95.6 per cent of their needs in
1991 to 121 per cent last year.
As in the case of companies, it has not been chiefly shortage of cash or
credit that has inhibited French households from spending more. Most indeed
are net creditors, a fact that perversely puts less rather than more money
in their hands as banks cut rates and so reduce their interest income. It is
fear of unemployment that has so depressed household consumption.
By allowing companies to keep real wages virtually static and by forcing the
government to raise more money to pay for high social security expenditure,
the jobs crisis has meant little rise in disposable income. People have also
been putting more of it into 'precautionary saving'.
This is why the Insee judgment that unemployment may now have stabilised may
be important in persuading the French to save less and spend more. In
response to specific government incentives, they are already spending more
on new cars and houses this year. But the economics ministry is forecasting
a more general improvement, with a 0.8 per cent rise in household
consumption largely funded out of a 0.6 per cent drop in the savings rate
this year.
For a steady recovery of its economy, France needs steadiness abroad and at
home, but the second condition is nearly impossible to guarantee in the
run-up to the presidential contest next May. Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist
leader and presidential contender, predicted last week that Mr Balladur
would 'take no more risks, after his frightful climbdowns' earlier this year
on education and labour reforms. That is probably true, though last week the
government quietly liberalised the rules on Sunday opening hours for shops.
However, at the very least, the prime minister will have to settle divisions
within his own conservative majority over whether to use any elbow room in
the 1995 budget for election-year income tax cuts or for less glamorous
reductions in social welfare charges. Waiting to exploit any internal
government arguments, too, is Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR Gaullist leader,
who may not now wait much longer to announce his claim on the Elysee.

<TEXT>
New Zealand is to send 250 troops to serve under British command on
peacekeeping duties in Bosnia. This is the country's biggest commitment of
military personnel to a combat zone since World War Two. The government is
believed to have been reluctant to send the troops, but felt obliged to do
so as it was chairman of the Security Council when the decision was taken to
step up the UN peacekeeping role in Bosnia. The force will serve for six
months and then be replaced by another company.
Many MPs are known to be privately concerned at the development, although
only the leader of the Alliance party, Mr Jim Anderton, spoke against it in
parliament when the decision was announced. The foreign minister Mr Don
McKinnon said earlier this year that New Zealand should not be drawn into
another European war, but he supported the move yesterday saying it was in
line with New Zealand's membership of the Security Council.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Sale of Ina likely to raise at least L4,500bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian state should raise at least L4,500bn (Pounds 1.9bn) through the
sale of up to 51 per cent of Ina, the state-owned insurer, at the end of
next month. It will be the largest privatisation yet attempted in Italy, and
the first under the new government.
The Italian treasury, which owns 100 per cent of Ina, announced yesterday
the offer would begin on June 27, and shares would be priced at between
L2,200 and L2,700 each, valuing the whole company at L8,800bn-L10,800bn.
The terms of the sell-off include safeguards for small shareholders,
following criticism that ordinary investors' interests were neglected in
previous privatisations. The same tactic may now be adopted for future
privatisations, such as that of Stet, the telecommunications group, and
Enel, the electricity company, which are due over the next 18 months.
Single institutional shareholders in Ina will be unable to buy more than 2
per cent in the issue itself. That stake can be increased to 5 per cent with
subsequent purchases on the market. But the shares of investors already
linked through the shareholder voting syndicates of other Italian companies
will be treated as a single holding.
The measure should prevent close allies from building up effective control,
circumventing the ceiling on share stakes. That happened earlier this year
following the sale of the state-controlled banks, Credito Italiano and Banca
Commerciale Italiana (BCI).
The treasury has also approved a special system for electing the first
directors after privatisation. Under the scheme, a certain number of seats
on the board will be reserved for directors nominated by small shareholders.
The double system of protection was agreed by Mr Lamberto Dini, the new
treasury minister and former central banker, and his colleagues Mr Vito
Gnutti at the industry ministry and Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget
minister. This same trio would guide the Stet and Enel sales. Both Mr Gnutti
and Mr Pagliarini are members of the Northern League, which has been sharply
critical of the dominance achieved by allies of Mediobanca, the Milan
merchant bank, on the boards of Credito Italiano and BCI.
Imi of Italy and Goldman Sachs are acting as global co-ordinators of the
issue, which will be launched in Italy and internationally. A certain
proportion of the issue will be reserved for former shareholders in Ina's
subsidiary Assitalia, the group's employees, agents, and policyholders.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Inflation rate edges down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The immediate outlook for inflation in west Germany has improved further
this month, although long-term prospects are still clouded by rapid
expansion in money supply, writes Christopher Parkes.
Consumer prices in North-Rhine Westphalia, the region's most populous state,
rose at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in the month to mid-May, down from 3
per cent in April, according to new figures. Inflation in Baden-Wurttemberg
was unchanged at 3.1 per cent.
The figures supported economists' forecasts of an annual rate for west
Germany of 3 per cent at most, after 3.1 per cent in April.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's favoured indicator for potential inflation, the
M3 measure of money supply, continued to exceed forecasts and the bank's 4-6
per cent target range for growth with a 15.8 per cent annualised increase
during April. The bank said part of the reason was its handing over to the
government of DM18.3bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in 1993 profits. It also singled out
private sector lending as a factor.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Kravchuk vents anger over Crimea
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's president, yesterday lashed out at his Russian
counterpart, Mr Boris Yeltsin, accusing him of fomenting separatist tensions
in Crimea.
'A president can only issue warnings to his own government bodies and
ministers and not to the presidents of other countries,' Mr Kravchuk said,
condemning Mr Yeltsin in an address to veterans in Kiev.
He blamed Mr Yeltsin's advisers for aggravating tension and accused the
Russian media of spreading 'rabid and dishonest' information about Crimea,
where the local parliament has restored a 1992 constitution denounced by the
Kiev authorities as an initial step to secession. 'This is a serious
question because we do not accept state level attacks on neighbours with
whom we want long-term friendly and equal relations, not just for a single
day,' he said.
Mr Kravchuk adopted a more peaceful stance in a meeting with Mr Douglas
Hurd, UK foreign secretary. 'We have no intention of using force. I'd like
to stress that,' he told Mr Hurd, adding that he hoped foreign support for
Ukraine and its territorial integrity would continue.
Since the Crimean parliament restored its 1992 constitution last Friday new
troubles have erupted between the Russian-dominated peninsula region and
Ukraine's central authorities. Kiev's parliament has issued a Monday
deadline for Crimea to rescind its constitution and there have been rumours
of increased military activity on the peninsula.
Local militia are guarding the parliament building and broadcast centre in
the Crimean capital.
Simultaneous negotiations in Moscow and Kiev have failed to resolve the
standoff. In Kiev, talks with Crimean politicians concluded unsuccessfully
yesterday. Crimean MPs refused to withdraw their assertive constitution, but
did agree to establish joint commissions with Ukraine for further
discussions on issues such as economic policy.
In Moscow, the Russian, Crimean and Ukrainian prime ministers held parallel
talks on dividing the Black Sea fleet, based at the Crimean port of
Sevastopol. The talks were said last night to have produced an outline
agreement on basing the Russian and Ukrainian fleets in separate ports.
Negotiations are expected to resume today.
The official Tass news agency reported that a 'joint document was ready to
sign after a final agreement had been reached' between Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, and Mr Yefim Zviagilsky and Mr
Yevgeny Saburov, the Ukrainian and Crimean premiers.
The Tass report said it was expected that 'in the final document precise
conditions will be laid down for the division of the infrastructure of the
Black Sea Fleet, and also for the issue of the bases for the national
fleets'.
Unconfirmed reports suggest there is agreement in principle that the Russian
share will remain in Sevastopol - as long as it remains a Ukrainian city.
Ukraine's navy, expected to be the smaller part, is to be based in Balaclava
some 160km away, according to the Russian Information Agency.
Ukraine's foreign minister, Mr Anatoly Zlenko, is eager to seek support for
his country's position from the United Nations and other multilateral
western organisations. Britain, the US and Germany have expressed support
for Ukraine's current borders, but Mr Zlenko is pressing for a 'broader
statement' that would show that the international community shows a clear
understanding of 'the territorial integrity of Ukraine'.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Mood lifts in west German manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A clear improvement in business conditions during April has boosted optimism
and production plans among west German manufacturers, according to a leading
economics institute. Rising output in the chemicals sector, and a surge in
the region's first-quarter trade surplus, reported separately yesterday,
provided further evidence of economic recovery.
Findings from the Munich-based Ifo institute's latest monthly poll of
industry showed new orders rising and inventories shrinking. Some
manufacturers reported an increase in unfilled orders even though output had
been stepped up.
According to the DIW institute in Berlin, pan-German gross domestic product
showed its first real year-on-year increase for 12 months in the three
months to the end of March. DIW said most of the 1.9 per cent growth came
from an unexpected surge in private spending.
While many indicators showed the gloom lifting rapidly, the German central
bank appears anxious that expectations do not run too far ahead of reality.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said on Monday that it was
difficult to assess exactly the strength of the recovery. 'At the moment it
seems to me that the mood in business is rather better than the facts
justify,' he said.
The Ifo poll, one of Germany's most trusted economic barometers, also showed
fading optimism among wholesalers and retailers - a widely-forecast
consequence of falling real incomes.
Although negative reports still predominated among manufacturers, with
suppliers of investment goods and consumer durables clearly less satisfied
with current conditions, the institute said poll participants overall showed
'considerably strengthened' optimism on the outlook for the next six months.
Most hopes were focused on improving exports, particularly among suppliers
of semi-finished products and raw materials, which are typically among the
first to detect the onset or easing of a recession.
The VCI chemicals industry association, for example, yesterday reported a
3.6 per cent rise in output from west German factories in the first quarter.
A 6.5 per cent increase in foreign demand more than offset a 2.6 per cent
decline in the home market, although prices continued to fall. The
association said it expected increasing momentum from markets outside
Germany, but no significant growth at home.
Strengthening exports showed up in a pan-German trade surplus for the first
three months of DM19bn (Pounds 7.6bn), compared with DM9bn in the comparable
part of last year.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Russians agree to join peace partnership
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, ended months of
uncertainty last night by saying his country would join Partnership for
Peace, the military co-operation project designed by Nato.
The general said a Russian agreement to join the programme, which brings
together Nato and its erstwhile enemies, should be supplemented by broader
statements about Moscow's relationship with the alliance.
But in contrast with previous Russian pronouncements, including a statement
from the general earlier yesterday, the minister said there were no formal
preconditions for entry into the partnership.
'President Boris Yeltsin has authorised me to make it clear that Russia will
join the Partnership for Peace', the general said after briefing his western
counterparts on Russia's new military doctrine.
He said the framework agreement for joining the partnership, which Russia
will now follow at least 20 other countries in signing, did not fully set
out the principles that should underlie Russia-Nato co-operation.
But General Grachev, in one of the most conciliatory statements made towards
Nato by a Russian official this year, said it would be 'incorrect and
wrongly understood' if Moscow set out formal terms.
Western diplomats said they now expected Russia to sign up in late June or
early July. This could pave the way for an appearance by President Yeltsin
as a guest or participant at the Group of Seven summit in Naples.
Russia has baulked at the idea of signing up to the partnership on the same
terms as its satellites. It has insisted that its co-operation with the
alliance should recognise Russia's status as a great power. Before the
general's arrival, Nato defence ministers agreed they might issue a
reassuring political declaration about relations with Russia but there could
be no question of any supplementary treaty.
The ministers also firmly agreed that Russia would not be allowed any veto
over the activities of Nato or the partnership in the smaller countries of
eastern Europe. Several prominent Russian politicians have demanded such a
veto.
Diplomats said yesterday's deliberations were unlikely fully to address the
fears of the east European states, which are nervous about any Russian
participation in European security arrangements.
The general said he will set out his views on the partnership in greater
detail today at a meeting that will also be attended by defence ministers
from the smaller east European nations.
Western diplomats welcomed the fact that General Grachev will be speaking to
an audience that includes those countries which are most anxious about
Russia's intentions.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Milan judge yesterday ordered leading members of Italy's old political and
business regime and one prominent representative of the new ruling class -
Mr Umberto Bossi of the Northern League - to stand trial, charged with
breaking the law on the financing of political parties.
The accused are alleged to have been involved in the 'mother of all bribes',
the L150bn (Pounds 62.7m) paid out to permit the Ferruzzi-Montedison
industrial group to withdraw from Enimont, its ill-fated joint venture with
Eni, the state-owned chemicals and energy group, in 1990. The trial will
begin on July 5.
Mr Bossi, whose Northern League is one of three main parties in the new
Italian government, will stand trial because his party is alleged to have
received payments from Ferruzzi. Apart from him and one regional League
organiser, the other 30 names on the list of people sent for trial are drawn
from the upper echelons of the discredited old regime.
Among them are former party secretaries of the pentapartito, the five
political parties which shared power in Italy from the end of the second
world war until the corruption scandal began to break two years ago. They
include two ex-prime ministers, Mr Bettino Craxi of the Socialist party, and
Mr Arnaldo Forlani, of the Christian Democrats. Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the
Milan prosecutor who is Italy's best-known magistrate and one of the most
popular figures in the country, formally requested the trial of 37 people at
the end of last month.
Yesterday's decision by Judge Italo Ghitti to agree 32 of those requests
should provide Italians with the next instalment in the judicial soap opera
which began last year with the trial of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial
consultant to Ferruzzi-Montedison.
After a grandstanding performance by Mr Di Pietro as prosecutor, much of it
televised, Mr Cusani was sentenced to eight years in jail last month for
corruption and falsifying accounts. Magistrates deliberately pressed for Mr
Cusani to be tried first, because they believed his trial would bring to
light allegations against more senior political and business figures. Mr
Craxi, probably the most prominent of those accused, again failed to hand in
his passport to magistrates yesterday, in spite of increasing pressure to do
so. He is thought to be in Tunisia. Judge Ghitti yesterday refused to accept
the pleas of his lawyer that the former prime minister was too ill to
travel.
Also sent for trial were Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino, a former budget minister,
and Mr Gianni De Michelis, former foreign minister. Mr Giuseppe Garofano,
former chairman of Montedison, and Mr Carlo Sama, former managing director
of Montedison, will also be tried for falsifying accounts.

FT  25 MAY 94 / 800,000 jobs on the line in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation in Europe could cost more than 800,000 jobs by the end of 1998
as previously sheltered nationalised industries face up to tougher
competition, a joint study by six European economic research institutes
warns today.
The Ereco network of research institutes says that more than 120 companies
in the European Union and the European Free Trade Area, employing more than
3.5m people and with annual sales of Ecu400bn (Pounds 308bn), are candidates
for privatisation. Ereco's forecast suggests more than one in five of the
present labour force in these companies will lose their jobs.
The expected job losses in the period from 1992 to 1998 are concentrated in
France, where 290,000 are expected to go, Italy (180,000) and Germany
(140,000). The heaviest concentration of labour shedding is expected in the
telecommunications sector, where an estimated 268,000 jobs will be lost,
followed by energy (250,000) and transport (77,000).
The Ereco estimates are based on Britain's experience of privatisation and
subsequent corporate restructuring. Five UK privatised industries - British
Telecom, British Gas, British Airways, British Steel and the electricity
supply companies - shed more than 300,000 jobs in the 1980s. The Ereco
report comments: 'The scope of the new privatisation programmes across the
whole of Europe in the 1990s threatens to dwarf this in its employment
impact.'
It predicts that more than 1.1m jobs could be lost if restructuring is
especially severe. Much will depend on how far governments press for
deregulation and market liberalisation in the telecoms and energy sectors.
But 'perhaps only 500,000 jobs will be shed' if output growth turns out to
be particularly strong in the newly privatised industries or if governments
take action to prevent the full employment implications of privatisation
from working through. The report warns, however, that mounting competition
and the reduced opportunity for states to intervene to protect national
champions mean that eventual job losses, totalling about 800,000, are
unlikely to be postponed for long.
Ereco expects privatisation in Europe to become a big political issue. There
will be doubts whether some governments have the political strength to go
ahead with privatisation at a time of high unemployment. However, the poor
budgetary positions of most European states make the revenues from
privatisation very attractive.

Wirtschaftsforschung, Germany; BIPE Conseil, France; Prometeia, Italy; NEI,

FT  25 MAY 94 / Moscow plans to cut duties on oil exports by half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia plans to halve duties on oil exports following Monday's removal of
oil export quotas, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for
economics, announced yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. President
Boris Yeltsin is also on the verge of issuing a new decree with detailed
instructions enabling the state to sell off bankrupt state-owned
enterprises.
'Now we are in a transitional stage when it has become obvious that there
are no extravagant measures for stimulating economic growth,' Mr Shokhin
said, explaining the flurry of activity after four months of government
inaction. 'Now we need painstaking work to create market mechanisms.'
The impact of the various measures is likely to be uneven. Foreign oil
companies, which have been complaining about high taxation, say that
congestion of Russian pipelines and ports means that exports are unlikely to
increase substantially in the near future despite a drop in export duties
from Ecu30 (Pounds 23) a tonne to Ecu15.
But in an area of great importance for ordinary Russians, Mr Anatoly
Chubais, deputy prime minister for privatisation, said separate decrees
ushering in measures to regulate financial markets, as well as to combat
dishonest advertising by banks and financial companies, were imminent.
Mr Shokhin said they might go as far as banning any advertising promising
specific dividend payments to small investors, who have been the main
victims of extravagant promises in aggressive advertising campaigns. As
evidence, however, of the government's tendency for contradictory action, it
announced last week that it would tax banks' profits on treasury bill sales
at a time when the government is trying to widen their use to cover the
budget deficit by non-inflationary methods.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Inflation rate edges down in W Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The immediate outlook for inflation in west Germany has improved further
this month, although long-term prospects are still clouded by rapid
expansion in money supply.
Consumer prices in North-Rhine Westphalia, the region's most populous state,
rose at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in the month to mid-May, down from 3
per cent in April, according to new figures. Inflation in Baden-Wurttemberg
was unchanged at 3.1 per cent.
The figures supported economists' forecasts of an annual rate for the whole
of west Germany of 3 per cent at most, after 3.1 per cent in April.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank's favoured indicator for potential inflation, the
M3 measure of money supply, continued to exceed forecasts and the bank's 4-6
per cent target range for growth with a 15.8 per cent annualised increase
during April. Markets had been given clear advance warnings of another
inflated figure.
The Bundesbank said part of the reason was its handing over to the
government of DM18.3bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in 1993 profits. It also singled out
private sector lending as another contributory factor. Borrowing had
expanded at an annual rate of 9.5 per cent in the six months to the end of
April.
The bank once again blamed 'special factors', evident since January.
Investment uncertainties had drawn large volumes of funds into short-term
deposits (within the scope of M3) rather than long-term instruments.
Long-term investment grew DM10.3bn in April, compared with DM5.4bn a month
earlier, but, as the bank pointed out, monetary capital formation had risen
at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of only 4 per cent in the first four
months.

FT  25 MAY 94 / IBM gives its global advertising to O&amp;M
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is to give a single advertising agency,
Ogilvy &amp; Mather, all its advertising around the world, in one of the largest
account moves in advertising history.
IBM, which currently uses more than 40 agencies worldwide, yesterday would
not put a figure on how much it spends on advertising, but industry
observers believe it could be up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) a year.
The company said that O&amp;M - which is based in New York but, as part of the
WPP group, is listed on the London Stock Exchange - will assume full
advertising responsibility, including media buying, for the IBM brand and
all IBM products and services from next month.
The consolidation into one agency came as a surprise to the advertising
world, which was not aware that IBM's account was up for review. It follows
a shake-up of IBM's marketing and sales, announced earlier this month.
Instead of being organised along geographic lines, marketing and sales are
to be restructured into 14 teams, each covering a specific industry segment.
The wider reorganisation is part of a plan by Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chief
executive, to restore the company to profit: this year's first-quarter
results showed net earnings of Dollars 392m, compared with net losses of
Dollars 399m in the first quarter of 1993.
Ms Abby Kohnstamm, IBM vice-president for corporate marketing, said: 'IBM is
one of the world's best-known brands. Our advertising team decided that in
an industry undergoing such rapid change, we would be better able to
maintain and increase brand awareness by having a single agency to leverage
IBM and its products around the world.'
Analysts said it was too early to tell what effect the account win would
have on WPP - the agency could lose other customers as a result of account
conflicts. The marketing services group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
54.4m for the year ended December 31 1993, up from Pounds 7.8m the previous
year.
In spite of the improvement in performance, Mr Martin Sorrell, chief
executive, was cautious about the forecast for this year, saying that
recovery for the industry was 'still unstable and uncertain'. The group's
other main advertising network is J. Walter Thompson. WPP shares gained 6p
last night to close at 126p. O&amp;M, which has among its other clients American
Express, Ford and Unilever, will also become responsible for a substantial
proportion of IBM's direct marketing. Ms Kohnstamm said the agency would
help 'deliver clear, consistent messages, in the most efficient way
possible'. The agency had the 'relevant technology expertise and the
extensive multinational and local capabilities' needed, said IBM.
Advertising agencies which will lose out because of the consolidation
include Lintas, DDB Needham, and McCann-Erickson.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Review promises boost for business: White paper aims to make
Britain more competitive; Pounds 300m extra for training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government launched its long-awaited white paper on boosting
Britain's competitiveness yesterday with a promise to raise standards of
vocational education and training and provide a better climate in which
business can operate.
The 163-page document, presented with much razzmatazz by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, contained a multitude of
initiatives and suggestions covering such diverse areas as employment,
management, communications and infrastructure, innovation, export promotion
and proposals to secure more prompt payment of bills for small companies.
But many of the measures in the paper were existing ideas repackaged and
brought together to constitute a strategy. The white paper itself admitted
it was 'in effect a snapshot of work in hand across the government'. Mr John
Major, the prime minister, told a press conference, however, that it was
'rubbish' to suggest there was nothing new in the document. 'There are no
short-term fixes in the white paper but a long-term look at the country's
competitiveness into the next century,' he said. Mr Heseltine said his paper
contained 61 new proposals.
In a rowdy House of Commons, Mr Heseltine said the white paper - 'an agenda
for change and improvement across the public and private sectors' - would
not lead to any overall increase in planned public expenditure. This was in
spite of the government's intention to provide an extra Pounds 300m over the
three financial years to 1997-98 for education and training.
Shortly after Mr Heseltine sat down, Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, announced that the government was considering how to put into
effect recommendations from the Health and Safety Commission that would
remove 40 per cent of regulations affecting most businesses 'without
adversely affecting health and safety conditions'.
For his part, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced a
consultation paper on privatising the UK's air traffic control system.
National Air Traffic Services may be floated on the stock exchange, becoming
a private sector contractor to the Civil Aviation Authority.
The white paper was given a scornful reception by Labour. Mr Robin Cook, the
shadow trade secretary, congratulated Mr Heseltine on his 'glitzy'
presentation 'which puts it in the coffee table class of white papers'. But
he said 'the gloss rubs off very easily'.
The white paper, Mr Cook said, was an admission of Britain's competitiveness
problem, adding: 'This is a bankrupt statement from a government on the
verge of liquidation.'
The paper itself said Britain has 'an enormous task' correcting more than
100 years of relative economic decline. It said that improvements in the
1980s meant that the country was 'now back in touch with the leaders, but
there is a lot of ground to make up'.
A cabinet committee, comprising Mr Heseltine and other senior ministers
responsible for the report, will continue to monitor competitiveness and the
effects of the white paper.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the committee would 'move on to things
which still need to be done'. He made clear he would be looking at how far
UK companies had achieved the right balance in paying out a greater
proportion of profits in dividends than continental companies. The broad
coverage of the white paper reflects the view of the Department of Trade and
Industry that there is no single cause or no small number of causes for the
UK's competitiveness problems.
In focusing on many facets of the economy, the white paper is intended to
provide ministers with a check list to judge future progress towards making
government policy more friendly to business in an increasingly competitive
world economy.
The check list aspect of the white paper was applauded by Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. 'The real value
of the white paper will depend on how it influences government policy in the
future. We shall use the analysis to argue our case for a tax regime which
favours industrial investment, and to press the case for public spending on
training programmes,' he said. The paper was given a generally warm welcome
by industry and commerce. Mr Graham MacKenzie, director-general of the
Engineering Employers' Federation, said it was the nearest to an industrial
strategy that he had seen from this government. 'We are especially pleased
with the education and training measures to strengthen school qualifications
and career guidance,' he said.
To raise educational standards, the government plans to introduce a new
general diploma in England and Wales to provide a 'quality check' that
school pupils have good general certificate of secondary education results,
'more and better' vocational courses for 14- to 16-year-olds and a review of
vocational training standards by the end of 1996. It plans to provide more
help for the transition from school to work and strengthen work-based
training.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said that 'by 2000 the 16-year-old
school-leaver will be as dead as the dodo'.
Mr Hunt said the Employment Department plans wide-ranging consultations on
the introduction of a voucher system for 16- to 19-year-olds to buy their
own education and training.
The white paper also underlined the government's intention to increase help
for companies, and especially small companies, so that they can improve
their management skills and be given better access to innovation and export
promotion.
In answer to long standing complaints from small companies, the government
will introduce a range of measures to encourage companies to pay bills
promptly. Lord Strathclyde, small companies minister, threatened that the
government would review the case for legislation to improve payment
discipline in two years unless 'significant improvement' has taken place.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Mandela pledges to curb state spending and deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Nelson Mandela pledged yesterday to curb government spending and
reduce South Africa's budget deficit as part of a programme dedicated to
redirecting state resources to meet the basic needs of those deprived under
apartheid.
In his state of the nation address to the new multiracial parliament, Mr
Mandela concentrated on economic policy, promising to maintain financial
discipline and to reduce the deficit without any increase in general
taxation this year.
It was Mr Mandela's first formal statement of economic policy since becoming
president on May 10, and was widely welcomed by businessmen and economists
for emphasising fiscal conservatism.
Mr Mandela outlined a cautious plan for his government's first budget, due
to be presented to parliament on June 22. He called for government spending
of R2.5bn (Pounds 450m) on the so-called Reconstruction and Development
Programme, and said these funds would come from rationalising and
redirecting government spending, which is forecast at R125bn for 1994-95.
Government ministers said spending by all government departments would be
cut by as much as 4-5 per cent, with military spending to face the largest
cut. The proceeds would be used for investment in housing and other social
services, including a plan to improve children's health services during Mr
Mandela's first 100 days in office.
In addition, electricity is to be provided to about 350,000 more houses
during the next year. This spending will be separate from the estimates
contained in the central government budget.
Further productivity improvements in government, as well as redirected
spending, would be required to free more funds for the reconstruction
programme. The estimated total government commitment is about R37bn over
five years, with further funds to come from the private sector and foreign
sources. Throughout the programme, the government hopes, general government
expenditure would be held constant in real terms and the budget deficit
would continue to decline from last year's 6.8 per cent of gross domestic
product.
General tax rates would not rise this year, but might increase temporarily
to help reduce the deficit in later years, government officials said. But Mr
Mandela insisted that 'a permanently higher general level of taxation is to
be avoided'.
He avoided quantifying promises to build new houses and provide other basic
services, though he said a campaign would be launched 'to rebuild our
townships, restore services in rural and urban areas while addressing the
issue of job creation and training, especially for our unemployed youth'. No
reference was made to the issue of land reform.

FT  25 MAY 94 / Morgan Stanley to monitor Dollars 2bn aid for PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Palestine Liberation Organisation said yesterday it had chosen Morgan
Stanley Asset Management, fund management arm of the US-based investment
bank, to monitor more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in international aid
committed to the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the next five years.
The appointment was made to allay international fears about the control and
direction of the funds, particularly that they should not be diverted to
political purposes.
Morgan Stanley has had significant business interests in the Arab Middle
East but has also advised Israel in arranging debt finance for its
US-guaranteed loans programme. The bank's MSAM division has about Dollars
50bn in assets under management.
In a statement from its Tunis headquarters, the PLO said the involvement of
Morgan Stanley would 'help assure contributing nations that the funds
provided directly to the Palestinian National Authority would be managed
with total transparency in a highly skilled and professional manner'.
Total international aid commitments to the Palestinians stand at about
Dollars 2.8bn over the next five years. This includes grants, concessionary
loans, loan guarantees and aid from the UN Relief and Works Agency.
About Dollars 2.1bn can be considered 'new' commitments made after the
interim self-rule agreement signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington on
September 13.
Some Dollars 800m has been pledged for the first year of interim Palestinian
self-rule but some donors, such as Saudi Arabia, have been reluctant to
commit themselves beyond that.
Officials in Riyadh, still angered by the PLO's support for Iraq during the
Gulf war, have said they wanted to be certain every dollar went to specific
infrastructure projects and nothing to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman.
The World Bank is co-ordinating the international aid effort but has not
taken responsibility for liaising on specific projects or acting as a
channel for the flow of money to the Palestinian Economic Council for
Development and Reconstruction (Pecdar).
Fears had been raised among donors that the membership of Pecdar, headed by
Mr Arafat, was too heavily politicised and lacked technical expertise.
As a result it it likely that Pecdar's main board will only set the broad
policy outlines, leaving detailed work to Mr Ahmed Qurie, also known as Abu
Ala, director-general, and departments under him. Palestinians associated
with Pecdar insist they will soon have mechanisms for accounting and
maintaining control over the council's spending.

FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Poland may revise bank disposal
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, Poland's new finance minister, has suggested that the
government's bank disposals programme could be revised.
'The first question which we will be answering by the end of next month will
be whether we consolidate the state-owned banks or privatise them,' he said
in a newspaper interview.
The finance ministry has been planning to sell several more state-owned
banks, including the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH) which was
due for privatisation by the middle of this year. It then planned to
consider merging the remaining state banks, either with those already
privatised or with each other, before privatisation.
Mr Kolodko suggested the BPH, one of Poland's largest banks, could be merged
with others before being offered for sale.
Meanwhile, Mr Janusz Quandt, head of the BPH, is pressing for the bank to be
privatised through a share sale to investors. This would avoid the need for
a strategic investor as recommended by CS First Boston, which has been
advising on the disposal.
So far, two banks have been sold: the Poznan-based Wielkopolski Bank
Kredytowy, in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has
a 28.5 per cent share; and Bank Slaski, where ING of the Netherlands owns
25.9 per cent of the equity.
The state-owned Bank Gdansk is thought to be next in line for privatisation
after the BPH.
Mr Kolodko also suggested that PZU, the state-owned insurer which controls
half of the country's insurance market and reported a 325bn zloty (Dollars
9.6m) net profit last year, should be broken up. This goes against the views
of Mr Roman Fulneczek, chairman, who says PZU should be kept together and
privatised through the sale of shares to local investors, management and
employees.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland cracked down on copyright abuse yesterday by implementing a law
intended to end video and music piracy and strengthen intellectual property
rights, Reuter reports from Warsaw.
The law, passed by parliament in February and taking effect after a
three-month grace period, is intended to end piracy which costs the state
treasury millions of dollars a year, and bring Polish laws in line with
international norms.
Polish artists welcomed the new law but said its efficacy would largely
depend on how well it was enforced.
The new legislation replaces a weak and outdated 1952 copyright law under
which the police's ability to make arrests was limited. A part of the law
governing computer piracy went into effect immediately after it was passed
in February.
The weakness of the old law helped music, video and computer piracy flourish
after communist rule ended in 1989, flooding the streets with hawkers of
cheap cassettes.
It was also a discouragement for some foreign investors.
The IFPI estimated that the state treasury lost a minimum of Dollars 25m in
1991 and probably much more in 1992 to music pirates alone and official
producers lost three times as much. Computer software is dominated by
pirated programmes.
Those losses should be quickly reduced, experts say, and prices of official
recordings are not expected to rise much as a result of the new law.

<TEXT>
China and Russia will hold a round of high-level trade talks this week, with
Beijing hoping to phase out barter trade in favour of cash exchanges, the
official China Daily said yesterday, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The Sino-Russian Joint Commission on Economic, Trade and Technical
Co-operation meeting, which begins today will be co-chaired by Chinese Vice
Premier Li Lanqing and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin.
The three-day talks occur as Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin
prepares for his first state visit to Beijing from May 26 to 29.
The China Daily quoted foreign trade officials as saying that one of the
primary goals of this commission meeting would be to stress Beijing's desire
to see barter trade gradually phased out along the border in favour of cash.
While up to 35 per cent of Sino-Russian trade is now conducted on a cash
basis, the rest involves the physical transfer of barter goods.
'Two-way trade should mainly be done through cash exchanges,' Mr Geng
Xuncai, deputy director general of the European department at the trade
ministry told the China Daily.
'Both sides should push their large companies to the forefront of trade and
investment activities,' he said. 'In so doing, the potential for further
growth of two-way trade can be tapped.'
Sino-Russian trade was valued at about Dollars 7.7bn last year, an increase
of 31 per cent over 1992, according to official figures.
The joint commission meeting will also discuss broadening technical
co-operation, with China eager to tap Russian expertise in such fields as
aviation, space technology, the chemical industry and machine building.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Nigerian election attracts few voters
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A partial boycott and widespread public apathy led to a low turnout
yesterday in Nigerian elections for delegates to next month's constitutional
conference, which is to be the basis of the military government's political
programme.
It followed the annulment of a presidential election last June after it had
become clear that Mr Moshood Abiola, a businessman from the south-west, had
won.
Political parties and associations have been banned since Gen Sani Abacha
became head of state last November and no campaigning by contestants was
allowed before yesterday's vote. Mr Ken Saro-Wiwa, a well-known political
activist in Port Harcourt, was stopped from holding a pre-election rally and
was arrested at the weekend. The 270 elected delegates to the constitutional
conference will be joined by 90 government nominees.
Those who voted said that unless they took part they could not influence the
constitutional conference. But senior politicians around Nigeria say there
is no need for the conference because Nigeria's political problems lies not
with the constitution but the military elite who obstruct it. The Campaign
for Democracy has called the conference a ruse to buy time for a regime
which lacks direction.
Other critics of the conference say it will be subordinate to the will of
the military regime, that the government has not stated how long it intends
to stay in power and that the absence of any electoral law and lack of
preparations for polling make the polling invalid.
In the Yoruba homeland of Mr Abiola in the south-west, a coalition of
politicians led by two former state governors told its members not to stand
as delegates for the conference and called for a poll boycott.
Elsewhere two powerful groups have boycotted the whole process: leaders of
the large Ijaw tribe in the south-east, and a powerful alliance of retired
military officers from the central region.
All Nigerians over 18 years were entitled to vote by open ballot at more
than 100,000 polling stations in Nigeria, to choose five candidates for each
of 6,000 wards. No official figures are yet available but In Lagos and the
capital, Abuja, the turnout seemed as low as 10 per cent and many voters
admitted they were not certain what they were voting for.
Mr Bernard Mbah, who is the national organiser of the polls, told reporters
in Abuja that the polling was 'impressive'.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's top legal newspaper yesterday called for judicial independence,
saying Communist party officials still tipped the scales of justice, Reuter
reports from Beijing.
The Legal Daily's front-page editorial said free courts were essential to
developing a market economy. 'The courts have become administrative tools of
the government,' the editorial quoted one unnamed court official as saying.
'Judicial rights and administrative rights are combined into one and used
against those under government supervision. What kind of appeal can they
make?'
The newspaper's editorial contradicted usual Communist rhetoric that China's
courts and judicial organs operate completely independently from the party
and government.
While Beijing has sought to strengthen its legal system by issuing new laws,
approving law offices and improving education, it has not addressed the
question of whether or not the courts are impartial. Many Chinese assume
they are not and are run instead on a system of favours rigged to benefit
those in power.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea said yesterday North Korea might have already replaced up to 15
per cent of fuel rods at a nuclear reactor without supervision by
international inspectors, Reuter reports from Seoul.
'The exchange of fuel rods at the 5MW reactor in Yongbyon is believed to
have been 10 to 15 per cent complete so far,' Yonhap news agency quoted Mr
Lee Hong-koo, unification minister, telling parliament.
The agency said there were a total of 8,100 uranium fuel rods at the
reactor, which could hold vital evidence on whether Pyongyang has developed
a nuclear bomb as suspected by some western governments and intelligence
agencies.
A team of nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) is due to arrive in the North today for talks on the refuelling.
Mr Kim Dai-ho, a former official at North Korea's Yongbyon reprocessing
plant, told the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun the North had secretly
extracted 12kg of plutonium from spent fuel in 1988 despite its public
denials.
North Korea, which denies trying to develop such weapons, insists the only
plutonium it ever produced at Yongbyon was 'a tiny amount' reluctantly owned
up to in 1992.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Russia to explain defence doctrine to Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato defence ministers will today hear out the co-operation ideas of General
Pavel Grachev, their Russian counterpart, amid charges from a prestigious
think-tank that the alliance is mistakenly appearing to pander to Moscow.
The general will lay out Russia's military doctrine, which has been
published only in part, and explain Moscow's terms for a more elaborate form
of co-operation than the Nato-designed Partnership for Peace programme.
Nato has made clear that whatever other arrangements it makes with Moscow,
Russia must sign the same basic documents as the 18 countries which already
adhere to the PFP.
However, Moscow has baulked at the idea of being treated in the same way as
its former 'satellites' in the Warsaw pact.
It remains to be seen whether Moscow's latest formula - a special Russia-
Nato protocol either 'within' PFP or in addition to it - provides the basis
for a compromise.
The International Institute for Strategic Studies alleged yesterday that
Nato had already made mistakes in its treatment of its erstwhile
adversaries.
In its annual strategic survey, the think-tank said Nato had clumsily given
the impression that its refusal to grant early entry to Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic had been motivated by reluctance to upset Russia.
'It was one thing to agree that Russia . . . should have its views
considered. It was another to make it appear that the west feared the strong
objections expected from Moscow on this question,' the survey said.
'To let it appear that the Russians exercised a veto over Nato's
non-existent desire to take these (central European) countries into the fold
was a mistake that should not be made again,' it added.
Diplomats expect the strongest pressure for a compromise with Russia at
today's meeting to come from Germany, which is keen to find a way of
consolidating its ties with both Moscow and its former allies without
upsetting either side.
Nato officials have discouraged suggestions of a 'special relationship' with
Moscow and specifically ruled out the idea of a Russian veto over Nato
policy in eastern Europe - although that seems to be exactly what Moscow
wants.
Mr John Chipman, the IISS director, said Nato was too concerned with shoring
up its own institutional prestige as opposed to addressing real problems.
An example of this was the argument used in justifying the alliance's air
strikes against the Bosnian Serbs: the raids, executed with only partial
success, had been presented as 'necessary to preserve the reputation of
Nato'.
Mr Chipman said that Nato should abandon the 'romantic' notion that it could
solve a wide range of security tasks and concentrate instead on the role it
could perform: providing a 'cheap, efficient bureaucracy' to manage its
members' forces.

FT  24 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Airways firmed 1 1/2 to 379p, in trade of 6.3m, as the
group reported full-year profits in line with market expectations and a
better than expected earnings per share figure.
Profits for the year to March 1994 rose by Pounds 116m to Pounds 301m and
dealers were particularly relieved by the lack of what one trader called
'nasty shocks'. They were also encouraged by the upbeat results presentation
and a bullish outlook to trading prospects.
Mr Ian Wild at BZW was encouraged by the results especially because 'there
were no surprises in the figures.' He is maintaining his current year
profits forecast at Pounds 400m, although shaved his earnings per share
estimate by 10 per cent to 28p due to the change in the tax charge.
Water shares, heavily bought as the market closed last Friday, made further
rapid progress yesterday as the market began to hunt for indications of the
preliminary 'K factors' which were made known by Ofwat, the industry
regulator, to the water companies last Friday. The water sector reporting
season starts tomorrow with results from North West Water, which the market
expects to deliver a dividend increase of around 8 per cent. North West
shares added 5 at 510p.
Among the other water stocks, Severn Trent moved up 7 to 507p, Thames put on
6 1/2 to 497 1/2 p and Anglian 3 to 496p. Yorkshire outpaced the rest of the
sector climbing 15 to 513p.
The electricity stocks rose strongly at the outset following a buy
recommendation from Salomon Brothers, the US broker, but quickly ran out of
steam to close with modest falls on the day. And there was plenty of stock
around in the generators where PowerGen dropped 11 to 487p.
Shares in Thorn EMI were weak ahead of today's finals, off 18 at 1096p,
although turnover was thin. Profits are forecast at Pounds 330m-340m,
compared with Pounds 286.3m last year. Granada slid 10 to 517p amid talk of
problems being encountered in the merger with LWT.
Profit-takers took the shine from Marks and Spencer ahead of its annual
results today, the shares slipping 2 1/2 to 424 1/2 p. Analysts are
forecasting a rise in profits of around 17 per cent to around Pounds 865m.
However, Northern Foods, a supplier to M&amp;S, rose 5 to 221p on hopes of good
figures from the stores group.
Negative weekend press reports hit Signet, the former Ratners group, and the
shares retreated 5 1/2 to 39p with turnover 7m.
Home shopping group Betterware slipped 5 to 123p after a slight improvement
in profits to Pounds 14.1m came in at the bottom end of market expectations.
A positive trading statement from Lloyds Chemist helped the shares put on 2
to 327p. The company, which was making the announcement ahead of an analysts
visit this week, reported sales ahead 15 per cent to over Pounds 800m in the
46 weeks to May 14.
Tesco held steady at 223p, down just a half-penny, with dealers citing
upgrades from UBS and Credit Lyonaise Laing. Argyll Group firmed 2 to 250p
ahead of results tomorrow.
Enterprise Oil drifted back 6 to 422p as the market continued to ponder the
prospects of a cash alternative to the all-paper bid for Lasmo launched two
weeks ago. Lasmo shares, however, held at 157p on the lowest turnover seen
for many months.
Reports that British Gas may float its domestic and business gas supply
operation failed to trigger any big action in Gas shares which eased a penny
to 285 1/2 p.
Bargain hunters helped aerospace and automotive components group Lucas
Industries bounce 5 to 180p, on volume of 4.5m. Fairey Group also gained to
754p, with James Capel reported to have recommended the stock.
News that airports operator BAA was interested in acquiring some of
Australia's main airports together with some concerns on the trading outlook
for the group, left the shares trailing 16 to 964p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel slumped 20 to 355p, as the market braced
itself for an Pounds 850m rights issue, higher than originally indicated by
the company.
Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the worst performers among the big UK
banks, the shares sliding 12 to 418p on reasonable turnover of 1.8m, as the
bank revealed it is expanding its business in the US. Dealers said the
market jibbed at the news. 'any moves by UK banks in the US tend to worry
analysts in the UK,' said one. Standard Chartered was another poor performer
and also came in for some determined selling, the shares retreating 9 1/2 to
244p on 2.9m traded.
Switching operations left Barclays 5 off at 541p and NatWest marginally
firmer at 456p. There were good gains, however, for TSB, up 3 at 222p and
Abbey National, 4 up at 409.
SG Warburg, the only merchant bank in the FT-SE 100 index, eased 4 to 724p
ahead of preliminary figures expected this week. Analysts are looking for a
14 per cent increase in the dividend total. Kleinwort Benson edged up 5 to
472p in the wake of switching out of Warburg.
A big jump in profits at Domino Printing sent the shares racing forward 27
to 517p. First half profits rose from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 5.4m.

FT  24 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Betting fall hits Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Starkly differing trading statements from two of Britain's biggest hoteliers
saw the respective shares record predictably opposite fortunes yesterday.
Ladbroke caused the most surprise as the annual meeting revealed a downturn
in its credit betting business and disappointing performance from its Hilton
hotels division. The veiled profits warning put the shares under immediate
pressure as leisure analysts lopped around 8 per cent from their current
year forecasts, pulling back to the Pounds 135m-145m range, and several also
downgraded their performance rating.
'What is worrying is that the problems are in two of Ladbroke's core
businesses,' commented one formerly bullish analyst. The shares ended a
torturous session 16 1/2 down at 182 1/2 p, the worst performing FTSE 100
stock, with turnover a hefty 8.9m, the biggest in the market.
In contrast, Forte produced a positive agm statement, which although less
detailed than Ladbroke's, said that trading was improving through longer
occupancies and firmer room rates. Forte shares moved ahead on the news but
fell back with the market to close unchanged at 232p.

FT  24 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sharp setback at the close of a quiet
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The holiday closure yesterday of markets in Germany and France left London
to bear the brunt of a setback in global bond prices following comments from
the president of the Bundesbank. Herr Tietmeyer's comment that the
Bundesbank was not following a step-by-step cut in interest rates for the
time being brought sharp falls in UK gilts, US Federal bonds and German
bunds as inflation fears resurfaced in fixed interest markets.
UK stocks, which had been no more than mildly easier at mid-afternoon, fell
sharply after New York opened, bringing the FT-SE 100 Share Index at one
time to within 6.4 points of the 3,100 mark from which the London market has
been struggling to escape for the past six weeks.
The final reading on the FT-SE Index of 3,108.4 showed a fall on the day of
18.9. The Footsie stock index future quickly fell below 3,100, showing a
discount to the underlying stock market.
Traders hastened to point out that, in the absence of the leading European
markets, London stocks had been only lightly traded and that prices for many
leading stocks had been barely tested.
Bond prices will face a more significant test this morning when German
markets re-open and brace themselves for both this week's money market repo
auctions and M3 money supply figures.
However, it was clear yesterday afternoon that UK stocks remained highly
vulnerable to developments in bond markets, especially in the US Federal
bond sector.
With gilts easier from the opening of trading, share prices had slipped from
a firm start to show a 6 point loss on the Footsie. But trading volume was
slow and it was left to individual company situations to provide the
highlights. News of a modest reduction in Britain's non-EC trade deficit
helped bond and share prices to steady briefly.
In spite of a modest increase in business following Herr Tietmeyer, the
day's Seaq total of 417.1m shares was around 40 per cent down on the day.
Friday's 708.2m shares were worth Pounds 1.38bn in retail business.
As usual, the late-afternoon downturn was led from the futures markets, and
the broader markets were to some extent left behind. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index
closed only 5.3 off at 3,709.3 having moved only narrowly throughout the
trading session.
Among the international stocks, Eurotunnel units weakened as the market
sensed that some institutions were calling for a unusually large discount on
the Pounds 850m rights issue widely expected later this week. Unexpectedly
good trading figures helped British Airways, although enthusiasm was
restrained by uncertainty over the prospects for Airway's Dollars 400m
investment in USAir.
The renewed concern over inflationary pressures on interest rate policies
was discouraging for many consumer stocks, and the mood was not helped by a
trading report from Ladbroke, the hotels and casino group. Breweries and
food manufacturing shares gave ground and some building and construction
stocks, with fortunes closely tied to interest rate prospects, also turned
lower, albeit in very thin trading.
This week, the second of an extended three week trading account in UK
equities, brings a batch of trading reports from leading British companies
which will be scanned for evidence of the progress of the domestic economy.

FT  24 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Comments by the President of the Bundesbank sent bond markets into retreat
and stock index futures crashing through the 3,100 support level in thin
trading in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 futures contract was
struck at 3,130, just ahead of the cash market. However, this soon changed
as June faltered on sporadic selling mainly from independent traders.
But trading remained very thin indeed and less than 1,000 contracts had been
dealt by 9.30am and just over 2,500 lots had been traded by lunch.
June was now trading at a substantial discount but it was the comments from
the Bundesbank President that sent the contract falling through the 3,100
support level, as both the bond markets and Wall Street reacted to the
comments. Dealers also reported increased arbitrage activity as the premium
between the cash and the cash market widened.
The contract closed at 3,085, a 22 point discount to cash on poor volume of
7,320.
In traded options, dealers reported the least active session this year as
total volume fell to 17,690 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 7,285 lots and
the Euro FT-SE option 2,985 lots. No stock option traded more than 1,000
lots with the most active British Aerospace at 603 contracts.

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: America leads the way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
America led the way last week, the only sizeable impetus as the FT-Actuaries
World Index rose by 1.05 per cent.
US stocks climbed on the tightening of US monetary policy. Canada followed
its neighbour, but its equity market got an additional boost from its base
metal content.
Mexico, depressed this year, and extremely sensitive to interest rate
action, gained most. In part, this was a pragmatic response to the
performance of the ruling party's presidential candidate, Mr Ernesto
Zedillo, in an earlier, televised debate.

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stumbles as rates worries
resurface
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Concern over rising interest rates resurfaced in the US stock markets as
share prices followed bonds sharply lower, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 23.94 at 3,742.41, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 1.72 to 453.20.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 0.56 at 437.64,
and the Nasdaq composite shed 1.75 to 724.95.
There was no fresh economic news yesterday to drive stocks. However, the
break in the release calendar served to fix investors' focus on the bond
market, which was experiencing heavy losses. The dollar was weakening again
against the D-mark and prices of gold and other commodities were up sharply,
a concern for investors in fixed-rate instruments such as government
securities.
The renewed weakness in bonds, after last week's firmer trend, was more than
enough to trigger a downward adjustment in share prices, following a
107-point net jump in the Dow industrials in the previous five sessions.
But yesterday's decline may have reflected a shift in sentiment that ran
deeper than a desire to book profits after a big rally. Investors seemed to
be growing increasingly concerned that the bear market in bonds, triggered
by the Federal Reserve's shift in monetary policy in early February, was not
brought to a halt by last week's fourth move by the central bank to tighter
money.
The upturn in the financial markets since Tuesday's rate increase was built
on the widespread perception that the Fed would hold off on further rate
actions until the end of the summer. But rising commodity prices and the
soft dollar were now clouding the outlook and complicating the strategic
perspective of equity investors.
Among the cyclicals, Procter &amp; Gamble dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 55 and
3M shed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 51 1/8 . In the energy sector, Chevron lost
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 86 7/8 .
Amid the general decline, there was at least one bright spot. Shares in
Gerber Products, the most active NYSE issue, surged Dollars 15 1/2 , or
about 45 per cent, to Dollars 50 1/2 on the announcement that Sandoz, the
Swiss pharmaceuticals house, had agreed to buy the baby-food maker for
Dollars 3.7bn, or Dollars 53 a share.
There was speculation about more takeovers in the sector which helped lift
the share prices of other food processing groups. CPC International gained
Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 48 and Philip Morris added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
55 1/4 .
Kodak also outperformed the market. The stock climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 47 after a federal court lifted long-established restrictions on the
company's marketing activities.
Toronto was closed for a public holiday.
Mexico
Equities ended firmer for the fifth straight session, buoyed by hopes
domestic interest rates will be stable or decline at the weekly Treasury
bill auction.
The 37-share IPC index ended up 14.13 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 2,431.43.
Turnover was a heavy 132.06m.
The bill auction is held today and results are announced Wednesday. Analysts
said that they saw the IPC index hitting its short-term resistance level at
2,520 this week before a bout of profit-taking.
Brazil
Shares eased from the day's highs to close up 3.1 per cent after the market
absorbed a mild profit-taking bout sparked by a drop in US stocks.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 646 at 20,963
points. Turnover was CR280.4bn (Dollars 137m).

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Growth prospects lift Japan's OTC
stocks - Small is beautiful again, but strategists like cyclicals long term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small is beautiful again in Japan. Since the beginning of this year, the
country's over-the-counter stock market has gained 28.1 per cent on
prospects of high growth against an 18.4 per cent rise in the Nikkei 225.
The current attractions of the OTC market are different from those of 1990,
when it climbed to a record high before plunging on profit taking. That
upsurge was supported by investment funds looking for alternative
investments, which ploughed in money without proper research. Some OTC
companies were valued on their land holdings rather than earnings.
The current buzz word is growth. With years of slow growth ahead for the
Japanese economy and the large blue chip companies, the OTC market is now
regarded as virtually another emerging market.
Recent profit announcements have supported the theory. According to Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, pre-tax earnings for leading OTC
companies are showing an advance of 14.7 per cent against a fall of 19.5 per
cent for all listed companies.
The new consumer trend towards cheaper prices has given OTC companies extra
scope. For example, Sari, a discount liquor store chain, has boosted its
profits by offering its own, economy-priced house brand. The shares have
risen by 80 per cent since their initial listing to the current Y4,500.
With the Ministry of Finance's ban on listings lifted and Japan's Securities
Dealer Association eager to allow five to six companies to list every week
from next month, the scope for investment on the OTC market is expected to
widen this year.
However, investors need to be aware of the high risk factor surrounding
these stocks. The market became a playground for speculators during the 1990
rally, since prices could be manipulated easily due to the lack of
liquidity; and lax disclosure requirements, leading to unexpected
bankruptcies, have left many investors nervous.
Mr Craig Chudler, managing director of Thomas Norton Associates, an
investment research company specialising in small Japanese companies, says
that OTC companies are different animals from their larger peers, usually
headed by a maverick entrepreneur and needing in-depth, individual analysis.
Meanwhile, while strategists do not deny that OTC growth stocks are a buy,
analysis suggests that larger, cyclical stocks may have longer term appeal.
Mr Rod Smyth, strategist at Baring Securities, says that OTC stocks have
more or less discounted the growth factor for now, and that the greater
profit surprises which will push share prices higher will be in the larger
blue chips.
The return of domestic institutional investors to the market also points to
a rise in interest in the larger companies, since the large financial
institutions are loath to invest in high risk instruments. Mr Smyth advises:
'Investors who dump the larger stocks now for smaller OTC shares may miss
the boat.'

Early gains were pared in Johannesburg as worries emerged that the higher
bullion price would not hold and in response to initial Wall Street
weakness. The undertone remained firm, however, although many investors were
thought to be awaiting direction from today's speech to parliament by Mr
Nelson Mandela.
The overall index was 50 better at 5,524, industrials added 19 to 6,640 and
golds put on 82 or 4.3 per cent, to 1,990.
Barlows rose 85 cents to R39 in response to its higher half-year profits.
Tobacco stocks remained under pressure.

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan down by 2.4% as
liquidity dries up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most senior bourses were closed for the Whit Monday holiday. In London, the
FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index indicated a gentle, and almost general downtrend
and, with Wall Street lower, neither Milan nor Madrid were disposed to argue
at the end of the European day.
MILAN added to last week's declines with a further 2.4 per cent fall,
although some late buying helped to pick shares up from their lowest levels.
The Comit index, which lost 18.48 was seen testing support at 757.97, in
modest trading which involved further selling by foreign investors.
Mr Michele Pacitti at NatWest Securities noted that the current downturn had
accompanied the drying up of the high levels of liquidity that had driven
the market higher after the general election at the end of March.
Fiat lost L166 or 2.4 per cent to L6,687 but Olivetti picked up from a day's
low of L2,740 to finish down L44 at L2,822.
Against the trend, Italmobiliare rose L927 to L48,330 on the view that
recent falls had been overdone. Assitalia added L282 to L18,150 in response
to the the Berlusconi government's statement that it would stick to the
planned privatisation schedule of the insurer's parent, INA. Nuovo Pignone
rose L60 to L6,750 as ENI complete the sale of a majority stake to General
Electric of the US.
MADRID's midsession recovery foundered on weakness on Wall Street, and the
general index closed 0.29 lower at 337.91 after a high of 339.36. Turnover
fell to Pta22.7bn as attention focused on second rank stocks.
TEL AVIV had another bad day. Israel's central bank raised interest rates by
half a percentage point in an effort to stem rising inflation and housing
costs, and the Mishtanim index slid by 5.14, or 2.55 per cent to 196.20.
This followed a 2.4 per cent fall on Sunday, after Israel Radio broadcast
more excerpts from a controversial speech which Mr Yasser Arafat, the PLO
chairman, made in a Johannesburg mosque on May 10. The radio said that Mr
Arafat's remarks put into doubt his commitment to the deal on Palestinian
self-rule.
ATHENS fell 2.8 per cent, driven down by one month interbank rates that
remained above 140 per cent and a liquidity shortage due to pressures on the
drachma.
The general index closed 25.91 lower at 887.08 in active volume of 1.3m
shares.
WARSAW extended its recent gains, the Wig index rising by 423, or 3.6 per
cent, to 12,240.8.
Brokers liked the fact that most stocks were appreciating moderately, but
with foreign investors remaining on the sidelines there were also fears that
profit-taking could interrupt the uptrend.

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Trade hopes take Nikkei
1.1% higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a breakthrough for the US-Japan bilateral framework talks on trade,
combined with an easing of the yen, prompted active buying. The Nikkei index
advanced by 1.1 per cent, led by a rise in large-capital shares, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average rose 226.54 to 20,568.71, and the Topix index by 11.67 to
1,654.21. Profit-taking dropped the Nikkei to a low of 20,328.07 in the
morning session, but buying emerged later as the yen fell to the Y104 level;
the index rose to a high of 20,574.91 just before the close.
Volume totalled 360m shares against 355m. Trading by arbitrageurs, overseas
and domestic investors supported activity. The Nikkei 300 rose 2.13 to
302.50, gainers led losers by 621 to 380 with 179 unchanged and, in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.52 to 1,355.04.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that the strong rise in large capital
stocks reflected buying by domestic institutions. However, whether the index
can sustain its current level to rise further depends on the amount of
trading volume, said another broker.
Large capital steels and shipbuilders were traded heavily. Nippon Steel, the
most active issue of the day, rose Y3 to Y369, NKK gained Y10 to Y284 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y6 to Y714.
Takuma, an industrial machinery maker, rose Y50 to Y1,660 on hopes of a rise
in profits for the current business year to next March.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y16,000 to Y827,000 on continued
selling. The stock has lost 7.2 per cent since the beginning of last week,
before the government decided to freeze all planned increases in public
sector prices, including a rise in local call rates on Wednesday.
Non-life insurance companies, which were also lower on the freeze of the
expected increase in fire insurance rates, rebounded. Tokio Marine and Fire
Insurance rose Y10 to Y1,340 and Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance rose Y32
to Y863.
Retailers were lower on profit-taking. The sector has been strong recently
on hopes of a recovery in consumer confidence. However, economists expect
that household spending data, due to be announced this week, will reflect
continued sluggishness. Seiyu lost Y50 to Y1,370 and Nichii declined Y60 to
Y1,490.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 111.94 to 22,619.59 in volume of 17.6m
shares.
Roundup
A quiet session was seen in many Pacific Rim markets as investors awaited
fresh incentives.
SHANGHAI's B share index, however, rose 4.6 per cent as the renewed
confidence that emerged last week brought local and foreign investors back
as buyers. The index, which had fallen by 40 per cent since the beginning of
the year, rose 3.06 to 70.24 in heavy volume of 14.3m shares, against a
recent daily average of 6m.
MANILA shrugged off last week's worries and advanced 1.8 per cent on
aggressive buying of blue chips. The composite index rose 51.85 to 2,922.17
in volume that eased to 751.4m shares from Friday's 1.5bn.
HONG KONG saw profit-taking erase early gains and the Hang Seng index, 141
points higher at one stage, ended 41.85 lower at 9,589.78. Turnover tumbled
from HKDollars 7.36bn. to HKDollars 4.22bn.
HSBC topped the active list and gained 50 cents to HKDollars 91. It was
followed by Cheung Kong, which lost 50 cents to HKDollars 39.25, as the
group denied press reports that it was bidding for London's Broadgate office
complex.
SYDNEY revived during the afternoon to close firmer on a buoyant gold
sector. The All Ordinaries index closed up 17.1 at 2,121.0, while the gold
marker rose 68.8 or 3.1 per cent to 2,314.1 after the rise in the bullion
price.
Among gold stocks, Placer Pacific leapt 24 cents to ADollars 3.09, Samantha
rose 30 cents to ADollars 5.30 and Newcrest jumped 21 cents to ADollars
6.82.
TAIPEI was lightly lower in slow, narrow trade , as investors remained on
the sidelines after a week of falls. Brokers said that the market was ripe
for a technical rebound after the weighted index lost 13.50 to 5,817.68,
turnover falling to TDollars 31.14bn from Saturday's TDollars 32.52bn.
BOMBAY was lower in very quiet trade in response to last week's refusal by
the Securities and Exchange Board of India to dilute tough conditions for
the resumption of the badla, or carry forward system of trading.
The BSE 30-share index closed 46.44 lower at 3,737.23.
SEOUL was easier for the third consecutive session in mixed trading with
persistent blue chip consolidation overshadowing the market. The composite
index lost 0.69 to 945.50.
SINGAPORE was mixed in sluggish trading ahead of a market holiday tomorrow
and the Straits Times Industrials index rose 2.30 to 2,339.31.
JAKARTA was in bullish mood with foreign and local investors buying heavily
across a range of stocks and the JKSE index rose 10.37 to 498.36.
KUALA LUMPUR finished easier after another dull session as lack of fresh
factors depressed investors. The composite index closed 2.06 lower at 999.10
in volume of 68.7m shares.
BANGKOK was marginally higher in thin trade as most investors remained on
the sidelines because of a lack of direction. The SET index closed 0.40 up
at 1,338.59 in turnover that shrank to Bt6.2bn after Friday's Bt9.5bn as
institutional investors slow down their buying.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Markets Report: German rate gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pessimism over the outlook for German interest rates dominated markets again
yesterday following further cautionary comments from the Bundesbank, writes
Philip Gawith.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, was quoted as saying in
Helsinki: 'We are not following a step-by-step cut in interest rates for the
time being.' This followed various comments last week suggesting a slowing
in the pace of German monetary easing.
The December euromark contract finished yesterday at 94.68, 21 basis points
below the Friday close, and 44 basis points down over the last two trading
days.
The trend in the futures market was at odds with the cash market, where call
money rates still favour a substantial lowering of the repo rate. This led
some observers to speculate that the Bundesbank might slow the pace of
monetary easing by announcing a fixed rate repo, possibly as early as today.
Trading on the foreign exchanges was generally fairly quiet, with most
European markets closed for a holiday. The D-Mark was stronger against the
yen and the Italian lira.
The Bank of Israel said it would raise short term rates by 0.5 per cent on
Thursday, with the rate on the daily monetary tender rising to a minimum
10.8 per cent.
The bearish tone to futures markets forced some market participants to
reconsider their view that the market had turned a corner last week, and
entered a more bullish phase.
But analysts said the market had overreacted to Mr Tietmeyer's comments,
which were seen as no more than a repetition of what he had said last week.
Business was fairly quiet until his comments provoked a flurry of activity,
with the December contract ending up trading more than 69,000 lots.
Euromark futures are currently pricing in a rise in interest rates by June
and September. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO,
described these rates as 'completely crazy'. He said he was 'not prepared to
see this as a fundamental move.' Although economists have been revising up
their forecasts for German growth, Mr Norfield said these remained modest
and were not an argument against further interest rate cuts.
The sharp movement in the futures market has not been mirrored in the cash
markets, with overnight money currently trading at 5.0/5.12 per cent. This
creates a policy dilemma for the Bundesbank, because these rates are well
below the current repo rate, of 5.23 per cent, and this would normally
favour another substantial fall in the repo rate.
Were this to happen, however, the Bundesbank could be forced to lower
official rates again quite soon, contrary to what Mr Tietmeyer has been
saying.
Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, argues that the solution
to this conundrum may lie in the Bundesbank returning to fixed rate repos as
a method of slowing the fall in interest rates.
Gloom in the euromark contracts spilled over into short sterling, where the
December future lost 8 basis points to close at 93.99. Volumes were light.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England supplied late assistance of
Pounds 125m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m. Earlier it had
provided Pounds 616m of liquidity to the system. Overnight rates moved from
4 to 5 3/4 per cent.
Sterling showed little response to the better than expected April non-EU
trade deficit. It closed at DM2.4789 against the D-Mark, from DM2.4856.
Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5064 from Dollars 1.5098.
The dollar had another uneasy day, with Mr Tietmeyer's comments doing no
favours for the US currency. It closed in London at DM1.6456, from DM1.6463,
against the D-Mark, and Y104.400 against the yen, from Y103.910.
Mr Tim Yetman, head of proprietary trading at Natwest Markets, said the
dollar continued to trade very softly. 'If this is a rally, it is not very
impressive,' he noted. With investors increasingly wary about the outlook
for US asset markets, Mr Yetman said it was difficult to see why people
would buy more dollars.
The dollar could weaken further today if the German April M3 number is a
poor one. This would bolster arguments for a slower pace of easing, and lend
support to the D-Mark.
The D-Mark continued its recent rally against the yen, closing at Y63.45
compared to Y62 on May 18. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at
JP Morgan (Europe), said the markets seemed to be responding to the threat
of another election in Japan, and the possibility of a trade agreement with
the US.
He said investors were fearful to sell the yen against the dollar, but were
positive about the outlook for the D-Mark, with German interest rates seen
to be close to the bottom.
The lira also slipped yesterday, to close at L966.1 from L959.4 on Friday.
Analysts said the poor performance recently of the bond and equity markets
had encouraged investors to take profits.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper pushes through
resistance to fresh highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper prices took off again yesterday as US fund buying pushed them
decisively through technical resistance levels that had held firm last week.
Metal for delivery in three months went to Dollars 2,277 a tonne, up Dollars
47.50, at the close on the London Metal Exchange.
The metal Copper continued its climb in late trading and touched Dollars
2,300 a tonne, its highest price in 16 months.
Copper also moved again into backwardation, where a premium is paid for
immediate delivery, frequently a sign of supply tightness.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, in
Merrill's monthly metals report, advises copper users 'to act now and look
to secure at least some forward cover'. He forecasts that in the next two to
three months copper will trade between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 2,315 a
tonne.
Ms Leanne Baker and Ms Janet Cochoff, analysts at the Salomon Brothers
financial services group, say they expect that 'short-term sentiment toward
copper will remain bullish, driven by positive technical and seasonal
considerations, as well as robust US demand'.
They suggest, however, that 'supply increases will begin to overwhelm demand
during the second half of this year and building into 1995 and 1996.' They
have raised their average copper price forecast for 1994 from 80 cents a
pound (Dollars 1,763 a tonne) to 90 cents (Dollars 1,984) and their 1995
price estimate from 75 cents a pound (Dollars 1,653) to 80 cents.
The International Wrought Copper Council, an association of consumers,
suggests that there will be a 'moderate' refined copper supply deficit this
year - after taking into account net trade with China and the Commonwealth
of Independent States - but adds that preliminary estimates for 1995
indicate supply and demand will be much more closely balanced.
According to the IWCC, refined copper production last year outside the CIS
and China increased by nearly 3 per cent to 9.5m tonnes while consumption
grew by more than 2 per cent to 9.4m tonnes. It forecasts production will
show a 'modest' increase of under 1 per cent in 1994 but then jump by nearly
5 per cent to more than 10m tonnes in 1995. Consumption, meanwhile, is
predicted to move up by 4 per cent this year and by another 3 per cent in
1995 to more than 10m tonnes.

FT  24 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa and coffee surge - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of both COFFEE and COCOA soared in late afternoon trading at the
London Commodity Exchange yesterday in response to a sudden spurt of
speculative buying.
July coffee futures ended Dollars 111 up at Dollars 2,295 a tonne after
touching Dollars 2,305, the highest since late 1987.
'It was speculative buying,' said one trader. 'London triggered the buying
and it spread to New York.' With no fundamentals justifying the rise an
analyst described the coffee market as 'hysterical'.
Traders said cocoa's late surge, which lifted the July position by Pounds 51
to Pounds 998 a tonne, was also technically driven and lead by investment
fund buying. 'But the market still looks very strong,' one said, although
noting London volumes were fairly low.
GOLD built on its recent rally with a Dollars 3.55 rise to Dollars 387.75 a
troy ounce.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean plan angers workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at Codelco, Chile's state copper company, have reacted angrily to a
Bill sent to parliament last week that aims to break the company up into
separate divisions.
The powerful Federation of Copper Workers (FTC) said it had not been
consulted over modernisation plans, which it claimed represented a step
towards privatisation. The Bill threatened the constitution, which was
amended in 1971 to guarantee that Codelco remained in state hands, it said.
Workers were particularly concerned at the future status of non-core
divisions - the Tocopilla power plant and workshops at Rancagua - which,
under the Bill, would be allowed to raise private capital.
'We are going to begin a great national movement to defend our inheritance,'
said Mr Raimundo Espinoza, president of the FTC. The union is forming a
commission to analyse the government's proposals and to formulate a
response.
The Bill came in response to declining profits at Codelco - largely because
of its inability to develop new projects - and to a futures trading scandal
that raised questions about the company's structure.
Mr Villarzu, Codelco's president, plans to create a holding company which
will oversee the operation of the group's six divisions, including its four
mines. Autonomous management teams will be expected to run the divisions as
if they were private companies, a strategy designed to cut down on
cross-subsidies between separate branches and to raise efficiency.
The bill also seeks to strengthen the role of the board of directors, much
criticised for its lack of vigilance over last year's metals futures trading
fiasco that led to losses of more than Dollars 200m.
Mr Villarzu said the overall aim was to reach annual production of 1.4m
tonnes of fine copper by the year 2000 - compared with about 1.1m tonnes in
recent years - through increased productivity and the development of new
deposits. He denied that modernisation implied a reduction in the number of
Codelco's workforce of more than 20,000.
Criticism of the Bill is not confined to Codelco workers. Chile's right wing
opposition argues that plans do not go far enough in facilitating the use of
private capital, for example in the development of new projects. Mr
Sebastian Pinera, a prominent opposition senator, said the government's plan
amounted to a dose of 'aspirin which will not cure the sickness'.
Some on Chile's right have called for the outright privatisation of Codelco,
an option entirely ruled out by the government of President Eduardo Frei.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm tax resisted in Pakistan

Pakistan's federal government has appealed to the country's four provinces
to become more active in supporting its initiative to introduce income tax
for farmers.
The appeal followed months of speculation over the future of an important
decision last year, when farmers were brought under the net of income and
wealth tax for the first time in the country's history.
International financial pressure has built up, however, following earlier
reports that the provincial governments were proving reluctant to press
ahead with the move, fearing a political backlash from the agricultural
sector. Pakistan's political structure continues to be dominated by the
country's wealthy landowners, who have directly or indirectly influenced the
government's decisions.
However, under a three year loan agreement signed with the International
Monetary Fund earlier this year, Pakistan has agreed to introduce new
reforms to improve its tax structure. Some officials say that a setback to
the initiatives on agricultural taxation could make it difficult for the
country to persuade its key donors and lending institutions, that its doing
enough to improve fiscal management.

FT  24 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): The
growing pains of British horticulture - Potential for expansion will be
jeopardised if levy-funding of research is abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Horticulture is one of the most under-rated sectors of British food
production.
It uses just 4 per cent of the total land area but produces goods with a
farm gate value of over Pounds 1.7bn, about half the total produced by
conventional agriculture on the other 96 per cent of the land. and it does
it virtually without European Union support.
Some industry insiders say it could increase output by a further Pounds 750m
over the next decade, given adequate encouragement and access to potential
advances in research and development.
The UK has a horticultural trade gap with other, mainly EU countries, of
some Pounds 2.3bn a year, so there would appear to be every reason to expand
domestic production. Britain imports 36 per cent of the tomatoes consumed in
this country, 48 per cent of the roses, 36 per cent of the chrysanthemums
and so on.
But this potential expansion - and even the status quo - could be threatened
if cash for researching and disseminating improved production techniques
dried up. The future of such work is in the balance this week, as is the
future of the levy-funded Horticultural Development Council, which
commissions and co-ordinates much of the 'near market' research.
The HDC is being subjected to its statutory five-yearly review by the
Ministry of Agriculture, the outcome of which will determine whether it
continues or is wound-up.
Yesterday representatives of about 30 horticulture industry organisations
met ministry officials to record their views on the future of the council.
Insider information in advance of the meeting suggested that they would back
its continuation 'to a man'. But they represented chiefly large-scale
operations. Some of the smaller growers among the 3,000 or so registered
horticulturalists are apparently not so happy.
The HDC requires each registered producer with gross sales of more than
Pounds 25,000 to declare his sales value each year. He is then billed for
half of 1 per cent of that gross as his contribution to council-co-ordinated
research and development efforts. This raises just under Pounds 3m a year
which, after modest administration costs, is all spent on selected 'near
market' research and the transmission of the resulting information to
growers.
The ministry, it must be said, spends some Pounds 15.5m on research geared
to horticulture, although it is mainly basic, as distinct from applied. The
HDC claims that if it did not ensure the 'application' much of the ministry
work would be wasted or, more likely, discontinued.
At a time when some horticulturalists, such as lettuce and tomato growers,
are making a loss on every box of produce, however, they are understandably
less than enthusiastic about increasing their immediate problems by paying a
statutory levy to the HDC.
Some growers are regularly tardy with their payments in any case and over
the last two years the HDC has spent over Pounds 30,000 on what it calls in
its accounts 'enforcement costs'.
Others, it is alleged, and they are not all small operators whose turnover
is below the trigger point, have not registered as growers and therefore
also avoid payment of the levy.
All of this raises the hackles of those who do pay promptly - especially
during periods of poor or non-existent profits - and leads them to question
if the council should be allowed to continue. In response, the HDC says it
is working on ways to ensure full registration but that, although the
ministry has information on all growers in the UK, it is legally prohibited
from making this available to the HDC for policing purposes.
The NFU, in its submission to the review, has identified non-registration as
one of the key points that require more attention.
It is, of course, almost inevitable in a volatile and multi-faceted
industry, that petty points appear to be major hurdles. For at any time,
some of the 80 different crops that fall within the HDC's remit will be
giving good returns while others make losses.
Last year, for instance, raspberry growers made a killing because normal
supplies from eastern Europe - particularly Yugoslavia, for obvious reasons
 -were not available. As a result, many UK growers have planted more canes.
These will come into full production in two to three years, by which time,
we must hope the Bosnians, the Croats and the Serbs may have resolved their
difficulties and once again be supplying raspberries to British markets.
Together with the increase in production from the new British canes, this
will probably bring about a glut on the market and prices and profits will
plummet. That is the way with horticulture.
Stiff competition for the British market is also coming, increasingly, from
southern countries within the EU. The climate in Italy, Greece, Spain and
Portugal means growers can produce many crops unprotected. In Britain, the
same crops can only be grown in expensive greenhouses with artificial
heating.
Nevertheless, British horticulturalists claim, domestic produce has
qualities that the competition cannot match - qualities that could be
further enhanced by the application of R&amp;D. It is widely recognised within
the industry that the HDC has done, and is doing, a good job. To most it is
inconceivable that it should be wound-up. Indeed, that is the message
ministry officials will have heard yesterday.
It is now up to ministers to respond to those representations by the end of
June. It is already clear that in the unlikely event that they kill-off
grower-funded HDC, the Dutch government-funded research establishment will
quickly be knocking on Britain's door. Initially, it will wish to sell its
expertise but, very soon, more of its produce, thereby increasing still
further the food trade gap, now running at a total of some Pounds 6bn a
year.
