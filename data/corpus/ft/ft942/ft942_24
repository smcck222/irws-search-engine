Malawi's new president, Mr Bakili Muluzi, is due to continue talks on
forming a coalition government, with five key parliamentary seats still in
dispute, Reuter reports from Blantyre.
Officials of Mr Muluzi's United Democratic Front (UDF), which is just short
of a majority with 84 seats in the 177-member parliament, said they were
awaiting a response from a northern-based party on whether it wanted to join
in a coalition government.
'No talks have been opened with Aford (Alliance for Democracy). The position
of the UDF is that we have no major problem in working with Aford if they
are willing to work with us,' UDF publicity chief Kassam Chilumpha said.
AFORD, which won 36 seats in last Tuesday's elections, is led by veteran
trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, who draws support from his home area in
northern Malawi. Former President Hastings Banda's Malawi Congress party,
the sole legal party from independence in 1964 until the first multi-party
election last week, took 52 seats, mainly in central areas.

unrest

The Chinese Communist party said yesterday it would step up its campaign
against unrest in the countryside, where stability is deteriorating due to
'paralysis' among inept local officials, Reuter reports from Beijing.
'The security management situation remains extremely grim nationwide this
year,' Mr Ren Jianxin, a senior party official, was quoted by the official
People's Daily as telling a meeting on rural instability.
The meeting of the party's Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social
Security, which Mr Ren heads, reflected Beijing's concern over an alarming
loss of political control in the countryside.
'All official and legal organs must strengthen the force of their blows and
mercilessly attack serious criminal activities and serious economic crimes,'
said Mr Ren, who is also supreme court president and member of the party
secretariat.
The rise in unrest is evident from mounting reports in the party-controlled
press of rural warlordism, banditry, deadly clan feuds, violent uprisings
and festering resentment.
Angry farmers have demonstrated against crippling, illegal local taxes and
have attacked corrupt officials who enrich themselves by running their
villages as personal fiefs.
Peasants also resent high inflation and a growing income gap caused by the
slow growth of farm earnings compared to the rapidly rising incomes in
China's cities and coastal areas.
Mr Ren made clear that Beijing would do anything to prevent the Communist
party's worst nightmare: a collapse of order among 900m peasants that would
plunge China into a chaos far broader than the student-led protests of 1989.
'The security problems are escalating enormously in some rural areas and the
public reaction is intense,' Mr Ren said.
'We must never underestimate the affect of rural unrest on our national
situation and must understand these problems in terms of the overriding
interests of the party and state.'

<TEXT>
The Philippine government went on the defensive at the weekend after banning
foreign participants from a conference on East Timor, apparently under
pressure from Indonesia.
President Fidel Ramos said the move was 'for the protection of national
interests'.
The Manila conference, scheduled for May 31-June 4, was conceived to discuss
alleged repression in East Timor, which Indonesia annexed in 1976 after an
earlier military invasion.
Among those who had been expected to attend were Mr Jose Ramos Horta, East
Timor foreign minister in exile and a leader of Timorese independence
movement, and Mr George Aditjondro, author of a book that detailed a
massacre of East Timorese in 1991 by Indonesian soldiers.
Mr Horta is currently identified with the anti-Indonesia Fretilin guerrilla
group in Portugal.
The Philippine government said Mr Horta had sought that the conference try
to make East Timor an Asian issue, to focus a global spotlight on the plight
of the people and to foster dialogue among human rights advocates in the
region.
Some members of the Philippine Congress had expressed apprehension that the
conference, if allowed as a precedent, could make Manila 'a new base for
subversive groups'.
Manila's move followed a threat of retaliation by Jakarta should the
conference proceed with government permission.

<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia will send a delegation to China soon to explore new investment
opportunities in oil refining and exploration following last week's visit to
Beijing by Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister.
China's official Business Weekly reported that the Saudi mission would visit
Lianyungang, a port city in northern Jiangsu province, and Dagang in Tianjin
on the Bohai gulf south-east of Beijing to investigate new projects.
The newspaper quoted Mr Nazer, who was on his first visit to China, as
saying that Saudi Arabia hopes to establish refineries to meet Chinese
domestic needs and to ensure a 'stable, long-term supply of crude oil'.
The Saudis are proposing to take a 45 per cent stake through Aramco, their
state oil company, in a 200,000 b/d refinery to be located near Qingdao in
Shandong province, north of Shanghai. Other partners include South Korea's
Ssangyong and Chinese organisations.
China, which last year produced 143.7m tonnes of oil, has become a net
importer in the past 12 months. It is looking to the Gulf states to help
overcome a growing shortfall as the Chinese economy continues its rapid
growth.
Mr Nazer, who was a guest of China National Petroleum Corporation,
reportedly discussed with China's President Jiang Zemin several oil projects
in which the Saudis may become involved. Mr Jiang was quoted as saying that
he would support Mr Nazer's proposals and 'help forge agreements as soon as
possible'.
The Saudi minister said his country expected to set up joint venture
refineries in China, similar to those it has established in the US, South
Korea and the Philippines.

<TEXT>
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has hinted that his
government might consider lifting its ban on offering government contracts
to British compan ies.
The ban was imposed in late February, in retaliation for a report in the
Sunday Times newspaper in London which alleged that a British company had
been involved in negotiations to offer Dr Mahathir bribes in exchange for a
contract.
Dr Mahathir said that now that Mr Andrew Neil, the Sunday Times editor, had
been transferred to a new post, British media reports on Malaysia might
improve. 'If we find that the British media reports the truth and no longer
prints lies, there is no reason why we cannot resume business,' Dr Mahathir
told Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.
Mr Neil, who is taking up a temporary post in New York, told Reuters that he
was delighted if his move was to be used as an excuse by Dr Mahathir to end
what he described as the 'absurd embargo' against British companies.
Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister, is due to visit Malaysia next month.

An opposition MP of the Chart Thai (Thai nation) party, Mr Thanong
Siriprechapong, has resigned from parliament following revelations two weeks
ago that he is wanted in the US for his alleged involvement in smuggling 45
tonnes of cannabis over a 10-year period.
Mr Banharn Silpa-archa, Chart Thai's ambitious new leader, is trying hard to
refurbish the image of a party which is the second biggest in parliament
with 77 MPs, but is tainted with a reputation for unscrupulous
money-politics.
The police further embarrassed the opposition last week by netting a Chart
Thai MP in a raid on a gambling den. The move may be part of a campaign by
the ruling five-party coalition to regain the parliamentary initiative,
which they appeared to lose when a proposal to reform the constitution was
recently humiliatingly defeated.
Earlier Mr Prasong Soonsiri, the foreign minister, alleged that seven more
serving and 10 former MPs are blacklisted by the US for suspected drug
trafficking. Only one was named: a Chart Pattana (national progress) MP, Mr
Mongkol Chongsuthamanee.

FT  23 MAY 94 / International Press Review: BBC feels chill from China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be putting it mildly to describe the present relations between the
Chinese government and the British Broadcasting Corporation as ill-starred.
In the nearly half a century since the Communists came to power in 1949, the
atmosphere between the world's premier broadcaster and Beijing has hardly
been chillier - except perhaps during the bleak days of the Cultural
Revolution of the 1960's and 1970's.
But in that era most international media organisations were regarded with
suspicion, if not downright hostility, as purveyors of capitalist
propaganda.
In this latest phase, however, the BBC finds itself the object of particular
displeasure for transgressions, real or imagined, against China's interests.
The fact that these tensions also coincide with the continuing row between
Beijing and London over Hong Kong is not helping matters.
In the latest incident, China expressed outrage over a television
documentary which its makers said showed hitherto unrecorded footage of the
Chinese gulag, or prison camps, in China's far-west.
And, perhaps more irritating from the Chinese standpoint in the days leading
up to President Clinton's decision on whether to continue China's privileged
trade access to the US market, the BBC also reported that prison labour was
being used to make goods for export.
The US administration has laid down as one of its conditions for renewal of
China's Most Favoured Nation trading status an end to the export to the US
of items manufactured by prisoners.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official Xinhua
newsagency, described the BBC reports as 'sheer fabrication' and suggested
darkly that 'hostile people with sinister motives have gone out of their way
to smear China with fabricated stories'.
That rebuttal, which was not reported by local media was supported by an
unusually detailed statement from the Justice Ministry indicating more than
normal official sensitivity over the BBC report.
Whatever additional fallout may result from this most recent skirmishing, it
cannot improve an already fractious relationship which has resulted in
China-based BBC reporters being subjected to restrictions on their freedom
of movement and access to officials. Visas are also being denied to BBC
programmers seeking entry to China.
It is not the least of ironies that at a moment when China is proclaiming
its opening to the world, BBC reporters are finding to the contrary that
doors are being closed.
The BBC's relations with China reached a nadir last December when Beijing
reacted furiously - some might say over-reacted - to the BBC's screening of
a documentary on the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Chairman Mao
Zedong entitled: Chairman Mao: The Last Emperor.
Beijing unsuccessfully sought to have the film withheld and then protested
to Britain for what it described as the 'BBC's vicious TV programme'. China
was infuriated apparently by suggestions that Mao had until fairly late in
life enjoyed the company of teenage concubines, and sometimes more than one
at a time.
The programme also depicted the late Chinese leader as something of a tyrant
who had been the cause either directly or indirectly of the deaths of
millions in the mass campaigns that accompanied his idiosyncratic rule.
Chinese sensitivity over the BBC's output has been heightened by vast
improvements in the broadcaster's signal to China and by the advent of
satellite television. China, which exerted pressure on Mr Rupert Murdoch,
the Australian newspaper publisher, to drop BBC news broadcasts from his
Star satellite television network may have been emboldened in its criticism
of the BBC by his decision to do so ( Mr Murdoch insists the BBC was
banished to make way for Chinese language programmes more relevant to Star's
target audience).
But World Service Radio in both Chinese and English is widely received in
China, especially since a new transmitter was installed in Hong Kong in 1987
and other transmitters are operating from near China's borders in the former
Soviet Union.
Chinese concerns and mis-perceptions about the BBC, wilful or otherwise,
were exemplified by a commentary in the official Yangcheng Wanbao (Evening
News) published last year in which the paper lambasted the broadcaster's
intentions over plans to increase its transmissions to China.
'The BBC's main purpose in strengthening its broadcasting to China is to
speed up its all-round invasion against socialist countries both spiritually
and ideologically,' the commentator said, adding: 'When we listen to the
free-of-charge information others provide, we should be able to tell the
truth from falsehood, the beautiful from the ugly. And furthermore, we
shouldn't let counterfeit and low-grade foreign goods burst into our world.'
Such sentiments may be out of step with China's modernising image, but the
fact that they are fairly widely held, including, it appears, among those
responsible for foreign media, does not augur well for an early end to the
Sino-BBC chill.

<TEXT>
Months of speculation over the leadership of Australia's federal opposition
will come to a head in Canberra today, where Mr John Hewson, the incumbent,
has said he will throw the matter open to a vote.
Just over a year ago under Mr Hewson, the Liberal party lost a supposedly
'unlosable' election to Mr Paul Keating's Labor party. He regained some
ground last summer, when the Labor government's budget was stalled in
parliament for several months, but since then has seen his ranking in the
opinion polls fall sharply.
By contrast, the Keating government has pushed through a number of policy
initiatives including an aboriginal land title bill and a white paper on
employment and industry, and its standing with the electorate has risen. Its
latest budget proposals, announced earlier this month, contained a minimum
of new measures and thus run little risk of a repetition of last summer's
upheavals.
Pressure on Mr Hewson has increased over the past 10 days as a field of
alternative leadership candidates has narrowed. Mr Alexander Downer, the
opposition's spokesman on economic and treasury matters, and Mr Peter
Costello, a young lawyer MP, are heading the challenge.
Announcing his decision to hold a vote, Mr Hewson said he believed
speculation had gained such a momentum that it needed to be resolved as soon
as possible. He believed his chances of retaining his position were good: 'I
think I will win quite well'.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Indonesian trial sounds alarms: A bank case's political
overtones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Eddy Tansil, an Indonesian entrepreneur, went on trial last week on
charges of corruption, alarm bells rang throughout the country's close-knit
establishment.
The trial, one of the biggest alleged corruption scandals since Indonesia's
independence, could affect the reputation of many high-ranking government
officials. It could also signal the beginning of tighter supervision of
Indonesia's state-owned banks.
Mr Tansil, owner of Golden Key, a retail and manufacturing group, received a
Dollars 430m loan in 1992 from Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), the
government's development bank, supposedly to finance a petrochemical project
in West Java.
The prosecution alleges that the loan was never serviced and that the funds
were partly diverted to Hong Kong. Bapindo, though it continues to do
business, is now technically bankrupt and is expected to be rescued by the
government.
It had been an open secret that Indonesian state banks were riddled with bad
debts brought about by collusion between lenders and politically well
connected borrowers. According to the government, 21.2 per cent of their
loans were bad or doubtful at the end of last year, compared with 17.4 per
cent a year before and only 6 per cent in 1990.
These figures, however, came from the state banks themselves and the
situation could be a lot worse, bankers say. 'We might well see similar
cases being unearthed in the near future,' said a Jakarta-based banker.
The case has attracted public attention. One disappointed Indonesian wrote
in a local daily newspaper: 'I hope that the government punishes the
criminals and upholds justice because if they fail it means they are no
better than criminals themselves.'
The trials of Mr Tansil and Mr Maman Suparman, a former deputy branch
manager at Bapindo, began last week in packed court rooms amid yells and
catcalls from angry mobs.
Both were charged with corruption and violation of banking laws. Prosecutors
have been trying to establish during a four- month investigation how Mr
Tansil, who had little capital to back him up and had a history of
unsuccessful ventures in the motorcycle assembly and brewing businesses,
could have qualified for a Dollars 430m loan from Bapindo without
collateral.
The answer could lie with Mr Sudomo, former minister in charge of political
and security affairs and now a government adviser, and Mr J B Sumarlin, the
former finance minister and now chairman of the country's audit agency. Mr
Sudomo has admitted that he authorised the Bapindo loan for Mr Tansil, and
Mr Sumarlin is alleged by the prosecution to have overseen the loan.
Both are due to give evidence at Mr Tansil's trial, although they may be
allowed merely to have their testimony read out in court. Their
participation may help indicate how immune from investigation the state's
power brokers are in the Bapindo affair and how serious the government is
about putting a halt to illegal collusion between lenders and borrowers.
In the central Javanese town of Bandung, students tussled with police as
they demanded that Mr Sudomo and Mr Sumarlin stand trial for their role in
approving the loan.
Mr Tansil and Mr Suparman face a maximum penalty of life sentences in jail
under anti-corruption laws. The prosecution says that Mr Tansil obstructed
the government's efforts to develop the economy by his abuse of the loan
from Bapindo.
Mr Tansil's lawyers have said that their client did not receive demands or
warnings from the bank about servicing the loan, and that the alleged
deviations from legal banking practices were made with the blessing of
Bapindo executives.
'What makes the Bapindo case interesting is not so much that it happened but
that it was leaked to the public,' said a Jakarta-based diplomat. The case
hints at political wrangling taking place among the ruling elite.
Some bankers argue that details of the loan were leaked as part of an
attempt to discredit Jakarta's technocrats, of which Mr Sumarlin was one.
Goverment technocrats are channelling billions of dollars into developing
heavy industry, although some economists say this path of industrialisation
offers little comparative advantage.
Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, finance minister, told the Asian Development Bank's
annual meeting in France this month that Indonesian banks faced difficulties
and that the government would further strengthen banking regulation. The
outcome of the Bapindo case may show the extent of the government's
determination to carry out this promise.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Indian brokers braced as curb stays: Market faces difficult
week after collapse of talks to end the forward trading ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Indian stockbrokers are bracing themselves for a difficult week following
the collapse of talks on ending a two-month ban on forward trading.
Officials of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the nation's largest, and
representatives of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market
watchdog, last week failed to agree terms for lifting the ban that Sebi
imposed on March 12.
The ban contributed to a sharp fall in shares, which were also pushed down
by increases in US interest rates and profit-taking following an earlier
rally.
The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading stocks fell from a high in
February of more than 4,200 to a low of 3,600 before recovering recently to
around 3,800, partly on hopes of a settlement of the forward trading row.
Volumes have also fallen sharply because the forward trading ban has greatly
reduced the scope for speculative trading with borrowed funds.
Sebi imposed the ban after failing to persuade stockbrokers to adopt
transparent rules for the forward market - a long-established and informal
market called Badla. Sebi believes Badla is easily abused by brokers for
price manipulation at the expense of client investors. It also argues that
Badla gives brokers opportunities for excessively risky leveraged forward
trading.
The brokers retort that some speculation is essential to provide liquidity
to the market. They claim they are ready to propose new rules tn ensure
greater fairness but these have been rejected by Sebi.
While the brokers are angry at the failure of last week's talks, they are
likely to try to make fresh proposals to Sebi, because forward trading is
essential to their business.
In a speech at the weekend, Mr A N Kolhatkar, the Bombay Stock Exchange
executive director, said that discussions were in deadlock but new
alternative solutions were likely to emerge in the next few months.
Mr S S Nadkarni, the Sebi chairman, has said that he is ready to discuss
details of proposed reforms but 'there is no going back on the principles
which led to the ban'.
To make matters worse for the brokers, the growth of foreign portfolio
investment, which was soaring in the months to February, has tailed off. Net
investments by foreign institutions fell from Dollars 398m in January and
Dollars 245m in February to Dollars 180m in March and Dollars 163m in April.
The main causes of the decline were the worldwide stock market correction
and settlement difficulties in India, though the Badla ban may also have
contributed.

Former Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi launched a crusade at the weekend to
remove President Boris Yeltsin and widen Russia to the boundaries of the old
Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Marking his return to the political fray, Mr Rutskoi proclaimed an end to
any compromise with the man who, in his eyes, sought to humiliate him in the
struggle that ended in bloodshed last October.
Mr Rutskoi scored a political triumph in winning re-election as head of the
renamed Russian Social Democratic People's Party, which appeared in October
to have turned against him. Few in its ranks backed him publicly after he
led an armed rebellion against Mr Yeltsin in the name of the parliament the
president had summarily dissolved.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Loan for Russian banking sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The World Bank and the European bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) will provide the bulk of a Dollars 390m (Pounds 260m) loan to build
up a core group of 30 to 40 Russian commercial banks capable of acting as a
catalyst for wider development of the banking sector.
The aim is to improve the quality of banking services and enable the core
group to form the basis of a private clearing bank system. Technical and
other assistance will also be provided to help them qualify as 'on-lenders'
of World Bank and other international credit lines.
The World Bank, whose board approved its 17-year loan for Dollars 200m of
the total, said the loan would promote 'twinning' with western banks and
modernise and standardise management and information systems. But it would
also be used to train central bank inspectors and create early warning
systems to detect problem banks.
The World Bank also approved a Dollars 175m loan to support private
enterprise in Romania, of which Dollars 102m will finance projects to raise
the competitiveness of industrial exporters and Dollars 70m for export
finance. Loans will be channelled through five selected Romanian banks.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Serb pledge to quit Gorazde zone

Bosnian Serb leaders have reiterated their pledge to withdraw from a 3km
exclusion zone around Gorazde, the south-eastern Moslem enclave which is a
United Nations 'safe area', to try to pave the way for an overall ceasefire.
Some 150 Bosnian Serb troops were due to withdraw by yesterday afternoon.
The Serbs were up to 1km deep in the UN exclusion zone, set up four weeks
ago under threat of further Nato air strikes.
The Moslem-led Bosnian government has refused to return to the negotiating
table until Serb forces comply with their pledge.
But even after Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, wrote to Bosnian and
Serb leaders proposing renewed truce negotiations, both sides reported
fighting along key supply lines in northern and eastern Bosnia.
Tanjug, the Serbian news agency, said that five people were wounded on
Saturday night when Bosnian Croat forces bombarded Brcko, at the eastern end
of the corridor which joins Belgrade to Serb-held land in Bosnia and
Croatia.
Bosnian Croat forces have fought alongside their Moslem counterparts in the
northern Sava River valley since the eruption of war 25 months ago while
elsewhere their alliance was restored only in March in an agreement brokered
by Washington.
After the agreement, Croat leaders have turned their attention to the status
of Serb-held territory in Croatia. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia at
the weekend warned that he would use 'all possible means' if Serb leaders of
the self-styled state failed to accept Zagreb's authority within four
months.
Brcko, which was mostly Moslem before the war, is now held by Serb forces
and is viewed as the next possible flashpoint because of its importance to
all three communities. Serb forces control about 70 per cent of Bosnian
territory, but Moslems have advanced in the region and may try to sever the
corridor.
UN officials said Serb forces shelled Tuzla, the second biggest Bosnian
government stronghold, shortly after the attack on Brcko.
A Spanish UN soldier and his interpreter were killed yesterday when an
armoured personnel carrier crashed near Mostar in southern Bosnia.
Three soldiers were also injured in the accident, as the vehicle went off
the road.
Spain has around 1,400 troops serving with the United Nations peacekeeping
forces in Bosnia, mostly concentrated around Mostar.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Ukraine seeks recipe for economic survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's economy is in deep crisis. Production has fallen an estimated 40
per cent compared with last year and both its currency and state revenues
have plunged.
Inflation has been screwed down from hyperinflationary levels to around 6
per cent a month and official unemployment is a mere 100,000 people. But
this is achieved, economists say, at the cost of idle plants and millions of
workers paid - or more often not paid - to do nothing.
The plight of the economy, and possible reforms to drag it out of the mire,
were discussed yesterday by international economists at a conference in Kiev
organised by the World Bank, the Kiev International Centre for Advanced
Studies and the Economic Policy journal.
Among those on the podium were Mr Leszek Balczerowicz, the former deputy
prime minister of Poland, Mr Sergei Vasiliev, deputy economics minister of
Russia, and Professor Jeffrey Sachs, the highest-profile western adviser to
the economies in transition. Mr Balczerowicz, the inspiration behind Polish
reforms in 1990 and 1991, told the audience that Poland in 1989 was in a
similar position to Ukraine today, with suppressed hyperinflation, a command
economy and little private sector. 'A radical programme can work,' Mr
Balczerowicz said, 'so long as it includes stabilisation of the currency,
privatisation and a unified exchange rate' - none of which Ukraine at
present has.
Mr Vasiliev, in the rare role for a Russian minister of being seen as the
representative of a success story, said that 'if Ukraine continues on the
road it is now on it has no chance of coming out of its crisis. Experience
shows that the more rapidly you go, the faster you get out.'
Mr Victor Pynzenyk, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and a former
reformist deputy prime minister with responsibility for the economy,
commented: 'We in Ukraine have chosen to show the word that we can commit
every possible mistake on the road to a market economy.'
Mr Daniel Kaufman, the head of the World Bank mission in Kiev, said that the
black economy was now growing rapidly - despite increasingly desperate
efforts by the government to tighten its grip on the state sector.
'Literally speaking, assets, capital, activities and entrepreneurs have
departed from the official economy (but) the emergence and growth of the
unofficial economy does demonstrate the entrepreneurship, creativity and
ability to adapt and survive of Ukraine's citizens.
'This bodes well for the future,' said Mr Kaufman.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Talks in Moscow toend Crimean crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine hold urgent talks in Moscow today
in an attempt to defuse mounting tension in Crimea, amid predictions that
confrontation between the two Slav states over the fate of the disputed
peninsula could lead to bloodshed.
Tension was fuelled on Friday when the Crimean parliament voted to unfreeze
a decision taken two years ago to adopt a separate constitution, - an act
viewed by Ukraine as tantamount to a declaration of independence.
A delegation of Crimean deputies led by Mr Sergei Tsekov, the speaker of
parliament, will meet leading Ukrainian deputies in Kiev tomorrow.
The rhetoric - if not so far the actions - has been threatening on both
sides.
Mr Mykola Mykhalchenko, the domestic policy adviser to Ukraine's president,
Mr Leonid Kravchuk, said at the weekend that 'it is time to remind world
opinion that Ukraine is a nuclear power'.
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, said that if Ukrainian
troops were sent in to Crimea to enforce Ukrainian rule, 'conflict is
inevitable'. Reports of Ukrainian special forces moving in to the peninsula
have been denied in Kiev - as have Ukrainian reports of a tank and a missile
batallion being moved in by the pro-Russian Black Sea Fleet command.
However, security at the Crimean parliament has been stepped up, with armed
guards and snipers deployed on the roof.
Mr Tsekov, speaking in the Crimean capital of Simferopol on Saturday, said
that a majority in the parliament wanted union with Russia - although other
Crimean deputies insist that Friday's decision remains within Ukrainian law.
Tensions have flared between Kiev and Crimea since Ukraine became an
independent state in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Though
Crimeans, nearly 70 per cent of whom are ethnic Russian, voted for an
independent Ukraine in 1991, the country's appalling economic decline has
driven the Russian majority to seek integration with Russia.
Mr Yuri Meshkov, the Crimean president, was elected earlier this year by the
large Russian majority in the region on a ticket of union with Russia.
The animosity between Simferopol and Kiev has been exacerbated by the
growing links between Crimea and the Russian authorities.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, repeated Russia's desire
for a peaceful settlement in a letter to Mr Anatoly Zlenko, his Ukrainian
counterpart.
However, Mr Kozyrev also said that it was essential to 'respect the
sovereign will of the people' - a formula which could imply support for the
Crimean parliament's decision.
Ukraine's present disputes with Russia centre on the status of Crimea and
the Black Sea Fleet, the supply of Russian gas and the payment of Ukraine's
vast debt to Russia.
The fleet, based in Sevastopol, is nominally under the joint command of Mr
Kravchuk and the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, but is
Russian-controlled. The meeting of the two prime ministers today will
address the fleet issue - though some half a dozen meetings and agreements
over the past two years have not resulted in a treaty to which the two sides
have felt able to adhere.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Russia firm on Nato treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, will tomorrow tell Nato
leaders in Brussels that Russia insists on a special treaty with Nato,
recognising its status as a military superpower, before it will agree to
join the Partnership for Peace.
The Partnership, announced in January, is designed to bring former Communist
states into an association with Nato - falling short of the full membership
which the central European and Baltic countries have requested and which
Russia sees as a threat.
Gen Grachev yesterday told the official Tass newsagency that President Boris
Yeltsin, who has approved the defence minister's plan, expects recognition
of Russia's special status.
'This can be done either with the aid of a protocol within the bounds of the
Partnership programme or by a joint document signed by Nato and the Russian
Federation.'
In an interview last week in the weekly Moscow News, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the
Russian foreign minister, laid out the basic conditions for such a protocol.
These were, he said, an agreement on common approaches between the two
military powers which recognised their 'global strengths and
responsibilities'; a commitment by Nato to invest in military conversion in
Russia; and a commitment to extend joint peacekeeping and joint political
consultations.
Nato leaders maintain that Russia must join the Partnership on the same
terms as all other members, but have stressed that Russia's size and
military might confer on it a special status. Speaking in the Latvian
capital of Riga on Saturday, Mr Luc Bouvard, president of the North Atlantic
Assembly, said Nato 'would never tolerate' a position where any Partnership
member state had veto rights or could dictate rules to Nato.

FT  23 MAY 94 / The Lopez affair becomes a saga: A cycling nymph and a
silent Swede put under the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the lengthening drama of the Lopez affair, there have already been many
episodes in which things have not always been quite what they seemed. So it
was with the cycling nymph, the muscular detective, the silent Swede and the
sacked motor industry executive who joined the saga last week.
They made their entrances in a scene carefully stage-managed by Volkswagen,
the automotive group whose production chief, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, is under criminal investigation based on suspicions that he and
colleagues stole industrial secrets from their former employer, General
Motors.
Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, got wind of things to come when it
received a list of questions from Stern, the popular weekly magazine, from
which it was apparent that Stern, working with the ARD television station,
had learnt that Opel lawyers last year set private detectives on the
suspects' trail. Spiegel magazine, always well informed on the case, ran a
pre-emptive story in its May 16 issue, featuring a girl and her bicycle. Ms
X, working for the PSS private detective agency, last summer apparently
suffered a puncture outside a Braunschweig house occupied by two of Mr
Lopez's lieutenants and fellow suspects, Mr Rosario Piazza and Mr Jorge
Alvarez.
The gallant young Piazza helped, drove her back to her hotel. Telephone
numbers were exchanged, and there versions of subsequent events diverge
sharply.
On May 17, Volkswagen moved. The suspects' five lawyers issued a statement
directed at Ms Dorothea Holland, the state prosecutor in charge of the
official case. It listed a series of 'indications' calling into question her
impartiality and professional standards in relation to the activities of the
cyclist and her fellow private eye, Mr Jean-Louis Royet. The thrust of the
claims was that information on the use of private detectives and the
information they gathered had been kept - against the rules - from VW's
legal representatives. Mr Gerhard Schroder, a member of the VW supervisory
board and prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony, which owns 20 per
cent of VW, simultaneously broke months of silence with a suggestion that
the official investigation should be closed.
Mr Royet, a heftily built martial arts fan and a part-time private detective
at PSS (run by his wife, Dagmar) had in the interim also proved to be a
full-time officer in the Rhineland-Pfalz state criminal investigation
bureau. The expose was to cost him his badge.
He made his first full appearance in the ARD broadcast, 'The Battle of the
Giants', transmitted last Wednesday. He had been photographed at work last
summer in Braunschweig. Also featured was an indignant Mr Eberhard Kempf,
the lawyer acting for Mr Alvarez, who also (as Opel pointed out) had acted
for the journalist who made the programme. Then there was another new
character, Mr Hans Huskes, recently fired from his post as a senior
executive at GM Europe. He, as GM was to reveal in the interim, was being
investigated by the Swiss authorities for unspecified alleged professional
crimes.
His contribution to the film comprised mainly a declaration of faith in Mr
Lopez. He provided a human touch in a programme dominated by journalistic
speculation and interspersed with shots of four cardboard boxes which once
contained documents and other data allegedly stolen from GM. Found last
June, they are now held in a police evidence store.
One former resident in the house where the boxes were discovered (vacated by
co-tenants Mr Piazza and Mr Alvarez shortly before the discovery) said he
recognised only three. There were distorted echoes here of VW's claims of
last year that 'evidence' could have been planted, but no more than
innuendo. The film moved on to a Mr Andersson, a Swedish engineer, filmed
sitting in his car as the reporter yelled in German: 'Now you have another
chance to tell the truth]' Mr Andersson, the man who handed the boxes to the
police, and who is believed to speak only Swedish and English, reversed
away.
Although the Stern article, the ARD programme and the lawyers' statement
were clearly linked and co-ordinated, they yielded some effects which VW
might count as 'positive'. Most important, the events prompted the legal
authorities to forbid the investigating office to issue any further press
comments. An erratic trickle of information from Ms Holland - virtually all
apparently damaging to the VW side - has accelerated lately. VW may draw
some small comfort from having at last managed to score a few points in the
media campaign.
But the lawyers' attack on the credibility and impartiality of Ms Holland,
despite the backing from the political weight of Mr Schroder, who has
ambitions to be federal chancellor, foundered. All the charges were promptly
and convincingly dismissed by her superior, Mr Hans-Christoph Schaefer, head
of the state of Hesse's prosecution service.
Following Mr Schaefer's intervention, Ms Holland, the character around whom
much of the action has revolved, is off the stage until the denouement. The
question now is whether the protagonists have the will to continue the
public battle. Neither seems to have any inclination to be seen to be
backing off, but both know it is likely to be some months yet before Ms
Holland makes her next and decisive entrance.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Andreotti denies Mafia charge: Former PM angered by Sicily's
moves to put him on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy, has condemned as
'absurd and unfounded' charges that he had links with the Mafia, following
Saturday's call by Sicilian magistrates that he should stand trial.
Most of yesterday's Italian newspapers carried interviews with Mr Andreotti,
75, a life member of Italy's upper house of parliament, in which he talked
of his 'bitterness' about the Palermo magistrates decision, which leaked out
on Saturday.
The magistrates will this week ask their judicial superiors to order the
trial of Mr Andreotti, which would be one of the most sensational court
cases ever to be held in Italy.
But the former Christian Democrat prime minister also said he was relieved
that he would be able to reply publicly to the charges, more than a year
after he was told that he was being investigated.
'Obviously I would have preferred the prosecutors to shelve the case, and it
would have been the logical conclusion from my point of view,' Mr Andreotti
told La Stampa. 'However I understand, given the way in which they started
off the procedure - accusing me of being the 'Roman centre' for all Mafia
business - it wasn't easy to turn back.'
The Palermo magistrates, working on the basis of confessions from Mafia
pentiti, have alleged that Mr Andreotti consorted with gang bosses, and even
kissed top Mafia boss Mr Salvatore 'Toto' Riina, as a mark of respect, at a
meeting in 1987. The former prime minister again denied at the weekend that
it would have been possible for him to shake off his police escort for such
a meeting.
Mr Andreotti has resolutely refused to give up the political limelight since
the Palermo magistrates' investigation first came to light. Last week he was
prominent in the senate, the Italian parliament's upper house, when he
opposed the new right-wing government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi in a vote of
confidence.
Mr Antonio Martino, Italy's foreign minister, yesterday flew to Washington
to reassure the US administration over the policies of its new conservative
coalition, which includes neo-fascists for the first time in 50 years,
Reuter reports from Rome.
Mr Martino, a member of the Forza Italia party of the prime minister, Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, will hold talks with the US secretary of state, Mr Warren
Christopher, and the national security adviser, Mr Anthony Lake. The foreign
minister is visiting Washington at a time of international concern over the
presence of five ministers from the neo-fascist-led National Alliance (NA)
in Mr Berlusconi's coalition, which also includes the federalist Northern
League. Three of the five NA ministers are from the Italian Social Movement.
Mr Martino's trip to Washington is seen as a continuation of a mission,
begun last week, when he visited Brussels in an attempt to reassure European
Union colleagues.
In Brussels, Mr Martino won praise from the British foreign secretary, Mr
Douglas Hurd, who called for early talks between UK prime minister John
Major and Mr Berlusconi.

Virgin Stores, which defied a French ban on Sunday trading, quietly
triumphed at the weekend after the government dropped the ban, Reuter
reports from Paris.
'Our stores open seven days a week,' said a recorded telephone answer at the
company's Virgin Megastore on the Champs Elysees.
Virgin Megastore, part of Mr Richard Branson's business empire, opened its
doors on three successive Sundays last summer, angering unions and risking
huge fines in its fight against the government for the right to trade on
Sundays.
Virgin eventually agreed to abide by the law pending a legal review. Despite
trade union opposition, the French official gazette on Friday published new
regulations allowing Sunday trading in leisure goods in tourist areas.
Virgin Stores manager, Mr Patrick Zelnik, had argued that 20 per cent of the
store's annual 8m customers came on Sundays and closure on these days would
cut sharply into profits.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Obituary: Goria, Italy's youngest prime minister, dies at 50
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giovanni Goria, 50, who served briefly as post-war Italy's youngest prime
minister and was the first major politician to stand trial in the country's
massive corruption scandal, died at the weekend.
Mr Goria, whose coalition governed from July 1987 to March 1988, died at his
home in Asti in north-eastern Italy from a lung tumour which had
deteriorated in the past month.
The Christian Democratic party he joined in 1960 changed its name to the
Popular Party earlier this year before the March elections in which they
were punished for the corruption scandal which also touched Mr Goria.
He studied economics, entered parliament in 1976 and often described himself
as 'an accountant turned politician'. He became one of the youngest
Christian Democrats to told key posts, serving as treasury minister in
several coalitions.
In a message to Mr Goria's widow, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi praised
his 'generous, passionate and long political commitment'.
Last February Mr Goria became the first major politician to stand trial on
charges resulting from Italy's seemingly endless corruption investigations.
He denied accusations that he agreed to a cut of a L7bn (Pounds 2.92m) bribe
to be paid by companies given a contract to build a hospital in his home
town.
Work on the L230bn hospital was stopped by the scandal and the alleged
kickback was never handed over to Mr Goria or his 10 co-defendants.
The trial, which embittered Mr Goria as his health failed, is still in
progress.
Mr Goria was the surprise choice to form the country's 47th government since
the second world war after the collapse of a coalition headed by Mr Bettino
Craxi in 1987.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Fugitive Schneider fails to surface
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER, ANGUS FOSTER and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, SAO PAULO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly a month after the international hunt started for fugitive German
businessman Jurgen Schneider, the world's police forces have drawn an
embarrassing blank.
Germany's Federal Criminal Office - the Bundeskriminalamt - said at the
weekend it had made little headway in tracking down Mr Schneider, who is
alleged to have misappropriated at least DM218m (Pounds 87.2m) of his
collapsed property group's funds before disappearing last month.
The Bundeskriminalamt, which has set up a special unit to deal with the
case, has passed on details of Mr Schneider to other national police forces
via the 174-member Interpol organisation in Lyons.
The German police force's task is to find proof necessary to support the
charge of fraud against the missing executive brought by Frankfurt
prosecutors on April 26.
Since he failed to return to Germany from a holiday in Tuscany at the
beginning of April, the whereabouts of Mr Schneider, 59, has been the
subject of widespread speculation. He has been reported to have been in a
variety of places, including Paraguay, Switzerland, Tehran, Florida, London
and even Frankfurt.
But the reports so far have been insufficient to persuade the
Bundeskriminalamt to send agents to particular parts of the world to locate
him, a spokesman said. 'The trail has gone dead: the German police do not
know which way to look,' said one investigator.
The latest reported sighting came at the weekend, when a Swiss newspaper
reported that Mr Schneider was hiding in a mountain hut. However, the Swiss
authorities said they had no information to confirm or deny the report.
Other interested parties in the search for Mr Schneider are German banks,
which are owed DM5bn by the collapsed property group. Deutsche Bank,
Germany's biggest bank, which claims DM500m of its money could be at risk,
said it received 'several phone calls a day' from people claiming they knew
where Mr Schneider was. The bank passed any useful information to the police
since 'we are not manhunters', the bank said.
One of the focal points in the search is Paraguay, where there have been at
least two alleged sightings of Mr Schneider. In the past, Paraguay has
harboured a number of German criminals, many of them linked to the Nazi
party, and the country has a large German community. The Aktuelle Rundschau,
Paraguay's main German-language newspaper, is following up several leads.
A spokesman for Paraguay's immigration department said: 'Legally, he is not
here. But he could have entered illegally under a different name.'
The Bundeskriminalamt said that for the moment it was engaged in 'normal
police work', sifting through documents confiscated last month from Mr
Schneider's former headquarters in a castle in Konigstein, near Frankfurt.
Mr Schneider is also under investigation by the finance ministry in the
state of Hesse for alleged tax evasion. This inquiry was launched after
numerous Schneider employees reported income on which they had not paid tax,
worrying that they might face charges of tax evasion.
The German banks have been tight-lipped about steps they may be taking to
locate Mr Schneider or the money. They launched a successful action last
month to freeze SFr200m (Pounds 93.4m) of Schneider funds traced to a number
of Swiss banks. But the banks refused to confirm whether this cash was the
DM219m Mr Schneider is known to have transferred out of Germany in March
before he went missing.
Popular cynicism that the reappearance of Mr Schneider on German soil could
embarrass the banks, with detailed disclosures of his connections to big
business and government, have fuelled speculation and interest in his
whereabouts.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Treuhand financing for Eko Stahl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency will for the next two months finance Eko
Stahl, eastern Germany's loss-making steel mill, following the decision by
Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel manufacturers, not to buy the mill.
The steel complex is losing DM150m (Pounds 60m) a year on a turnover of
DM1bn. At the same time, the Treuhand is still determined to find a buyer
for the mill, despite comments made by Mr Karel van Miert, the European
Union's competition commissioner, who said last week that the EU's rescue
package for steel was dead.
The original EU package, unveiled last December, envisaged cutting 25m-30m
tonnes of crude steel capacity out of a total 170m tonnes. Part of the
package included backing a DM813m investment and modernisation plan by the
German government for Eko Stahl, which is located in Eisenhuttenstadt, close
to the Polish border.
That plan had been contingent on the Treuhand selling the mill to Riva,
which in turn would have invested more than DM1bn in transforming Eko Stahl
into an integrated steel mill producing 900,000 tonnes of steel a year.
According to Eko Stahl officials, the collapse of the Riva deal, and
confusion within the EU on how to introduce capacity cuts, reduces the
chances of finding a buyer willing to invest in an integrated mill.
An integrated steel mill could help reduce some of Eko Stahl's losses,
particularly transport costs, according to the Halle Institute for Economic
Research, one of the six think tanks advising the government. Eko Stahl
currently ships its slabs for hot-rolling to plants in western Germany. They
are then returned to east Germany and cold-rolled. The Halle Institute says
each tonne of transported steel costs DM100.
To cut these costs, the Treuhand had intended to integrate Eko Stahl's
steel-making and its steel-processing operations by building a new
hot-rolling mill. The agency has received no takers for this plan following
the collapse of the Riva deal.
Thyssen, Germany's biggest steel manufacturer, which earlier led a
consortium to buy 50 per cent of Eko Stahl's cold-rolling mill, still sees
prospects for a cold-rolling mill for Eko Stahl. But the Treuhand argues
this would make Eko Stahl dependent on west German steel manufacturers, and
would entail further job losses.
The mill employed nearly 12,000 people in 1989, and produced more than 3.5m
tonnes of steel. It has since reduced its work force to 3,000, and its
annual capacity to under 1m tonnes.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Spain drafts bill to fight official corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish authorities have drafted a bill to reform the country's penal
code in a move to close loopholes and crack down on corruption.
The reforms, presented at the weekend, were drawn up at short notice
following a political storm and a series of high-level resignations over
corruption scandals.
Mr Juan Alberto Belloch, appointed earlier this month to head both the
justice and interior ministries, described the proposed reforms as
'revolutionary'. .
However, the conservative opposition Popular party, described the measures
as 'electoralist' in the run-up to next month's European elections and
regional elections in Andalucia in which the ruling Socialist party is
expected to suffer heavy setbacks.
The draft bill provides for jail terms of between one and three years for
government employees who use public property for their own benefit.
In what is seen as a preventive measures, it also provides exemption for
people who denounce civil servants for accepting or seeking bribes.
Measures against insider dealing on the stock market are also tightened.
The bill provides for prison sentences of between one and four years, as
well as fines, for use of privileged information - one of the allegations
made against Mr Mariano Rubio, the former Bank of Spain governor currently
on bail.
In severe cases the penalty for insider trading can be increased to six
years.
People refusing to testify to parliamentary committees may also in future
face prison sentences of between six months and a year, or up to two years'
imprisonment in the case of civil servants.
Separate legislation is being prepared to tighten up on tax fraud.
The measures were among a series of steps promised last month by Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, the prime minister, in an effort to stem the controversy over
corruption and financial misconduct by senior officials.
Other moves include setting up a special prosecutor's office to deal with
corruption and strengthening the powers of the Audit Tribunal, which comes
under the authority of parliament and is responsible for monitoring public
finances.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Shadow cabinet splits three ways over leadership: Brown
starts his campaign to head Labour with appeal to socialist values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, SWANSEA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The shadow cabinet was last night divided between three candidates for the
party's leadership as Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, launched his claim
with an appeal to traditional socialist values.
Mr Brown, delivering the keynote speech at Labour's annual Welsh conference
in Swansea, sought to shore up his standing on the left of the party with a
strong appeal to 'enduring' socialist values, and fierce attacks on the City
of London, privatisation and means-testing for pensions.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, will launch his candidacy in a speech
tomorrow, as unofficial campaigning accelerates after the burial of Mr John
Smith, former leader.
Friends of Mr Blair, the party's leading modernist, said he would also seek
to increase his appeal to the left with an 'inclusive and radical' campaign
platform to combine Labour's traditional values with modern policies.
Mr Blair has strong support in the shadow cabinet, but backing is flowing to
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, who is strongly
supported on the left of the party. Mr Brown is running third.
Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment secretary, appears to
have no firm shadow cabinet support, although support for him is emerging
among trade union leaders.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, praised Mr Brown and Mr
Prescott for their commitment to Labour's policy of full employment. Senior
Labour officials say there is no doubt that Mr Prescott will be endorsed by
other union leaders if he chooses to stand.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting leader, also appears to be without support
among her senior colleagues. Mrs Beckett has not decided whether to stand,
but is expected to continue as deputy leader.
Shadow ministers are refusing to endorse candidates publicly, in accordance
with a shadow cabinet ban on campaigning until after the European parliament
elections on June 9. However, Mr Blair is believed to have the support of Mr
Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, Mrs Ann Taylor (education), Mr
Jack Straw (local government), and Ms Mo Mowlam (national heritage), who is
expected to act as campaign manager.
Mr Brown is thought to be backed by Mr Tom Clarke (development), Mr Donald
Dewar (social security) and Mr George Robertson (Scotland). However, Mr
Dewar and Mr Robertson would back Mr Blair if Mr Brown stood aside. Mr David
Clark (defence) is said to be undecided between Mr Blair and Mr Brown.
Mr Cook is believed to have the support of Mr Frank Dobson (transport), Ms
Joan Lestor (children) and Mr Michael Meacher (open government). Mr David
Blunkett (health) and Mr Chris Smith (environmental protection) are said to
be undecided between Mr Cook and Mr Blair. Mr Ron Davies (Wales) is also
thought to favour Mr Cook.
The level of support for Mr Cook is likely to hamper efforts by Mr Blair's
camp to persuade him to withdraw from the race and offer his support to the
shadow home secretary. Mr Cook has not decided whether to accept a formal
nomination for the leadership, but he is under strong pressure not to
withdraw.
Labour's ruling national executive committee will decide on Wednesday to
ignore leftwing calls for an autumn election and accept formal nominations
for a four or five-week cam-paign starting immediately after the June
European elections.
Senior shadow ministers say there is a growing belief that at least three
candidates will stand, forcing the party to use a preferential voting system
for the first time in a leadership election.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Heseltine plans bar on regional pricing at Royal Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to draw up legally binding contracts to prevent a
privatised Royal Mail from introducing regional price differentials.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has told Tory MPs that
the green paper on the Post Office will contain the proposed contracts
guaranteeing a uniform tariff at an affordable price.
But the possibility of BT introducing regional phone pricing has swollen the
ranks of Tory backbenchers worried that Mr Heseltine's plan to float 51 per
cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce could lead to a similar development
in mail services.
A number of Tory MPs regarded as 'Post Office sceptics', rather than
outright opponents of flotation, have warned they would vote against
privatisation unless Mr Heseltine gave 'cast iron guarantees' preventing
regional pricing.
Mr Richard Alexander, MP for Newark, said: 'If there was any suggestion of
regional pricing when it come to the Post Office - even if it was a few
years ahead - I would be opposed to privatisation.'
Another Tory MP privately said the possibility of regional pricing by BT may
force the government to amend or even drop its plan to sell a majority stake
in Royal Mail and Parcelforce.
He said many of his colleagues were very concerned that BT last week flagged
regional phone pricing as an option after the introduction of a new charging
system next year.
Although BT claims to have no immediate plans to introduce regional pricing,
the option is attractive as the company confronts stronger competition from
rival operators.
Mercury, BT's main long-distance competitor, already engages in regional
pricing. It is running a promotion in the Cardiff region offering
residential customers a third off standard long-distance Mercury tariffs.
Some BT executives fear that its ability to compete will be limited unless
it can react in like manner.
Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East, said: 'This is the slippery
slope. There are genuine worries being expressed about the effects of
privatisation, not for reasons of dogma but simply as a consequence of the
introduction of regional price differentials.'
At the time of gas privatisation assurances were given that price
differentials on a regional basis would not happen, although the government
recently agreed that remote regions could be charged more. Assurances were
also given at BT's privatisation that national tariffs would remain intact.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Sale of Railtrack may raise Pounds 3.5bn before next
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to privatise Railtrack, the railway infrastructure
company, before the next election, in a public sale which could be worth up
to Pounds 3.5bn.
The Treasury and the Department of Transport believe Railtrack's move into
the private sector could be completed at the end of the 1995-96 financial
year.
Ministers from both departments are confident it would receive cabinet
backing since it would be the final act of railway privatisation and would
not need primary legislation.
'Unlike Post Office privatisation, the sale of Railtrack would be relatively
free of controversy,' said one minister.
The flotation of the company owning rail track and signalling has been given
greater impetus by the Department of Trade and Industry's victory in its
battle with the Treasury to delay privatisation of the nuclear industry
until after the general election.
A value of about Pounds 3.5bn is expected to be placed on Railtrack. While
some officials believe it could be worth up to Pounds 4bn, ministers believe
a lower value is more realistic because of the 'high public policy risk'.
Railtrack is reliant for most of its revenue on track access charges, which
private rail companies have to pay for the right to run their trains on the
national rail network.
While the access charges are set by Railtrack, they have to be approved by
the rail regulator. A franchising director will be responsible for
allocating subsidies to the franchisees run by private rail companies,
British Rail management buy-outs or directly by BR.
Although any Railtrack prospectus would have to spell out the regulator's
intentions on future access charges, potential investors may still be
concerned that the regulator could force Railtrack to lower its charges.
Until the end of 1996 the regulator must also take account of 'any guidance'
from the transport secretary.
However, ministers dismiss the possibility of government interference when
the company is privatised.
Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, has said publicly that the
government's railway bill has paved the way for his company's privatisation.
He believes there is no need for a commercially driven public sector
organisation to be subject to what he called 'the full detailed panoply of
nationalised industry controls'.
Ministers have yet to decide whether all the shares in a private Railtrack
should be sold at once or whether the government should continue with a
minority stake.
Their intention, however, is to sell all the company at the earliest
possible opportunity.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Brussels to name single-market laggards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is to publish a rogues gallery of member states with
the worst records on adopting EU legislation, amid concerns that offending
nations are holding up completion of the single market.
A senior single market official said: 'We are going to name names, and
publish tables that show, in declining order, the performance by the
different states in different areas. It is time people realised who has done
what they were supposed to do, and who hasn't'
The use of public humiliation tactics to highlight performance in specific
areas, such as banking, comes 18 months after barriers to trade and free
movement in the EU were supposed to end.
The move is part of an overall effort by Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi,
internal market commissioner, to maintain momentum behind Europe's grand
project.
Other measures include the launch of 'internal market weeks' in the 12
member states, during which citizens and enterprises will have access to
Commission experts via a telephone hotline. It will also provide feedback
for the Commission on how the project is working.
Although four-fifths of the necessary legislation has been adopted by member
states, the Commission is concerned that in certain areas - particularly
banking, other financial services and public procurement - countries have
dragged their feet.
The exercise is planned as a follow-up to next month's ministerial meeting
in Luxembourg to discuss the internal market. Generally, assessments show
that Denmark and the UK have been quickest to adopt Commission legislation
on the single market, while Greece and Spain have been the laggards. Italy
is somewhere in the middle.
An analysis of individual sectors shows sharply diverging performances.
Germany, for example, has still to adopt nine directives on public
procurement. Greece and Germany have also been sent warning letters over
their failure to adopt certain banking directives.
'From June onwards we will turn up the spotlight and really try to push
people to finish all the unfinished business,' the official said.
'In the past, people have tried to avoid being bottom of the league. Now we
are going to move the debate away from who is top and who is bottom to
focusing on what is happening in certain key areas.'
Another area of particular concern to single market officials is the high
number of complaints about remaining technical barriers to trade. There is
also significant grievance over the failure of member states to mutually
recognise national product standards.
The official added: 'We have a problem with mutual recognition where people
are supposed to accept products that have been recognised in one country in
another. It is clear that this principle is very foreign to your average
local inspector.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Southern Yemen declares new state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Yemeni leaders early this morning announced that they were seceding
from united Yemen and declared a separate state, four years after North and
South Yemen united.
The announcement was made by Yemeni Vice President Ali Salem al-Baidh, the
country's southern leader. He said general elections would be held a year
from now.
The move was a slap in the face for the north which only hours before had
announced a three day ceasefire starting today to mark the Moslem feast of
Eid.
Earlier however North Yemeni military forces had stepped up their attacks on
Aden, firing two missiles into the port city and shelling a vital military
base 60 km to the north. Southern officials said one missile hit Aden's
airport, while the other was shot down over the harbour. No deaths or
injuries were reported in the attack. The missile attack broke northern
promises made last week not to bomb southern cities.
Northern troops also kept up pressure on the southern military base at
al-Anad, 60 km north of Aden, shelling the base overnight. Southern forces
were said to be counter-attacking with prolonged air attacks and ground
bombardment.
As the civil war entered its third week Western observers said al-Anad was a
vital defensive position for the south. Journalists approached to within 3
km of the camp yesterday but were prevented by heavy artillery fire from
getting closer to the battle.
Northern forces are also reported to be massing at Zinjibar, about 60 km
east of Aden. But western observers say southern defences have already
repulsed several northern drives from that direction.

North Korea has apparently not attempted to divert spent nuclear fuel now
being unloaded from its Yongbyon reactor to nuclear arms production, US
officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
'There is no diversion, according to (IAEA) inspectors. We are hopeful,'
said one of the officials.
The US has repeatedly warned Pyongyang that it is prepared to press the
United Nations for international sanctions if it moves ahead with a
programme to develop nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the US would
increase the already high 'readiness level' of its troops in South Korea if
it proved necessary to seek sanctions against North Korea.
The North, which denies it has such a programme, recently announced that it
had begun unloading spent nuclear fuel rods from a controversial reactor at
Yongbyon - fuel which the US says can be converted into enriched plutonium
for nuclear weapons.
A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the
UN nuclear watchdog, arrived in Pyongyang this week and reported that some
of the ageing fuel rods had been removed from the reactor's power core.
But US officials said yesterday the IAEA had also reported those rods had
been put in cooling tanks of water and had not been spirited away from the
reactor in an attempt to enrich the material.
The UN nuclear agency said the unloading of the fuel rods alone was a
serious violation of its safeguards agreement with Pyongyang and it would
report the communist state to the UN Security Council.
'But I don't believe the IAEA statement says there will be any immediate
declaration that continuity of (nuclear) safeguards has been broken,' said
one US official.

Northern Yemeni forces appeared yesterday to have won control of part of
Al-Anad military base as they tightened their grip around the southern
stronghold of Aden, Reuter reports from Al-Anad.
Heavy shelling prevented independent witnesses from getting closer than 3km
south of Al-Anad, but southern Yemeni forces were retreating at that point.
A Reuter report says southern tanks were moving south on transporters.
Artillery positions were also moved south from the important base, which
lies near a junction about 65km north of Aden.
In spite of the apparent retreat, southern officers at the front said
southern units still controlled the air strip and buildings in the southwest
part of Al-Anad base.
They said infantry were fighting northern forces loyal to Yemeni President
Ali Abdullah Saleh in and around the base, and more soldiers were seen
heading northwards as reinforcements.
Southern warplanes yesterday pounded rival positions north of Al-Anad,
showing the air force was active despite an attack on Aden airport.
President Saleh launched an offensive on May 4 to crush his estranged
vice-president, Ali Salem al-Baidh, based in the port city.

The US, the European Union and other members of the 22-strong Gatt civil
aircraft committee agreed on Thursday to resume talks in July on a
replacement for the Gatt's 1979 code of fair trade practice with the aim of
reaching a deal by the end of this year, reports Frances Williams from
Geneva.
The US wants any new accord to be limited to 'multilateralising' its 1992
bilateral pact with the EU which puts a cap on subsidies for the European
Airbus. The EU and most other committee members are insisting that the new
agreement cover all types of civil aircraft and components, and all forms of
state support including indirect assistance through space and military
research contracts as practised by Washington.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Labour's beauty contest: You cannot judge politicians by
their looks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Smith's body will be laid to rest today. This, apparently, is the cue
for the campaign to begin in earnest for the right to succeed the dead
Labour leader. As far as the press is concerned, however, the battle has
already swung wildly back and forth, and is close to being decided.
The day after Smith's death, the 41-year-old Tony Blair was - almost
unanimously - declared a shoo-in for the job. He is, it was stated, young,
good looking and 'a moderniser'.
Two days later, the landscape - with equal decisiveness - had changed. Blair
was not just young, but too young. He was not just good looking, but
suspiciously good looking, a 'Bambi' figure. The press which had endorsed
him the previous day suddenly discovered that it had absolutely no idea what
Blair believed in. But Blair's extraordinary physical beauty has still left
his rivals struggling, we are told.
Robin Cook gained the most votes in last year's elections to the shadow
cabinet. He is the party's most consistently brilliant debater in the
commons. He would probably eviscerate John Major at question time. He is
just about the only Labour politician to have thought seriously about the
dangers of European Union. He is in favour of hunting.
In short, Cook is, for all his Edinburgh intellectualism, a man in touch
with popular sentiment. But he is unelectable as a prime minister because he
resembles a garden gnome.
Or so we are told by our great opinion formers. Indeed, the Guardian, which
ought to know most about such things, tells us that Cook himself, worn down
by criticism of his appearence, has conceded that he is physiognomically
unelectable in the era of electoral franchise by television.
Gordon Brown, aged 43, splits the modern school of political analysts
neatly. On the one hand, we are told admiringly, Brown is 'brilliant at
television sound-bites'. This means that Brown is capable of spending all
day saying the same five words over and over again to a succession of
television crews, without going mad.
On the other hand, we are told, Brown is blind in one eye, which means that
he looks a bit, well, you know, odd. And he is a bachelor, which is
apparently risky these days. As with Blair, Brown's political views are
deemed to be undetectable. But because he is not so good looking as Blair,
this is put down to native Scottish caution rather than vacuity.
I am beginning to believe that the election for the leadership of the Labour
party should be conducted by Julia Morley, who has vast experience of
organising beauty contests, notably 'Miss World'. The contestants would
march up and down in a succession of costumes, and then would spend 30
seconds each being interviewed about their hobbies and ambitions ('leading
the Labour party') by Michael Aspel.
What is so very odd about all this, is that there is no evidence, so far as
I am aware, that the British electorate, let alone the members of the Labour
party, are decisively influenced by the physical appearance of a candidate.
Perhaps there has been research to this effect, and if so I should like to
see it. But until then I think we should assume that the vast majority of
the British people, if they are the sort who care enough to vote, will do so
on the basis of what they think are the opinions and achievements - or lack
of them - of those who solicit their support.
What tends to happen is that our views of politicians' appearances are
conditioned by our growing appreciation of their virtues and vices. Winston
Churchill was about 5ft 5ins tall, narrow shouldered, sunken chested and pot
bellied. But he appeared formidable, because of what we knew of his
achievements.
Anthony Eden was a striking physical specimen, as handsome as any prime
minister. But now all we see is weakness in that fine face, because we
discovered all too quickly what lay beneath the veneer. The Labour party, in
other words, should not be frightened of electing someone who looks like a
garden gnome.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The road to insanity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday I hurled myself out of London and down the motorway to Solsbury
Hill, overlooking the village of Swainswick, very close to Bath. Solsbury
Hill was the site of an Iron Age fort, and is a place of great beauty. But
now it is being raped by a bypass scheme which will stand, unless work is
halted, as a monument to the madness of John Major's doomed government.
It had been several months since I last broke free of London, so I was
stunned by what I saw as I steered my car westward.
England, it was clear, is being sundered by two colliding forces: the death
throes of the Tories and the first black waves of PMT (pre-millennial
tension).
There were peculiar sights everywhere. In some localities there were floods.
Whole villages were drowned. Survivors clutched church steeples. But after a
few miles the land would turn to desert, as though gripped by drought. In
places, mahogany forests flourished, or stands of bamboo; in others,
stretching to the horizon, was a tundra of ice-age flowers, speckled and
malevolent. The sky kept changing colour, from pearl to sulphur to scarlet,
and was filled with unusual birds: cockatoos, flamingos and the largest of
the albatrosses.
On those village greens not drowned by floods, the villagers were building
straw figures with hideously-painted faces - Major, Heseltine, Clarke - or
else they were building arks, or what you might call coracles, enormously
bigger than usual, and floating them down rivers, packed with their
possessions, and with household pets. In some places I glimpsed bands of
archaic homo sapiens, 6 1/2 ft tall, rudimentarily dressed, or even
archaically nude, skulking past coppices or emerging from earth mounds.
As a result of all this, I reached Swainswick, near Bath, in a state of some
terror. But my brain swiftly cleared the moment I saw Solsbury Hill and
understood what the fuss over the bypass is about. It is about insanity:
about carving a two-mile stretch of dual-carriageway, together with sound
barriers, bridges and a roundabout, through the trees and water-meadows of a
famously beautiful hill for a tiny gain in convenience for a small number of
people in the villages of Swainswick and Batheaston. The cost of this
desecration is put at Pounds 75m.
This is road-building mania on a completely crazy scale: an indication of
madness among ministers and officials at the Department of Transport, and of
degeneracy and decadence at the core of the Major government. Go to Solsbury
Hill. Walk up it, down it, round it. Examine the rape and vandalism. Ponder
the huge cost. Then join the protest.
At present, the protest is centred on the pale figure of Bel Mooney, a
prominent journalist (and recently-installed fellow of University College,
London) who has a house on Solsbury Hill and who is now on hunger strike -
consuming only water and fruit juice - to protest against the pillage.
Yes, there was a public inquiry, in 1990. Yet when she reflects on the
cynical limitations of that inquiry, says Mooney, she feels outraged by the
acquiescence which allows this destruction in the name of the people.
She told me: 'The bypass is expected to generate extra traffic of about 600
cars daily, but it is a two-mile stretch of dual-carriageway going from
nowhere to nowhere. Bath itself will still be heavily congested. What we
want is for them to halt the building work now, before the trees and
water-meadows are damaged beyond repair and pending a transport review for
the whole of the south-west.
'This story is a dreadful can of worms that needs exposing. I cried the
other day when the diggers tore down some trees. You have no idea until you
see it what a physical assault it is.' The issue of roads and the
environment, she insists, is not local but national.
After talking to Mooney, I walked up and down the hill, chatting to the
people that are rallying to the cause and gathering on Solsbury Hill, before
the concrete mixers start their work. I visited the eco-warriors' camps,
which the wreckers and the robo-cops plan to destroy.
It is not too late. The madness can be stopped. But time is running short.
Unless the roads minister, Robert Key, swiftly gains his wits, he will find
the whole of England over-run by ancient homo sapiens risen from their
graves, clamouring for blood.

FT  21 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Morality on a tight leash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A British journalist rarely questions his or her moral framework. The chap
who sits at a table in a smart restaurant listening to a tart extracting
confessions of lust and infidelity from a leading public servant does not
spend much time pondering ethics.
In France things are different. A new three-part book - the title translates
as 'The Journalists - Stars, Scribes and Scribblers,' * - delves deep into
questions of journalistic morality.
The first part is called 'Diary of a Dog'. That is taken from the eulogy
delivered by President Mitterrand at the funeral of his one-time prime
minister, Pierre Beregovoy, who shot himself a year ago. Mitterrand spoke of
the 'dogs' who had driven Beregovoy to his death. He meant the journalists
who had investigated his interest-free loan from a leading businessman.
The writer is Jean-Francois Lacan who was once media and communications
editor at Le Monde. He has followed a professional code of such rigour that
it has led him from one disaster to another and vilification from
intellectuals and fellow hacks.
He left Le Monde in characteristic circumstances, after his investigation
into the share scandal associated with the Pechiney aluminium company, in
which Lacan had implicated Patrice Pelat. Pelat died soon after of a heart
attack and Lacan was pilloried.
Le Monde apparently thought he had behaved badly - partly because he had
smuggled his report into the paper when his editor had not been around. The
fact that Lacan was entirely right hardly mattered.
He then founded a daily called La Truffe. This consisted of short news items
exposing evil. It folded after two months, so Lacan went into television
where he worked on a programme called Bas les masques which specialised in
risque exposes.
It perished after an attack on what the French call 'Reality shows' by an
academic. It had a memorable opening: 'It is time for a political reflection
on this televisual style, instead of contenting oneself with routine sermons
on the sly tricks of the producers, the obscenity of the broadcasts and the
imbecility of the public.'
Lacan supports British ways. He tells of a conversation with a minister who
was contemplating tightening up already strict laws on privacy. The minister
himself had been under attack by the satirical weekly, Le Canard enchaine.
He told Lacan: 'I count on you to explain that I am not an enemy of the
press, but this time Le Canard has overstepped the mark.'
Some weeks later Lacan witnessed a debate between the minister and the then
chairman of the British Press Council, Lord MacGregor. 'Sure of finding an
ally in the person of the noble Lord, the minister pressed him to exhort
French journalists to respect privacy.'
'I can't help you,' said MacGregor. Smiling, he noted it was always liberals
who wanted to muzzle the press in the name of privacy. 'The difficulty, you
see, is that each press investigation into a public figure, his misdeeds,
his corruption, more or less obliges the journalist to stick his nose into
his private life.'
It may seem that French journalists are a stiff-necked lot who refuse to
dive into everyday merde. But for Lacan they are moral pygmies.
He worries about an ancient income tax benefit - a 30 per cent allowance for
so-called representational expenses - but other concerns are more important.
'Every newsroom throws up stories of motoring correspondents who have never
paid for a car, the financial reporters who benefit from insiders' networks
on the bourse, the political reporter who is compensated by the minister's
kind gift of a necklace for his wife. Spend a few days before Christmas in
editors' offices and see the accumulation of cases of fine wines,
televisions, watches or other business gifts from grateful advertisers.'
An account of a lunch with a corporate PR boss, 'Sylvie', was fascinating.
She explained how she had stitched up most of the press prior to the
announcement of some poor results. An article planted here, an interview
there and a strategic lunch would ensure there would be no 'disobliging
commentaries' once the results appeared.
All this seems somewhat overdrawn but Lacan's world is unusually dramatic.
This may be because the reputation of French journalists is no better than
that of the British among their public. But in France it may be for the
wrong reasons.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Private View: Laughing all the way across the Atlantic - Don
Taffner, the man who sold Benny Hill to the Americans, believes competition
for the mass audience leads to a poverty of ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
His laugh is the happy sound of money rattling down the bank-teller's chute.
He chortles over his latest art nouveau capture at the saleroom, cackles
while describing his battles with the television moguls, hoots as he tells
you that one of his tailored-for-America British sitcoms has grossed Dollars
500m.
Don Taffner, the Brooklyn newsvendor's son who sold Benny Hill to American
audiences, laughs like a tickled hyena. It is the sound they put in cans for
TV comedy shows. Indeed, it was his laugh which got him noticed when he
began as a humble messenger boy for the William Morris talent agency in New
York.
He even laughs - respectfully - about his wife.
For the first thing you see as you step inside Taffner's London office is a
Brooklyn version of an Andy Capp joke: a blue plaque framed by little yellow
curtains hanging from a brass rod. Picked out in white are the words
'Eleanor Taffner Lives Here' and, underneath, 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'.
'We had this office at 1430 Sixth Avenue,' said He Who Does the Obeying,
'and they wanted to up the rent on our lease. So I said to Eleanor: 'Would
you go look for some space for us?'
'So Eleanor - she's really a partner in all of this - she says to me, 'Don,
how much have we got coming in?' And I said to her: 'I don't really know.
All I'm doing is getting it. Talk to our accountant, Marty Jaffe.' And he
said to her: 'Eleanor, it's coming in so fast you can't spend it all.'
'Within 24 hours she found a building. He called up the next day and said:
'Eleanor, I take it back]''
Taffner cackled, heh-heh-heh. 'So, she knows how to spend it]'
Taffner's speciality is selling British sitcom to Americans, developed while
acting as agent for Thames Television, the production company and former
London area broadcaster. He takes the basic idea and modifies the scripts to
suit the culture. So, for example, the Jewish tailor and Irish tailor in
Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width became Jewish and Irish bartenders -
the little tailor shop was already extinct in the US.
What is the difference between British and American audiences? I asked him.
'I don't know how to answer the question, but instinctively I think I know
what it is, what will work and what won't,' he said. 'But Benny's humour was
so visual, he could go anywhere. I call him an adult animation.'
But all those smutty jokes?
'No, no, the broad-based Americans (his euphemism for the mass market) just
sat down and enjoyed it. That's what makes me worry about research. There is
what people think they should say, and what they do.' He has a framed
cartoon in his office: a viewer is watching Benny Hill on TV and saying to a
market researcher on the phone: 'Of course, I'm looking at Masterpiece
Theatre'.
'No,' Taffner continued. 'I don't think the people are different. I think
the pressure groups are different.'
That is one reason why DLT Entertainment, Taffner's production and
distribution company, sold Benny Hill area by area. 'If we were on the
network the pressure groups who wanna get publicity would go after it much
bigger than if I went market by market.'
What about Good and Evil? I said. It's said that to sell to America you have
to make it very clear who the goodies are and who the baddies.
'I will say it's halfway to being true. I don't think it becomes a yes or
no, but I do think they need more of a clear picture of the goodness of a
person. But I don't think it can become so good so that it becomes
milk-toast, ya know. I am almost convinced that even in the UK there is a
demographic of people that need a black and white situation.' Taffner is no
cultural snob; by 'a demographic' he means 'the unsophisticated'.
And the shorter attention span?
That, said Taffner, might not be the audience at all but a function of the
cost of air-time. 'All I know is that in America shows tend to have to hit
their point faster (he punched his palm, thwack) than they do here.
'I believe that a show grows, rather than instant. But commercial power is
such that it has to be instant. They can't afford to let it grow. Here it
isn't as much like that, but it will be as competition comes in.'
Sometimes Taffner gets it wrong. His Miss Winslow And Son, an adaptation of
Miss Jones And Son about an unmarried mother in a block of flats proved
'ahead of its time'. He is now trying to reintroduce it. 'You see, I don't
like to put things in catalogues because it ages them. To me something is
brand-noo until it's been sold there, no matter how long ago it was
produced.' Even 'Allo, 'Allo , the camp parody of the French Resistance
which did not take in the US the first time, should have been tried again
with the D-Day anniversary looming.
Were British sitcoms then more daring than American?
'They certainly were then. I looked upon it that I was bringing freshness of
ideas. Most of Hollywood has an incestuousness to it. If a success comes
they copy each other. It is still that way. Only unfortunately there aren't
too many formats here now; it's more sketch comedy and stand-up comedy stuff
than thoughtful situations.'
Competition for the mass audience was to blame for a poverty of ideas, he
said, and Britain was following the US. 'It's going to be threatened but I
hope you fight the threat,' he said. 'There's no doubt about it because you
can see it - and I have no criticism because I do game shows myself - in the
formats that people are looking for. What I'm suggesting to you is it's
going to come around to the least common denominator, right?'
Yet minority audiences for subjects such as opera might prove viable markets
in a country as large as the US. 'Here, I don't know.'
Taffner has put money back into the pool of British comedy talent from which
he has earned his living. He is the majority shareholder of Ray Cooney's
Theatre of Comedy in London, based at the Shaftesbury Theatre which it owns.
But the investment is not only philanthropic.
'It all has to do with programming. I'm sure experts in the field of finance
will tell me I'm wrong, but I'm pig-headed enough to keep on going.
Television has peaks and valleys: you're selling shows, you don't have a
show. Theatre has peaks and valleys. My theory is that if I can just not
have them happen simultaneously the theatre can bring a return to help me
during the valleys of television.'
Though Taffner says he gets his fun from earning, he manages to spend a
little too. He and Eleanor are collectors of Arts and Crafts or art nouveau
furniture, with a special penchant for Glasgow and the work of Charles
Rennie Mackintosh. They make a point each year of buying work from Glasgow
Art School students.
He led me round the office basement, pointing out some favourite pieces and
modestly dropping the names of painters such as John Duncan Fergusson and
architects of the Wiener Werkstatte and Bauhaus schools.
'It's kinda the things my mother and grandmother in Brooklyn threw out,' he
joked. 'It may sound like bragging, but the appeal to me is that we might
have helped start something. Some of it is just absolutely lovely.'
He also has a steeplechaser, Ghofar, 1987 winner of the Hennessy Gold Cup,
once owned by Sir Hugh Dundas, chairman of Thames. ('Just how much does a
horse corst?' he had asked his English racing friends.) 'I planned to have a
flat racer too but we weren't coming over to England so much, so we got out
of the flat business.'
Do you indulge any childhood cravings?
'No. There was one but I changed my mind. When I was growing up in Brooklyn
I wanted to own a sports team. Now that I can afford to buy one I've decided
that if I get close to those people I'll find out that they're just people
and they won't be the glorious images of sport.
'One thing I've learned from the showbusiness world: sometimes when you get
close to personalities, that aura melts away.'
It is easy to believe Taffner when he says he makes money for the fun of it.
'I just wanted to keep on doing things. If I thought too much of the return
of everything I wouldn't enjoy the things.'
Just describing his deal-making technique creases him up:
'I talk to the networks in America and I wanna be a partner with them and I
say: 'Let's take advantage of something: you're the big guy. If we're
partners, you'll be the big guy and I'm the small guy. If you're the big guy
and you can step on the person and get what we want, let's do that. But if
we can go to somebody and I show him the frayed collar, (heh-heh-heh) and we
can get it that way, let's go get it that way.'' Taffner is rocking in his
chair, beside himself.
'So I kinda say I get involved in those businesses that fall between the
slats of the big guys, ya know. I usually have found I could make a living
out of the things that the Warner Brothers and the Paramounts didn't want to
get involved in.
'I also like to be at home at night, at 10.30 or 11.00 before I sleep and
putting everything in my mind, I like being the underdog saying: 'OK, you
big bastards, I can make a living too at this, ya know.'' Taffner yelped
with glee. 'And I feel satisfied I have done that, and I can have a good
night's sleep.'
But still laughing.

THINKING THE UNTHINKABLE by Richard Cockett HarperCollins Pounds 22.95, 390
pages
Some of my best friends were Keynesians, I think. So it is stimulating to
read a book which portrays John Maynard Keynes as the enemy of all sound
policies, a man who sold his intellectual soul for political influence, and
whose followers after his death tried to enslave Britain in the trammels of
the corporatist state.
Richard Cockett tells the story of an epic struggle against the evils of the
Keynesian consensus which grew out of the unemployment in the 1930s in
Britain and lasted until the glorious victory of May 4, 1979 when . . . but
I anticipate. The new regime begins only in the final chapter, entitled 'The
Heroic Age II' and lasts for a mere 23 pages.
Cockett's theme is, rather, the battle of ideas in which the principles of
liberal free-market economics were hammered and sharpened into a political
instrument called Thatcherism. It is an exciting story because it deals, at
one level, with the most important intellectual conflict of the 20th century
 -between the forces for centralised planning and socialist government
controls, against the old liberal tradition of individual freedom,
unfettered markets and minimum government interference.
The danger of Keynes, according to this account, was that he offered an
illusory 'middle way', including the benefits of a managed economy (to end
unemployment), but avoiding the evils of extreme socialism, communism and
fascism. The leading critics, Edwin Cannan, Lionel Robbins and Friedrich von
Hayek (at the London School of Economics) warned even in the late 1930s that
this middle way led on to a slippery slope of increasing government
intervention.
Hayek, pointed out then, and later in his Road to Serfdom (1944), that
governments which pumped money into the economy to create jobs would start a
'collectivist spiral'. It would lead, as another critic, Jacob Viner, put
it, to 'a mad race between the printing presses and the business agents of
the trade unions'.
Were these liberals foretelling the traumas of the British economy 40 years
later, when it was assailed by industrial strife, low growth and inflation?
Cockett thinks so and claims that Keynes was 'running up the white flag on
behalf of capitalism . . .'
After the war, the yearning for a better society was so strong that Keynes's
demand management and William Beveridge's welfare state became an orthodox
faith. The flame of capitalist freedom was kept flickering by an assortment
of pressure groups and by a more substantial band of liberal academics which
Hayek gathered at Mont Pelerin in Switzerland in 1947.
Their ideas were successfully popularised by the Institute of Economic
Affairs (founded in 1955) and later also by the Centre for Policy Studies.
Cockett tells his tale with the rather breathless spirit of a partisan
(adopting the tone of an academic historian). Much of his material, one
suspects, came directly from activists such as that pugnacious polemicist,
Sir Alfred Sherman, former director of the CPS and adviser to Thatcher.
Cockett is consequently much too kind to the counter revolutionaries, some
of whom had some very silly ideas, and were later abandoned by Thatcher, for
understandable reasons.
In this battle of ideas, economists (including those in the Treasury and the
London Business School in the 1970s and 1980s, for example) differed on much
more subtle and pragmatic grounds than Cockett seems to understand. Few
dispute, for example, that Keynes was right that the immediate cause of the
dreadful unemployment during the 1930s was a failure of economic demand,
whatever they say about later Keynesians. And Keynes told Hayek that he
agreed with, and was deeply moved by, most of The Road to Serfdom.
Most free marketeers, including Thatcher, accept that the state must play a
big part in modern economies (and she scarcely reduced the proportion of
national income dispensed by the state). Sensible Keynesians are much
exercised by monetary policy, while monetarists think deeply about aggregate
demand . . .
So Cockett has interestingly described a battle for hearts and minds as seen
by the infantry of the winning side, with scarcely a reference to what the
enemy was saying. We view in bright technicolour what Sherman thought of
Keynes and his snivelling disciples in the Treasury; but what would Keynes
have said about Sherman? Or of Cockett for neglecting this point?

FT  21 MAY 94 / Books: Closet narcissist - Fiction

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFANE FRIENDSHIP by Harold Brodkey Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 387 pages
The significance of Narcissus is not that he fell in love with his
reflection, but that he failed to recognise his own image. A comparable
failure of perception darkens the life of Harold Brodkey's anti-hero, Niles
O'Hara, a closet narcissist, a beautiful little boy in Venice of the fascist
1930s who grows into a ruminative old one, yet fails to understand the drama
of his own life. You could interpret the novel as the apotheosis of
homoeroticism, detailing an affair that never really was, viewed through the
prism of memory in the seductive glow of Venice. But to do that is to avoid
considering why Profane Friendship so infuriates and dissatisfies.
Brodkey's own, much publicised life provides a distracting point of
comparison which cannot quite be discounted. He first became famous for
being on the persistent verge of producing the new great American novel, and
after almost 30 years The Runaway Soul (1990) almost qualified. But in
recent months he has acquired a far more difficult sort of fame - for his
intimate, ultimate unveiling in The New Yorker, the stark reporting of how
it feels to find yourself dying of Aids.
Brodkey explained that he believed he had contracted the HlV virus through a
homosexual route down which he had briefly gone after his first marriage and
before the second: his implicit defining of himself as an occasional
bisexual, pre-eminently at home with heterosexuality, has no direct bearing
upon his portrait of Niles, a writer who lines up firmly in heterosexual
ranks. Yet Profane Friendship, for all the hero's self-confessed concern
with girls, never moves far beyond homoerotic perimeters.
From the vantage point of self-scrutinising old age, back on a Venetian
visit, O'Hara recalls childhood years in 1930s Venice, with his family, and
when a pretty Italian boy crossed his path, never quite to leave it. Their
juvenile preoccupation with each other reaches the level of the ambiguous
crush when the adolescent Niles returns to Venice after the war.
Although a little light self abuse of the mutual sort is as far as the two
youths go, and Niles succumbs with the studied reluctance of a hip, young
chap who wants to do his friend a good gay turn, you are incited to wonder
what sort of deep deception is going on. In old age, with a deal of
heterosexuality behind of them, Onni is still captivating and bemusing his
friend whose guise remains that of the gruffly indifferent. Yet he succumbs,
as all true narcissists do, to the embrace of constant attention. The sense
of enclosure and obsession is overwhelming.
Brodkey's diction, flashy, complex and opaque sentences swollen with the
weight of imprecise adjectives, seems to strive for illumination and
perception, while achieving no more than a chronic evasiveness. For in the
obsessed brooding over Onni, Niles O'Hara manifests a profound longing,
always frustrated, whose implications drift away into the might-have been.
It is a novel which never faces its own complex yearnings. The use of the
word 'profane' in the title suggests that the relationship is characterised
by a polluted unclean quality. And by so entitling it Brodkey implies that
the two men's life of role and game playing with each other is to be
censured. A strange case of homophobia.

THE ASTONISHING HYPOTHESIS: THE SCIENTIFIC SEARCH FOR THE SOUL by Francis
Crick Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.99, 317 pages
What is it that says and thinks 'I'? Many people feel that it is the soul,
but scientists, on the whole, do not. For them, and others of a more
rational bent, believing in souls is no easier than believing in unicorns.
There is no direct evidence for either, they say, and to accept their
existence would call into question a host of scientific premisses and
deductions.
Unfortunately, scientists have yet to agree on exactly what does go on
between our ears. Those who do venture an explanation usually fall into one
of three camps. Some say that the physics of the brain is yet to be
discovered: quantum mechanics, for example, is the most successful tool of
modern science when applied to atoms and their components, but its
implications for everyday experience remain unclear. Perhaps, one day,
quantum mechanics will explain the mind.
Then there are those who say that biology and physics belong to different
worlds and to think that human activities, such as love and politics, could
be described by physics is just silly. US Nobel laureate Gerald Edelman, for
example, describes the brain as a Darwinian jungle where cells link to
others in order to cope better with the world.
Finally, there are those like Francis Crick, also a Nobel Laureate for his
co-discovery of the structure of DNA, who argue that conventional science
will provide the answer if it approaches the subject seriously. Crick's
'astonishing hypothesis' is: 'You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories
and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in
fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their
associated molecules'.
His evidence is the vast and impressive store of discoveries in
neuroscience. Taking just the question of how the brain turns electric
signals from our eyes into moving colour pictures, Crick shows that the
breadth and detail of today's knowledge of the physical brain are matched
only by an awareness that there is still much to learn.
He links this physical knowledge of cells to recent work in experimental
psychology. Take 'blindsight', in which a patient can see but denies it.
Brain damage leads to a patient saying that part of his field of vision is
blank. Asked to point to a light placed in that field, 'the patient normally
demurs, saying that since he is blind there, there is no point in doing the
test. With a little persuasion he may be coaxed to give it a try and 'guess'
where it was. The surprised patient, in spite of denying that he can see
anything, points to the light usually to within five or 10 degrees.'
The patient appears to be unconscious of something of which he is, in
another way, aware. Crick concludes that it is not only the visual part of
the brain that can be pinpointed, but a part related to consciousness, in
this case damaged.
Crick says that not only consciousness but free will have identifiable
locations in the brain. His survey of the latest finds in neuroscience is
clear and entertaining. But it does not lead, as the reader might expect, to
a theory of how the mind emerges from the brain's jumble of wires and
junctions. Instead the physicist-turned-molecular-biologist Crick appeals to
fellow scientists to claim the subject of the mind from philosophers and
psychologists and to bridge the gap between neuroscience and thinking.
'Now is the time to take the problem of consciousness seriously,' he writes.
'We cannot be satisfied forever by the guesses of yesterday.'
One question that Crick does not answer is why mainstream 'hard' science has
not yet taken up the challenge. He is 78 next month. Others will have to
pick up the gauntlet.

controversial history of the school

<TEXT>
ETON RENEWED: A HISTORY FROM 1860 TO THE PRESENT DAY by Tim Card John Murray
Pounds 22.95, 338 pages
This book will be read for all the wrong reasons after recent disclosures
that the former headmaster Anthony Chenevix-Trench was a drunk and a sadist
fond of beating his boys.
Before the flogging furore, however, Lord Carrington wrote in the Old
Etonian Review, without mentioning Chenevix-Trench: 'This is a book which
all Old Etonians will thoroughly enjoy. It is evocative, informative, and
scholarly, and full of good stories.'
Tim Card, now Vice Provost, has been at Eton as a boy and a beak since he
was 12 (except for five years at Cambridge and the Army). He has not let the
side down, although he has sailed rather close to the wind on homosexuality.
He has written this book as an insider putting the record straight, rather
than as a propagandist trying to convey an image to the outside world. There
are a lot of Eton terms, such as Oppidans, scugs, tugs, burries and wet and
dry bobs, which most of us haven't heard since we left the school.
There is no attempt to provide an artificial gloss. Subjects are tackled
dutifully and with care - Card knows that there are thousands of Old
Etonians with elephantine memories (and many published memoirs) waiting to
pick him up if he gets anything wrong. Malcolm Muggeridge once complained
that Etonians never forget where they went to school.
Probably the most striking thing about Eton for an outsider is the degree of
autonomy enjoyed by the boys. In the late 19th century, long after the Duke
of Wellington's alleged remarks about the playing fields of Eton, all
sporting activities were organised by the boys themselves. A Master in
College (housemaster to the 70 scholars) was rebuked by his senior boys for
unwarranted interference.
Members of Pop, who had the power to cane boys or fine them, and restrain
them if there was a riot, elected each other without reference to the beaks.
Even in the 1960s the Captain of Boats had the power to sack the master in
charge of coaching the Eight - Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons
select committee on defence, was Captain of Boats in those days and, for
some of us, he was a more imposing figure then than he is now.
If boys are less powerful now it is partly because the headmaster has
succeeded in clawing back responsibility each time the boys have abused
their authority; and partly because the boys are under so much academic
pressure that they do not want these extra duties.
It is unfortunate for Chenevix-Trench that he presided over the decline of
fagging and flogging, which are now seen as barbaric practices. Bernard
Fergusson, writing in the 1930s, treats them, with no hint of an apology, as
initiations into the roughness of normal life. Trench's mistake was to
remove the sadistic ritual behind flogging, with a praeposter and a college
porter to assist in the bare-bottomed assault with a birch. Instead he caned
boys privately, lessening the ordeal but, without the witnesses, increasing
the speculation about his own motives.
Trench's other mistake was that he distrusted housemasters, wondering
whether he could communicate with Etonians through '25 robber barons' as he
called them. This attitude undermined the authority of housemasters and in
some cases, anarchy prevailed.
When he arrived in 1964, Chenevix-Trench was a breath of fresh air. For 50
years the school had not progressed at all. There had been years of
stagnation under Robert Birley and Claude Elliott - both of them formidable
schoolmasters in their different ways but deeply conservative figures, only
interested in stemming the tide against a ghastly modern world.
The Chenevix-Trench chapter is headed 'Upheaval' - and an upheaval was what
was needed. It was unfortunate that for all his many talents he did not have
the ability to communicate with Eton house-masters, an eccentric, unworldly
group of men who favoured humiliation as a means of control.
Card acknowledges that there is a recurring debate about whether Etonians
should continue to wear the tails, striped trousers and stiff collars which
were fashionable two centuries ago. Boys and masters usually agree that it
is a pity to tamper with tradition. No one seems to ask whether it is a good
idea for boys to spend their formative years strolling around town looking
slightly ridiculous, like superior beings from a lost era.
Whether an Eton education (present cost Pounds 12,000 a year after tax) is
going to be an advantage or a hindrance in the 21st century is not addressed
by Card. Too many Etonians still go into non-productive employment in the
Army and the City (perhaps defence cuts and Lloyd's will put that right)
rather than industry, science, medicine or the creative arts. The last Tory
leadership contest, in which a Fellow of Eton and a former Captain of the
School was beaten by a south London boy who left school with no O levels,
might suggest that today, even in Tory politics, an Eton background is seen
as a handicap.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Books: Meditations of the sage for today - JDF Jones reviews
an anthology of the work of Sir Laurens van der Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES

<TEXT>
FEATHER FALL: AN ANTHOLOGY by Laurens van der Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds
16.99, 269 pages
Sir Laurens van der Post is not so far short of 90 but, happily, in full
possession of his powers as he celebrates this 60th anniversary of his
association with the Hogarth Press (today subsumed in Chatto, and in turn in
Random House). This attendant anthology, Feather Fall, is a slightly curious
concept because one has to question its function. Is it to commemorate the
occasion? To remind us fans of his qualities? To give to new readers a taste
which will encourage them to buy the real books? Perhaps the model is the
anthology of CG Jung - van der Post's mentor - which has led many casual
readers to tackle Jung's fuller achievement.
After all, it is hard to imagine an anthology from, say, Conrad, or Bellow,
or Hemingway (successful publishing projects like The Essential Hemingway
are not comparable because they are omnibuses, not anthologies). The
explanation is that van der Post is seen today not so much as a novelist -
although he is a good one - but as a thinker, visionary, philosopher,
mystic. You cannot sensibly anthologise a novelist but you can much more
easily gather together a collection of extracts, often brief, even a single
paragraph, from the life-work of a sage.
The danger is that, as a result of abbreviation, you can finish up with too
many out-of-context mini-extracts which do less than justice to the author:
for instance, 'Never try to go ahead of your spoor. Many a man has died
because he has not observed the discipline of the spoor to the end'. That
sort of example, and there are quite a few of them here, would keep Private
Eye happy for months. As with all van der Post's regular appearances in that
journal, it is very unfair but undeniably funny.
Another problem with a book of this sort is that it cannot - because these
are snippets] - communicate the achievement of a creative writer. It needs
to be insisted that the early van der Post novels - In A Province, The Face
Beside The Fire, Flamingo Feather - are still splendid. The African travel
books - Venture to the Interior, The Lost World of the Kalahari, The Heart
of the Hunter - continue to defy the sneers of the anthropologists. A Story
Like The Wind and A Far-Off Place are a captivating duo about childhood and
much else. Even the food book, First Catch Your Eland, is hard to put down.
And that is to leave out The Dark Eye in Africa, The Seed and the Sower, the
travels to Russia and Japan, the recent semi-memoirs, and so much more.
The editors of Feather Fall, Jean-Marc Pottiez and Jane Bedford, focus on
van der Post not as novelist or traveller, soldier or crypto-diplomat, but
as - to use Rosamond Lehmann's words about him - 'a great spiritual thinker
and writer'. They correctly see 'a pattern in his writing, a flow and a
continuity' over 60 years, or at least over the 40 years since he resumed
his writing career after returning from the war in the Far East. That
pattern is underlined by the fact that he has never hesitated to repeat
himself: again and again his books, whether ostensibly fiction or
non-fiction, return to themes and episodes from his early Afrikaner
childhood, his Bushman nanny, his Huguenot ancestry, his early youthful
visit to Japan, his experiences as a POW, his subsequent travels in Africa,
his acquaintance with Jung, and so on.
Inevitably and properly, these topics are re-visited in this volume,
together with his lifelong meditation on the mighty themes that go with them
 -the dark shadow within ourselves, the function of journey for each of us,
the significance of the Bushman as the 'first man', the religious role of
Wilderness, the necessity to forgive, the Jungian sense of 'wholeness', the
mystery of Dream.
Too many of these extracts, in my opinion, are taken from that odd volume A
Walk with a White Bushman, which is not a real van der Post book but a
rambling and disorganised conversation with Jean-Marc Pottiez. I am also
struck by a change in style over the years: I am convinced that at some
point the taut, elegant pace of, say, Venture to the Interior, turned into
the very different rhythm, a tendency to spin words and lose precision, of
the later books. (I assume he started to dictate, which is never a good
thing.)
Van der Post has been active in Southern African affairs for many years
though he has chosen to operate sub rosa. His disdain for apartheid was
never a secret, nor - more controversially - his opposition to the
international sanctions which surely contributed to recent events. I
particularly enjoyed his unwitting reference here to the Afrikaners' history
'which still has a half-Nelson hold on them'. Fresh from a visit to
Johannesburg, and full of images of inauguration of majority rule, I was
also struck by his understanding - dating back to his years as prisoner of
the Japanese - of the surprising possibility of forgiveness.
'Persons who have really suffered at the hands of others do not find it
difficult to forgive, nor even to understand the people who caused their
suffering,' he once wrote. 'They do not find it difficult to forgive because
out of suffering and sorrow truly endured comes an instinctive sense of
privilege . . .' He went on, in a later novel, 'For if one does not forgive,
one does not understand, and if one does not understand, one is afraid, and
if one is afraid, one hates, and if one hates, one cannot love. And no new
beginning on earth is possible without love . . .'
I should like to think that those two elderly South Africans, Laurens van
der Post and Nelson Mandela, might have something to say to each other when
they are next in the same town.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Sport: Sampras floats towards his slam - Tennis / John
Barrett looks at the men most likely to win the French Open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

'He seems to be flying. I have never seen a player play that well against me
. . . and I had the best seat in the house]' Thus spake Boris Becker in Rome
last Sunday, no longer the dominant superman whom Nietzsche would have
admired. The 26-year-old German had just been thrashed 6-1 6-2 6-2 by Pete
Sampras. It was the American's 27th consecutive winning match and his
seventh title of the year, the fifth in succession.
I am glad I was there to witness this virtuoso performance because few men
ever reach the level of perfection Sampras achieved that day. This was a
truly majestic display of controlled aggression on clay from the powerful
22-year-old world No 1 and was achieved without undue help from his serve,
usually his most potent weapon. 'I guess I'll have to work on it before
Paris,' he told me.
As we approach the 1994 French Open, the unofficial world championship on
clay which begins at the enlarged and improved Stade Roland Garros on
Monday, everyone is wondering whether Sampras, already the Wimbledon, US and
Australian champion, can complete a consecutive slam. With the holder, Sergi
Bruguera and the 1991 and 1992 winner, Jim Courier, both in his half,
Sampras was treated harshly by yesterday's draw.
In the entire history of the game only four men have won all four of the
game's great titles and only two have won them all in the same year.
Britain's great champion of the 1930s, Fred Perry, collected his quartet
between 1933 and 1935. Then, in 1938, the red-headed Californian Don Budge,
already the holder of the previous year's Wimbledon and US titles made a
special journey to Australia in quest of that title. Having won it Budge
proceeded to add the French Championship to his growing collection. He was
now the holder of all four major titles, the feat that Sampras is trying to
emulate.
However, it was not until Budge had won a second Wimbledon that year and
arrived in New York to defend his US title that John Kiernan, writing in the
Herald Tribune, suggested that ' . . . if he wins it will be the equivalent
of a bridge player scoring a grand slam in no trumps, doubled and
redoubled.' Budge duly beat Gene Mako in a four-set final. From that moment
the Grand Slam became the holy grail of tennis.
The great Australian left-hander, Rod Laver, equalled the feat as an amateur
in 1962 and repeated it seven years later in the second year of open tennis.
In between, his compatriot Roy Emerson won the first of his two Wimbledon
crowns in 1964 to complete his collection. Eventually Emerson would amass a
record total of 12 Grand Slam singles titles, but he never held all of them
at the same time.
It was Laver whom Sampras most admired when he was growing up in California.
At the suggestion of his first coach, Dr Pete Fischer, Sampras used to watch
tapes of the great man's matches. Unconsciously perhaps, he has inherited
some of Laver's most attractive qualities - modesty, shyness and a sense of
history.
Who might prevent Sampras from emulating his boyhood idol? Until Michael
Chang won the French Open in 1989 as a 17-year-old to become the
youngest-ever men's champion, no American had been successful since Tony
Trabert in 1954 and 1955. Chang's victory ended the hoodoo and paved the way
for Jim Courier's convincing wins in 1991 and 1992 against fellow American
Andre Agassi and Petr Korda of the Czech Republic. Here, we thought, was the
new strong man on clay.
It was a surprise therefore when Courier, a firm favourite to become the
first triple winner since Bjorn Borg (1978-1981), lost in last year's final
to Bruguera of Spain after holding a break of serve in the final set. This
was not the ruthless match player we had come to admire.
That painful loss, and another in the Wimbledon final, seemed to knock the
stuffing out of Courier who lost to the unconsidered Frenchman, Cedric
Pioline in the fourth round at the US Open and finished the year poorly. His
personality seemed to have changed too. He had become grumpy, supercilious
and withdrawn.
After a mediocre start to 1994 and another disappointing loss in Monte Carlo
to the 19-year-old Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev, Courier said: 'There is no
reason for me not to be happy . . . I have a career and a perfect family and
the fact that I lose a tennis match isn't going to change all that . . . I
just want to be happy and get rid of all that excess baggage on my
shoulders. I don't care that much about the rankings. All I want to do is
play my best tennis.' Which might make Jim a more likeable guy, but will rob
him of the intensity that made him such a great competitor. From No 1 in the
world in April last year he has slipped to No 7.
Another strong contender is the holder, Bruguera, in spite of the pressures
of high expectation. He must first deal with the tough Austrian left-hander
Thomas Muster, who won seven titles on clay last year, or the unseeded
Agassi. These two clash in an outstanding second round match.
The No 2 seed, Michael Stich, has a dream draw until Chang looms in the
quarters. The brilliant 20-year-old Russian, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, may reach
the same round at the expense of Cedric Pioline (14) and Stefan Edberg (3)
to test sixth seeded Goran Ivanisevic in the lower half. I do not see
Becker, Martin or Korda having any real chance.
The ladies? Steffi Graf to repeat.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Property: Watchdog sees room for change - The estate agents'
ombudsman tells Gerald Cadogan how conveyancing could be improved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Estate agents can never take too much time to make sure both sellers and
buyers understand the processes, and the implications of each step, in
transferring property. That is the view of David Quayle, the Ombudsman for
the Corporate Estate Agents (OCEA): 'It is my job to remove
misunderstanding.'
This group of agents - made up either of public limited companies or those
owned by banks, building societies and insurance companies - is known best
for its monthly index of activity in the property market. The index is based
on data from more than 4,000 offices.
Quayle finds the Scots are clearer about how their system works than the
rest of the UK, where he is eager to re-open the debate about the procedures
for transfer. 'We need a satisfactory system for the next century,' he adds.
A retired major-general, who served with the British Army on the Rhine and
was once military attache in Bonn, Quayle has an office in Salisbury,
Wiltshire. Last year, it received 2,340 initial inquiries, of which 1,375
were outside his terms of reference - mainly because the agents involved
were not members of the OCEA. But 965 cases did come within his remit.
The chief complaints usually concerned matters of maladministration,
professional misjudgment, or breakdown in communications. But Quayle admits:
'My work load is nothing like that of the ombudsmen for the building
societies and the insurance industry.'
To be considered by Quayle, the complainant must first raise the matter with
the agency he considers at fault and work through its complaints procedure.
If not satisfied, he can then turn to the ombudsman.
Of 198 cases closed by Quayle last year, he found against the agencies in
71. Awards, which are binding, were mostly in the Pounds 100 to Pounds 499
range, although the highest was Pounds 5,500 (capped recently by one of
Pounds 13,000).
The awards do not bind the complainant, though; he can still go to law if he
wants. They are not intended to be punitive, either. What they offer is some
recompense, mostly for the inconvenience, when buying or selling has gone
wrong through no fault of the client. In best army fashion, Quayle
administers pragmatic but fair justice.
In the 3 1/2 years of the scheme, he says only three or four cases have
shown deliberate malpractice. More typical are those when an agent has
failed to pass on a new offer to a seller because something has gone wrong
in the office.
With so much of the work now done by computer it is easy for matters to be
overlooked if they have not been logged in. Either that, or the nuances of
agentspeak - which are important as they reflect more subtly than a computer
the progress of a sale - may be missed altogether.
Quayle says the times when it is crucial that all is made clear are
instruction (for the seller), offer (for the buyer), and acceptance subject
to contract (for both). The agent must be explicit that either party can
withdraw until exchange of contract.
On gazumping, Quayle points out that it is not the agent who gazumps but the
seller. By law, the agent must pass on all offers. When the seller decides
to break an agreement, the agent takes the flak from the aggrieved
underbidder. He makes little extra money in commission and his reputation is
damaged. The ombudsman can do little except try to ensure that agents in
general perform to the best standards and have high-quality paper/computer
work.
Quayle is eager for a change to the habit of asking for 'best and final'
offers. They are fine, he says, if they really are final. But, often, they
are not, as in repossessions when a mortgagee might succumb to a higher
offer after bidding has seemed to close. Quayle proposes that sellers should
ask for best offers by a certain day, and not indulge in spurious finality.
He also sees a future in lock-out agreements, where the buyer makes the
offer only if the seller agrees not to break it for another offer during a
specified period (while contracts are prepared and exchanged). This can ease
the usual worrying time of uncertainty for both sides.
In 1993 more buyers made initial inquiries to the ombudsman than sellers but
the latter predominated in cases he closed. And he found more often for the
agency (106 cases) last year than the complainant.
Often, sellers did not want to pay the agency fee. 'They were in dire
straits, and looked for every way possible to reduce their bills,' says
Quayle. He would first see what was due, and then whether the service given
merited an award to the complainant.
Quayle feels it is time to think again of a system in England and Wales
where surveys and mortgages are all settled before an offer is made and
accepted. This happens in Scotland. But a frequent objection there is that
this makes for unnecessary and expensive surveys before buyers find what
they want.
Quayle counters that the Scots know they are spending risk money; it is
considered part of the game. In England, though, buyers view a place as
their new house the moment their offer is accepted - subject to contract and
survey, of course.
He says conveyancing could be speeded if solicitors acting for sellers
started the searches, and if all houses had a log book (as do some new
houses and Anglican churches) - a move proposed by the chairman of the OCEA
council, Lady Mallalieu.
Quayle also urges buyers to start their mortgage inquiries before they even
offer. 'Find out what the building society will give on the basis of income,
and then you know what you can afford,' he says. That would cut delay and
help the seller, who would know that the buyer was likely to complete.
These suggestions show that the property market needs more openness and
consideration for the other party. That would do wonders for the often
abysmal public esteem for estate agents, and might even produce better
prices if buyers and sellers took it on themselves to start the legal and
financial investigations well ahead of the decisions on what to buy or whom
to sell it to.
Perhaps such changes will come only through legislation. In the meantime,
Quayle says the OCEA scheme is improving the quality of estate agencies and
their public esteem. He champions clear English and encourages young
recruits to the business to take the National and Scottish Vocational
Qualifications in estate agency. All power to his elbow.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Property: Your own windmill? - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you long to live somewhere different, a working windmill with its mill
house is for sale in Stanton, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.
The windmill, listed grade II* and a scheduled ancient monument, was built
in 1751 but was moved to its present site around 1820, when the mill house
was built. The price is Pounds 135,000 from Hamptons in Bury (0284-767338)
or Kevin Henry in Saffron Walden (0799-513632).
At Tregurtha Downs near Marazion, Cornwall, you can buy a tall engine house
once used for powering a tin mine. It was built in 1883 and mining continued
until 1900. In 1903, the engine was taken out and moved to the South Crofty
mine, where it worked until 1955.
The engine house, looking like a Norman castle combined with a chapel, was
turned into a home in 1987. Offers over Pounds 175,000 are invited by Miller
in Truro (0872-74211).
Equally unusual are plans for an earth-sheltered home for sale at Ashmead
House in Fulbrook, near Burford in Oxfordshire. By building the house into
the soil, there is an enormous saving of energy, while the building is
intended to merge with its surroundings to make a harmonious whole. The
agent, John D. Wood in Oxford (0865-311522), also points out that it will
provide greater protection than usual against burglary.
There is a choice between two plans, priced at Pounds 275,000 or Pounds
250,000 and designed by David Woods. Both allow plenty of natural light,
through the roofs or conventional windows looking out on open areas.
Mr and Mrs Kipling loved Rudyard Lake in Staffordshire so much that they
named their son after it. Now, two boathouses are for sale there. The Lady
of the Lake, set in the lake itself and approached by a jetty, costs Pounds
175,000. The Shieling is on dry land and costs Pounds 65,000. The agent is
Jackson-Stops in Chester (0244-328361).
The House Builders Federation, representing the builders of new homes, has
been complaining that prices of development land have shot up and will
threaten the recovery in the housing market.
With the cost of a plot forming about a fifth of the sale price of a house,
they say they cannot find enough land 'where people want to live'. But
plenty of derelict industrial land is available in our cities. It would help
society to develop such spaces, especially now there is an increasing tilt
at the Department of the Environment against out-of-town, car-dependent
shopping centres.
A wonderful, red-brick Tudor house is for sale in Northamptonshire. Fawsley
Hall (as in Lord St John of Fawsley) was derelict in 1972 when the present
owners bought it. Listed grade I, its highlight is a splendid Great Hall.
The house is set in a park (which it does not own) that was probably planned
by Capability Brown. In the middle of it, all on its own, is the parish
church. Savills in Banbury (0295-263535) is asking Pounds 1.25m.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Sport: Ryder Cup brings pain in Spain - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish venue for the 1997 Ryder Cup will be announced at the Volvo PGA
Championship at Wentworth on Wednesday. This was to have been the greatest
day in Spanish golf history, the culmination of a heavily romantic story
that began in 1976 when Severiano Ballesteros charmed us all with his
performance in the Open Championship at Royal Birkdale.
But sadly, the great day approaches with Spanish golf in turmoil. Seven
clubs have applied to stage the Ryder Cup but Valderrama, near Gibraltar, is
widely expected to win.
But Ballesteros, Spain's leading golfing ambassador, has fallen out with
Valderrama: last week he accused the club of offering him a bribe to support
their case, a claim he later retracted.
Ballesteros will not speak to the Spanish Golf Federation either - he has
accused it of being a cancer on the game.
Ballesteros is widely expected to be the 1997 Ryder Cup captain, but here
again there are wounds to be healed.
Last month he resigned from the Ryder Cup committee in a fit of pique when
it became obvious that his nomination, Novo Sancti Petri, near Cadiz, had no
chance. And last week, he raised the question of whether the committee,
which decides on who is to be captain, had been offered inducements by
Valderrama or any of the other venues.
'If he said that to my face I'd punch him on the nose,' said committee
member David Huish. Ballesteros said this week he did not mean to imply the
committee had acted dishonourably.
Adding to the elements of farce is the fact that the Ryder Cup will do
little for golf in Spain.
Parallels with taking football's World Cup to America are striking. The
Spanish do not care for golf. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has done
nothing to help Ballesteros in his long-standing desire to bring the game to
the masses.
Notoriously, Gonzalez declared 10 years ago that golf was a 'rich man's
game' and, of course, by providing no money to help build municipal courses
he has perpetuated his own theory.
It is an especially sorry situation given that for almost 20 years the
game's best loved and most charismatic figure has been a Spaniard.
More than any other golfer, Ballesteros has been responsible for the recent
explosion of interest in the sport, but in his own backyard there has been
no reaction. Even now, when golf courses have appeared all over Europe,
Spain has just one 18-hole public course, and to get on that you have to be
in the know.
To be fair, the Spanish Golf Federation does have a number of schemes,
including the Escorial School in Madrid, to help those who are not from
wealthy backgrounds to play the game. However, little help is forthcoming
from the sports ministry and with no available courses, it faces an almost
impossible task.
Here is an example of the impact golf currently has on Spanish sporting
life: in Jerez in February, when Ballesteros made his comeback to the game
after a four-month break, the news promoted a small army of golf
correspondents and sports feature writers to travel from Britain. The story
took up half of page 40 in each of the two 48-page tabloid Spanish sports
dailies.
On that comeback day, Ballesteros played with Jack Nicklaus, the game's
greatest name, and Miguel Jiminez, who comes from Jerez.
The number of spectators following the trio reached a grand total of 42.
'Passion for Golf', said a sign by the 18th, belonging to the Spanish
tourist board . . .but little was in evidence.
So why is the Ryder Cup going to Spain?
Ireland, as golf-obsessed a country as it is possible to find, has never
hosted the contest. Spain was chosen because of the support the country has
given to the European Tour since 1971. But the golf there is played by
ex-patriots, tourists and the Spanish elite. As for sponsorship, the Spanish
tourist board almost single-handedly sponsored the early part of this year's
tour. Acutely aware of the importance of golf to tourism in many Spanish
regions, the board sponsored events in all the holiday areas, such as
Andalucia, the Costa del Sol and the islands, Majorca and Tenerife.
This has brought accusations that the Ryder Cup has become a crutch to prop
up the European Tour's schedule.
Regardless of who gets the nomination, what is to be fervently hoped is that
in the 40 or so months that remain before the contest, some dramatic strides
forward are made in the infrastructure of the game in Spain.
The glory of the matches is the impact they have in getting people
interested in the sport. But that will be lost if average sports-minded
Spaniards, intrigued as they undoubtedly will be by the Ryder Cup, seek out
a place to play the game themselves only to find none available.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Sleepers meet outsiders - Nigel Andrews reports from
the bracing peaks and wacky foothills of Cannes '94
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bet-placing for the Palme d'Or has now reached fever pitch, but the 'Titre
d'Or' award has been in no doubt. It goes to France's Grosse Fatigue. This
title coaxes a sour chuckle from every festivalgoer who has spent the last
week rising at seven, reeling from film to film through the day, winding up
at midnight.
And this in a quiet Cannes. With most Hollywood stars detained at Gatt-point
back in America by studios still smouldering about Euro-protectionism, there
is little otiose razzmatazz. And the 'no show' disease seems to have spread
east with the suddenly-announced absence of the Palmists' current
co-favourite, Zhang Yimou.
His film To Live is a mordant, majestic fresco of life under Mao. It covers
similar historical terrain to last year's Farewell My Concubine, but from a
more intimist, venom-tipped viewpoint. We watch the trials and tragedies of
a poor couple (Gong Li, Ge You), who lose their children, their livelihood
(shadow puppetry) and most of their emotional bearings in the tidal wave of
Great Leaps Forward and Cultural Revolutions. Zhang's style is less fierce,
less 'Jacobean' here than in Ju Dou or Raise The Red Lantern. But he is a
master at probing the psychology of 'ordinary' people and at juggling horror
and hilarity in the same scene. Piece de resistance is the daughter's
disastrous sojourn in a maternity hospital, where the doctors have all been
dismissed or jailed - as 'too reactionary' - and the trainee nurses must
cope with haemorrhaging and hysteria. You do not know whether to laugh or
cry or hide under the seat.
So where was Zhang himself? Not in jail, but detained in China where his
film is failing to get a censor's visa. With the fifth anniversary of
Tiananman Square only two weeks off, the stage now seems set for another
East-West human rights row, with a powerful movie as rallying-point.
The other Cannes favourite is more subtly political. Kieslowski's Three
Colours Red is part three of his trilogy on tricoleur themes. A meditation
on fraternity set in that capital of brokered harmony, Geneva, it stars
Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. She is a goodhearted model, he is a
retired judge with an odd hobby - electronically snooping on his neighbours.
First question prompted by Red: Is 'brotherhood' a beneficiary or casualty
of the age of communications? Kieslowski begins with a dazzling high-speed
montage of multicoloured phone-lines and snaking undersea cables, as if to
crystallise and satirise at once the iconography of the 'information
highway'.
Second question: is there a brotherhood (or sisterhood) that leaps across
time and gadgetry? Trintignant's life and destiny seem to be being repeated,
eerily, in the tale of a young lawyer who lives near Miss Jacob.
Third question: is this is as good a movie as K's previous ones? I thought
not. Though stylishly shot by cameraman Piotr Sobocinski, with the title
colour heraldically picked out in every interior and street scene, the movie
seems too composed, too attitudinising. It is like a mannequins' catwalk
through previous Kieslowski obsessions and sign-landscapes. The mystical
coincidences, so haunting in Blue or The Double Life Of Veronique, seem
over-wrought. And the ending, a mid-channel ferry mishap of wild
improbability, is a disaster-ex-machina designed purely to spotlight the
trilogy's main characters.
Kieslowski's film still seems like the complete works of Eisenstein compared
with some competition entries. Apart from a neighbour licensed to wield a
hatpin, how do you stay conscious through films like, say, Italy's Barnabo
Of The Mountains, with its handsome border guard righting wrongs and
dreaming dreams in a movie designed (on a bad day) by Caspar David
Friedrich; or Russia's Riaba My Chicken, all about post-glasnost peasants
still glazed with the collectivist ideal; or France's laborious spy epic Les
Patriotes, 2 1/2 hours of cross and double-cross with existential
pretensions.
Once you descend from the bracing peaks you might as well head for the wacky
foothills. Showing in a sidebar was Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, a title I
casually mentioned in my last report, not having seen the movie. It has now
become the sleeper of the entire festival. Terence Stamp and a pair of
Aussies play the drag artistes who break down in their touring bus and bring
culture-shock, or couture-shock, to the Outback.
Writer-director Stephan Elliott, who has clearly not slept since last year's
Cannes when his Frauds was in competition, makes free with the mascara, the
lingerie, the song-and-dance numbers and the one-liners. It is very funny
and endearing and it has turned Mr Stamp into the comeback kid of Cannes
'94.
Also out-of-competition were a fleet of bargain-budget American movies: the
kind that slip quietly out of Port Hollywood while the big ships are tied up
by cultural embargo. Best of them was Rory Kelly's Sleep With Me, a game of
musical beds involving Eric Stoltz, Meg Tilly and Craig Sheffer. Three
lovers revolve on the sharp points of an eternal triangle while four
scriptwriters (no less) did relay work on the witty, fizzing dialogue.
To call Cannes '94 a transitional festival may be understating it. The
absence of large-scale US celluloid meant that flags were run up by nations
virtually unheard-of before at this event. The flags merited respect, if not
automatic saluting. Iran's gauche, meandering movie about movie-making,
Across The Olive Trees, won applause for its 'charm': a word deadly with
condescension at Cannes. And Mexico's Queen Of The Night was another chunk
of magical realism from a part of the world already over-productive in that
commodity.
Cambodia, however, offered the genuinely powerful People Of The Rice Field.
Though this looked at first like 'Cold Comfort Paddy', as the villagers
waded through the rice-swamps cursing the weather and the snakes and
flashbacking almost nostalgically to the days of the Khmer Rouge, the story
gathers strength. Its Hardyesque architecture of fate rises to the challenge
of a genuinely tragic climax.
Rithy Panh's film is the only late-arriving outsider that might surprise us
on prize night. No - there is one other: I have just seen it. Nanni
Moretti's Dear Diary is a ramshackle autobiographical comedy from the
bearded Roman comic who looks like Woody Allen re-designed by El Greco. It
is no more than a 'musing on life' in three parts. First, he tootles around
Rome on his moped, voice-overing thoughts about life, love and cinema. Then
he island-hops with a writer friend. Then, suspecting cancer, he goes
through a series of medical tests worthy of Allen in Hannah And Her Sisters.
This is a film with true charm: not the brittle charisma of naivety, but the
magic of a self-deprecating honesty served up with wit and a wayward,
garrulous poetry.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Pinter - prince of pauses / Alastair Macaulay enjoys
the wordless moments as much as the prose
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sooner or later some bright Ph. D. student is going to publish a thesis on
'The Pause in 20th-Century Drama'. The origins of the pause will no doubt be
traced back to Greek drama and to Shakespeare; Ibsen may be acknowledge as
the secret godfather of the pause, and Chekhov as its undisputed father. The
prose of Proust and Joyce, the poetry of Pound and Eliot, the films of DW
Griffiths et seq., the music of Erik Satie and John Cage, will all be seen
as major influences, and the importance of Stanislavski and Brecht will be
given due weight. The Pause will be seen as one of the key technical and
expressive devices of modernism.
The pause in Beckett will be reassessed, of course, and given yet more
honour. A revisionist chapter will give fresh credit to Joe Orton and
Marguerite Duras for their hitherto under-praised use of the pause in all
its ambiguities. Who knows? Maybe Coward and Rattigan will prove to have
been secret masters of the pause as well. I confess that I await 'The Pause
in 20th-Century Drama' with no small impatience. But it will stand or fall
by its treatment of Harold Pinter.
Readers of Pinter's plays will know that 'Pause' and 'Silence' are frequent
directions in the text, and will have pondered the separate implications of
both words. Theatre-goers, however, may feel that there should be more than
two words to cover the wordless moments in Pinter. If the Eskimos have
umpteen different words for snow, after all, why not as many for Pinter's
pauses? He gives them umpteen different nuances.
In One for the Road (1984), pauses are simply part of police-state
interrogation. In four scenes, Nicholas, who is or seems to be chief of
police, interviews a family of prisoners: husband, wife, seven-year-old son.
The pauses here are filled with suspense. They are the prisoners' refusal to
answer, their failure to comprehend the question, their shock at the nature
of the question, and they are also moments in which the interrogator changes
tack from one line of thought to another.
As often in Pinter, one actually finds oneself wanting more pauses, for
Nicholas - who does almost all the talking - jumps from one thought to
another with bewildering fluency. The bewilderment is both ours and the
prisoners'; and so, as we follow Nicholas's words, we begin to react as they
do. Nicholas is a monomaniac, and his interrogation is at least half filled
by his declarations of his own importance, his nearness to God, and his
irresistible allure. As he proceeds, we sense something else: that all his
talk only reveals the flaws of his own mind. Silence, by contrast, is
golden.
One for the Road was being performed in the second week of Dublin's Gate
Theatre's Pinter Festival, along with Old Times (1971). Talk about contrast]
Whereas One for the Road is (with Mountain Language) Pinter's most overtly
political play, Old Times is entirely to do with a man (Deeley) and a woman
(Anna) meeting, and in part competing, to stake personal claims upon the
past and present of Deeley's wife, Kate. And whereas the several ambiguities
of One for the Road (director: John Crowley) are not its most forceful
feature, the ambiguities of Old Times (directed by Kevin Billington) keep
growing.
Deep beneath the surface, however, both plays express one of Pinter's most
deep-held concerns: that no one can or should possess or control anyone
else. In One for the Road, this point is immediately and overtly political.
In Old Times, it is subtly and eventually feminist: Kate resists the claims
of both husband and oldest friend, affirming her own independence no less
than Nora in A Doll's House. Yet the play is no more about her than it is
about the other two. Very beautifully, it shows time past within time
present, and shows people using, and being used by, old times. Not only can
no one be possessed by anyone else; eventually, no one can ever be known by
anyone else. Here is the quintessence of Pinter.
A brilliant gimmick of this festival has been to cast a leading actor, each
week, in two plays. In Week Two it was Michael Pennington who played both
Nicholas and Deeley. Pennington is one of the last of a line of those RSC
stars whose command of vocal technique is (forgive the pun) breathtaking.
His Nicholas is a bass, his Deeley a tenor. He can, as Nicholas, produce an
effortless fortissimo - and then, as a psychological twist, produce an
effort-ful fortissimo. His phrasing is always musical, and one attends to
his every word. His only abiding fault - never a major problem, but a fault
in Pinter as in Shakespeare  - is that he lacks the art to conceal his own
art.
In this pair of Pinters, however, I found that he slightly overplayed the
contrast between the two characters. Deeley has his feeble side, sure; but
if Nicholas is played so much as the sinister controlling figure, One for
the Road loses its subtler tensions. This fault was shared by his Irish
colleagues, who stressed the terrorised protesting side of the imprisoned
family. The two women in Old Times, Olwen Fouere and Catherine Byrne, were
also Irish. Doesn't the text suggest reverse casting? Though the play is set
in England, Deeley slips into Joyce-like parlance ('bejasus'), whereas
Anna's lyrical stream-of-consciousness flights sound rather Virginia Woolf.
This hardly matters, however. All the Irish actors bring a naturalness to
Pinter that frees his plays of the hothouse atmosphere that can, in England,
become precious. And a common theme throughout the festival has been the
designs by Eileen Diss. Their elegant economy is always in ideal accord with
the plays. At each performance the Dublin audience responds readily to
Pinter's humour, lyricism, and deeper humanity.
The Pinter Festival ends this week with a matinee of Landscape and evening
of Moonlight.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: The Count of Monte Cristo - Malcolm Rutherford admires
a new staged adaptation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the 150th anniversary of one of the most prolific literary
achievements of all time. In 1844 Alexandre Dumas produced both The Three
Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. They were first written in
instalments for magazines; the books came later, then the plays and
ultimately the movies. Dumas himself wrote a popular stage version of The
Count which required four evenings to perform.
The enthralling new adaptation at the Manchester Royal Exchange Theatre is
slightly more modest. The first night began just after 6 pm and, with a few
intervals, was over shortly after midnight. The adapters, James Maxwell and
Jonathan Hackett, have divided the novel into two parts: Treasure and
Revenge. Although for most of the season they will be shown separately,
there is much to be said for taking in the full sweep at one sitting.
'Sweep' is what it is. There is no wholly satisfactory term to describe the
Dumas style. 'Romantic epic' perhaps comes closest. There is not much
feeling, but the action comes in bucket-loads. Wild and improbable though
the story may seem (it was partly based on a police record), somehow it
never breaks into parody. The secret, I think, is that there is a realistic
social background: beyond the ball-room glitter and the talk of millions of
francs, poverty, prison and fear are never far away. It is the role of the
Count to provide the mystery and the magic.
In the Manchester production, directed by Braham Murray, there are two
outstanding accomplishments. One is the use of the Royal Exchange stage; the
other is the performance of David Threlfall as the Count.
This is theatre in the round, but not of the conventional kind. There are
galleries all round the stage as well. Simon Higlett's settings use the
space and the height to the full. Characters come down on ropes, there are
firework displays and strange sprite-like creatures dressed in red flit
about all over the place. It is never quite clear, though never distracting,
which entrance will be used next. Indeed it all adds to the impression that
the Count can appear from anywhere.
Threlfall's energy and stamina are prodigious. He is a tall actor - or
perhaps the height of the roof and the smallness of the others make him seem
taller than he is. He appears in several guises: young sailor, priest,
eccentric English lord as well as the Count. At his most unforgettable, he
is standing erect in evening clothes with long black flowing hair: a
Mephistopheles figure who can do good as well as evil.
Like Hamlet, the Count can also fence and there is a certain melancholy
about him. When challenged to a duel, he suggests - apart from the
conventional choice of weapons - drawing lots on who should commit suicide.
None of the other characters quite come up to him, though that is not to
disparage: they are not meant to. Some of them impress, like Clive
Llewellyn's mute slave, merely by being there and giving presence. This is a
team performance where no-one falls short.
The scenes change swiftly and frequently: note, for instance, when the Count
appears at the opera. Even after nearly six hours we are off to new
territory when one of the characters is kidnapped by bandits and kept in a
cage. The Count could go on for ever. Nothing ever flags: neither the
imagination, nor the playing.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Pericles diffused - Martin Hoyle on the National's new
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The huge disc that dominates the Olivier stage in Pericles at the National
is planked like a galleon's deck and blistered with what might be lunar
craters or froth bubbles; a reminder from Mark Thompson's designs that the
moon and the sea propel the action in this rambling odyssey. Or it could be
a giant beer-mat.
Phyllida Lloyd's production draws on styles and cultures from South American
jungle to ice-bound Inuit, Arab to African to oriental. There is music.
There is dance, not as much as advance publicity led us to fear but still
interminable. From the home country there is a dash of pantomime and a hint,
in the brothel scenes, of Carry On (one day Barbara Windsor must play the
Bawd). And the net result is to make a sprawl more sprawling still.
Ms Lloyd's production of Britten's Gloriana, much praised at its Opera North
base raised doubts at Covent Garden: it failed to paper over cracks in
disjointed narrative or iron out unevenly distributed dramatic action. It
substituted business for an overall view; and made a long work longer. The
same might be said of this Shakespeare production, particularly damaging in
a piece that needs to be focused, cohesive and concentrated. Here it is
merely diffused.
Part of the trouble is the character of Pericles himself, at first glance
tailor-made for the Green Party candidate that Douglas Hodge is in real
life. The prince is a jolly good sort, suffers, and is reunited with his
dispersed family; all without achieving any noticeable human character. Some
themes may herald the last great works but much is hack stuff, possibly
already extant when Shaklespeare took it up.
Mr Hodge does well in a psychologically non-existent role that requires him
to be a boy scout for most of the evening before briefly turning into King
Lear. His early, slightly gormless, decency finds a natural resolution in
the almost wimpering exhaustion from happy gratitude to the goddess Diana -
the production at least ends movingly.
But mainly it limits itself to throwing visual gimmicks at the piece and
hoping for the best. The chorus-figure Gower (pointedly not ancient in his
famous opening words, 'From ashes ancient (pause) Gower is come') emerges
from the same grand piano in which Thaisa's presumed corpse is consigned to
the sea. Why? Sexual cross-over in the casting seems to have no rationale
behind it - unlike the famous 1973 Round House production which boasted a
Bawd, G-stringed, fish-netted and high-heeled, in the wickedly cherubic
shape of Harold Innocent. Tom Yang comes off best as the murderous
foster-mother, an imposing presence flouncing, swirling and fluting, a cross
between M Butterfly and Cruella de Vil. Poor Selina Cadell, on the other
hand, looks and patently feels absurd as a bespectacled elder statesman.
Visually there are treats but it is all too picturesque. Fairy-tales need
the anchor of normality as a point of reference; when everything is
grotesque you cease to care; the lost chord in Pericles' perceived music of
the spheres is the sound of a great 'So what?' The first real stroke of
theatre, when Thaisa is resuscitated not gracefully but screaming, reliving
the pains of childbirth, occurs after an hour and a half.
In a not entirely audible cast, Kathryn Hunter brings her gnomic
individuality to roles as varied as the nasally cockney Bawd and the
incestuous king (a monstrous Ralph Steadman-like figure, tiny crowned head
atop fifteen feet of red robe, scarecrow stilt-arms waving). Susan Lynch's
Ulster-accented Marina is a tough, sparkish waif who replaces the part's
usual pathos with Paisleyite pugnacity. Of the French-accented dancer chosen
to speak the goddess's important words, the less said the better. The
overall impression is of watching an ambitious production of The Magic Flute
without Mozart's music. And what an experience that would be.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Beautiful in isolation - William Packer admires the
work of Marie-Louise Motesiczky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We fondly believe that talent will out, that all artists of true stature are
known to us and set in their proper art historical place. But what if such
artists would rather cherish their obscurity, happy enough, pace the poet
Gray, that their blooms should blush unseen, wasting their sweetness on the
desert air?
In considering the comparative obscurity of Marie-Louise von Motesiczky, we
can only conclude that either she has been a victim of crass critical
myopia, or she preferred it that way. Marie-Louise addresses the point
herself. 'It was my fate that for decades I concentrated on only a very few
people, both artistically and personally . . . Isolation is a word. It
sounds sad, but it can also be something very beautiful.'
Happily in her old age, with a substantial retrospective in Vienna and
London in 1985 and now this smaller but extremely choice study at
Manchester, that obscurity is more comparative than it was. For she was
known of, certainly, in Germany, moving in the circles of Max Beckmann, who
admired her work, and of Oscar Kokoschka, who drew her.
She was born in Vienna in 1906, and studied there before going to Frankfurt
in 1923, where she first met Beckmann. He invited her to join his classes at
the Stadel, where she stayed until 1928 before returning to Austria. With
the Anschluss of 1938, she left for Holland, and it was only then, at the
Hague early the following year, that she first showed her work.
That summer she came England, moving to London after the war, where she has
lived ever since. 'I like the reticence of English life', she writes: 'The
artist is left alone with himself.' It was not until 1960, at the Beaux Arts
Gallery, that she had her first solo show in England. Thirty-four years on
and her score is three.
She is, even so, as interesting a painter as any in her time. The influences
are evident - Beckmann first and most directly formative, with his breadth
of statement and graphic directness; Kokoschka later on, thinner in the
paint, more fluid in the drawing, more poignant in symbolic effect; and
nods, too, to Matisse and the symbolist expressionism of Chagall, Corinth
and Liebermann.
But all artists are thus of their time and circumstance. What matters is
only what they make of them. Moving freely as she has between the School of
Paris and the German modernism of the 1920s and 30s, Marie-Louise has never
been anything less than herself. She has had, always, her own particular
eye, and touch, and wit - above all, her wit, delicate, affectionate,
ironical, less bleak than Beckmann, less anxious than Kokoschka.
Her gift is an ability to move easily from the narrative and symbolic, to
the formal and objective, to the personal and intimate. Her paintings of her
mother in extreme old age bring all these aspects together in single images.
But perhaps the self-portraits are her truest images of all, now the young
artist in Paris combing her long straight hair, now, a little later,
self-mockingly full-length at the dress-maker's, or wide-eyed and surprised
at herself so beautiful beneath her straw hat. And always, stopping us in
our tracks, is that same calm, questioning gaze of those big, sad eyes.
Marie-Lousie von Motesiczky: paintings 1925-93. City Art Galleries, Mosley
Street, Manchester, until June 19.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Inheritance goes public - Antony Thorncroft explains
why tax free treasures must be accessible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was one of the easiest scams going. If you inherited a valuable antique
you could avoid paying inheritance tax by putting it on the Inland Revenue's
register of 'conditionally exempt' works of art. In theory there was a
downside: the work must then be available for public view so that the
curious could pop into your home for a look.
But since virtually no one was aware of the existence of the register this
was not much of an obstacle. In the average year about four people turned up
at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum to wade through the files in the hope of
finding an object they wanted to examine.
So it must have been unsettling for the owners of exempt works to be
suddenly flooded with requests to view. There were about 500 enquiries
seeking access to untaxed treasures in the last few months. But the calls
were, in fact, from students, hired by the Inland Revenue to test the
system.
Stung by criticism, the Inland Revenue has been attempting to rectify what
was basically a scandal in the making. It has computerised the works of art
on the list, making copies available in Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast; and
it has publicised its existence by giving regular up-dates on new additions.
Recruiting the students was the start of regular checks. The threat is that
any owner making undue difficulties about access will get a tax bill pretty
sharpish. The register is, however, not without its problems. You have to to
know what to look for. Requesting a list of paintings by Turner turns up
nine held in private hands, but also includes works by Turner of Oxford, FC
Turner and Francis Turner.
Ironically it is owners rather than the public that have taken most
advantage of the increased awareness of the system. The number of works of
art given exemption has rocketed. In the last quarter alone a further 843
signed on, for a total of 12,340.
Flicking through the register the same names, or rather the family
solicitors who shield owners from possible burglars, occur again and again.
There are quite a number of museums credited as contacts, too, which
suggests that the works of art are already on view: anything in a museum or
in a house open to the public automatically qualifies for tax exemption, and
does not need to appear on the list. This ensures that great houses, like
Chatsworth and Blenheim, are not devastated by death duties, while holding a
tantalising question mark over the wonderful Old Masters belonging to the
Duke of Sutherland on permanent loan to the National Museum of Scotland.
It is probable that the rising number of works going public to avoid tax
reflects the recession in the art market. Anyone inheriting a Henry Moore or
a Gainsborough is best advised to wait for prices to rise before disposing
of it. Whatever the reason, exemption is a tax break which needs constant
examination.
The Treasury certainly thinks so and is dubious of the argument that
exemption bolsters the heritage and prevents national treasures being sold
abroad. The parallel scheme whereby you can pay off tax by giving antiques
to the nation was created in the face of Treasury opposition and has never
really got off the ground. The annual allowance of Pounds 12m is rarely
taken up, thanks to a lack of publicity.
Making sure that owners of works of art give something back to the nation in
return for their tax free inheritance is part of a new concern on the part
of the Exchequer. Changes may be needed to ensure that the scheme really
does benefit scholars, and the public generally, rather than just owners.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: The plight of the Prado - This great museum is being
allowed to rot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last century a Madrid journalist dramatically informed an unsuspecting
public that the Prado museum had burnt down. It was a spoof article based on
a disturbing fact: such was the official neglect of the art collection that
its reduced staff of watchmen regularly lit fires within the building in
order to cook their meals and to keep warm.
A new Prado director, archaeologist Jose Mara Luzon was appointed yesterday
 -the fourth incumbent in the past three years - and he will find that not
much has changed. Nobody burns charcoal alongside a Goya these days but nine
months ago the museum's roof sprung a leak and rain water poured into
strategically placed buckets in the main Velazquez room.
The plight of the Prado, arguably the finest art collection in the world, is
a damning indictment of political meddling in cultural institutions.
Directors come and go at the whim of the minister of culture while the
museum's pressing need to acquire adequate funding and a stable
institutional framework is ignored.
An internal memorandum drawn up the Prado's board of trustees in 1992 warned
that the museum 'continues to suffer a slow deterioration. Its problems are
almost the same as those that existed at the end of the 19th century.' Art
historian Francisco Calvo Serraller, who resigned as the Prado's director a
week ago, complained that the museum 'systematically lacked the most
elementary means' to improve its lot and that there was 'not the slightest
sign' that the government intended to correct the situtation.
The conservative opposition party tabled a parliamentary motion in February
calling on the Prado's director and curators to prepare a wide-ranging
report on the state of the museum. The motion, which also called for a
parliamentary hearing to examine the report, was defeated by the governing
socialist party.
The key issue, which the report and the hearing would inevitably have
addressed, concerns the independence of the museum to run its own affairs.
'The Prado cannot be a toy in the hands of whoever happens to be the
minister of culture,' said Miguel Angel Cortes, the conservative opposition
spokesman on the arts.
A semi-autonomous status is probably the most that can be hoped for. 'No
minister of culture is going to give up lording it over the Prado,' said a
member of the museum's board of trustees, who asked not to be named.
If the Prado's senior staff members, with the backing of independent
trustees, were allowed to have a greater say in the running of the museum,
their first decision would be to increase their numbers. The Prado has only
seven curators, only three of which have tenure.
Although the museum possess the finest collection of 17th century Venetian
paintings under a single roof, and a leaky one at that, it does not have an
senior Italian art specialist. Nor can it afford to publish a comprehensive
catalogue.
The culture ministry has, in contrast, been lavish with its allocations to
Madrid's Reina Sofa arts centre, a modern and contemporary art museum which
has been inaugurated on three occasions by successive ministers in the past
decade. The Reina Sofa's most recent re-opening, in 1992, also marked one of
the Prado lowest hours; it followed extensive refurbishing to house
Picasso's Guernica and its 63 accompanying sketches, all of which were
transferred from the Prado.
According to opposition arts spokesman Cortes, the Reina Sofa has an annual
maintenance budget from the ministry of Pta169m (Pounds 186,000), four times
more than the allocation for the upkeep of the Prado.
Luzon's first words on his appointment were hardly reassuring for those
concerned about the future of the Prado: 'there are people who become
impatient when they get a top administration job but this is not a Formula
One race,' he said. 'It is a very slow process.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Summer Festivals: Dance takes pride of place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After many fallow and frightful years, dancing has an honourable place once
more at the Edinburgh Festival, a fact surely not unconnected with the
opening of the new Festival Theatre, which is the desperate old Empire
Theatre re-born, re-furbished, and not before time too.
Mark Morris, who had a great success at last year's jamboree, returns with
his finest creation, L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato. It crowds the
stage with memorable dancing, ravishing images. Handel's music will be given
by a distinguished group of soloists and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Not
to be missed: performances between August 20 and 22 at the Festival Theatre.
Also not to be missed is the Miami City Ballet, a strong company directed by
Edward Villella. Villella was a tremendous dancer for 20 years with
Balanchine's New York City Ballet, and he has made the Miami ensemble a home
for Balanchine choreography, which is danced with verve and clarity. Three
acts of the sublime Jewels are on view between August 15 and 17; a quadruple
bill on August 19, 20. Performances in the cavernously dour Playhouse.
The festival also presents Merce Cunningham and his dancers with two recent
pieces on August 27, 28 at the Playhouse, while another American
dance-explorer, Lucinda Childs, will be at the Playhouse with two programmes
between August 23 and 25. Canadian choreographer, Jean-Pierre Perreault,
makes his British debut at the King's Theatre between August 20 and 22.
The Holland Festival, Amsterdam, will feature three major dance companies.
Merce Cunningham and his newest piece, Ocean, will be at the Muziektheater
between June 27 and 30. Nederlands Dans Theater is mounting a special
programme of choreographies by Hans van Manen and Jiri Kylian, inspired by
the paintings of Mondrian, at the Muziektheater on June 2, 4, 5, 7. The
Dutch National Ballet shows new works at the Stadsschouwburg, June 25, 26.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Summer Festivals: Jazz blows its own trumpet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
There are two kinds of jazz festival: a straining at the seams where there
is the potential for spontaneity or, more likely, a series of tenuously
linked concerts. Brecon and Cork, held over the weekend, and both floated on
prodigious amounts of ale, fall, literally, into the first category.
Brecon Jazz (August 12-14, Tel: 0874-625557) is held in the civic buildings,
hotels and meadows of the picturesque Welsh market town. This year the very
ovine Market Hall will swing to the sound of Slide Hampton's Jazz Masters'
Big band and George Shearing's 75th birthday celebration. 'Stroller'
day-pass tickets are available for the fringe concerts.
The Cork Jazz Festival (October 28 -31, Tel 21313131) is sponsored by, and
runs, on Guinness. It too takes over the town: the 'pub trail' comprises 25
bars and headline concerts are held in the Opera House.
The Glasgow International Jazz Festival (July 1 - 10, Tel 041 552 3572)
promises an intimate event on the cobbled streets of the old Merchant City.
The line-up is impressive and features pianists Herbie Hancock, Horace
Silver, Ahmad Jamal, Joe Zawinul and Bheki Mseleku. Trumpeter Bobby Watson
is composer-in-residence and drummer Max Roach is making a rare visit.
Likewise, much of the old town in Edinburgh (August 7-14, Tel: 031-557-1642)
is pervaded by a McMardi Gras atmosphere and McEwans 80/- sponsors a 'free
jazz trail'. Headliners this year include the Ted Heath Band.
The London gatherings make up for their lack of festival conviviality with
heavyweight programming. The 95.8 Capital FM/JVC Jazz Parade (July 16 - 24,
Tel: 071-379-1066) combines the reliably famous (Wynton Marsalis, Joe
Henderson and BB King) with the famously unreliable (Nina Simone) all found
in the un-festive confines of the Festival Hall. The London Jazz Festival,
last night tomorrow, spreads throughout North London with headline concerts
held in diverse places such as the Union Chapel and the splendid Hackney
Empire. Main attractions include Chick Corea and Carla Bley.
A long way from Hackney, the Stravinsky Hall in is the focus of the Montreux
Jazz Festival (July 1 - 16, Tel: 21 313 45 67). A mind boggling line-up
which features Van Morrison and Bob Dylan on consecutive nights also has the
entire Verve roster on the same stage across two nights. Purists will be
astonished to see names such as Johnny Cash on the same programme as
abstractionist Albert Mangelsdorf.
The only rival to Montreux, in terms of sheer volume and diversity of music,
is the North Sea Jazz Festival (July 8 - 10, Tel: 70 354 2958) which in one
weekend somehow manages to pack in 1000 artists on 13 stages under one roof,
the Dutch Congress Centre. Or one might prefer to sit under a tree on the
Ile du Berceau and listen to the sound of gypsy guitars carried by wafting
Gitanes smoke. The 15eme Festival de Jazz Django Reinhardt (June 24 -26,
Tel: 1 64 69 54 66), is traditionally a meeting place for guitar players,
and this year features young american saxophonist Steve Coleman.

<TEXT>
AIX-EN-PROVENCE
July 15 - 30
Ancien Palais de l'Archeveche, 13100 Aix-en-Provence, France. 33-42 17 34 00
Hard times have reached the South of France. From three operas Aix has had
to reduce to one: a new production of Mozart's Die Zauberflote by its
winning team of recent years, the conductor William Christie and producer
Robert Carsen. An uninspiring selection of concerts will probably not be
enough to tempt regulars back to this delightful town, though the food and
general air of good living might.
ALDEBURGH
June 10 - 26
High Street, Aldeburgh, Suffolk IP15 5AX. Tel 0728-453543
Britten and Stravinsky are the featured composers with a wide range of their
smaller-scale works on offer and a series of Stravinsky on film. The London
Contemporary Dance Theatre visits with a new programme combining the two
composers. The other stage event is Britten's Noye's Fludde. Recitalists
include Russian soprano Galina Gorchakova and pianist Pedja Muzijevic. New
music continues to features prominently with world or UK premieres of works
by Colin Matthews, Magnus Lindberg, Elena Firsova and Jonathan Lloyd

Kissinger Sommer, Postfach 2260, D-97672 Bad Kissingen, Germany. Tel
0971-807110 Fax 0971-807191
The attraction of Bad Kissingen is its north Bavarian setting and the
relaxed atmosphere of a former royal spa. The Regentenbau incorporates four
elegant concert halls, and there is also a fin-de-siecle theatre. Among this
year's events are a Schubert recital by Andras Schiff, song recitals by
Edita Gruberova and Wolfgang Holzmair, a Mahler concert with Christa Ludwig
and symphony concerts conducted by Donald Runnicles, Vaclav Neumann and
Vladimir Ashkenazy.
BATH
May 27 - June 12
Linley House, Pierrepoint Place, Bath BA1 1JY. Tel 0225-463362/466411
This is the first festival under the auspices of the Bath Festivals Trust,
launched to raise the profile of Bath as a festivals city. The theme of
'Ancient Echoes' links music of the past with music of the present. Kent
Opera, risen from the ashes, performs Britten's The Prodigal Son. Jonathan
Miller's staging of Bach's St. Matthew Passion gets open-air performances.
The Tallis Scholars, Frans Bruggen and Roger Norrington are among those
performing the music of the past, Gorecki and Nyman the featured
20th-century composers.
BAYREUTH
July 25 - August 28
Kartenburo der Bayreuther Festspiele, Postfach 100262, D-95402 Bayreuth,
Germany. Tel 0921-20221
This year's new Ring brings together arch-radical producer Alfred Kirchner
and arch-conservative conductor James Levine, but its most controversial
feature may turn out to be the designs of German illustrator Rosalie. John
Tomlinson's Wotan and Deborah Polaski's Brunnhilde are carried over from the
Kupfer production, and the new Siegfried is Wolfgang Schmidt. Giuseppe
Sinopoli takes over as conductor of Parsifal. The other revivals are Tristan
und Isolde and Der fliegende Hollander. Unless you are prepared to pay a
heavy black market premium, it is now too late to get hold of tickets.
BREGENZ
July 20 - August 26
Kartenburo der Bregenzer Festspiele, Postfach 311, A-6901 Bregenz, Austria.
Tel 05574-492 0223 Fax 05574-492 0228
The opera festival at the Austrian end of Lake Constance has won an enviable
reputation for artistic boldness, while preserving its appeal for tourist
audiences. David Pountney's spectacular 1993 production of Nabucco is
revived on the lakeside floating stage - counterbalanced in the nearby
indoor theatre by a rare staging of Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini, with
Mara Zampieri in the title role.
BRIGHTON FESTIVAL
Until May 31
The Dome Theatre, 29 New Rd, Brighton BN 1VG. Tel 0273-709709

Company from Poland. British theatre includes Cheek by Jowl's Measure for
Measure, the Wrestling School's staging of Howard Barker's Hated Nightfall.

Cheltenham is marking its golden jubilee year by celebrating 50 years as a
champion of contemporary music. Among the Cheltenham commissions being
revived from the last half-century are works by Maxwell Davies, Rawsthorne,
Maconchy, Lennox Berkeley and Williamson. To show that Cheltenham has a
future as well as a past there is an array of world premieres by Colin
Matthews, Powers, Heath, Bennett, Michael Berkeley, and a major new work by
Thea Musgrave. There is also a complete cycle of the Beethoven string
quartets.
CHELTENHAM LITERARY FESTIVAL
October 7 - 16
Tel 0242 521621
This has established itself as the largest in Europe. This year a new
director, children's writer Humphrey Carpenter, has introduced themed days.
For example, October 9 is Booker Day and introduces some of the short listed
writers, with critics giving their views on the likely winner. The 1894
Booker Prize will also be posthumously announced. Other theme days cover
science; psychology; the British whodunnit (with PD James); old devils of
20th century literature, starring Kingsley Amis; history; and the church in
literature, with Robert Runcie.
Among the writers promised are Alan Bennett, Douglas Adams, Craig Brown,
Susan Hill, Irish Murdoch, Joanna Trollope and Ian McEwan. Ralph Steadman is
Artist in Residence and he will stage the premiere of 'I Leonardo', his
imaginary autobiography of Leonardo.

Dresdner Musikfestspiele, Postfach 160106, D-01287 Dresden, Germany. Tel
0351-486 6666 Fax 0351-486 6307
With its great traditions and court palaces, Dresden has enormous potential
as a festival centre, but recession and the cost of reunification are
slowing the pace. The new festival director, Michael Hampe, has threaded a
programme around August the Strong, whose accession as Saxon ruler 300 years
ago heralded a golden era in Dresden's artistic life. Visiting baroque
specialists include I Solisti Veneti and Concerto Koln, and there will be a
chance to hear rare choral and operatic works by Telemann, Handel and Hasse.
The Semperoper has Capriccio with Felicity Lott, plus a new production of
The Cunning Little Vixen.
DROTTNINGHOLM
May 26 - September 9
'Forestallningar', Box 27050, 10251 Stockholm. Tel: (0)77-1707070
In this 18th-century working court theatre with original machinery and sets,
the emphasis is on operas from the period of the theatre's birth. This year
opens with the Swedish Royal Opera in Ungdom og galskap (Youth and Folly) by
Edouard Dupuy. Drottningolm's own productions are Haydn's Orlando Paladino
conducted by Nicholas McGegan and a fantasia on the works of Handel called
'Heavenly Handel' with Barbara Bonney and Anne Sofie von Otter among the
visiting singers. Arriving by boat from Stockholm is a delightful extra.
DULWICH
September 24 - October 2
75 Calton Avenue, London SE21 7DF. Tel 081-693 3577
This community festival provides a showcase for local talent, both amateur
and professional. Highlights include Camberwell Pocket Opera's The Marriage
of Figaro, London City Theatre's The Dumb Waiter, a poetry competition, jazz

EDINBURGH
August 14 - September 3
21, Market St, Edinburgh EHl 1BW. Tel 031-225 5756. Fax 031-226 7669
The 48th Edinburgh International Festival must be the biggest ever. The
opening of the Festival Theatre, which at last gives the Festival a stage
large enough to handle the grandest lyric theatre, also means that director
Brian McMaster has another 24,000 tickets to sell.
Beethoven is the festival composer this year and the first production at the
Festival Theatre is Scottish Opera's Fidelio on August 15. Also appearing
there is the Australian Opera in Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and
those Edinburgh favourites the Mark Morris Dance Group from the US.
All nine Beethoven symphonies will be played, by orchestras from Cleveland,
Stavanger and Hamburg plus the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, as
well as all his five piano concertos and many of his string quartets. Among
the musicians involved are Alfred Brendel, Andras Schiff and Piotr
Anderszewski. The other featured composer is Emmanuel Chabrier, a
contemporary of Bizet.
Opera North performs the pantomime-like L'Etoile and the comic opera Le Roi
Malgre Lui, while there is a concert performance of his unfinished opera
Brises. The opening concert at the Usher Hall is the Royal Scottish National
Orchestra with Mahler's 'Symphony of a Thousand', and the closing is Elgar's
'The Dream of Gerontius' with the same orchestra.
Making a return to the festival are directors Peter Stein and Robert Lepage.
Stein presents a Russian cast in Aeschylus' trilogy Oresteia, which will
last 7 1/2 hours, while Lepage gives a world premiere of his new work, The
Seven Streams of the River Ota, the river which runs underneath Hiroshima.
Among the other theatrical works on offer are Goethe's Torquato Tasso, about
the 16th century Italian poet, in an English translation; JM Synge's The
Well of the Saints from the Abbey Theatre of Dublin; and two Shakespeare
plays, Antony and Cleopatra, performed in German by the Berliner Ensemble,
and The Winter's Tale, performed in French by the National Drama Centre of
Orleans. Luc Bondy makes his UK directorial debut with a quintessential
international festival production, The hour we knew nothing of each other, a
play without words by Peter Handke, performed by the Schaubuhne Theatre,
Berlin. Over 30 actors will play more than 400 characters on the vast stage
of the Festival Theatre.
Ticket prices have been changed, making the best seats more expensive but
increasing the number of cheap seats. There will also be Pounds 5 'day
seats' for certain major productions. The Festival still lacks a strong
visual arts programme but the main summer exhibitions organised by the
National Galleries of Scotland, in particular 'Monet to Matisse: landscape
painting in France 1874-1914', will be on show throughout the Festival.
In addition, of course, running concurrently with the Festival, will be the
Edinburgh Fringe, the largest festival in the world and the national
showcase for comedy; the Film Festival; and the Jazz Festival, as well as
the Military Tattoo.

Until May 30
Tel 0497-821299. Fax 0497-821066
Most people, even non-readers, have heard of the bookshop at Hay-on-Wye and
of the Hay Festival, an eclectic gathering of writers and entertainers
reading from, talking about or performing their work. This year, there are
100 events ranging from Soweto Jive Music to writing masterclasses through
Indian cinema, mountaineering, Scandinavian poetry and a PEN lecture by
Carlos Fuentes.
Hay means instruction and delight. James Fenton, the new Oxford Professor of

Netherlands. Tel 070-320 2500 Fax 070-320 2611
This year's Holland Festival centres on opera and music theatre. The most
eye-catching events are rare performances of Chausson's Le Roi Arthus and
Max Brand's Machinist Hopkins, plus the continuation of John Eliot
Gardiner's Mozart cycle with Don Giovanni. Another theme is the idea of
musical realisation - such as Bruno Maderna's version of Monteverdi's
L'Orfeo. The concert programme focuses on young Chinese composers. Other
attractions include theatre productions by Peter Zadek and Peter Brook, and
a tribute to choreographer Merce Cunningham.

Tel 212-258 3212 Fax 212-261 8823
Istanbul's arts festival aims to stress the city's historic role as a bridge
between Europe and Asia, but its programme is unashamedly western in origin.
This year's guests include the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Gunther Herbig,
the English Chamber Orchestra under James Judd and Dresden Philharmonic with
soprano Hildegard Behrens. Valery Gergiev conducts the Kirov Opera Orchestra
and Chorus in a series of concerts, and Roland Petit brings his Ballet

Postfach 5, D-83708 Kreuth, Germany. Tel 08029-1819 Fax 08029-1828
The lakeside setting of Kreuth, a former court spa at the foot of the
Bavarian Alps, makes this one of Europe's most peaceful and intimate
festivals. It was founded five years ago by the late Russian violinist Oleg
Kagan and his cellist wife Natalia Gutman, and is notable for attracting
high-powered virtuosi. This year's programme is headed by Sviatoslav Richter
and Martha Argerich.
KYBURGIADE

CH-8400 Winterthur, Switzerland. Tel 01-251 4044 Fax 01-251 4060
Now in its third year, the Kyburgiade owes its unique atmosphere to the
open-air setting of Kyburg Castle near the Swiss town of Winterthur, and to
the participation of one of Europe's leading young string quartets, the
Carmina Quartet. They are joined by London Baroque, the Hagen Quartet, I
Musici di Roma, pianist Paul Gulda and oboist Hansjorg Schellenberger, in
programmes focusing on Bach, Mozart and Vivaldi.

The castle grounds of La Roque d'Antheron, equidistant from Avignon and
Marseille, provide a serene provencal atmosphere for a piano festival of
increasing international renown. You may not find Richter or Pollini here,
but the festival does offer the cream of French pianists, plus other
well-established artists such as Nelson Freire, Deszo Ranki, Stephen Hough
and Elisabeth Leonskaja.
LONDON, THE PROMS
July 15 - September 10
Promenade Concerts Ticket Shop, Royal Albert Hall, London SW7 2AP.
Tel:071-589 8212
The Proms are celebrating their 100th season. The temptation to look back
over a century as Britain's largest music festival has proved irresistible
and this year's programme comprises a survey of the people and ideals that
have made the Proms so successful. Among the great figures of Proms' history
allowed evenings in their tribute are William Glock, Malcolm Sargent and
Henry Wood. The programme of 6 September 1900 is repeated in its entirety,
an amusing historical exercise. The work of the Proms in encouraging new
music is recognised by recalling past premieres by composers such as Maw,
Bliss, Schoenberg and Britten. Among major premieres new this year are
Maxwell Davies's Fifth Symphony and Tavener's The Apocalypse. The visiting
orchestras include the Berlin Philharmonic, the Cleveland Orchestra, the
Dresden Staatskapelle, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Pittsburgh Symphony
Orchestra.
LUCERNE

CH-6002 Lucerne, Switzerland. Tel 041-233080 Fax 041-239464
Under Matthias Bamert, Switzerland's premier festival has taken on an
adventurous slant. Focal points this year are a 70th birthday tribute to
Swiss composer Klaus Huber, whose new piano concerto will be premiered by
Andras Schiff, and a wide-ranging exploration of the way music is
interpreted. Four different performances will be built around Schubert's
Winterreise, including a new opera, augmented by offbeat events breaking all
the rules of traditional concert form. The conventional side to the festival
is as strong as ever, with leading orchestras from Berlin, Vienna,
Amsterdam, Cleveland and Dresden.
MALTA
June 2 - 5
Manoel Theatre, Valletta. Tel 010-356 222618 Fax 356-247 451

Festival de Radio France, Le Corun, BP 9214, 34043 Montepellier Cedex 01,
France. Tel 6702 0201
Apart from its setting in southern France, the attraction of Radio France's
annual festival is its selection of rare operas. This year sees concert

re, plus the first-ever staging of Cimarosa's L'Armida immaginaria.
MONTREUX
August 21 - September 23

orchestras and soloists from the summer festival circuit. This year's
programme opens with a Pollini recital and ends with Martha Argerich playing
Beethoven. Other visitors include Anne-Sophie Mutter, the Pittsburgh
Symphony under Maazel and the Orchestra of La Scala under Giulini.

Festspielkasse der Bayerischen Staatsoper, Maximilianstrasse 11, D-80539
Munich, Germany. Tel 089-221316
Peter Jonas' first Munich Opera Festival opens with Tannhauser - and by
handing the production to David Alden he is clearly aiming to unsettle
Munich's conservative public and critics. Zubin Mehta conducts. The festival
offers a retrospective on Jonas' first year as intendant in Munich,
including Tom Cairns' dire production of Un ballo in maschera and Richard
Jones' Jurassic Park version of Giulio Cesare. Cheryl Studer sings in La
traviata, and Eckehard Mayer's new opera Sansibar can be seen in the
Cuvillies-Theater.
OSLO
August 3 - 13
Oslo Chamber Music Festival, Inkognitogt 33, 0256 Oslo, Norway. Tel 2255
2553 Fax 2255 2554
Founded by Norwegian violinist Arve Tellefsen in 1989, the Oslo Chamber
Music Festival has quickly won a reputation for conviviality and musical
quality. Concerts take place in churches, castles and concert halls around
Oslo, with each year's programme focusing on a different country. This year
is Britain's turn, with music ranging from Byrd and Bridge to David Matthews
and Oliver Knussen. The Nash and Hilliard Ensembles are taking part, while
Truls Mork will play Elgar's Cello Concerto and Yuri Bashmet gives a viola
recital.
PESARO
August 11 - 29.
Via Rossini 37, 61100 Pesaro. Tel: (0)721-33184
This exquisite walled town on the Adriatic was Rossini's birthplace. Each
year it brings together genteel lovers of the Italian maestro's music, who
come to explore some of his lesser-known operas, alongside bucket-and-spade
beach-goers. This year's programme includes productions of L'inganno felice
produced by Graham Vick, Semiramide conducted by Roger Norrington and
L'italiana in Algeri produced by Dario Fo.
SAINT LOUIS
May 21 - June 26
Opera Theater of Saint Louis, PO Box 191910, Saint Louis, Missouri 63119,
USA. Tel 314-961 0171
Saint Louis - one of the world's most pleasurable opera festivals - offers a
characteristically adventurous diet: Colin Graham stages the first US
performance of Bernstein's final revised version of Candide, Andrew Litton
conducts Falstaff, the outstanding young American soprano Patricia Racette
sings the title role in Iphigenie en Tauride, and there is a dusting-off of
Conrad Susa's Black River (1975). Theatre conditions are intimate, and
picnics on the lawns of the Loretto-Hilton Center round off the amiable

SALZBURG
July 25 - August 31
Kartenburo der Salzburger Festspiele, Postfach 140, A-5010 Salzburg. Tel
0662-846682 Fax 0662-844501
The 1994 festival takes to the sky with the premiere of Stockhausen's
Helicopter Quartet: while the composer controls the sound electronically in
the Mozarteum, members of the Arditti Quartet will play their parts in four
airborne helicopters. Back on terra firma, this year's flagship production
is Don Giovanni, staged by Patrice Chereau and conducted by Daniel
Barenboim, with a cast headed by Ferruccio Furlanetto, Bryn Terfel,
Catherine Malfitano and Cecilia Bartoli. The opera programme otherwise has a
Russian emphasis, with three Stravinsky stagings and a transfer of the
Claudio Abbado/Herbert Wernicke production of Boris Godunov from the Easter
Festival, with Samuel Ramey in the title role. In the concert hall, Nikolaus
Harnoncourt conducts the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in two cycles of
Beethoven symphonies. The drama programme continues to gather strength, with
Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra directed by Peter Stein, and Pirandello's
The Mountain Giants directed by Luca Ronconi.

The most eye-catching feature is the American premiere of Judith Weir's
Blond Eckbert, less than four months after it was unveiled by ENO. Francesca
Zambello produces this and Il barbiere di Siviglia. This year's other new
productions are Tosca directed by John Copley with Mary Jane Johnson in the
title role, and Entfuhrung directed by Graham Vick. A revival of Goran
Jarvefelt's 1984 production of Intermezzo completes the bill. And the
pleasures of the place itself never pall.

July 6 - 30
Savonlinna Opera Festival, Olavinkatu 35, 57130 Savonlinna, Finland. Tel
057-514700 Fax 057-21866
No-one who visits Finland's premier summer festival can fail to be impressed
by the stone castle courtyard in which it takes place. Poised on the edge of
a lake, Olaf's Castle (Olavinlinna) is one of the world's outstanding
outdoor locations for opera. The 1994 programme is one of the least
distinctive of recent years, with a revival of last year's successful
Macbeth and a visit from the Hungarian National Opera. Perhaps the festival
is husbanding its resources for next year's big splash - a new opera by
Finland's leading composer, Aulis Salinnen.
SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN.

Box Office, Postfach 38 40, 24037 Kiel. Telefax 0431-56 91 52
Stretching from Westerland in the North to Hamburg in the South, the
Schleswig-Holstein festival embraces everything from family music days in
country barns to high culture. This year's programme places a special
emphasis on Jewish music. There are visits from the Israel Philharmonic and
Symphony Orchestras, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and young musicians
from Israel. Jewish composers being represented include those banned during
the Nazi era, such as Ullmann, Haas and Klein from the concentration camps,
and Mendelssohn and Mahler. There is also a retrospective of Beethoven.

Torroella de Montgri, Spain. Tel 072-761098 Fax 072-760648
Torroella de Montgri is a small Catalan town six km from the sea on the
Costa Brava, but it is not primarily a tourist resort. The town-centre is
architecturally typical of the Emporda, the natural surroundings are lovely
and numerous cultural activities take place throughout the year. The summer
music festival mixes Spanish artists of the calibre of Giacomo Aragall and
Jordi Savall with international guests such as the Franz Liszt Chamber
Orchestra and the Choir and Orchestra of the St Petersburg Capella.
WEXFORD
October 20 - November 6
Theatre Royal, High Street, Wexford, Ireland. Tel 0353-53 22144
Elaine Padmore's final season as artistic director brings a classic Wexford
trio of neglected operas: The Demon by Anton Rubinstein, La Boheme by
Leoncavallo and Wagner's Das Liebesverbot. A full concert schedule includes
recitals by Wexford's young singers, operatic scenes and late-night cabaret.
The homely atmosphere belies the fact that serious opera-lovers cross oceans
to sample Wexford's operatic rarities.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Travel (France): Up-country retreats - Practical Traveller /
Nicholas Woodsworth offers some out-the-way alternatives to the heat and
bustle of Provence in summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My father-in-law, Rene Luc, is 81 years old, Provencal through and through,
and has never lived anywhere else in his life. A passionate fisherman, he
admits that the region is somewhat short on decent trout streams. Apart from
that, he reckons Provence is just about as fine a place as anyone could want
to live.
But come July and August, the months when visitors from all over the world
crowd into every nook and cranny of Provence, Dordogne and the Riviera, Rene
is rarely to be found at home. For decades now he and his wife Odette have
retreated up-country for their summer holidays, to areas of southern France
that are virtually ignored by French and foreign holiday-makers alike.
It is not just the lack of crowds, cars, stressed waiters and
over-subscribed facilities that attract them there. Like most locals, they
find the northerner's love of sitting in the blazing Midi sun somewhat
potty: Provence is simply too hot in mid-summer to be comfortable.
The places they choose - none more than three or four hours' drive away -
are all cool, green and 1,000m high or more. Here in villages and unspoiled
countryside they get all the sunny character of the Midi in summertime
without the exhausting heat and crowds.
Their second objective is to come away from an enjoyable holiday without
paying an arm and a leg for it. Accommodation up-country might not be as
sophisticated as along the Cote d'Azur but it has its compensations: hosts
that are almost always friendly and hospitable, generous offerings of
high-quality country cooking, and bills that by European standards can be
astonishingly low.
Chambre d'hote and table d'hote - accommodation and food provided in private
homes, usually farms and country houses - are always one possibility. For
longer stays, my parents-in-law generally find auberges located in small
towns and villages more convenient. There are still many such establishments
where demi-pension (accommodation and two vast meals) is offered for little
more than Pounds 20 a day.
Where, then, are these areas? Not long ago I cornered Rene in his garage as
he was digging out trout flies and dusting off his fishing rod in
preparation for the summer season. Here are some of them from his little
black book.
The Cevennes (see above). One of the wildest and least populated areas in
France, the steep hills and valleys of the Cevennes have also discouraged
the development of all but the simplest tourist facilities. But for the
beauty of its landscapes, for its remote stone-built hamlets, rugged walks
and a way of life that has changed little over the centuries, it is well
worth a visit.
The Cevennes is marvellously refreshing when most of the Midi lies hot and
panting. For those seeking comfort, the small market-town of Florac is
probably the best bet. It is also the gateway to the high, lonely plateaux
of the Causses and the spectacular Gorge du Tarn, a descent of which is
inspiring by car, and thrilling by canoe. In Florac, the Hotel du Parc (tel:
66 45 03 05) offers most facilities, including pool, and an excellent
restaurant.
For those prepared to put up in more rustic accommodation, lists of chambre
d'hotes are available in the syndicats d'initiatives, or tourist offices, of
local towns. For a night on a remote Cevenol hillside farm (goats and
donkeys included), nothing could be more genuine than La Deveze in the
Trabassac Valley (prop: Marie-Claude Charbonnier, tel: 66 44 74 41).
L'Aubrac. Less than 100km from the enclosed valleys of the Cevennes, the
Aubrac region, on the border of the departements of Lozere and Cantal, is a
vast sweep of high, open plateaux. Treeless, and stretching to an empty
horizon, it is spectacular and dramatic. Carpeted in drifting snow in
winter, it is an open range for cattle in summer.
The village of Nasbinals, just to the west of these great open spaces, is
the easiest place to stay to take advantage of the walking, lakes and
fishing in the area. The Hotel de la Route d'Argent (prop: Pierre Bastide,
tel: 66 32 50 03) provides comfortable accommodation and a splendid country
kitchen for very reasonable prices.
For those with more sophisticated tastes and thicker wallets, the small town
of Laguiole is only half-an-hour's drive away. In addition to making some of
the best cutlery in France, it is the town chosen by celebrated chef Michel
Bras for the freshness and purity of its products. But beware: his
restaurant here is a favourite summer pilgrimage of Paris politicians and
other luminaries; reservations are often made a year in advance.
Le Queyras. Entirely different again, Le Queyras is an area sitting high up
in the departement des Hautes Alpes, near the Italian border. It includes
the old, picturesque and rather touristy village of Saint Veran, reputed, at
more than 2,000m, to be the highest village in Europe.
But the real attraction is the classic and wholly uncluttered alpine
landscape. Walks here look out on to some of the most spectacular mountain
scenery in France, with few of the crowds to be found in Chamonix, Mont
Blanc or other celebrated places.
You will eat less well and more expensively here than in the Aubrac, but
there are still many establishments offering good value. There are a number
of hotels on the route N-547 leading to the Belvedere de Cirque, a
magnificent place to gaze out on to an alpine giant, the 3,800m Mont Viso in
Italy.
Other good bets include: L'Hotel-Restaurant Les Veyres (tel: 92 45 01 91) on
the road from Guillestre to Ceillac, a pretty little village high on an
alpine plateau, and L'Hotel- Restaurant Le Chamois (tel: 92 45 83 71) in
Moline, on the road to Saint Veran.
Cantal. There is no rural countryside in France quite as peaceful as the
departement of Cantal. These are rolling hills full of old slate-roofed
villages, untold numbers of cows, and restaurants offering some of the most
interesting and ridiculously cheap regional cooking in the country.
There are many picturesque towns to stay in, including Saint Flour, Murat,
and Puy Mary. The most arresting, though, is the old medieval village of
Salers, a place of castles, battlements, old houses and winding streets.
L'Hotel des Remparts (tel: 71 40 70 33) in Salers offers both good food and
lodging. Further south, on the border between Cantal and Aveyron, the Lot
River Valley offers a splendid route eastwards to Cahors and on to the
Dordogne.
Haute Provence. This area offers an alternative to Provence proper. It is
higher, drier, and wilder - only goats, lavender and honey do well in this
harsh and arid climate. But it has many beautiful Provencal villages not yet
spoiled by crowds. From a base in the towns of Sault or Sederon, both with
good hotels, circuits might include Aurel, Montbrun-les-Bains, Aulan with
its Provencal chateau, Banon, reputed for its leaf-wrapped cheese, and the
very scenic Simiane-la-Rotonde.
Rene has no addresses for this area - it is too close to his own home and
his wife's unmatchable Provencal cooking. But I plan to explore it in detail
this summer and report later. Trout streams or no, I recently bought a house
in the hills on the edge of Haute Provence, and think it about as fine a
place as anyone could want to live.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Travel (France): The land people cannot change - Nicholas
Woodsworth meets the inhabitants of the Cevennes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Louis Stevenson crossed the Cevennes in 11 days with a donkey named
Modestine, and found enough of interest in the trip to write a book about
it.
I did not have that kind of time, and I did not have a donkey. I had a
Peugeot, and was concentrating on coaxing her on a day trip down the
frightening roads of the Vallee Francaise, a valley as steep-sided and
sharp-cornered as any in the heart of the Cevennes.
But when I stopped the car and climbed up the hillside to the Canourgue
tower, I began to understand Stevenson's attraction to the region. Sitting
on a rocky outcrop and poking up out of a thick forest of holm oak and
chestnut, the tall stone tower provides a bird's eye view of the Cevennes
countryside.
In Stevenson's time this was one of the wildest and least developed areas
left in France. It still is.
It is not hard to see why. This is a tortured, rugged, broken landscape, a
great mass of elevated rock jutting out into the Mediterranean plain from
the southern end of France's massif central.
The Cevennes impresses not with its height but with its depth.
Where further north the massif is gentle and rolling, here it is deeply cut
by narrow valleys and ravines that plunge towards small, fast rivers snaking
far below. There is little flat land to speak of.
Heavily forested, subject to snow in winter and torrential rains in spring
and autumn, the Cevennes accepts a human presence with barely a flicker of
acknowledgement on its great weathered brows.
Yet man is here. When war, pestilence, brigandage or political strife
threatened security on the broad plain below, the Cevennes became a place to
hide away deep in the folds of the earth until the trouble passed.
Trouble has been such a permanent feature of history here that for a tiny
population the Cevennes became a permanent if demanding home.
The Canourgue tower is more than 1,000 years old. Commanding a view of the
Vallee Francaise down its entire length, it was used to watch for the
approach of marauding bands or invading armies.
But it is not the only construction in sight. Scattered up and down the
valley, perched high on rocky spurs or sitting on whatever flat land exists
at the valley bottom, are the isolated slate houses and hamlets of the
inhabitants of the Cevennes.
There is little here to tell you that this is the 20th century.
Until well into the 1900s, the Cevenols depended for their survival on the
forests surrounding them. The great chesnut plantations that still cover
much of the Cevennes provided everything in their diet, from soup to nuts,
including the flour with which they made their bread.
The forest also provided mulberry leaves, the food of the silk-worm, and no
Cevenol house was without a vast third floor full of racks of wriggling,
ravenous, cocoon-spinning worms.
For centuries, chestnuts and silk were the strange and fragile twins that
supported Cevenol life.
Existence is almost as precarious today, and depends on a resource equally
as odd. Down by the Gardon River, on the narrow floor of the Vallee
Francaise, I met Claire Rosier, keeper of 115 goats. Without the small,
round, salty goat cheeses known as pelardons, there would be little to keep
the Cevennes going.
Every day, to a great clanging of goat bells, Madame Rosier herds her
charges along the road to the narrow meadows beside the river. To summer
visitors basking by swimming holes through long afternoons, or fishing for
trout in the still, early evening, it all looks idyllic - goats bleating in
flower-filled meadows, attentive dogs splayed on the cool ground, Madame
Rosier sitting in the shade of a tree. But seen from the Rosier farmyard,
life is somewhat more exacting.
Like most of the residents of the valley, the Rosier family is Protestant,
and has been ensconced by the river for centuries.
They came not for the quality of life but to escape Catholic persecution.
Even deep in the remote confines of the Cevennes, the Protestants were
chased and harried for centuries.
The early 1700s saw the invasion of Catholic armies, open warfare and the
wholesale destruction of farms, hamlets and villages. The Protestants
affirmed their faith all the more vigorously, went underground - and
survived.
Such a past forged a people who today remain hardy, determined and
resistant. Although life could be easier for them after generations of toil,
the Rosiers remain as frugal and hard-working as ever - goats, a saw-mill, a
vast vegetable plot, bee-hives, fruit orchards, rabbit hutches and dovecotes
keep them as self-sufficient as is possible.
All that is missing is the time to laze in the swimming hole below the house
along with the holiday-makers.
But peasant life in the Cevennes means more than austerity.
The locals' strongly-held faith also teaches open-mindedness, a questioning
of the moral order, and refusal to accept authority blindly. Perhaps it is
because of these traditions that the remnants of a later protest generation,
the defenders of the 1968 Paris barricades, also chose the Cevennes as a
retreat.
I met Janine Berder at the weekly market in Saint Croix, a village which,
with two bars, two restaurants, two shops and a bakery, is the largest in
the Vallee Francaise.
In another life, Janine was a teacher of Latin and Greek, une intello, as
the French like to say. But 20 years ago she exchanged that appellation for
another. Along with large numbers of other young urbanites she became a neo,
a newcomer to the life and culture of the Cevennes.
Most of the now middle-aged men and women selling goat cheese, honey and
jars of preserves on the little bridge that crosses the Gardon in Saint
Croix come from that generation. But many neos did not make it.
They knew more about Mao's Little Red Book than they did about country
living or hard physical work. The communes broke down, the co-operative
farms foundered, and for many, back-to-the-earth was followed by
back-to-the-city.
Those who have stayed have adapted to local ways, and learned to use their
hands. Today Janine gardens for summer residents and works a vegetable plot
as vast as Claire Rosier's.
In the long winter months she works at a loom with her partner, Pierre, a
professional tapestry weaver, in her stone house not far from Saint Croix.
Did she not miss civilisation, I asked. Civilisation is not so very far
away, she laughed. Her isolationist period came to an end after her first 10
years in the Cevennes.
These days, she said, she likes to drive down to Nimes, 90 minutes away, for
dinner with friends, an evening at the theatre, or a browse in the
bookshops.
But she also enjoys coming home. She is happy in her world of forests,
rivers and tiny villages.
She is not resentful that the larger world is coming to the Cevennes. Wasn't
she afraid it would spoil things, I wondered.
Not at all, she laughed again. The country is too wild, too overpowering,
its inhabitants too unbending. People do not change the Cevennes. The
Cevennes changes people.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Travel (France): Flaubert leads to Rouen's chamber of
horrors - Stanley Stewart follows in the footsteps of a literary hero to a
city of executions, adultery and gruesome medical history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STANLEY STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Musee Flaubert in Rouen, literature and medicine compete for the
visitor's allegiance. It is an unequal battle. The manuscript pages of
Madame Bovary do not detain one long when the next case holds two
guillotined heads. One tends to skip over Flaubert's letters to his mother
to gape at a pickled foetus or the gruesome instruments of early amputation.
But do not feel guilty about preferring the sensational. Flaubert would have
been delighted that his literary effects are overshadowed by the chamber of
horrors that is 19th century medicine. The museum, still attached to the
hospital, was the home of the chief surgeon, a post held by Flaubert's
father.
The novelist grew up in these rooms. As a child he had skipped through the
garden gate to browse among the corpses in the hospital mortuary.
Dissection, still birth and unanaesthetised amputations were dinner table
conversation.
I came early to Flaubert. He had that mixture of cynicism and self-pity so
fatally attractive to the adolescent. Later, he seemed to dog my footsteps
wherever I went. I read his Letters from Egypt while sailing up the Nile,
and the Temptations of St Anthony while staying in a monk's cell in St
Anthony's monastery. I felt it was time I tracked the literary lion to his
lair.
I got the train one bright morning at Victoria and was in Rouen for lunch.
Straddling the Seine, the city has a sophisticated air, as if metropolitan
glamour had mysteriously flowed downstream from Paris. Certainly it has
outgrown the provincial insecurities of Flaubert's time. In its medieval
streets, wisely given over to pedestrians, the shops are full of antiques,
haute couture and exercise machines.
The Gros Horloge still strikes a symbolic curfew at 9pm, but now it is the
signal for the start of the evening promenade, an aperitif at a pavement
cafe, and a late dinner in one of the fashionable restaurants around the
Place Vieux Marche where the English burnt Joan of Arc at the stake.
Joan's bonfire is an episode from which Anglo-French relations are still
struggling to recover. Her charge sheet, it has to be said, made grim
reading: witchcraft, impurity, heresy and, most grave, wearing men's
clothes.
The site of her execution is marked by a 20-metre cross and a modern church,
Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc, that revives in splendid style the ancient tradition of
building a church in the form of the upturned hull of a ship. In the
visitor's book I found an entry in Hindi, kindly translated by the writer.
It was a cryptic piece of Indian advice. 'Nationalist leaders come and go,
but railways last forever.' The Rouen-to-Paris line, inaugurated in 1843,
was built by the English.
Ruskin called Rouen 'the city of north Europe as Venice was of the south'.
It provides a wonderful study of the imprint of different ages, of the
historical ebb and flow of confidence. The centre of Rouen has one of the
finest and most complete medieval districts anywhere in France. Its lanes
curl between overhanging half-timbered facades, quirky, obtuse and
secretive.
One is never far from the canyon walls of the cathedral, dwarfing all human
activity. Cobbled streets lead westward to the Renaissance and the
magnificent Palais de Justice, its sense of order and proportion a direct
rebuff to the anxieties of the preceding centuries. A few minutes away
Napoleon, mounted on a verdigris steed, rides the 18th century to a dramatic
close, in the Place de General de Gaulle.
Above him the streets climb between tall shuttered windows and wrought-iron
balconies, through squares of plane trees and cafes, into the bourgeois 19th
century Rouen of Flaubert's Madame Bovary. If the prosecutors who charged
the book with obscenity are to be believed, this sloping quarter of
'boarding schools, churches and big derelict mansions' was the birthplace of
modern adultery. But Rouen was used to women setting their own sexual
agenda. In 1072 a mob of priests' concubines lynched the archbishop after he
dared to preach a sermon denouncing them.
Down the hill, in the Place des Carnes, Flaubert himself stands above a
boules pitch, nose in the air, his posture managing a swagger in bronze. The
Rouennais who hurry past his feet ignore him. He had loathed the
petit-bourgeois of this provincial town and they hated him right back. On
Flaubert's death, Zola wrote that four-fifths of Rouen did not know who he
was. The other fifth despised him.
The great novelist's gaze is carefully averted from the cathedral spire, a
19th century iron-work addition which he described as 'the nightmare of a
delirious blacksmith'. He was understandably put out by its erection; the
building was one of his passions. 'There is something in me akin to the
greenish light of Norman cathedrals,' he wrote.
The cathedral's facade is familiar from Monet, who painted it no less than
30 times without, by his own admission, ever getting it right. Down the
broad nave, the columns of green light alternate with columns of stone. The
cathedral was the setting for Madame Bovary's fateful assignation with Leon,
and this scene in the novel, the prelude to the consummation of their affair
in the back of a hansom cab, is as good as any guide book for prospective
visitors.
In the ambulatory lies the grave of Richard the Lion Heart. In accordance
with the practice of the times, Richard was buried in three places.
Apparently this increased the odds of getting to heaven, as if each grave
would be taken as a separate application. His body is buried at Fontevrault.
Rouen has the good fortune to have the famous lion heart. Charroux drew the
short straw and plays host to his bowels. Richard's magnificent castle at
Les Andelys, a few miles upstream from Rouen, is one of the most dramatic
sights anywhere on the Seine.
I followed the road downstream along the Seine, past the docks and the
smoking factories, to Flaubert's property at Croisset. The writer's house
has been demolished, making way, appropriately, for a paper factory. But a
pavilion still stands in a garden of lime trees where Flaubert sought the
solitude he so loved.
At Croisset one gets Flaubert without the surgery. The pavilion, its tall
windows overlooking the river, is flooded with light. There are family
photographs, souvenirs from trips to Egypt and Carthage, his pipes, and the
notorious stuffed parrot. But it is impossible to seek the man without
finding the macabre. There is a death-mask of his mother, and a handkerchief
with which he wiped his brow moments before his death.
I had hoped to find his library. The keeper of Croisset, a woman in an Iron
Maiden T-shirt, directed me up the hill to the town hall.
In a civic reception room in the mairie, the library resides in baroque
bookcases taken from his study. The attendant opened the glass doors and
browsed happily among the medical volumes inherited from his father, the
sets of Shakespeare and Balzac and Victor Hugo, the first editions of the
author's own works. I lifted down a copy of Madame Bovary.
'Did you know that the French government used to give every bride in France
a copy?' the attendant asked. It seemed a bizarre gift, like presenting a
new mother with a book on infanticide.
'Is this the council chamber?' I asked as I was leaving.
'Oh no,' the woman said. 'C'est pour le mariage civil. For weddings.'
It was a final irony. Flaubert, the confirmed bachelor, believed marriage
was a delusion. His books are now the silent witnesses to every marriage in
Croisset.
Stanley Stewart travelled to Rouen as a guest of Stena Sealink (tel:
0233-647033) which offers two-night breaks in Normandy from Pounds 129 per
person. Rouen's tourist office is in a 16th century house opposite the
cathedral (tel: 35 71 41 77). Both the Rough Guide and the Blue Guide
publish individual guides to Normandy. Another useful publication is The
Traveller in France, from the French Tourist Office at 178 Piccadilly,

FT  21 MAY 94 / Gardening (The Chelsea Flower Show): Cornwall transported -
Patricia Morison on the exhibitor taking the Monument Stand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON

<TEXT>
Two worlds of gardening intermingle on this year's Monument Stand at
Chelsea. The Monument site in the Great Marquee is the most prestigious an
exhibitor can be given. It is large - 4,250 sq ft - so only the big players
in horticulture can afford to take it on. This year, the site has been given
to Burncoose and Southdown Nurseries from Gwennap, a village far to the west
in Cornwall.
Burncoose and Southdown was established only 12 years ago. The display,
designed by co-owner David Knuckey, is intended to be as Cornish as clotted
cream, based around the engine house of a tin mine, with a shingle beach and
rushing stream. It will be planted with species to show that although the
Cornish gardener sometimes benefits from almost sub-tropical warmth, there
can also be cruel frosts and lashing, salty winds.
About 10 articulated lorries will be needed to take this Cornish scene to
Chelsea, at a cost of Pounds 30,000. Charles Williams, Burncoose's other
owner, who is not short of connections after spending his 20s working for
merchant bank Lazards, found a City sponsor in Gerrard &amp; National.
It is like a parable of modern success. In the 1980s, a young banker senses
that the party is winding down and turns to the good life in wellingtons.
Believing gardening to be a growth stock, he goes west and joins up with a
local nurseryman. He then spots a gap in the market to sell plants by mail
order in the UK and abroad.
After 12 years, the nursery has a turnover of Pounds 650,000, 80 per cent of
it mail order, and customers in 19 countries. The apotheosis comes with a
display of Cornish nostalgia on the Monument Stand.
There is, however, more behind Burncoose than City nous. The other world on
the Monument site is gardening as it was long ago: of gentlemen amateurs
with long purses and a passion to know and grow rare plants.
Williams has a gardening pedigree which stretches back to great-grandfather
JC Williams, Liberal MP for Truro and a great name in British gardening of
the Edwardian period. JC sponsored the plant-hunters George Forrest and
Ernest Wilson, grew their discoveries and created the famous 'williamsii'
hybrid camellia.
The family seat was (and still is) Caerhays Castle, built by John Nash,
where four generations have planted and re-planted 60 acres of woodland with
rare and delicate trees and shrubs.
Julian Williams, Charles's father, is a distinguished gardener who has
carried on the Caerhays tradition of hybridising. His son teases him for
being a 'tree creeper', delighted to discuss Caerhays rarities by the hour.
Charles Williams is Cornish to the core. The huge variety of plants he
sells, often rare, speaks of a historic pedigree. For cuttings of camellias,
magnolias, rhododendrons, pieris or myrtle, he can take branches from
specimens planted by his ancestors.
There is nothing about this in the Burncoose catalogue. Perhaps it is felt
that only an elite of customers will respond to the thought of Rhododendron
lindleyana or Michelia doltsopa with that kind of family tree.
The catalogue speaks the language of the future - or so Williams hopes. In
four languages, it explains the rules for export orders and the single
European market. The rules changed in 1993 - nurseries no longer needed to
have an export certificate or inspection by a ministry official for every
order.
Williams and Knuckey were already doing the bulk of their UK business by
mail order. Selling plants by post raises complications undreamt of by
companies dealing in shirts. Williams 'factors in' the not inconsiderable
cost of dealing with customers' calls - the lonely gardener who wants to
chat, or the one seeking advice.
The problems of mail order to foreign buyers have always deterred British
nurserymen, but not Burncoose. Distant customers are determined,
knowledgeable, rich - and place large orders. Burncoose's Japanese customers
usually spend between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000 an order. It takes three
days for plants to travel from Gwennap to the Japanese customs hall.
Plants destined for Japan, Israel and the US (all good customers) have to be
bare-rooted, and the Ministry of Agriculture makes sure every trace of
Cornish earth is washed off. Plants for Australia and New Zealand have to be
defoliated, which makes the game less worthwhile.
But Europe, especially since 1993, looks a far easier and more profitable
market - as well as one which the continentals seemed ill-equipped to
exploit. Successful though the Dutch, French, and Italian horticulture
industry is, Williams discovered that their nurseries grow plants
exclusively for retailers. Plant mail order does not exist in the rest of
Europe.
Within three months, 1994's new, trilingual catalogue had produced 33 orders
with a value of Pounds 11,200. The Germans are particularly eager, while a
list strong on tender species is attractive to southern Europeans. Burncoose
has allied itself with Torsanlorenzo near Rome, a nursery which can supply
big plants at big prices; a cordyline with an 8ft girth costs Pounds 600
plus carriage.
The Monument Stand might look to visitors like Cornish nostalgia, but a lot
hangs on Burncoose's display. Large stands do not necessarily mean large
orders. Increasingly, stalwart exhibitors are beginning to ask if a stand at
Chelsea justifies the expense when they can sell their stock twice over at
the Hampton Court flower show. Burncoose has a different perspective, one
which sees the Monument Stand as a world stage.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Gardening (The Chelsea Flower Show): Marquee of marvels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old-timers know it, but if this is your first visit to Chelsea and
especially if you are a non-gardener, the following are the marvels of the
Great Marquee. Miss these bravura displays and I am tempted to say you have
missed the heart of the world's greatest flower show.
Every year, the celebrated Woodford Brothers of Stratford-upon-Avon arrange
a glorious symphony of lupins. Warmenhoven's bowls of enormous tulips always
hold me spellbound, as do Brenda Hyatt's extraordinary auriculas. Equally
unmissable are Blackmore &amp; Langdon's begonias and delphiniums and S &amp; N
Brackley's sweet peas.
For floral perfection, look to the fuchsia displays (Potash Nursery and
Roualeyn Nursery). Indoor gardeners are always well served at Chelsea - year
after year, Dibleys' stand has inspired people with a passion for
streptocarpus, one of the most charming and easiest of flowering
house-plants.
Pleiones always look tempting on Butterfields Nursery's stand. Tropical Rain
Forest's display of bromeliads or 'air plants' can be relied upon to
fascinate.
Serious plant hunters must look for two specialist shrub and tree nurseries.
Mallet Court Nursery's owner is something of a plant-collector. He displays
rarities such as Tapiscia sinensis (an anagram of pistacia), raised from
seed sent from China, Pterocarya insignis, and exotic oaks grown from seed
collected in the mountains of Mexico. Acer enthusiasts should inspect
Millicient, a jazzy variety of Acer morrisonense Hayata.
Bluebell Nurseries of Swadlincote in Derbyshire is another connoisseurs'
nursery, and it boasts Sinocalycanthus chinensis, a shrub with white flowers
in June. It also exhibits Caragana jubata, described as a strange, shaggy
Mongolian affair, and Senecio gnapholodes, a prostrate willow-like plant
from Crete.
Several delphiniums make their debut, among them Albert Sheppard from
perennial specialists Rougham Hall, and salmon-pink Princess Caroline from
Burncoose. A Dutch creation, it achieves the long looked-for goal of a
tall-growing red delphinium which can be grown out of doors.
Variegation is an easy way to stand out in a crowd. This year Bressingham
Gardens is launching Polemonium Brise d'Anjou, discovered in France. I also
look forward to their new verbena Homestead Purple.
Even more eagerly anticipated are the year's new clematis exhibited by
Valley Clematis, which always makes a lovely show. Lady in Red sounds
intriguing if alarming, with its orangey-red flowers. There are five new
varieties from the US and Guernsey. Arctic Queen sounds like a winner if it
is true that here is a double white which really is double and floriferous
for the whole season.
Gardeners can rely on unearthing something to their advantage in the
educational section. If there is something nasty in the lawn, the Institute
of Groundsmanship will analyse specimens. This year the University of
Reading addresses itself to the compelling problem of pest control. And at
the Plantlife stand you can do your bit for the environment by joining the
Great Hedge Scheme.
This year's show gardens more than ever are linked to charities. Watch out
for the gardens for the blind, for allergy sufferers, for people with
learning disabilities, families with sick children, and even a holistic
garden for the terminally ill.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A chef chooses chicken - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER, JILL JAMES and GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asked by an inquisitive nine-year-old to name his favourite food, Simon
Hopkinson, chef/partner at London's Bibendum restaurant, replied
immediately: 'Roast chicken'.
Perhaps a mundane choice for such a talented chef. But in his cookery book
Roast Chicken and Other Stories (Ebury Press, Pounds 17.99 230pp) Hopkinson
explains why he adores simple, tasty things and where he has enjoyed them.
Included are a refreshing, sour and salty parsley salad from Berowra Waters
restaurant in Australia; a milk chocolate malt ice cream recipe from San
Francisco; and a recipe for oeufs en cocotte from Lacy's restaurant which
was his first London culinary experience at the age of 18.
Each chapter deals with produce rather than seasons or menus, which allows
Hopkinson to voice his enthusiasm for such a wide range of foods as
aubergines, cod, potatoes and double cream. Lindsey Bareham intelligently
turns Hopkinson's restaurant quantities into easy-to-follow recipes for
four.

After its successful release of a single cask of 20-year-old Isle of Jura
malt, Invergordon Distillers once again invited a panel of writers and
experts to choose the best old whisky from the Bruichladdich distillery on
the Isle of Islay.
The winner was distilled on November 22, 1972 and aged in a sherry butt,
making it unusually fruity for an Islay malt (Bruichladdich is also one of
the mildest whiskies made on the island). Its strength is 53.4 per cent. The
whisky is available from Invergordon Distillers in Leith. Tel: 031-554 4404.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The culinary melting pot that makes Malta
special - Cookery / There is plenty to satisfy every taste, but Philippa
Davenport finds that fish remains the country's outstanding food item
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malta was fated to be a culinary melting pot. Phoenicians, Carthaginians,
Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Castillians, Knights of St John, French
and British - all have been there and left their mark.
The blood orange season had just finished when I arrived so I was denied a
taste of sauce Maltaise, the only recipe of international repute, so far as
I know, that carries the name of Malta in its title. Loquats, on the other
hand, were just coming on stream, heaped in apricot-coloured piles on market
stalls at Birkirkara, half way between Valetta and the medieval city of
Medina.
The market fills the streets that flank the cathedral square with a
haphazard mix of fresh fish, flowers, clothes, toys, dairy produce, live
rabbits and chickens, fruits and vegetables, pots and pans. There was
surplus garden produce and foods from the wild: bunches of mint (a Maltese
favourite) and savory, home-pickled olives, and the first of the new
season's capers. The impressive spread of fishy offerings included one
barrow selling nothing but octopus.
Orderly queues waited patiently to be served by stallholders proudly
displaying young globe artichokes bunched as prettily as flowers; milky
white-toothed young garlic complete with flowing green leaves; and firm
yellow potatoes piled as neatly as dry stone walls. Other vendors, placing
their scales on the ground amid an untidy sprawl of bulging vegetable sacks,
elicited bargain basement tactics from excited customers.
I shall also remember Birkirkara for its baked goods. I recall the dexterous
speed of a pie-man shaping and filling pastizzi - savoury puff pastry
confections eaten fresh from the oven as anytime snacks. I downed one
version filled with ricotta and another made with peas and spices. Mincemeat
is for city folk, the pie-man told me. Spinach and anchovy is reserved for
Good Friday. Many bakers still use proper brick-lined, wood-fired bread
ovens, and housewives still bring meals to be cooked in them after the
freshly-baked loaves emerge.
On Gozo, an island just 15 minutes by helicopter from Malta, wild flowers
grow in even greater profusion and huge, feathery plumes of wild fennel
stand sentinel along most pathways and roads. Fennel seeds are saved for
cooking with potatoes but, curiously, no one I met seemed to know about
using the previous year's dried stems as fragrant fuel for grilling and
barbecueing.
Gozo is home to Malta's salt pans, quite small, carved to fit the contours
of the rocks and twinkling like glassy mosaics when you look down on them.
Gozo is also the home of gbejniets, miniature ewe or goats' milk cheeses
which have a lovely junket-like texture when very fresh. The Maltese like
them best when mature, marinated briefly in vinegar and/or coated heavily
with black pepper.
The cheese-maker I met had 70 ewes and I watched her ladle the freshly-set
curds into plastic moulds that looked like shuttlecocks. At lunch time, I
tasted the product at a bar and restaurant in a sleepy square in Xaghra.
There, we tucked into good bread and a soup called kusksu. This consists of
broad beans and tiny pasta balls in a broth sweetened with a smidgin of
tomato; slices of cool, junket-fresh gbejniet are added at the point of
serving. The substantial soup was followed by a choice of two other
traditional Maltese dishes: rabbit cooked with garlic and ross fil forn, a
dish of baked rice with eggs, cheese and meat sauce said to have originated
with the Phoenicians.
Soups are good news in Malta. I was very taken by widow's soup, a clear
broth laced with vegetables and finished with slices of gbejniet (and a
boiled egg, perhaps) for extra nutrition. This is particularly tasty when
made not with worthy winter roots but with fresh peas, young carrots,
lettuce and sprigs of mint.
Fish, though, is Malta's outstanding food item. At one fish restaurant in St
Julians, a pretty bay zinging with holiday spirit, we dined on fish with
fennel potatoes, for which I give the recipe below. This was preceded by
hobz biz-zejt, which can be a simple bite or substantial enough to be a
nicoise-type sandwich lunch in its own right.
The restaurant's version seemed to be hobz biz-zejt crossed with bruschetta
and I liked it all the more for that - thickly-sliced country bread, toasted
lightly, soused with olive oil, sprinkled with skinned and finely-chopped
tomatoes, seasoned, and cut into bite-size pieces. The availability of good
bread, good oil and good tomatoes are, of course, essential to its success.
Just beyond the charming fishing village of Marsaxlokk, on Malta's south
east coast, lies a government fish farm and research station. Here breeding,
hatching, nursery and fattening units are all housed inside an old fort,
while floating cages tethered offshore are home to the young adult fish. Sea
bream and sea bass are the main subjects of research.
BAKED FISH WITH FENNEL POTATOES (serves 6)
At the restaurant in St Julians, this was made with dentex, a member of the
bream family I have been unable to buy in the UK. Grey mullet, providing it
is veryfresh, works well. Ask your fishmonger to fillet it and take home the
bits to make a few spoonfuls of well-flavoured stock. The oven must be very
hot indeed. Start heating it up well in advance and heat a baking sheet,
too.
Ingredients: 1 fine fresh grey mullet weighing 3 to 3 1/2 lb, filleted; 2lb
firm potatoes (I suggest large Jersey Royals);  1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds;
several sprigs each of thyme and rosemary; the finely-grated zest of a lemon
and a good squeeze of lemon juice; 1 small onion; 1 garlic clove; 4 or 5
tablespoons of fish stock; extra virgin olive oil.
Method: Chop the onion and garlic finely and soften them in 3-4 tablespoons
of olive oil. Slice the potatoes thickly and parboil for five minutes. Pound
the fennel, rosemary and thyme with mortar and pestle. Toss the drained
potatoes with the onion and season with salt, pepper, most of the lemon zest
and most of the herb mixture. Toss again.
Oil a gratin or baking dish as large as a roasting pan but suitable for
bringing to table. Pour the fish stock into it and season with lemon juice.
Add the potatoes. Make nest-like hollows among the potatoes and lay the fish
fillets in them, seasoned with salt, pepper and the rest of the lemon zest
and herbs. Half-fold the fillets and lay them skin side down.
Drizzle olive oil over the fish and give the potatoes a final annointing.
Slide the dish on to the hot baking sheet and bake at 450'F/250'C (gas mark
8) for about 20 minutes.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: To Alsace for a dish of potato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As soon as he mentioned the dish, the wine producer knew I was hooked. 'It
is an old Alsace dish which I think you can find in only two or three
restaurants. Would you like to try it?'
I agreed enthusiastically and spent the rest of the day wondering what a
potato dish that incorporated a verb usually associated with hairdressing,
could look like let alone taste of. I was sure my ears had not deceived me -
pommes de terre coiffes - was what we were to eat that evening.
We set off at 7pm on a typical Alsace spring evening. The rain was falling
softly in the vineyards and in the villages, where memorials to the dead of
the first world war are splintered with bullets holes from the second.
We headed towards the Vosges mountains where in the summer, my host assured
me, French farmers' wives open their kitchens and serve a bountiful FFr60
(Pounds 7) menu.
We stopped at medieval Riquewihr, on the edge of the mountains. The town
still maintains an ancient feel - two sets of city walls, cobbled streets
and old, exposed beams.
In the Grand Rue, stands Wistub Cric, a pale green building that would not
look out of place in a Hansel and Gretel storybook.
Inside there is not a level surface anywhere and an air of comfort and
friendliness emanates from its owner.
I cannot vouch for all the dishes on the menu. Another table's tarte a
l'oignon and quiche lorraine looked good, and the rhubarb tart, made with
the first of the season's crop, was excellent. But we were there to eat
potatoes.
We ordered the pommes de terre coiffes au Munster (FFr59) which, according
to the menu, came with slices of mountain ham and salad.
My host, a potato connoisseur, did not require either.
Ten minutes later, four large earthenware bowls arrived and silence
descended.
The dish was simplicity itself - slices of potato that had been sauteed,
seasoned, mixed with slices of Munster cheese, cooked and then given a
crisp, golden topping under the grill. It was fashioned to a peak in the
centre, hence the word coiffes.
No one left a mouthful.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Do not write off Bordeaux '93s - Edmund
Penning-Rowsell finds that strict selection has produced some
better-than-expected wines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of last year's summer was disappointing in Bordeaux, but a hot, dry
August and early September brought hopes of a fine 1993 vintage.
These were washed out by the rain that began as the picking started, around
September 20, and continued irregularly to the end. So, 1993 was dismissed
initially as the third disappointing claret vintage in a row.
But late hot weather improved a fair proportion of the grapes, particularly
the earlier-ripening Merlots, and thickened the skins. This, plus cool
weather throughout the harvest, prevented rot developing.
Nevertheless, only where strict selection was employed from the vineyard to
the fermentation vats - often 'bled' (seignee) to reduce the proportion of
juice to skin - was success achieved, producing deep-coloured, well-balanced
and medium-weight wines for early drinking. There is more to them than the
not-to-be despised '92s.
Special care was also required in the assemblage - the choice of vats for
inclusion in each chateau's grand vin, and the proportion of each grape
variety to be used. At Ch Margaux, only 47 per cent of a below-average yield
went into the grand vin.
This blending begins in November and usually finishes by February. This
enables the Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux to organise tastings for its
115 members at the end of March for the Bordeaux trade, and in the first
week of April for groups of international wine writers.
The first growths and three leading seconds - Cos d'Estournel,
Ducru-Beaucaillou and Leoville-Las-Cases - are not union members, partly
because they expect their wines to be tasted in their own cellars.
Thanks to Bruno Prats of Cos d'Estournel, who arranged most of my visits,
and Peter Sichel, a former union president who provided accommodation at
Angludet, I was able to preface these in advance of the three days of union
tastings in the Medoc, Graves and Pomerol.
Of the first growths, my favourite was Margaux, followed closely by
Haut-Brion - the former dense-coloured with a fine, elegant nose and fruity,
well-balanced, long flavour; the latter with very big colour and an austere
but distinguished nose.
Although not big, it was well-balanced, with some tannin evident. Latour,
meanwhile, was typical Pauillac, a big wine with fine colour but a rather
closed nose and plenty of body.
I found Mouton-Rothschild and Lafite difficult to taste as both,
particularly the Mouton, were very closed. The former seemed lighter than I
expected but had a long flavour, while the Lafite was encouragingly
concentrated.
At the end of the union tastings, the '93 was sampled at Cheval-Blanc.
Purple, with a rich nose, it had a typical richness but, perhaps, lighter
flavour than in the greater vintages.
The union's tastings were divided into four groups of approximately nine
members and they were held in four different chateaux in each district.
In our group, unfortunately, the wines in the first of two Medoc tastings -
from Listrac to Margaux and St Julien to St Estephe - were shown in a very
cold chai, and again in the St Emilion-Pomerol one. This flattened the
aromas and led to a good deal of hand-warming of wine in glasses. But
elsewhere it was easier. Overall, the greater maturity of the Merlots is
likely to have favoured St Emilion and Pomerol.
Below is a list of those wines that appealed to me, with the particularly

The Bordeaux trade in its fine wines is now notably better than last year,
but cash deficiency will lead to more en primeur offers than at any time
since 1990. Should one buy?
For those able to decorate their cellars or reserves, the first growths and
top seconds are probably good gastronomic (if not financial) speculations.
The firsts that came out at FFr155 a bottle are still a long way below the
1989s originally at FFr230; Haut-Brion and Margaux sold all the '93 they
offered and could have sold much more. The leading seconds and their peers
opened at FFr70.
In this irregular vintage, though, it might be better to wait until the
lesser classed-growths are in bottle - especially those picked out by the
traditional merchants who specialise in them and can, if necessary, keep
them. Yet, there is a case for buying minor growths selected as 'opening
offers'; they should make attractive early drinking. When sold out
initially, they will not re-appear on lists.
Unquestionably, the heavens owe us a fine vintage this year. Meanwhile, the
heads of Bordeaux University's institute of oenology, professors
Ribereau-Gayon and Guimberteau, say in their annual report that, providing
overall selection was maintained, 'one can be thoroughly optimistic over the
quality of the 1993 red vintage'.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Fashion: Secret ingredients for surviving the Season - As
the rites of a summer in society get under way, Brenda Polan offers a guide
for those still wondering what to wear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are those who are certain that the as yet undescribed ninth circle of
Hell is a day at the races, an endless torture of tedium, tight clothes,
forced-feeding, alcoholic poisoning, foul weather and wasted money. Others
seem to enjoy it.
But whether they enjoy it or endure it, for many people going to Ascot,
Cheltenham or Newmarket is a summer rite which it would be unthinkable to
duck.
The same goes for the rest of the Season, that spring-to-autumn round of
entertainments which keeps the upper classes and aspiring other ranks fed,
watered and anxious about what to wear for the months of what we like to
call summer. It is true that, for the last couple of recession-strapped
years, the numbers of those participating have dwindled, but the Season is a
resilient social mechanism and there are signs that optimism is overcoming
discretion and will swell this year's crowd.
Almost as if anticipating an influx of newcomers, a recent issue of Tatler,
the society magazine bought by many outside the circles that it writes
about, provided a pithy survival guide. For the benefit of those not bred to
it, who might be misled by newspaper photographs or bedazzled television
coverage, Tatler reveals the secret ingredients which make the Season
bearable. These range widely from a stock of safety pins, emergency wellies
in the car boot and a supply of blankets to a portable telly, a tow rope and
rheumatic hot packs from Boots or, more appropriately, Holland and Holland.
Although umbrellas and sturdy flat shoes feature most repetitively, the
references to thermal vests are almost as obsessive (Hanro's silk number
from Harrods is the vest of choice but, unless the consumption of champagne
is truly excessive or one gets altogether too close to the river bank at
Henley, no one need ever find out that one has opted for St Michael).
Spare pairs of tights are an obvious precaution; lead weights in your hem if
you are helicoptering are less so. Taking your passport to polo just in case
a dashing Argentine persuades you to run away with him is a provision that
may well not occur to you; stuffing a train timetable into your handbag just
in case you need to do a solitary runner just might.
However, apart from recommending bright and cheerful foul-weather gear for
Cowes, suggesting multi-layered, easy-strip outfits for the suffocating
tents at the Chelsea Flower Show, and giving a firm reminder that skirts
must cover the knee at Henley, Tatler leaves outerwear mostly to the
reader's discretion. And, in fact, it is easier to dress for the Season than
it used to be.
Many of the rules have been relaxed in recent years. Trousers, if they are
part of a trouser suit, are permitted in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot,
although not yet at Henley. A short cocktail dress will not get its wearer
expelled from a ball but she will probably feel uncomfortably different.
High-heeled shoes at a polo ground will single one out as a newcomer and
exclude one from the uproarious bonding ritual of stamping in the divots.
Hats are, of course, still necessary - if not essential - at most daytime
events.
Although Seasonal lore is full of tales of unprepared unfortunates whose
straw hats have drooped and whose flimsy frocks have turned transparent in
an Ascot downpour, there is no such thing as a rain-resistant hat - unless
it is a thoroughly unromantic purpose-built rain hat.
Thus, unless a drought is forecast, a largish handbag, a pack-away plastic
cape and an elegant plain-canopied (no logos permitted) umbrella are
essential baggage. Many women settle for making their escort tote the
umbrella but that does mean they are joined hip and thigh for the day.
A collapsible umbrella suspended by a nylon loop from the wrist is less
attractive than a long, tapering umbrella with which one can pose fetchingly
and with which, as the Princess of Wales once demonstrated, one can prod
one's acquaintances into attentiveness.
Although a relaxation in the ordinances imposed by society's style police
may have made things easier, in some ways fashion has made them harder.
Late-1980s style provided uniforms for all occasions. The little tight suit
in various fabrications could carry one through the day and through the
cocktail hour and out to dinner. Now the confusion of long skirts, short,
flared skirts, wide pants and narrow pants make decisions much harder.
Last summer, short skirts - which could just about still be worn straight
and short - outnumbered long skirts. This summer the long skirt is more
powerfully entrenched, especially in pretty layers of chiffon. It will be
interesting to see at Ascot next week whether the spirit of Cecil Beaton
flits again.
Certainly, it is likely that the cocktail dress will have been supplanted,
especially among debutantes, by softly cut, fluid, layered separates:
chiffon palazzo pants and a cashmere sweater; besashed crinkled silk or
satin long skirt and antique lace blouses; layered satin slip dresses, long
or very short indeed.
The slip dress, the ultimate in cool minimalism, is likely to feature
strongly at balls, too, although most leading fashion designers seem to be
placing their bets on its sartorial opposite: cleavage-enhancing boned
bodices and sculpted crinoline skirts. If they are right, then the brief
years of recessional penance and low profile for the Season are over indeed.

FT  21 MAY 94 / How To Spend It: A princess who shops to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In certain female circles, shopping is a survival mechanism. And its
consequences, in terms of bulging wardrobes, tend to be limited only by how
tough it is to survive, and by resources.
This is not shopaholism. That is directionless, wasteful and leads to
penury. This is shopping therapy. Men do not understand it.
The Prince of Wales does not seem to. He is, according to reports apparently
based on his sieve-like friends, shocked and irritated to discover, thanks
to an audit on behalf of the Inland Revenue, that Princess Diana's 'grooming
bills' add up to Pounds 160,000 a year. It may amount to only one third of
what the Daily Mail last week calculated he spends on clothes, massages,
polo ponies, hunters, Georgian silver, watercolours and Trumpers Extract of
Lime toilet water, but it is a lot of money. It is around 200 times what
Di-look-alikes - the check-out girls, the factory workers and the office
drudges who are Diana's most adoring fans - earn in a long and tedious year.
Yet it is small beer compared to what is spent by many other women of the
international set. The glossy consort, the trophy on the arm demands a lot
of upkeep. In Britain, however, such an investment in appearance, in
clothes, haircuts, cosmetics and therapies, is contrary to the
make-do-and-mend mentality of most women raised in a puritanical tradition.
This is particularly true of the class from which Lady Diana Spencer comes.
Her erstwhile rival in love, Camilla Parker Bowles, is much more typical
with her bare face, bad haircut and crumpled clothes.
There are exceptions, of course, but they are rarely among the ranks of
non-working wives or ex-wives. They tend to be women who are earning their
own money and, if they have a husband, are in a position to lie to him about
what their clothes cost. Most well-groomed and partnered women halve the
true cost and then round it down. It is only kind to do so. British men
think frocks and blonde highlights should come at slave-labour prices. It
distresses them to find out they do not.
It is because most British dependent wives would heartily agree with their
spouses about prices, that Britain's fashion industry, particularly its few
couturiers, limps along for ever on the edge of disaster. For the big
spenders are foreigners. What a Gulf princess or the wife of an Italian or a
Japanese industrialist spends on 'grooming' makes the princess look
economical.
The princess was reported to be embarrassed and contrite and to have set in
train cost-cutting measures. Perhaps, given the political and economic
climate, she was wise, even valorous, to opt for discretion. But if ever a
woman was encouraged to become a spendthrift, it was Diana. She married into
a family which elevated dowdiness to an art form.
Diana's beauty and stylishness (something she had to work to cultivate) sent
the international media hysterical. They bayed for more. More Diana, more
frocks, more jewels, more smiles, more leg, more pictures. And because she
wore British clothes, the British fashion industry benefited. It egged her
on to become an ever more visible, ever more idolised super-mannequin.
Looking gorgeous was perceived as an important part of her function. She did
her best.
One may speculate whether her relentless pursuit of physical perfection
started as a strategy to win the stinted admiration of her husband. It may
have ended as a ploy to prove to him and to the rest of the world what he
had lost. But it has also become a habit, a way of life, and a comfort. She
opted out of work because she felt she needed space and now she finds that
space is empty. Many lonely women fill their days with shopping and beauty
treatments, but a woman does not have to be lonely to understand the value
to her psyche of shopping therapy. It is an affirmation of one's worth if
only in one's own eyes.

FT  21 MAY 94 / How To Spend It: Beating a path to Egg - Lucia van der Post
discovers an unusual shop where the owners sell what they like
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has to be some compelling reason why Richard Rogers, Issey Miyake,
Donna Karan, Rei Kawakubo, Joseph Ettedgui, Sir Terence Conran and a host of
other top designers have been seen recently heading for a small mews in
Knightsbridge, west London. There is - a shop called Egg.
Egg is a small, light and airy converted garage in which Maureen Doherty
(once Miyake's right hand in London and a noted arbiter of taste) and Asha
Sarabhai have joined forces to sell the things they like. Others seem to
like them, too: hence the activity in Kinnerton Street SW1.
What can you get there? Try, for instance, 'the best gym shoes in the world'
(at Pounds 20 a time) or a nubbly duster (Pounds 5). Then there are
exquisitely subtle tie-and-dyed silk pieces that would set you back Pounds
350 or more. The backbone of the shop is a collection of easy, unstuffy but
beautifully-made clothes, some indigenous ethnic designs from India, others
with ethnic origins adapted subtly to western living.
Sarabhai is a highly-regarded textile designer whose exhibition at the
Victoria &amp; Albert museum a few years ago was an eye-opener to many a
westerner used to the cruder, more mass-produced Indian textiles. Having
married into a wealthy Indian textile family, she has used the connection to
develop indigenous skills, improve quality and find markets for all her
hand-made work.
The shop has many of the garments and textiles produced in her small
workshop in Ahmedabad: cotton kurtas, for instance, made from high-quality
cotton with draw-string trousers and a long overshirt. These are loose, easy
and timeless in style. At Pounds 95 the set, they tune in easily with the
prevailing penchant this summer for easy trousers and long tops.
Elspeth Juda is an 82-year-old artist who visits Egg regularly. 'I work
every day,' she says, 'and I like very easy clothing, simple things that
cover every bump, of which I now have plenty. I used to be a size 12 and now
I'm a size 18.
'Trousers, I find, are habit-forming; they are so comfortable. I also love
the white shirts and I have a wonderful navy-blue cashmere gilet which was
my birthday present from me to me.'
Almost everything in Egg is hand-made, much of it labour-intensive - the
exquisite workmanship of the silk, tie-dyed pieces in particular but also
the pleating, the quilting and the smocking. There is a concern that every
detail should be perfect.
Besides the exquisite pieces, are quite homely things such as traditional
tin yoghurt pots from southern India, ranging in price from Pounds 20 to
Pounds 40; cotton khadi trousers and jackets from the Gandhi shops at about
Pounds 30 a time; and Chinese workmen's cotton tops (they make splendid
jackets for summer) in white and indigo.
Then there are cushions covered in rare and beautiful 18th century French
fabric which cost between Pounds 80 and Pounds 120 each; antique linen
sheets at Pounds 120 a set; and a few pieces by British designers, notably
Flyte Ostell's creamy linen knits and T-shirts. 'I like basic things that
can be worn by men and women,' says Doherty.
Egg is a shop that links the calm serenity of the east with a touch of
western sophistication. It seems to make for a happy marriage.
Egg is at 36 Kinnerton Street, London SW1, tel: 071-235 9315. Open Tuesdays
to Saturdays from 11am to 7pm.

FT  21 MAY 94 / The Nature of Things: Fertility plights - Clive Cookson on
the alarming decline in average sperm counts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an overpopulated world, a decline in male fertility may at first seem
like good news. But recent reports that the sperm counts of men today are
only half those of their counterparts 50 years ago are causing disquiet in
medical circles, particularly because the leading theory to explain the
decline involves pervasive chemical pollution of the environment.
There has even been bizarre speculation that mass infertility could lead to
the extinction of Homo sapiens by the end of the next century - a scenario
that PD James explored in her recent novel The Children of Men.
In reality, however, all that the latest scientific evidence has
demonstrated convincingly is how lamentably little we know about male
infertility in general and sperm production in particular.
The much-quoted estimate of a 50 per cent fall in sperm counts since 1940 is
based on a thorough analysis by Niels Skakkebaek of Copenhagen University of
studies carried out in 21 countries and involving 15,000 men. Although he
tried hard to correct for changing procedures and standards over the years,
retrospective studies of this sort are vulnerable to statistical attack -
and not everyone agrees that there has been a decline at all.
Another analysis of the data, to be published shortly in the British Medical
Journal, claims that the basis of the Skakkebaek paper was invalid. But a
large French study, accepted for publication in the New England Journal of
Medicine, will provide strong support for him.
In spite of the conflicting evidence, most experts believe that there has
been some decline in sperm production, though perhaps not as much as
Skakkebaek estimated. They suspect that it may be linked to the three-fold
increase in testicular cancer that has undoubtedly occurred in the
industrialised world since 1940. Other male reproductive disorders, such as
undescended testicles, have also become more common.
Our scientific ignorance is so great that no one knows what impact a 50 per
cent decline in average sperm counts would have on male fertility. On the
face of it, a normal man produces a vast excess of sperm: about 100m per
day. During sex he deposits between 100m and 800m (depending on when he last
had an orgasm) in the vagina, although only about 100 sperm reach the female
egg and of course just one fertilises it.
But sexual reproduction has evolved to require a huge number of surplus
sperm. By the standards of the rest of the animal kingdom, humans are
sub-fertile. Richard Sharpe of the Medical Research Council's Reproductive
Biology Unit in Edinburgh says that men produce sperm with only 10 to 30 per
cent of the efficiency of other mammals and, to make matters worse, about
half of human sperm are abnormal in some way, compared to 2 to 5 per cent in
other species.
In Britain infertility affects about one couple in six and the man's sperm
count is believed to be responsible in about a quarter of these cases. But
so little research has been carried out that estimates of male infertility
today vary by a factor of three - and no one knows to what extent, if at
all, the problem is worsening.
Many theories have been advanced over the years to explain declining sperm
counts. An old favourite is that modern men are overheating their testicles
by wearing too-tight underpants and trousers and/or by soaking too long in
hot baths.
Changing diet is frequently blamed too. The organic farming lobby jumped on
the bandwagon earlier this month when a small study in Denmark showed that
men eating only 'organic' food had sperm counts twice as high as the Danish
average. But other researchers said the sample of 30 men was too small to
give scientifically valid results.
However, the explanation receiving most attention at the moment is that
falling sperm counts and increasing reproductive abnormalities are related
to our growing exposure to 'environmental oestrogens'. These are persistent
man-made pollutants which mimic the biological effects of oestrogen, the
female sex hormone.
Natural oestrogen molecules work by fitting into a particular 'receptor'
site on human cells, like a key fitting a lock. For unknown reasons, nature
has not designed the oestrogen lock to tight tolerances and a range of other
molecular keys, including residues of the pesticide DDT and various
industrial chemicals, will also fit it and produce similar effects.
Until a couple of years ago, scientists had assumed that reproductive
problems stemmed mainly from events in childhood, puberty and adulthood. Now
Sharpe and his colleagues believe that the main impact of environmental
oestrogens takes place during the early development of the foetus, when
so-called Sertoli cells, precursors of sperm-producting cells in the
testicles, are formed.
According to the theory, a genetically male foetus exposed to even a little
extra female hormone will grow fewer Sertoli cells - and produce less sperm
in adulthood. If so, there is not much a subfertile man can do to boost his
sperm count by changing to an organic diet.
Evidence to support the environmental oestrogen theory is growing, from
studies of wildlife as well as humans. It may be a false alarm. Or we could
inadvertently be engineering not only a solution to overpopulation but a
barren future for man.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Skiing: Japan is no holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker aim to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition, which has now reached Japan.
After almost a week of grey skies and two days of torrential rain, we have
seen little of Japan's sun - rising or otherwise, writes Arnie Wilson.
The only time we have managed to keep dry has been while skiing indoors.
Less than an hour from Tokyo there are two indoor slopes with artificial
snow, including the recently-completed Ski Dome at Funabashi, the largest in
the world, with runs a third of a mile long, served by two high-speed quad
chairlifts.
The exterior, resembling a huge grey lunar base, is equally impressive.
In nearby Tsudanuma, there is a smaller, older and friendlier version with a
more sedate escalator.
Japan is the only country where we have no transport of our own. Getting
around by Shinkansen (bullet train) and taxi (much slower, especially in the
rush hour) is exhausting and expensive.
Although we have dumped eight of our 14 bags - to be retrieved later - in
Wyoming, Colorado, Austria, France and even here in Japan, changing trains
and walking along Japan's long platforms with a double ski bag and five
other heavy bags is wearisome.
There are no trolleys and taxi drivers do not like trying to manoeuvre 207cm
skis in a ski bag, still dirty and dusty from Delhi, across their immaculate
upholstery.
So after a day's outing to a far-flung ski area, we do not hail a cab to
take us from Tokyo station to our hotel a quarter of a mile away. If it is
raining you cannot get a cab anyway. You just walk. And get drenched. Who
said this was one long holiday?

FT  21 MAY 94 / Motoring: When looks count - Stuart Marshall road tests
BMW's new 7-Series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from their V8 engines, the latest BMW 730i and 740i are completely new
cars. But they look so little different from the old ones that, at a glance,
only a BMW aficionado might notice.
Does this matter? BMW thinks not. It says people who buy cars in this price
class - and the new 7-Series will cost between Pounds 39,800 and Pounds
46,700 when they arrive in British dealerships next month - are not looking
for anything revolutionary.
According to a senior BMW executive when the new models were launched in
Germany last week: 'We have not designed these cars to do the competition in
the eye but to please our customers. We know they appreciate our kind of
timeless elegance. They like understatement and they certainly do not want a
heavy, Teutonic look.'
The new 7-Series takes over from the models launched in 1986. Then, they
were powered by a five-litre, V12 engine and in-line sixes of three and 3.5
litres, replaced two years ago by V8s of three and four litres.
Longer wheelbase 7-Series saloons, with enlarged 5.4-litre V12 or four-litre
V8 engines, are due to appear for the 1995 model year, priced at Pounds
65,900 and Pounds 52,900 respectively .
BMW knows the flagship 750iL will be chosen by a small minority because even
luxury car owners or users do not relish being suspected of consuming
excessive amounts of petrol. (For that matter, one is tempted to ask: who
needs a 5.4-litre V12 putting out well over 300 horsepower, anyway?)
In fact, by the standards of a few years ago, the new 7-Series V8s are
remarkably economical, with a combined cycle consumption of 25.7mpg (11
l/100 km). This is based on a car spending half its time in traffic with the
other half split equally between driving at constant speeds of 56mph (90kph)
and 75mph (120kph).
The 210 horsepower 740i I drove for a morning accelerated agreeably swiftly
through its five automatic gears and streaked along the autobahn like some
earthbound executive aircraft.
At close to its electronically governed maximum of 155mph (250kmh), I
thought it as quiet as any obvious rival such as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class,
Audi A8 and Lexus LS400.
Off the autobahn, it handled as nimbly as a smaller car. The ride, as one
would expect, is excellent.
Even on an uncharacteristically rough German minor road, the suspension
simply soaked up the potholes and bumps and tyre noise remained muted.
All the new 7-Series cars coming to Britain will have five-speed automatic
transmission. If anyone insists, the 730i can be supplied with a five-speed
manual gearbox and the 740i with a six-speed, although I cannot imagine any
British buyer being unwise enough to want one. BMW dealers are likely to
warn inquirers that manual versions would have a lower retained value than
automatics.
When I tried a five-speed manual 730i after the two-pedal 740i, it was quite
an anti-climax. Both clutch and gear-shift had a long throw and - most
unusually for BMW - smooth changes between first, second and third required
concentration. The manual three-litre accelerated less urgently than the
740i although it felt just as relaxed as an autobahn cruiser.
Inside, the new 730i and 740i have the wood veneer trim now obligatory for
posh cars, to go with leather seats, twin air-bags, 10-speaker sound system,
air-conditioning and computer. This produced a clear central display of
range, fuel consumption, temperature, time and so on. But while modern cars
such as the BMW 7-Series are wonderfully easy to drive, one really needs a
short course to learn how to work all their electronic wonders.
In the 1980s, luxury car sales grew in Europe by 90 per cent to around
240,000 units each year. The recession cooled things down considerably, but
forecasters say it will be up to 260,000 in a year or two. BMW expects its
new 7-Series to take a 20 per cent share.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Lunch with the FT: A writer whose talent bloomed - Michael
Thompson-Noel meets Lisa St Aubin de Teran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
She is small and exotic. Occasionally, her eyes survey a detail - the light
on the river, a waiter's passing smile - with an artist's calculation. You
wonder what she is seeing. Is she absorbing data, or just enjoying lunch?
This is Lisa St Aubin de Teran, whose novels and short stories have been
translated into a dozen languages, although her poetry has been translated
only into Italian and Norwegian. I ponder that awhile, wondering what a
master of literary impressionism like her - sensitive, evocative,
beautifully controlled - sounds like in Norwegian.
The task is beyond me, so I produce my cigarettes. She studies me
approvingly, and takes out her own pack. 'I am so relieved you smoke,' she
says. 'I was sort of wondering. In Italy' - where she lives - 'there is no
problem with smoking, but in other parts of the world this whole
anti-smoking thing is almost beyond control. I find it so
counter-productive, all this hectoring.' A waiter, watching her keenly,
replaces her ashtray even before she lights up.
'Why this restaurant?' I ask. (For Lunch with the FT, guests can choose any
restaurant they wish.) We are in Cantina del Ponte at Butlers Wharf, on the
bank of the Thames immediately to the east of London Bridge. As part of Sir
Terence Conran's South Bank gastrodome, it occupies what many would rate the
finest restaurant site in London. The food is good: more Pacific rim, claims
The Good Food Guide, than ethnic Italian, as though anyone minds.
Lisa St Aubin de Teran had started with a glass of champagne, then switched
to orange juice, and was eating voraciously - salmon, steak, pudding.
'I just like it,' she said, answering my question. 'I know this restaurant,
though I have only been here at night. I like the view. It's a little like
being in Sydney. I like the river and I like the City, but then I am
extremely fond of London. My favourite city for being in is probably Rome.
For eating in: Paris.'
She was born in Kensington, London, in 1953 and moved, shortly afterwards,
to Wimbledon. She was first married at 16. For seven years, she managed a
sugar plantation in the Venezuelan Andes. She is very widely travelled,
especially on trains, and has lived here, there and everywhere.
She started writing poetry when she was 12, short stories six years later.
Her first novel, Keepers of the House, won the 1983 Somerset Maugham Award
and her second novel, The Slow Train to Milan, the 1984 John Llewellyn Rhys
Memorial Prize.
Now, she lives in a valley in Umbria. In her latest book, A Valley in Italy,
she describes her struggle, since 1988, to rehabilitate the Villa Orsola in
which she and her family live: a Herculean task. The villa was a ruin: no
electricity, no water, no windows, no doors and a serious gap in the roof.
'You must be tough,' I said to her. 'Extremely tough. What possessed you to
take the villa on? How could you write anything with all that noise and
mess?'
'I suppose I am tough,' she replied. 'Buying the villa was partly an act of
real foolishness. I didn't see how derelict it was. People said it would
cost millions to restore. I could see that it wouldn't cost millions, but I
didn't realise how much it would cost - money I didn't have, the energy of
organising people. The effort that went into its restoration was probably
sufficient to run a small country, and it is by no means finished. Two sides
of the villa are all right, the third unfinished and the fourth - the back -
still spectacularly derelict.
'Fortunately, I click on and off as a writer. I spend a lot of time working
things out in my head, so that the time spent actually writing is hardly
more than auto-dictation. This gives me lots of spare time, for music and
opera, say. I love the way opera is much more part of everyday life in Italy
than elsewhere. A performance of Don Giovanni in Italy is a bit like a
football match. If they don't like the soprano, they crank up their football
rattles.
'In view of the money and energy that the palazzo consumed, I've felt a lot
less self-indulgent since starting my lily project.'
This lily project could make her famous in her part of Italy, if she isn't
already. (She speaks Italian fluently, and now understands Umbrian dialect.)
In her part of Umbria, poverty used to be endemic; it still casts a shadow.
Until 1945, the local men had to emigrate or work a six-day week as
labourers, charcoal burners or wood-cutters in the endless forests.
The land, says Lisa, excelled in no single crop, producing only inferior
versions of what neighbouring Tuscany grew. Then tobacco caught on,
providing, from 1953 onwards, a boom which by 1980 had provided every family
in her village, San Orsola, with its own house, a piece of land and at least
one car.
'In the high days, tobacco yielded a profit of Pounds 25,000 per hectare,
far more than maize, for example - Pounds 400 per hectare if the villagers
were lucky.' But tobacco-growing, which is pollutive, entails crippling
drudgery, and the EU subsidies were being slashed. A new crop was needed.
To her intense surprise, Lisa discovered that lilies grew easily in her
Umbrian garden. Perhaps they were the answer. She imported 500 bulbs from
the Netherlands which also, generously, offered technical assistance and
advice. The bulbs did as well as on a Dutch lily farm. Three years ago, she
imported another 8,000 bulbs, raising her stock to about 24,000.
'But I went to Brazil, to make a TV film of a rail journey. On my return, I
found that a herd of pigs had broken in and caused dreadful damage, though I
have probably still got 6,000 lilies flowering this summer.'
'Wild pigs?'
'The offspring of domestic sows and wild boars - the very worst. They are a
terror because they can get into anything. Real kamikazes - they will thrust
their young on to electrified fences, then storm in behind them.'
Despite that set-back, and the tangle of red tape that surrounds any
endeavour in Italy, Lisa is hopeful that lilies will bloom commercially in
her valley. 'People originally thought my scheme truly ridiculous. Now they
are keen.'
Some farmers are ready to try growing them, with her support, and the
rewards could be significant. Rome and its flower markets are two hours
away, Florence and Siena closer.
'You only need a small amount of land to grow lilies. No family would be
able to farm more than  1/2 -1 hectare of lilies and tulips, which also do
extremely well. The villagers could make more from my flowers than from
tobacco.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / No one with a gun is approachable: Michael Skapinker argues
that increased arming of the police could make matters worse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not despair. We can still defeat those who are intent on bringing mayhem
and bloodshed to our streets.
We know who they are: the roaming gangs of self-appointed experts, the
ravenous packs of sensation-seeking hacks, and the receivers of second-hand
prejudices who are determined to arm the British police - thereby
encouraging criminals not only to carry guns, but to shoot first.
I understand that there are no concrete plans to arm all police officers.
What Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, announced last week
was an increase in the number of London armed response vehicles from five to
12, with their occupants openly wearing handguns.
Mr Condon said the further carrying of guns by police would be
'event-driven'. All around us, however, are people determined that routine
arming of police should be headline-driven, letter to the editor-driven, and
unattributable quote-driven.
Criminologists believe the standard issue of guns to be 'inevitable', a
report in one newspaper told us. 'Our proud boast to have an unarmed police
force is now history,' said a letter in another newspaper. 'There is no
turning back.'
I know a bit about guns. As a South African, I grew up surrounded by them.
The police all had guns, of course. Many civilians did too. Some wore them
on their belts when they went to the shops. I recently saw an African
National Congress spokesman on Newsnight making the bold suggestion that no
person should own more than one gun.
Do all these guns preserve people's lives? Of course not. Despite its
blessedly peaceful recent election, South Africa is one of the most
murderous societies on earth.
True, South Africa has tensions that the UK does not: for many decades, most
of the population regarded the police as a hostile force. But guns
exacerbate whatever tensions exist in any country and in any confrontation.
To be an effective deterrent against attack, the carrier of a gun has to be
prepared to use it. If criminals believe police will not use their guns,
they will feel free to attack them, perhaps stealing their weapons in the
process. If criminals believe the guns will be used, they are faced with two
choices: either they give up crime or they arm themselves.
Advocates of an armed police force, might wish for the former to happen; the
experience of heavily armed countries suggests it will be the latter.
Ah, say the advocates, but what you forget is that British criminals are
using guns in increasing numbers anyway. Violent crimes have rocketed and
attacks on officers have soared.
There are several flaws in these arguments, the most important being that
they are not supported by the facts. Attacks on police officers have not
soared. The number of assaults on London police using guns, knives or other
weapons rose in the early 1980s, but has dropped since 1987. In 1992, there
were fewer assaults on London police than in 1982. In 1992, one London
police officer was injured by a gun being fired at him. In 1977, the figure
was five.
As to the safety of the streets, violent crimes reported to the police in
England and Wales have risen sharply, to 284,200 in 1992 from 151,300 in
1982. The difficulty with these figures is they depend on changes in
people's willingness to report assaults. For this reason, the British Crime
Survey interviews people to provide an alternative measure.
The 1992 survey concluded that there had been a significant increase in
domestic assaults and attacks in or around work between 1981 and 1991. It
then said, and you will not believe me, but it is there, on page 96: 'Other
types of assaults have shown less change, or in the case of street assaults
and pub brawls, a slight decrease.'
It is true that the number of firearms used in reported crimes in England
and Wales has increased, from 8,400 in 1982 to 13,305 in 1992. Note: used,
not fired. In 85 per cent of cases in which the weapon was more lethal than
an air gun, it was used as a threat. The number of cases in which the victim
of a crime was injured by a firearm was lower in 1992 than in 1982.
That violent crime is reasonably stable is no comfort to the victims or the
police who have to protect them. But arming police officers is unlikely to
make their task easier and could make it worse. The majority of the police
appear to recognise this: a poll this week showed 56 per cent are opposed to
further arming.
The public seemed more amenable to the idea, although most remain against
the police carrying guns at all times. More than two-thirds thought they
would find an armed police officer as approachable as an unarmed one. Let us
hope they never get the chance to test this. No one with a gun is
approachable. That is what guns are for.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Silversmiths' time capsule -
Clive Fewins meets three craftsmen in a workshop that has changed little
since 1902
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ancient cracked plaster peels away from the walls on the bare oak staircase
up to the first floor workshop. Inside, bills dating from the early 1940s
hang from the low, beamed ceiling; antiquated tools and price lists from
long-defunct bullion dealers line the walls, and the only automation in
sight is an archaic hand-worked silver rolling machine.
The scene is Harts Silversmiths, in a quiet side street in the Cotswold town
of Chipping Campden.
It reminds the visitor of the wedding dress scene from Dickens' Great
Expectations; it is a time capsule.
Harts is an Arts and Crafts Movement workshop. It is the only survivor from
The Guild of Handicraft, moved from the East End of London to Chipping
Campden in 1902 by utopian and early Arts and Crafts pioneer C R Ashbee.
The brick-built former silk mill was once buzzing with the sound of iron
forging, leather working, book binding, and woodcarving, but in the first
floor workshop at least, things have changed little.
'Everything is hand-beaten out of sheet silver, rather than being spun on a
lathe or pressed out by large machines,' said David Hart, who heads the team
of three silversmiths. Reticent, slightly gruff, a craftsman to the core
after learning the business at his father's leather apron, Hart is 55. His
son William, 25, works alongside.
The workshop was founded by David's grandfather, George, who came with
Ashbee and bequeathed to the workshop a vast array of drawings. David and
his father Henry stopped counting when they reached 4,000.
William gained a BSc in computing at Manchester University but joined the
family firm after graduating. There is no computer among the hand tools in
the creaky-floored, wood-lined workshop.
The third member of the trio is Derek Elliott. He wandered into the workshop
(anyone is welcome to walk in and browse) 14 year ago while studying A-level
Art at Chipping Campden School. A year later he was beginning a five-year
apprenticeship with David, Henry, and David's uncle, George, who played
Jethro Larkin in The Archers for 20 years.
Harts Silversmiths is not a company but a group of three small businesses.
Each of the three craftsmen undertakes his own jobs and keeps his own
accounts.
Overheads - rent, business rates and allied expenses - come to about Pounds
5,000 a year. The three share this, and the cost of their materials. The
silver arrives once a month, the annual bill being between Pounds 12,000 and
Pounds 20,000.
'If we were good businessmen we'd be turning over Pounds 60,000 apiece. But
we are not. We're appalling businessmen. We have no retail outlet. We let
the public come to us and we do virtually no marketing,' said Derek Elliott.
That is the way things have always been - and are likely to stay. David and
his team love Campden, their workshop, and their craft. They enjoy meeting
the stream of visitors, from the steady flow of retired people in the town
who drop in for a chat, to the visitors from across the Atlantic, Asia and
Australasia, who find their way to the upper room.
The three each turn over about Pounds 22,000 worth of work in a good year,
charging at the rate of Pounds 12 an hour, plus Pounds 10 an ounce for
silver - their pricing has not changed in four years.
They rarely argue over who takes on which job, and never know how much each
turns over or pays himself. They say they are happy to net Pounds
12,000-Pounds 15,000 a year each.
'It's all underpriced, but the market won't stand any more,' said David
Hart. 'However, we are anticipating some interesting new business from a
Belgian who wandered in recently. He looks like ordering a pair of wall
sconces to support light fitments, and also a set of silver dinner mats.
'The commission should be worth several thousand pounds. But the interesting
thing is that this man controls a large specialist glass factory and is
looking for a source for prototype silver adornments for a new range of high
quality glass decanters. We could do the job, and he seemed keen.'
Spring optimism is in the air at the Hart workshop. The order book is
looking healthy. As well as a myriad of designs of silver place settings,
napkin rings, serving spoons, tankards and teapots, all to be made to
commission, there are one or two large church orders in hand, and also a big
job making a commemoration cup and rosewater dish for a Cambridge college
anniversary. The commission is worth about Pounds 8,000 and will have to be
split between two, or possibly all three, of the craftsmen.
There is a steady stream of church work, plus refurbishment and restoration
jobs.
This year looks like being a prosperous one for the workshop. But last year
was very different. 'In early 1993 we were really hit by the effects of the
recession,' David Hart said. 'The order book was the lowest it had been in
my 38 years here. Commissions were just not coming in.'
Things did pick up, but the Harts had learned a lesson. They are about to
advertise in a society magazine - their first advertising apart from a
regular slot in the quarterly Church Building journal.
In the meantime, work continues to flow from the workshop: a Pounds 2,500
tea set being made to a client's design by Derek Elliott; a pair of
delicately curved modern silver candlesticks by William Hart, each with six
parts that are invisible to the untrained eye; an intricate repair to a
stylish Georgian teapot by his father.
'I enjoy the challenge of restoring lovely things, but it is uneconomic. It
always takes longer than you think. So often you could make a new one more
cheaply,' said David Hart.
'Although it doesn't make much money you can't turn this sort of work down.
It is part of our tradition, and it often comes via long-established
customers.
'However it is far better than being like most other silversmiths nowadays.
So often they are just assemblers of wafer-thin spun or pressed components.
Here we are - different.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
April. Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the month
in which you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale;
the balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them
in January 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
September 1985 figure of 1.511 gives a total of Pounds 9,066.
Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 3,934,
which is within the CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If selling shares bought
before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The RPI in April
was 144.2.
The Budget decision that indexation cannot be used to create or increase
losses for shares sold after November 29 1993, has been modified for Pounds
10,000 of transitional relief.

<TEXT>
With reference to EU bearer securities (ie, BASK AG shares), would you
please clarify the following points:
1. If held by the trustees of a company profit-sharing scheme, can they be
transferred at the end of the five-year term into a single company personal
equity plan?
2. Is it a legal requirement for them to be held in a custodian account at a
bank?
3. Is it true that the collection of dividends is not difficult and involves
only a bit more paperwork?
4. Would you expect to pay a fee, however small, to the custodian to get
physical possession of shares held for five years in a company
profit-sharing scheme?
1. No. 2. No. 3. In our opinion, the answer is No for most people. 4. Yes,
if the sponsoring employer has not undertaken to meet such expenses.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: UK interest on US earnings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife and I are considering returning to the UK this year. I am a British
subject and she is a US citizen who also holds an Irish passport. We are
planning to live on the interest from money inherited by my wife until
suitable employment is found. We know we will be liable for US income taxes
on the earned interest but would we have any tax liability in the UK?
As we intend selling our residence in the US in order to buy property in
Britain, would there be any liability for capital gains tax in the UK on the
money realised from the sale?
The answer to your first question is yes, subject to credit for the US tax.
The answer to your second question is no, assuming that you are talking
about a home which has been the sole or main residence of both of you since
it was bought (or since the end of March 1982, if later).
On the other hand, you might have to pay capital gains tax on money
withdrawn from your US dollar bank account/s if the rate of exchange has
moved against the pound between deposit and withdrawal of each item.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Liability on shares?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I work in the City for the UK subsidiary of a continental company. I am
resident in Britain but domiciled elsewhere. Last year and this, I received
shares in the parent organisation. They are reported as income to the Inland
Revenue. But I received them in a securities account outside the UK.
1. If the shares pay a dividend which is not remitted to the UK, is there a
liability to UK tax?
2. If the shares are sold for a gain and funds NOT remitted to the UK, is
the sale subject to capital gains tax?
3. If the shares are sold for a loss and funds remitted to the United
Kingdom, can the loss be offset against income if there are no other capital
gains? Can it be offset against capital gains?
1. No. 2. No. 3. The loss would not be eligible for relief, regardless of
whether the proceeds were remitted to the UK.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next year, my husband is likely to realise a capital gain from share options
in excess of his personal allowance. As well as transferring shares to me,
so that I can use my capital gains allowance, is it possible similarly to
transfer shares to our children?
As a general principle, gifts are treated as sales at market value, as you
will see from the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction)
which is obtainable from tax offices. So, if your husband transfers shares
to your children (or anyone else other than yourself), he would be treated
as if he had sold them at market value. This defeats the object of the
exercise.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been using a high-powered Mercedes car in my small family business. I
intend to replace it with a more economical vehicle for business only. The
Mercedes has been written down for tax purposes to Pounds 3,000 but,
although eight years old, it is in excellent condition.
I propose selling it to my wife for that price, for her private use. When
she eventually sells, would she be liable for capital gains tax on any
profit?
No. It is exempt from CGT by virtue of section 263 of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992. This says: 'A mechanically propelled road vehicle
constructed or adapted for the carriage of passengers, except for a vehicle
of a type not commonly used as a private vehicle and unsuitable to be so
used, shall not be a chargeable asset; and, accordingly, no chargeable gain
or allowable loss shall accrue on its disposal.'

<TEXT>
Three years ago, my husband and I made substantial interest-free loans to
our daughter to set up a small retailing business which has, unfortunately,
made an annual trading loss.
Do you think we would have any chance of claiming these losses against any
possible future gains?
If your daughter is effectively bankrupt, you and your husband can each make
a claim under section 253 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 for
your respective irrecoverable loans. You must, of course, send your daughter
formal demands for immediate repayment of the loans in part, if not in full.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Permanent interest-bearing shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of permanent interest-bearing shares have not differed substantially
since the table was published on April 16. But movement has not been
uniform, with most prices weakening, some improving and others static,
writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
Pibs are issued by building societies to raise capital; they pay a fixed
income indefinitely but, since they have no redemption date, investors can
get back their capital only by selling them in the stock market.
There was excitement in the Pibs market when the proposed takeover of
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester by Lloyds bank was announced last month and, soon
after, by the news that North of England would merge with Northern Rock.
Those holding C&amp;G Pibs on or before March 31 1994 will be entitled to Pounds
500 (if they are a voting member) as well as 10 per cent of their holding,
to a maximum of Pounds 10,000, when the takeover is completed.
North of England has not announced a similar benefit for its clients but
there has much speculative buying of Pibs issues from societies considered
likely takeover candidates. These include the Newcastle, Cheshire, Bristol &amp;
West, and the Leeds Permanent.
David Barker, director of Hoare Govett, says: 'Activity levels have picked
up substantially in recent weeks and the market generally has strongly
outperformed the gilt-edged market, which has been quite weak over the past
month.
'The reasons are twofold - investors believe the high real yields offered by
Pibs are attractive in a low-inflation environment, and many investors were
lucky enough to own Pibs issued by C&amp;G and North of England. Both Pibs saw
strong gains.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The need to be flexible - Your
pension / Retirement and after, last of three articles by Eric Short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q. I am retiring this year and will be receiving a pension from my company's
scheme. Should I transfer into a personal pension, as has been suggested to
me?
A. For employees who are not high net worth executives, the answer is NO.
For the executives, though, transferring before retirement into a personal
pension offers interesting financial possibilities.
Q. What are they?
A. In a nutshell, flexibility of income, opportunities to continue investing
pension cash, and the facility to pass on pension assets to your children
should you die early.
Q. Can you explain more fully?
A. First, consider what happens when you retire from your company. You have
to take the benefits from the company scheme at the time you retire. You
have the options of a pension based on your salary at retirement and years
of service with the company, or a tax-free cash sum together with a reduced
pension.
You have no choice over deferring the payments or varying the amount of each
payment to suit your circumstances.
Q. What happens when I die?
A. Your spouse would continue to receive a pension at around half the amount
of your pension until he or she died, when the payments would cease.
Q. So, the value I get out from my company pension scheme depends on how
long I and my spouse live. If we both die soon after I have retired, we get
comparatively little from the scheme.
A. That is correct. But you must remember that a man retiring in good health
at the age of 65 can, on average, expect to live 14.5 years. And, of course,
the longer a person lives, the more valuable the benefits from the company
scheme.
In any case, since pension payments usually are guaranteed for five years,
your estate would not lose out entirely if you and your spouse died soon
after retirement.
Q. Can I leave the balance of my pension benefits to my children if I and my
spouse die soon after retirement?
A. You can take the tax-free cash sum on retirement, with a lower pension,
and that sum can be invested and left to your children. But the pension
payments die with you, other than those over the five-year guaranteed
period.
Q. How does this compare with transferring into a personal pension?
A. Your transfer value is divided into two parts - the protected rights and
the excess, with the excess being by far the greater value.
Both parts are put into in a personal pension with complete investment
freedom.
You can choose to invest in one or more funds from the range offered by the
life company - UK and overseas equities, fixed-interest, property and cash -
with opportunities to switch funds.
Q. What happens to the protected rights portion?
A. This represents contracting-out of the Serps (the state earnings-related
pension scheme).
When you reach state pension age - now 65 for men and 60 for women - you
must use the accumulated value to buy an annuity on a unisex, uni-status
basis increasing by 3 per cent a year.
If you are transferring at state pension age, you will be required to buy
the annuity immediately on transfer.
Q. What happens to the excess portion?
A. This is where the transfer offers the interesting financial possibilities
mentioned earlier.
With a personal pension, you can take the benefits, wholly or partially, at
any time between your 50th and 75th birthdays.
Up to 25 per cent of the value of the cashed-in benefits can be taken as
tax-free cash; the rest must be used to buy an annuity, with complete
freedom as to which one you choose.
This flexibility means that you can take the benefits from the personal
pension in bits. In other words, you can stagger or phase the cash-in of the
benefits until you reach your 75th birthday.
This process is known in the industry as staggered vesting or phased
annuities.
Q. How does one use this flexibility?
A. Each year, you decide how much income (after tax) you require for the
next 12 months. You assess your existing income from other sources - state
pension, protected rights pension and investment income. You then work out
what the shortfall is, and plug this gap by taking money out of your
personal pension fund.
Three-quarters of the money taken from the fund buys an annuity (which
provides lifetime income); the final quarter (which can be taken as a
tax-free lump sum) is actually earmarked for additional income for the
coming year.
The calculations need only be approximate.
Q. This cash-in process appears complicated. How does it work?
A. Suppose you are 65 and need to take around Pounds 10,000 net of tax from
the personal pension for the next 12 months.
The rate for the required annuity at age-65 is, say, Pounds 1,000 gross for
each Pounds 10,000 cash, and your tax rate is 25 per cent.
If you cash-in Pounds 32,600 of the personal pension, you can take Pounds
8,150 as tax-free cash. The balance of Pounds 24,450 buys a gross annuity of
Pounds 2,445 a year - or Pounds 1,834 after tax. So you have a net income
from the personal pension over the next 12 months of Pounds 8,150 plus
Pounds 1,834 - a total of Pounds 9,984.
The income from the annuity will be paid for the rest of your life. The rest
of your personal pension not cashed-in remains invested and continues to
grow in value.
Q. What happens next?
A. This process is repeated each successive year. Remember that each year
you buy an annuity which is added to your existing sources of income.
Annuity rates increase with your age, so your cash will buy a greater amount
of annuity each year, other things being equal (which they never are). Thus,
you might not need to cash-in so much of your personal pension
Q. What happens to the underlying personal pension fund?
A. During the first few years, the fund will diminish as you draw on it. The
rate at which it diminishes depends on how much you cash in each year.
But, as you build up your annuity, and as annuity rates increase, and if you
achieve a good return on the investments, then you could find the value of
your personal pension increasing until age-75.
Q. What happens at age-75?
A. You must use up the remaining value of the personal pension by taking the
tax-free cash sum and buying an annuity with the remainder. This final
tax-free sum should be regarded as capital rather than income; it will be
the last.
Q. What happens if I die before then?
A. The value in your personal pension is paid over as a cash sum - free of
tax if the personal pension is written in trust. This amount can be passed
to your children if desired.
Q. What about financial provision for my spouse?
A. He or she is provided for from the protected rights. You can buy
annuities with payments continuing to your spouse after your death. And/or
you can pass on the cash sum so that, if you die before 75, your spouse can
buy an annuity. You can tailor in the spouse's benefit to complement your
spouse's income. But, at 75, you should consider buying an annuity that
makes payments to your spouse after your death.
Q. This means, then, that if I transfer out of the company scheme, I can
manage my own affairs up to age-75 and do not lose the value of my pension
benefits if I die early?
A Yes, but it does depend very much on how much you take out of the personal
pension in the early years and the underlying investment performance. By
transferring, you are giving up certainty and security in return for
flexibility and the chance to obtain higher benefits. But you would be
vulnerable, particularly to a fall in investment values.
Q. I am interested in handling my own affairs. How should I proceed?
A. You must give yourself several weeks ahead of your retirement to make the
transfer, which must be completed before your retirement. The Inland Revenue
will not permit transfers to take place on or after retirement.
Most important, if you intend to proceed then you need professional advice
at all stages. The adviser must be prepared to cover all aspects  - income
assessment, investment management, as well as advising on the type of
annuity. In addition, you must be prepared to take time and trouble
assessing your requirements and understanding the adviser's recommendations.
As such, the adviser should operate on a fee basis for work done, not on
commission.
Q. Any final thoughts?
A. Above all, be wary of being offered a staggered vesting package that sets
out your income requirements over the next 10-15 years. It is essential that
you have complete flexibility of action.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: How to grill your adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You know a financial product is moving in deep waters when even City
regulators believe investors need advice about how to talk to their
financial advisers. That is what happened this week with personal pensions
sold to people leaving a present or former employer's pension scheme.
The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the chief regulator, has
published two fact sheets intended to help consumers make well-informed
decisions about whether it is in their interests to take out a personal
pension in those circumstances.
One deals with pension transfers - where someone moves a lump sum from a
pension scheme - and the other covers opt-outs where people choose not to
join or decide to leave occupational schemes for which they are eligible.
The lists should be available by the end of the month from public libraries,
citizens advice bureaux and (SIB hopes) through other organisations such as
the Trades Union Congress and occupational pension schemes.
SIB chairman Andrew Large stressed that a personal pension could be the
right decision for many people, but the leaflets themselves point to many
possible pitfalls while making it clear that they are not DIY pension kits.
Each fact sheet has, as its front page, a flow diagram which begins by
asking whether you are, or ever have been, a member of an employer's pension
scheme. After further 'yes or no' questions, it reaches one of the following
conclusions: that you should consult a financial adviser about your pension
arrangements; that you should read the fact sheet on transfers; that you
should read the fact sheet on opt-outs; or that you are safely in an
occupational scheme and do not need either fact sheet.
Both leaflets follow similar patterns in advising people what issues they
should consider. In particular, these include knowing enough about their
employers' scheme to be aware what they would be giving up by transferring
or opting out. They then offer a list of questions intended to make sure
that the adviser - whether an IFA or a sales agent linked to a single
company - and the investor have raised all the relevant issues. For
transfers, these are:
Have your personal circumstances - including your attitude to risk - been
discussed in detail?
Has your adviser discussed benefits such as early retirement which you might
lose through leaving the scheme?
Have you discussed the decision with your spouse or partner?
Have you had all the options explained to you?
Has your adviser explained the differences between occupational schemes
based on final salary and a personal pension?
Do you realise that taking a personal pension means taking an investment
risk; and that the pension you receive will depend on annuity rates, which
reflect interest rates?
For opt-outs, the questions cover some of the same ground, but also warn you
not to take out a personal pension unless you can pay the contributions for
a number of years.
Both leaflets point out that good reasons are needed to take out a pension
transfer, and that very good reasons are needed to opt out of an employers'
scheme. They urge investors to get their advisers to explain in writing why
the decision makes financial sense.
Investors also should ask about charges and commission, since these will
affect the pension available on retirement, and should shop around to try to
make sure they get good service.
Individual copies of the leaflets are available free by sending a 9in by 7in
stamped, addressed envelope to the Securities and Investments Board,
Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8RA.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Forget trusts - Opt for the managers
and make much more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why should long-term investors bother with unit trusts when they could make
10 times as much money out of shares in the trust managers? The question is
particularly pertinent as the veteran M&amp;G Group prepares next week to
celebrate two unit trust birthdays: a 30th for the M&amp;G Dividend fund and a
25th for M&amp;G Recovery.
M&amp;G has been brewing up the customary mix of nostalgic facts and long-term
performance figures. Graphs have been drawn showing how Pounds 1,000 in M&amp;G
Dividend at launch in May 1964 would have been worth Pounds 65,440 by May 6
this year, (allowing for buying and selling costs, with net income
re-invested).
On the same basis, Pounds 1,000 invested in M&amp;G Recovery in May 1969 had
grown to Pounds 111,040 by the end of April 1994, outperforming the FT
All-Share index over the period by a factor of about 4.5. But a comparison
investors might find equally striking will not be available: the performance
of an investment in M&amp;G's own shares over the past 25 and 30 years.
The group says its records do not stretch back that far; the stock exchange
says documents covering the 1960s were destroyed in a warehouse fire. Yet it
is clear that over the past 15 years, investors could have made up to 10
times as much in M&amp;G Group shares as in M&amp;G unit trusts.
Our table compares the performance of a Pounds 1,000 investment in M&amp;G
shares with that of a similar investment in a spread of its unit trusts,
including both the best and the worst.
If anything, the comparison flatters the unit trusts, where dividends are
assumed to have been re-invested; the share dividends are not. Although the
share performance figures do not allow for buying and selling commissions,
these would probably not make much difference.
The overall pattern was similar over shorter periods of 10.5 and three years
but, the shorter the time scale, the smaller the lead held by M&amp;G shares.
And if you look just at the latest year, 12 of the group's unit trusts
outstripped its own share price.
Nigel Russell, an analyst with James Capel in Edinburgh, says long-term
investors would, in most cases, have done better in the shares of a fund
management group than in the group's unit trust products.
But he cautions that while the rewards can be high, so can the risks. 'With
unit trusts, the punter is buying a diversified portfolio whereas, with M&amp;G
itself, you are buying a single UK share in a very volatile business,' he
says.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Versatile and various - Where your
money goes . . . investment trust / Second in a series by Anthony Bailey on
the true costs of investing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY

<TEXT>
Investment trusts are a versatile vehicle. They allow people access to a
diverse range of portfolios - from general funds investing across the world
to UK blue chips and higher-risk funds which specialise in a specific
country, region, type of market or type of company. In addition, the range
of shares in split capital trusts allows investors to select those which
fulfil a particular aim.
The actual costs of investing in these funds are not easy to compare with
similar unit trusts. This is because the price of investment trust shares is
determined by supply and demand in the market and not solely by the value of
the underlying investments they hold.
Dealing costs
Since investment trusts are companies listed on the stock exchange, the most
obvious cost for investors is that of buying and selling the shares. What
you pay will depend on which broker you use, his commission, the value of
shares you buy and, if you are investing only a small amount, the minimum
commission.
So, if you invest through a broker who charges 1.5 per cent, the cost of
buying rises to 2 per cent (once 0.5 per cent stamp duty is added) - more if
you invest a small amount and have to pay the minimum commission. A similar
1.5 per cent commission when you sell puts the total cost at 3.5 per cent of
what you invest, or Pounds 35 on an investment of Pounds 1,000.
These, along with the dealing spread (see below), are the figures to compare
with the bid/offer spread of 5, 6 or 7 per cent incurred when you invest in
unit trusts.
Cheap entry
The traditional broker is not the only way to buy investment trust shares. A
number of management companies run schemes which allow investors cheap
entry, either through regular monthly savings of at least Pounds 20 to
Pounds 50, or via single lump sum investments of around Pounds 250 to Pounds
500.
A few schemes make no dealing charge at all, while others have low dealing
commissions of 0.2 per cent and perhaps a flat rate sale charge of Pounds
10. Even those schemes that charge 1 per cent compare well with many
brokers, especially if there is no minimum charge.
The snag with some schemes is that they do not deal every day, or even every
week - so check. You also need to check just how cheap these schemes are. If
you go through a financial adviser rather than directly to the management
company, you might have to 'agree' to pay the adviser commission of up to 3
per cent.
The bid/offer spread
As with all shares, there is a difference between the higher offer price at
which you buy and the lower bid price at which you can sell. This spread
needs to be added to the buying and selling cost of shares to get a true
comparison with the bid/offer spread of unit trusts. With some large,
well-established general trusts, the spread can be narrow. It is 1.4 per
cent with F&amp;C's original general trust, but 3.1 per cent on F&amp;C Germany. On
City of Oxford's warrants, it is 27 per cent.
New investment trusts
There is no brokers' commission or stamp duty when you buy shares in a
newly-launched trust, but that does not mean investing is free. The
prospectus will have details of the launch costs, which could amount to 2 or
3 per cent or more.
The new Fleming Indian investment trust had a launch cost of 4 per cent, so
the starting net asset value of the investment was 96p a share. In practice,
though, measuring the effect of this cost is not straightforward because
what matters to investors is the actual value of the shares in the market
place, not the net asset value.
The management costs
As with unit trusts, the managers of investment trusts charge an annual fee.
In the case of Fleming Indian, the management company gets 1.2 per cent a
year. This sort of charge is roughly comparable with the annual charge
levied by unit trusts.
But as well as paying a fee to the management company, an investment trust
is a company in its own right with its own running costs. These must be
added to the management company's fee to reach a figure for the total cost
to investors - this being money which is not actually placed in stocks and
shares.
The best place to ascertain these costs is to look at the investment trust's
annual report and accounts. Some of the larger, older general trusts may
have overall costs of under 0.5 per cent, but others may be well over 1 per
cent.
One reason why investment trust costs can be lower than unit trusts is that
the former is a closed-end fund. It does not have to maintain a dealing desk
to respond to the constant demand from investors to buy and sell units.
The discount/premium
With a unit trust you are, essentially, paying for the costs of getting a
professionally managed portfolio. So, costs - the money not actually
invested - are an important factor (although, ultimately, it is the skill of
the investment managers and the return in your hands which counts).
Investment trusts are a bit different. One reason is that the price at which
investors buy and sell is determined by market forces and not by a formula
relating to the value of the actual assets held.
Not so long ago, discounts of 30 per cent were common. In other words, you
could buy assets worth 100p for 70p. While this sounds like a bargain, it is
not so wonderful if you have to sell the shares at a 30 per cent discount,
too (although you will have had the benefit of dividends on 100p worth of
assets in the meantime).
Discounts have narrowed, though, and the average discount now is nearer 8
per cent. Some shares are trading at a premium to the trust's net asset
value.
That is one reason why, on average, investment trusts have given investors
better returns than unit trusts. But a narrowing discount is a one-off bonus
 -and discounts may widen again.
Purists would argue that discounts and premiums are nothing to do with the
cost of investing; that they are part of assessing whether an investment
trust share is good value. It is a fair point. But private investors who may
be comparing the relative merits of investment and unit trusts with the same
investment remit do need to be aware of this crucial difference.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Ground for optimism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Investing in ground rents - the small, annual payments made by owners of
leasehold property - might seem an obscure way of generating above-average
returns. But investors seeking a high, secure income may be interested in
the Freehold Income Trust (FIT).
This unit trust, which invests in ground rents, announced a year-end income
distribution - paid gross - of 10.2 per cent this week. Over the year, the
offer price of the units rose by 5.9 per cent.
The trust - which has attracted about Pounds 1m of investors' funds - owns
the freehold of 1,700 flats and houses in London, the North and Midlands.
Its income stems from collecting the ground rents, ranging from Pounds 1 to
Pounds 300 a year, from these properties.
The income from its portfolio is considered to be secure because, in the
case of default, the freeholder ranks ahead of a leaseholder's mortgage
lender. But the trust's income will change over time because it is affected
by the price at which it buys additional portfolios of ground rents. Based
on present property purchases, the trust expects next year's income to be
similar to that of the last.
Last year's rise in the value of the trust's units stemmed from an upwards
revaluation of its ground rent portfolio. It also made a capital gain of
Pounds 1,900, as a result of selling the freehold of two houses to their
leaseholders. Leaving aside capital gains, the future value of the units is
likely to fluctuate in line with the market for long-dated gilts.
The FIT is an unauthorised unit trust. This gives it the flexibility of
being able to borrow, but it also means that it should not be seen as a
liquid investment. Although the trust aims to cash in investors' units on
demand, it has the right to postpone payment for up to 12 months.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Fee rules change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment costs are such a live subject that they are changing even while
this series of articles is being published. This week, the Securities and
Investments Board - watchdog for the industry - altered the rules on unit
trust fees.
Unit trust managers will now be allowed to deduct annual charges from the
capital of funds they manage, and will no longer be limited to taking it out
of the income stream from dividends. This is obviously particularly relevant
for income funds. Some fund managers, such as Schroders, are considering
taking advantage of the rule change. But preliminary discussions on how
yields should be publicised are likely. And industry regulator Lautro plans
to publish guidelines.
Next week, our series moves on to the costs of direct investment in the
stock market: brokers' charges, spreads, and why the size of a company can
alter the cost of buying and selling shares.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Only the best will do - Gillian
O'Connor looks at a trust-picker with teeth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Investors in the US wanting to have their money managed by the legendary
Warren Buffett used to have two choices. First, they could try to get hold
of shares in Berkshire Hathaway, the company he runs. Or they could buy into
Sequoia, a fund with a similar approach and a hefty chunk of Berkshire
Hathaway shares in its portfolio. Sadly, Sequoia has been closed to new
investors.
British investors can play a similar game with unit trusts recommended by
Fund Research. London is teeming with stockbrokers' analysts researching
individual companies. But only Fund Research makes an equally serious bid to
pick the best of the 1,500-odd unit trusts on the market.
Run by former fund managers, the firm screens the funds exhaustively in
order to winnow out all but the minority which perform well on a consistent
basis. It does not use the normal one, three, five and 10 year performance
tables to select past 'winners'; instead, it looks at each fund over
discrete periods of a year within a longer time span. Only those which are
among the leaders qualify consistently for the second round.
Next, it goes through its short-list with a fine-toothed comb, looking for
such potential problems as excessively high turnover. Then, it grills the
fund managers.
The myth is that Fund Research interviewers always go in pairs, with a
different duo each time in order to minimise the chances of human
misjudgment. ('Not quite true,' says managing director Peter Jeffrey). But
if a fund manager leaves, the new one must endure further close questioning.
The qualitative judgment counts most in the final assessment. The research
is sold to investment managers for up to Pounds 8,750 a year.
As yet, no version of Fund Research's work is available to the UK public
although, in the US, comparable firms such as Morningstar and Value Line
sell their findings to the affluent private investor. But there are two ways
in which British private investors can hitch a ride on the bandwagon.
They can either buy units in a trust called Portfolio Fund of Funds, which
has produced very good results by following Fund Research's recommendations
closely; or they can buy the same unit trusts as Portfolio does.
Portfolio was started, and is managed, by the one of the men who started
Fund Research: Richard Timberlake, former managing director of Fidelity UK.
In the four years to the beginning of 1994, its units had risen by 82 per
cent compared with 61 per cent for the FT-SE-A All-Share index and 24 per
cent for the Morgan Stanley Capital International world index. And, in the
second half of 1993, the units rose by 29 per cent compared with 19 per cent
for the FT-SE-A All Share.
The managers point out that, over the same four-year period, their fund did
better than any of the other 20 funds of funds - that is, unit trusts which
invest in other trusts rather than directly in shares. The average return on
a Pounds 100 investment was Pounds 135 compared with Pounds 178 from
Portfolio.
Timberlake and his associates are notorious for driving a hard bargain on
charges with the managers of the funds in which they invest. The initial
charge on their fund is 5 per cent for investments up to Pounds 4,999, with
lower rates on larger sums. The annual charge is 1 per cent and the minimum
investment Pounds 1,000.
As yet, Portfolio Fund of Funds is a minnow, worth only Pounds 2.5m with
some 150 unit-holders. But the managers are planning to produce an emerging
markets fund run on the same principles.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Flush funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within the past six months, three new investment trusts pulled in about
Pounds 1.5bn of investors' money between them: the Mercury World Mining fund
(December 1993, Pounds 426m); Kleinwort European Privatisations (February
1994, Pounds 500m); and Mercury European Privatisations (March 1994, Pounds
575m), writes Bethan Hutton.
With such enormous sums to dispose of, it is perhaps no surprise that the
managers of the funds continue to hold large amounts of cash.
Kleinwort European has been quicker than most to invest its money but, as
its shares were issued half-paid, there was less to start with. It will
receive another inflow in August. About 90 per cent of the first tranche is
invested, mostly directly in equities.
Mercury European fund is 40 per cent in cash - but that is not because of
any difficulty investing the money. It is deliberate policy based on the
manager's view of the market, and appears to be working so far: the net
asset value per share has grown from 95.5p to 97.52p, while markets have
fallen. Of the money invested, about a third is in futures rather than
shares.
The Mercury Mining fund is now about 80 per cent invested. The process has
been slow in this case because the fund's aim is not to buy the larger, more
liquid mining shares but, instead, to seek much smaller stocks.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Flow slows to a trickle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a hectic start to the year, the flow of new issues by investment and
unit trusts has slowed to a trickle, although this could be viewed as a
return to normal following a period of unprecedented activity, writes Bethan
Hutton.
The amount of money raised by investment trust new issues in the first few
months of 1994 has already outpaced the amount raised in the whole of 1993 -
Pounds 2.2bn, compared to Pounds 1.5bn. But most of the 1994 total was
pulled in during January and February before a rise in US interest rates
triggered falls in world stock markets.
Since then investors have been noticeably more reluctant to put more money
into equities, while fund managers are finding it harder to raise new money.
Another reason for the slowdown is the passing of the Pep deadline for the
1993-94 tax year. Investors often wait until close to that before using up
their allowances, so many fund managers time their offerings for the last
few months of the tax year.
It is logical, therefore, that the majority of recent new trusts are
non-Pepable, focusing mostly on the Far East and emerging markets elsewhere.
Japan is now the area drawing the most attention.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Investor complaints fall - But Norma
Cohen finds cause for worry in ombudsman's report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For private investors, the report of the investment ombudsman, Richard
Youard, this week is cause for both confidence and worry.
For confidence, read the statistics. The number of cases handled by his
office - which deals with complaints against money managers - fell by 29 per
cent in the 1993/94 year to 73. Better yet, according to Youard, there was a
marked decrease in the number of 'vehement comments' once a decision was
reached and the case settled.
But the report does point to some worrying trends for private investors and
suggests that, on balance, there is great danger in allowing reasonable
standards of vigilance to lapse.
Youard himself argues against too much vigilance by investors; taping every
conversation with an adviser is probably going too far, he says.
Nevertheless, he recalls the story of one investor who took the precaution
of placing a tape recorder behind the sofa. When the sales agent was
confronted with the tape, 'he admitted that he actually did not realise that
share prices could go down as well as up'.
Youard notes that one particular area of growing concern is the 'income from
capital' product where investors may not understand that their initial
capital investment is being depleted in order to provide a regular monthly
income.
'It is clear from the cases we have seen that investors instinctively assume
that if the money they receive is described as 'income', it is not coming
from capital or, at the very least, will in no way give rise to a reduction
in their original capital,' the report says. 'In fact, this is far from the
case in many of the schemes which have been adopted, and new schemes emerge
every year.'
Youard points also to two areas where investors' interests may be damaged
even though they remain unaware of it.
One was the propensity of some investment managers to place clients in their
own unit trusts, even when those were performing poorly compared with rival
funds. 'We have found a pretty cavalier attitude in some organisations about
the choice of unit trusts,' he says, singling out banks as the main culprits
in this area.
A second was the unit trust manager who, after launching a new product,
decided investor interest had been too little and that the vehicle should be
altered or scrapped. In such cases, says Youard, investors should not have
to bear the charges associated with selecting and buying a replacement.
Overall, Youard believes the IO scheme is working well. But with the new
Personal Investment Authority soon to start work - along with its own
ombudsman scheme - some investors may be worse off. While the IO can award
compensation of up to Pounds 100,000, the PIA claims will have a Pounds
50,000 ceiling.
For the retired shopkeeper who puts the proceeds of selling his business
into a single, wrong investment, Pounds 50,000 is probably too low a
ceiling. 'These people will not have the liquid resources to fight their
claims through the courts,' Youard notes.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Counting the cost - John Pitt on the
downturn in emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the rewards reaped by investors in emerging markets in 1993 has come
the reckoning in 1994. Some of last year's best-performing markets  - such
as Turkey, the Philippines and Brazil - have shown a darker side after being
hit by negative news, both at home and abroad.
The most significant contributor to the downturn was the first round of US
interest rate increases in February. With many Asian and Latin American
economies linked to the US dollar and interest rates, it was not long before
foreign investors moved out of equities in a big way.
While the correction might have unnerved some investors, it has been seen as
necessary and healthy by a number of commentators who feel that the growth
in emerging markets over the past few years has been overdone.
But the latest lift in US rates last Tuesday - the fourth this year - is not
necessarily seen as posing the same threat as the previous increases;
indeed, some say it might help to trigger an upturn.
The Hong Kong equity market, for example, rallied nearly 5 per cent the day
after the announcement.
Michael Hughes of BZW argues that if you accept the Fed will not move again
on interest rates for the foreseeable future, and if you believe that the
economic growth cycle has probably peaked in the US, then the prospect for
the emerging markets does not appear so bleak.
In fact, he says, a case can be made for building up weightings again,
particularly after taking into account that the strong rally in Europe
during the first months of the year might also be approaching its end.
Of the Asian markets, Hughes especially favours Indonesia, Thailand and
Taiwan, which have all remained relatively stable during the course of this
year.
Elizabeth Morrissey of Kleiman International Consultants, an independent
monitoring group based in Washington, points out that emerging markets
became over-heated during 1993.
'A touch of reality this year has been good, since many of these markets
were simply over-priced,' she says. 'The slowdown in investment certainly
occurred in the first quarter, but things are now back to relatively normal
levels.'
Indications are that the flow of funds into emerging markets will be well
down on the estimated Dollars 50bn that went in last year; but Barings
Securities, which collates such data, expects a better performance in the
second half of the year.
Whatever the longer term forecasts, domestic factors are likely to provide a
continuing damper on performance in some of this year's weakest markets.
Foreign investors in Turkey, for instance, have seen a 218 per cent gain in
dollar terms during 1993 turn into a loss of 66 per cent during the first
five months of this year.
This sharp reversal was triggered by a downgrading of the country's foreign
debt rating, before accelerating as the Turkish lira came under fierce
pressure on the money markets.
To make matters worse, Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist and
an influential commentator on emerging markets, this week cut his exposure
to Turkey in half.
According to Biggs, while the Turkish government's economic stabilisation
package - which plans to cut the nation's fiscal deficit in half - is on the
right track, it faces tremendous opposition in the country at large.
Another worry on the horizon is China's fledgling financial markets, which
have provoked a rash of optimistic - some would say over-optimistic -
forecasts from financial institutions looking for new opportunities.
Morrissey is one of the many who are advising caution. She suggests that
investment here could be a 'fad that may have taken off a little too
quickly'.

Aerostructures Hamble Holdings, the aircraft components company that
occupies the site near Southampton where Sunderland flying boats were built
in the 1930s, is coming to the market with a capitalisation of Pounds 68.6m,
writes David Blackwell. Shares in the company - subject of a Pounds 47.6m
management buy-out from British Aerospace in 1990 - have been priced at
120p.
Of the 33.33m ordinary shares on offer, 20.83m will be placed firmly with
institutions by NM Rothschild. The rest will be subject to a clawback to
meet retail demand through intermediaries. The company is raising more than
Pounds 26m net of expenses to be used alongside a Pounds 10m revolving
credit facility to repay Pounds 35m of debt.
Managers have put their experience of Japanese production techniques at
Rover Group into practice at Hamble, lifting margins from 8.9 per cent to
11.3 per cent. Pro-forma, pre-tax profits for last year are put at Pounds
5.6m on turnover of Pounds 70.4m.
The company, chaired by Lord King, has in three years reduced the proportion
of its sales to BAe from 93 per cent to 78 per cent. It has broadened its
customer base, winning a big order for wing parts for the Boeing 737-700,
and the issue looks to be priced realistically given the tough competition
in the industry. The broker is Smith New Court.
Intermediate Capital Group, formed in 1989, is coming to the market via a
placing and intermediaries offer priced at 225p a share, writes Richard
Gourlay. ICG provides loans for fund management buy-outs and buy-ins,
acquisitions and development capital; and it enhances returns by receiving
warrants or a redemption premium when investments are realised.
Judging by the pricing, the company will not be assessed as an investment
trust - the Pounds 105m market capitalisation values the group at a 19 per
cent premium to net asset value. Viewed as a specialist lender, however, its
notional gross dividend of 5.5 per cent for the year to January 1994 is only
just covered by earnings from core interest income, dividends and management
fees. This is hardly comfortable cover in conventional terms, but the group
hopes to continue to realise capital gains through further sales of equity.
Cazenove and James Capel are brokers to the issue, which closes on May 26.
Denby Group, the stoneware pottery maker, has priced its placing and open
offer at 130p a share, valuing the company at Pounds 43.3m, writes Peggy
Hollinger.
With pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m forecast for the year to September 30,
the group is priced at a prospective multiple of 14 compared with about 17.5
for Portmeirion Potteries, its closes competitor. Given the recent glut of
flotations, the rating seems about right.
A final dividend of at least 1.4p and earnings of 9.2p are also forecast by
the company for this year. The notional full year dividend would have been
3.1p, with a yield of 3 per cent.
The broker is Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull and the offer closes on May
26.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: BA set to soar again - The week
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways' tradition of near break-even fourth-quarter results has
seen analysts forecasting that full-year pre-tax profits will be about
Pounds 300m, against Pounds 185m, when they are revealed on Monday. But the
tone of the statement could be more important than the headline profit.
The stock has been weak since lower-than-expected growth in traffic figures
for April, and there are concerns about BA's troubled associate, USAir. The
dividend is expected to be in the region of 11p.
Thorn EMI, the music, rentals and electronics group, reports full-year
results on Tuesday, with pre-tax profits expected to be between Pounds 330m
and Pounds 340m, compared with Pounds 286.3m last time - although the 1992-3
figure is expected to be adjusted to take account of FRS 4. Pressure on
margins has caused analysts to lower slightly their profit forecasts for
BET, the business services group which reports annual results on Tuesday.
They now expect pre-tax profits of Pounds 90m, compared with the previous
loss of Pounds 9.8m.
John Clark, the chief executive, has completed his three-year programme of
restructuring and disposals after the group overstretched itself during the
1980s. Having eliminated Pounds 1bn of debt in the process, the City will
want to know where Clark thinks future growth lies.
Marks and Spencer is expected on Tuesday to extend its lead as the UK's most
profitable retailer, with an increase of more than 17 per cent in full-year
pre-tax figures from Pounds 736.5m to Pounds 865m. The tough conditions in
the grocery market and new depreciation policies are likely to be reflected
on Wednesday in a fall in full-year pre-tax profits at Argyll, the UK's
third-largest grocery retailer. The consensus forecast among analysts is
about Pounds 365m - down from Pounds 417m - after a new Pounds 40m
depreciation charge following the group's decision to start writing down its
superstores.
The extent of the recovery in commercial property values will be underlined
on Wednesday when Land Securities, the UK's largest quoted property company,
reports its final results. After three years of steeply falling net asset
values, the company's nav for the year to March is expected to rise from
Pounds 5.04 a share to a figure in the range of Pounds 6.30-Pounds 6.60.
Pre-tax profits are likely to remain static at around Pounds 233m.
Serious watchers of Carlton Communications, the broadcasting and television
services group, are plumping for pre-tax results between Pounds 65m and
Pounds 70m in the half-year, compared with Pounds 55m last time. Analysts
are forecasting pre-tax profits for UK telecommunications group Cable &amp;
Wireless in the region of Pounds 1.05bn, a 27 per cent increase on last year
(Pounds 824m). That would give earnings per share of 22.6p, a 16 per cent
increase on last year (19.4p). However, better-than-expected results
announced last Thursday at Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest business, might
make that view somewhat pessimistic. It reported turnover 12 per cent up at
HKDollars 24.3bn.
When Trafalgar House announces interim results on Thursday, analysts will be
expecting a marginal decline in its operating performance but no more
provisions. There is a range of pre-tax profit forecasts from Pounds 25m to
Pounds 38m, comparing favourably with last year's Pounds 97.6m loss.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The creeping inertia by directors in terms of their dealings has led us to
check back to the same time last year. The story was very much the same
then: one-third of the sales were option-related and the buys were very low
key.
This time last year Robert Gavron, the chairman of St Ives, a security
printing firm, sold more than 2m shares at 317p. Following the announcement
of interim results this year, he has sold 420,000 shares at 359p. But Gavron
retains more than 6.5m. In February 1994, Upton and Southern announced the
terms of its acquisition of The Reject Shop. The firm's management has
proven ability in turning round difficult retailing situations and it is
expected to apply that magic touch to its new buy.
When the acquisition was made, part of the consideration was in cash and the
rest in shares. The sale recorded this week was by Anna Vinton, formerly
joint chairman of The Reject Shop, at 34p. She still holds more than 2.3m
shares in Upton and Southern.
Sage Software is one of the best-known names in accounting packages and the
group's share price has performed strongly over the past two years. Interim
results end-April reflected a return to larger margins and the recent
expansion programme into Europe. The sale by Michael Jackson, the
non-executive deputy chairman, and Kevin Howe leaves each director with
considerable stakes.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets: Equities fail to respond to good news - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having raised expectations of the positive effects of a tightening of US
interest rates, the City appeared rather underwhelmed when the Fed obliged
by lifting its short-term rates by the full half-point which the markets had
sought.
One reason was that the continuing weakness of the dollar will postpone the
arrival of stability in global bond markets, which seems a necessary
condition for a significant advance by equities.
News that average earnings growth had risen to 4 per cent last month also
killed any lingering hopes of an early cut in UK interest rates, even
although the increase from the previous month's level of 3.75 per cent
largely reflected bonuses and overtime payments.
However, most of the week's economic indicators were positive. Unemployment
fell last month to 2.68m, its lowest level for two years, and the underlying
rate of growth in retail prices also came down unexpectedly, from 2.4 per
cent in March to 2.3 per cent.
Consumers appear to have coped - so far - with the impact of last month's
tax increases. Barclaycard said spending had begun to rise again following a
slight drop when customers received their pay packets last month.
A rise in retail sales to 4.4 per cent, year on year, also suggested that
consumer spending was proving robust, although analysts cautioned that it
would be summer before the real impact of the tax increases was clear.
A longer-term concern was highlighted by news that the ratio of savings to
gross domestic product last year fell to the lowest level since the second
world war - putting the UK at the bottom of the 24-nation OECD league for
national saving ratios.
Although the level of private sector savings has been increasing recently,
this has been more than offset by the sharp deterioration of public sector
finances. Robert Fleming Securities warns that this debt level is likely to
undermine hopes for an investment-led recovery. The stockbroker says it is
complacent to assume that the UK can run a perennial current account
deficit, increasingly financed by bank borrowing from overseas.
'Such money flows are notoriously fickle . . . Competition for variable
short-term funds depends critically on currency expectations. This
inter-relationship between exchange-rates and short-term interest rates
could easily turn the tide of short-term UK base rates, even though
inflation remains low.'
The results front was generally upbeat, with BOC, the industrial gases and
healthcare group, reporting that economic recovery in the US and Australia
had boosted sales.
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, gave the market a surprise by
raising its interim dividend, from 2.85p to 3p. Lord Hanson, chairman, said
'our return to profit growth at the operating level is now established.'
While some analysts welcomed this demonstration of confidence, others
fretted that the group was further stretching its already low dividend
cover. Some suspect that Hanson is anxious to push up its share price, to
fund new acquisitions.
Hanson's dividend generosity was put into perspective, however, by National
Power, the UK's biggest electricity generator, which raised its pay-out by a
hefty 18 per cent. In spite of a sharp decline in its market share, National
Power said the recent cap on prices in the electricity pool would not be
material.
A less blase view of regulatory pressures came from British
Telecommunications, which saw its annual operating profits increase by less
than 3 per cent, in spite of a 6 per cent increase in inland call volumes.
Turnover rose only 1.9 per cent because BT was obliged last year and this to
cut its prices by 7.5 per cent, after allowing for inflation.
Concern over regulatory pressure and competition meant BT's share price had
declined by nearly 20 per cent against the FT-A All-Share index over the
last year. The shares closed 16 1/2 p higher on the week, as the market
concluded these fears may have been overdone.
Growing regulatory pressure and competition led to a drop in British Gas's
first-quarter profits, from Pounds 650m to Pounds 634m. Richard Giordano,
chairman, warned again that full-year profits were likely to be below 1993
and said uncertainty over the regulatory environment made it inappropriate
to comment on dividend prospects.
The brewers' reporting season continued with Whitbread managing to increase
pre-tax profits by 32 per cent. Lower beer sales were offset by a strong
performance from its pub food, restaurant and leisure operations.
Bass, the UK's biggest brewer, is more exposed to the beer market and it
said the amount of beer sold through Bass Taverns fell, as did the group's
brewing volume. However, the group also benefited from increased sales of
food and a profits recovery in the Holiday Inn hotel chain.
Gains in spirits and retailing helped Allied-Lyons to offset a weak
performance by the Carlsberg-Tetley brewing joint venture, formed in 1992.
One spirit did particularly well: there was a 25 per cent increase in sales
of Beefeater Gin, which the group has kept at its full strength of 40 per
cent alcohol by volume - in spite of a decision by most other gin makers to
reduce the strength of their domestic gin to 37.5 per cent, saving 34p a
bottle in excise duty.
Beefeater's market share increased last year from 5.6 per cent to 6.6 per
cent, while the share of Gordon's - the Guiness brand which is the market
leader - slipped from 48 to 47 per cent.
In days of yore brewers and publicans were sometimes suspected of watering
the workers' beer. It appears that diluting the executive's G &amp; T is no less
hazardous.

At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Money Marketing's annual survey of with-profits products shows that maturity
values of long-term policies are moving upwards, while short-term returns
continue to plummet. The highest payout on a 10 year policy (for a man aged
29 paying Pounds 35 a month) was from Royal London at Pounds 8,427, with the
Tunbridge Wells in second place, followed by Equitable Life. The lowest
payout was from Guardian, with a return of Pounds 5,786.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets: The hidden costs of high returns - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that income and capital are separated by some kind of Berlin Wall
is as outdated as the Cold War. But breaking down this traditional barrier
has created dangers as well as opportunities.
The acceptable face of financial glasnost is the concept of total return.
Today's intelligent investor targets the return produced by income and
capital growth combined: getting the best return may well mean investing in
shares with a low yield but good growth prospects. The financial
sophisticate then creams off some capital when he needs a bit of pocket
money, but would never be so irresponsible as to endanger his long term
wealth.
The unacceptable face is the pathetic picture of retired people who do not
realise that the income produced by some ultra high income products comes
out of their own capital, and only wake up when they have eaten their own
seedcorn. Investment Ombudsman, Richard Youard, whose job is to resolve
complaints from people who feel badly treated by investment managers, this
week expressed his concern about 'income from capital' products (See page V)
'It is clear from the cases we have seen that investors instinctively assume
that if the money they receive is described as 'income', it is not coming
from capital or, at the very least, will in no way give rise to a reduction
in their original capital.'
Youard is particularly critical of salesmen who fail to make clear any risk
to capital at the initial client meeting. He also deplores advertising
literature which 'requires a D. Phil and a month's work to figure out.'
The contrast between the financial sophisticate and the impoverished
pensioner is stark. But as always it is the middle area that is hardest to
deal with. Investors' hunger for products offering a high immediate income
has been answered by a flood of disparate products: annuity shares of split
level investment trusts, which leave you with only a token capital
repayment; distributor trusts, which allow you to choose your income with no
promises about maintaining the capital; and very soon income unit trusts
which boost their yield by knocking their expenses off capital rather than
income.
The Securities and Investments Board, which has overall charge of investor
protection, told unit trust managers this week that they may now knock their
annual management charges off investors' capital, rather than their income.
What this will mean in practice is that an income fund with a yield of, say
3.5 per cent now, will be able to increase it overnight to, say, 4.5 per
cent, without any change in its underlying investment strategy. It will
simply elect to knock its management charge (say, 1 per cent) off capital
and pass the whole of the income on the underlying fund on to the investor.
Some income funds plan to seize this opportunity; others do not.
Regulator Lautro is due to send fund managers guidance on the explanations
capital-charging funds will need to put in their advertisements and
promotional literature. They will, for example, need to point out that
capital may be eroded or future growth constrained, and that the tax take
could rise.
But the industry has no plans to make the differing charging practices
evident in newspaper listings. So anyone who starts looking for a high
income investment by comparing the yields of income funds quoted in a
newspaper such as the Financial Times, will come away with an imperfect
understanding of what is available. Two identical funds with different
distribution policies will appear very dissimilar, since the only statistic
commonly quoted is the yield.
No professional investor would find this satisfactory. Consider the way
share prices are presented. They are bunched into sectors because one of the
key tasks of investment analysis is to compare one company with others in
the same business.
When you look at the share price service in the Financial Times, the yield
will tell you about the current dividend policies of two retailers, and
their price earnings ratios will give a fair reflection of the underlying
profitability of both. This makes it possible for stockpickers to learn
something useful by comparing the two shares.
Surely investors looking for income funds are entitled to similar help? In
an ideal world, fund managers might be asked to provide additional
information, such as total return figures. At worst, some method of flagging
funds which take their charges out of capital seems simple but essential.
What is the annual running cost of Britain's unit and investment trust
industry? Some back of the envelope calculations came up with a figure of
Pounds 1.65bn, of which Pounds 1.4bn related to the Pounds 95bn worth of
unit trusts and Pounds 250m to the Pounds 40bn worth of investment trusts.
And what do investors get for their money? On average most funds do worse
than the market.
Here's another anomaly: the charging structure proposed by the new
Baronsmead investment trust. Most management fees are a set percentage rate
of assets. With Baronsmead, the larger its assets grow, the higher its
management percentage.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets: Hanson ends its brief freeze - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's great dividend freeze has proved just a cold snap. In December, the
Anglo-American conglomerate failed to increase its quarterly dividend for
the first time in 30 years. Last week came the thaw.
The return to dividend growth is an important signal of the company's
confidence in the future. Yet, on the surface, it is not obvious that the
world has changed that dramatically in the past six months.
Analysts estimate that this year's increased dividend payments will be
covered little more than 1.2 times by underlying earnings, barely more than
last year and scarcely comfortable.
But the recovery in the US economy, which provides 60 per cent of Hanson's
profits, is starting to show through in the group's figures. The scope for
recovery in Hanson's earnings is considerable.
Although it has a steady flow of profits from Imperial Tobacco, Hanson has
some very cyclical businesses in areas such as building materials and
chemicals which have been hit hard in the recession. It estimates that
underlying profits, which are running at about Pounds 1bn a year, are around
Pounds 1bn below the peak level represented by the previous records in each
division.
For some businesses, such as bricks in the UK, it might be argued that the
peak was an unrepeatable consequence of the boom of the late 1980s. But most
of the cyclical businesses are in the US where the peaks were achieved in
less exceptional circumstances.
A large part of the shortfall stems from Quantum Chemical, the US
polyethylene and propane group acquired last September for Pounds 2bn.
Quantum's profits were severely depressed by price erosion during the
recession. It is large enough to make a significant difference to a group
Hanson's size if it makes a decent recovery and recent evidence suggests
that such a recovery is under way. Quantum is already performing better than
Hanson expected and, more importantly, recent price rises are sticking.
Meanwhile, the expensive strike at Peabody, Hanson's US coal business, has
been settled on terms which will lead to useful cost savings and the high
borrowings which were left after the Quantum acquisition,are being whittled
away, largely by disposals such as the flotation of Beazer Homes.
After the acquisition Hanson's gearing rose to 86 per cent, but this was
down to 69 per cent by the end of March. Excluding exceptional items such as
the cost of the coal strike, the company says there was a cash inflow from
operations of Pounds 100m in the first half. Derek Bonham, chief executive,
is so confident that the debt reduction will continue at a brisk pace that
he last week said: 'We're prepared to look at acquisitions from here on.'
Yet, while the group's borrowings are coming down, its interest bill is
rising steeply. This paradox stems from the reduction in the disparity
between US and UK interest rates which allowed Hanson to make more money on
cash deposited in the UK than it paid in interest on its much larger debt in
the US. As a result, it is expecting to face an interest bill of Pounds 250m
this year, compared with income of Pounds 14m last time.
In terms of reported profits this will be offset by gains on disposals this
year but it will absorb a good part of the recovery next year.
On an underlying basis, analysts expect profits to edge up to just over
Pounds 1bn this year rising to Pounds 1.35 in the year to September 1995.
Assuming that Hanson manages to hold its tax rate to the underlying level of
28 per cent achieved this year earnings would rise to around 18p in 1994-95.
That would only cover this year's likely dividends of 11.85p just over one
and a half times. Given the cyclical nature of the businesses, and the
longer- term threats to Imperial Tobacco's profits, Hanson's prudent
approach would require cover to be built up significantly further, limiting
the scope for dividend increases.
But with the shares yielding over 5.5 per cent gross income-seeking
investors can afford to be patient.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets: The Fed tightens and sets the Dow loose - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the unseasonably wet and blustery weather which struck New York this
week, Tuesday's aggressive tightening of monetary policy by the Federal
Reserve hit Wall Street like a spray of cool rain in the face, awakening the
groggy markets with a jolt.
Not that the Fed's move was unexpected. On Tuesday morning, when the central
bank's Federal Open Market Committee began its meeting, almost everyone was
convinced that the policy-making body would vote to approve another increase
in interest rates. Yet, even though Wall Street saw it coming, the 50 basis
point rise in the federal funds rate to 4.25 per cent and the 50 basis point
increase in the discount rate to 3.5 per cent sent a surge of energy through
the markets.
Minutes after the Fed announced the tightening, a previously becalmed Dow
Jones Industrial Average and 30-year government bond were roaring ahead on a
wave of buying. By the end of the day, the Dow was up 49 points, and the
long bond had climbed two full points, a gain that lowered the yield on the
benchmark government issue from 7.44 per cent to 7.26 per cent.
To anyone familiar with traditional market economics, this might have seemed
a curious reaction. The Fed raised rates for the fourth time in as many
months because it felt monetary policy had been overly accommodating for too
long. It believed that excessively low interest rates were threatening to
provide too much stimulation to the economy, and it was worried that unless
rates were raised to slow the pace of economic activity, inflation would
begin to revive later in the year.
In these circumstances, the stock market might have been expected to react
badly to another Fed tightening. Higher interest rates mean more costly
borrowing for companies and consumers, slower economic growth and lower
corporate profits, and they make other forms of investments more attractive
than equities, so stocks usually fall when interest rates go up. As for the
Treasury market, the Fed's evident concern about the outlook for inflation
would normally alarm investors in instruments that pay a fixed rate of
return such as government securities, so a decline in bond prices would have
been expected.
These, however, were not ordinary circumstances, for two main reasons.
First, traders and investors had already priced a monetary tightening into
stock and bond prices. This discounting meant that by Tuesday morning, when
the FOMC began its meeting, the markets were primed for a rate increase. In
particular, they were expecting an increase of half a percentage point in
both the fed funds and discount rates. Anything different - a smaller rate
increase or no increase at all - and uncertainty about Fed policy would have
returned to the markets. In the end, they got exactly what they expected, so
prices rallied.
Second, the aggressive nature of the Fed's move - 50 basis points on two key
interest rates instead of 25 basis points on just one - suggested to
investors that it might be the last tightening of monetary policy for some
time. This judgment was quickly proved accurate when the Fed, maintaining
its new policy of explaining its actions, issued a statement asserting that
the rate increases would 'substantially remove the degree of monetary
accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993'. In other words, the Fed was
saying it had finished tightening for now.
This was good news for financial markets, which warmed to the prospect of a
summer free from worries about another rate increase. Moreover, among more
forward-looking investors, there was plenty of support for the Fed's
actions. Inflation is low today because special factors in the US economy,
such as rising productivity and excess labour resources, are helping to hold
down prices. These disinflationary forces will not last forever, so it makes
sense for the Fed to slow the economy down, before it becomes too late to
douse the inflation fires.
So, where does all of this leave the stock market? Its impressive
performance this week - the Dow climbed almost 100 points in the first four
days of trading to 3,760 - suggests that the corrective phase of the market
cycle, which took the blue-chip average down 9.5 per cent from its February
high, is over. A floor of 3,600 has been established, and equities are
likely to enter a phase of consolidation, in which share prices rise
gradually as investors turn their attention back to economic and earnings
fundamentals.
This assumes that the correction has also ended in the bond market. But with
the 30-year bond yield declining from 7.6 per cent to 7.3 per cent in the
past 10 days, it is a relatively safe assumption.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Is a national lottery just the ticket?: With the winner of a
national lottery licence to be announced next week, Antoin E Murphy examines
the history of an institution which has been blamed for poverty, madness,
crime and suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Lottomania is nigh. Suppressed since 1826, though variants in the form of
Premium Bonds and the pools subsequently popped up, the first fully fledged
national lottery is about to re-emerge as a potent force in British society.
Its rebirth will continue to generate debate on the morality of gambling, on
the wisdom of allowing people to win huge prizes, and on the reputation of
the government permitting its citizens to be entrapped by a scheme which Sir
William Petty in the 17th century dismissed as a tax on 'unfortunate
self-conceited fools'.
The winner of the UK's National Lottery licence is to be announced at 10am
on Wednesday and a great deal of cant, humbug and hypocrisy is going to
reappear in the newspapers and be voiced in churches and on television. The
lottery will be extolled by its promoters and the government for the good
works that it finances; it will be vilified by many adopting the strong
puritanical and paternalistic streak of opponents to the lotteries from the
16th century onwards.
It was Queen Elizabeth I who permitted the drawing of the first state
lottery in 1569. However, lotteries have a longer history than this.
The word lot is believed to come from a Teutonic root hleut meaning a pebble
that was cast to settle arguments arising over the division of property. In
Jewish history one finds accounts of selection by lots in order to determine
who would kill the survivors of sieges such as that of Massada. Christ's
clothes were drawn by lot. In Greek mythology the distribution of the world
among the gods was decided by lot, Hades losing out when drawing the
underworld.
The lottery defined in court as 'a scheme for the distribution of prizes by
lot or chance' was discovered by governments as a convenient supplementary
method of taxation, and by private merchants as an effective way of
disposing of goods that were slow to sell. The first national lottery in
Britain, drawn in 1569, consisted of 400,000 lots at 10 shillings each.
Religious ministers today, as they prepare their sermons against the
lottery, may be surprised to learn that this first national lottery was
drawn at the west door of St Paul's Cathedral, London, starting on January
11, 1569.
As every single ticket was drawn, it continued day and night until May 6.
One doubts whether Richard Branson - the favourite of the bookmakers, if not
the specialists, to be awarded the lottery concession - will be applying to
the Dean of St Paul's for similar facilities.
The profits from the lottery were used to repair harbours and ports. So
began the state's involvement in lotteries, one that would continue for 250
years.
The state was first in a long list of groups that benefited from the
lottery. At times the lottery became an essential tool of public finance.
This was the case during the final stages of the War of the Spanish
Succession when the over-burdened Exchequer, strapped for cash, tapped the
market for Pounds 1.5m (1710), Pounds 3.5m (1711), Pounds 3.6m (1712),
Pounds 0.5m (1713) and Pounds 1.4m (1714) through interest annuity
lotteries. These were very large amounts when judged against the Pounds 1.2m
that investors lent to the government in return for obtaining the privilege
of establishing the Bank of England in 1694.
Later, the lottery provided more than Pounds 70m for the war with the
American colonies. The lottery was also used by the state to finance long
term infrastructural investments such as the building of Westminster Bridge
and the establishment of the British Museum. We are still enjoying the
benefit of these 18th century lotteries.
The second grouping that benefited from the lotteries were the 'people of
quality'. As the tickets were usually priced at Pounds 10 and, at times as
high as Pounds 100, they were not within the reach of the common people. A
Pounds 10 ticket could represent the equivalent of a year's income for many,
while rich nobles purchased considerable quantities: a letter from Lord
Falmouth to Thomas Pelham requested Pounds 12,000 in lottery tickets. He was
granted Pounds 9,000 worth.
Such purchases were probably destined not to gratify mad gambling urges but
to make a profit by dividing the tickets into shares which were sold at a
premium. This system of the rich buying quantities of tickets persisted
until 1788 when the Treasury sold all tickets to lottery contractors.
Ostensibly, the high price of tickets was to preclude the poor from
participating, to keep them out of harm's way. But ingenious methods were
quickly found to permit and indeed encourage their participation. The
tickets were broken up into shares of a half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth and
then sold on at a premium to a far larger market.
As the time for the lottery approached, and high powered marketing
techniques built up a fever of excitement, the premiums for shares in
tickets could go very high. In one handbill for the lottery of 1793 it was
calculated that there were only 500,000 'persons of property' in a total
population of 10m in England and Ireland.
As there were only 50,000 tickets in this lottery there was only one tenth
of a ticket for each of the persons of property. Add on the 'middle
classes', which the writer reckoned bought 30,000 tickets, and his
conclusion was easy to proclaim: 'Can we possibly doubt that tickets this
year will be at least 18 guineas?'
At this price the tickets were selling at a premium of 89 per cent
indicating that there was a lottery within the lottery for those lucky
enough to obtain large quantities of lottery tickets.
Responsibility for generating excitement lay with the stockbrokers and
lottery contractors. Stockbroking and lottery contracting went hand in hand,
led by such stockbrokers as Bish, Carroll, Martin, and Webb. Modern day
stockbrokers may be surprised to learn that their predecessors made a handy
living out of selling numbers.
While the government, the rich nobility and the stockbrokers/lottery
contractors were the prime beneficiaries of the lottery it also spawned a
sizeable underground bookmaking industry in what was known as 'insurance'.
This practice started in the 1740s and was known initially as 'riding a
horse in the lottery'. For a fee an individual could hire a ticket in the
lottery for one of the days during the drawing of the lottery. If the ticket
was drawn on that particular day the individual was entitled to the prize
once he paid for the ticket. As the drawing of each lottery was a very long
drawn-out process lasting 42 days (later, legislation of 1802 reduced the
drawing period to eight days) there was enormous scope for betting on the
numbers through 'insurance'.
It took so long to conduct the draw because every ticket was drawn. The
print for a drawing of the State Lottery in 1763 shows a boy from the
Bluegate school drawing a ticket from one wheel and another boy drawing
either a prize or a blank from the other wheel.
The commissioners then had to examine each drawn ticket and its
corresponding prize/blank and register them in a book. It was a
time-consuming process.
It has been estimated that the betting on 'insurance' was as great as the
amount wagered on the lottery itself.
At its height there were more than 2,000 agents offering 'insurance' and
they employed 7,500 commission agents, known as the Morocco men, to extend
their business.
A variant on this has developed in the current Irish lottery with bookmakers
offering 4/1 against a punter nominating one of the seven numbers drawn,
28/1 on nominating any two numbers and 12,500/1 on nominating any five
numbers drawn.
To clamp down on 'insurance' the government declared it illegal and offered
rewards to informers. This in turn spawned a further industry as fraudulent
charges were laid against innocent people of setting up 'insurance' schemes
by extortionists looking for rewards in order to drop their fictitious
charges.
The beneficiaries did not end there. An incipient advertising and marketing
industry was developing to extol the merits of the lottery. The artwork used
in producing posters and hand bills became increasingly more sophisticated
as they urged people to participate in lotteries with prizes of up to Pounds
20,000, freehold property in the city lotteries, and pipes of port.
Many dreamed of winning the lottery. One footman put his thoughts to paper
as to how he would spend his winnings: 'As soon as I have received the
money, I will marry Grace Towers; but, as she has been cross and coy, I will
use her as a servant.
'Every morning she shall get me a mug of strong beer, with a toast, nutmeg,
and sugar in it; then I will sleep till 10, after which I will have a large
sack posset. My dinner shall be on table by one, and never without a good
pudding. I will have a stock of wine and brandy laid in. About five in the
afternoon I will have tarts and jellies, and a gallon bowl of punch; at 10 a
hot supper of two dishes.
'If I am in good humour and Grace behaves herself, she shall sit down with
me. To bed about 12.'
He did not win the lottery and having invested his life savings of 20 years
in acquiring two lottery tickets he committed suicide on discovering that
they had drawn blanks.
He was not the only lottery suicide. In 1787 a young gentleman shot himself
after cursing 'the head that planned, and the heart that executed, the
baneful, destructive plan of a lottery'.
The greatest 18th century lottery contractor must have been Thomas Bish, a
man with a natural flair for publicity. Born in 1779, Bish attained a
dominant position as a lottery contractor very young, probably through a
brilliant series of creative advertisements which convinced ordinary people
that there was only one place to buy lottery tickets and that was at Thomas
Bish of 4 Cornhill, or 9 Charing Cross.
Bish was the first to offer wines and port as extra sweeteners for lottery
participants. He also had his publicity posters translated into Welsh in
order to encourage the men and women from the valleys to participate in the
lottery on St David's Day, March 1, 1817.
Many commentators have credited the demise of the lottery to the public
opinion whipped up against it by its opponents including such distinguished
economists as Henry Thornton and David Ricardo.
Was pre-Victorian Britain becoming prudish about the lottery? This seemed to
be the growing perception judging by a parliamentary report of 1808 which
stated that as a result of the lottery 'idleness, dissipation and and
poverty were increased; the most sacred and confidential trusts were
betrayed, domestic comfort was destroyed, madness was often created, suicide
itself was produced, and crimes subjecting the perpetrators to death were
committed'.
There had always been a strong literary tradition against the lottery and
this by itself would not have been sufficient to force the government to
abandon the lottery. More importantly, as James Raven has recently shown in
The Historical Journal (1991), the net profit to the government from the
lottery had started to dwindle so that by 1819 it was contributing less than
one per cent to the ways and means income of the government.
This contribution deteriorated further between 1820 and 1822 due no doubt to
the economic slump of those years. Thus, when the decision was taken to
abolish lotteries in May 1823 the system had lost its zest and was
contributing little to the Exchequer.
The difficulties of selling tickets for the final lottery of 1826, as
evidenced by postponements of the draw in order to sell off surplus tickets,
shows the extent to which it had declined.
In spite of abolition in 1826, (the last one, in fact, was the Glasgow
lottery of 1831) the spirit of the lottery never died. It continued
initially in newspaper competitions where readers were asked to find a
missing word in a text; and it was practically resurrected with the
establishment of the pools.
Entering then pools is deemed not to be participating in a game of chance
but a game of skill and as such is not a lottery.
De facto, if not de jure, Harold Macmillan reinstated the lottery with the
establishment of premium bonds in 1956. Macmillan denied that the scheme was
a lottery while Harold Wilson described it as a 'squalid raffle'.
Most fascinating was that the scheme was almost a replica of the interest
annuity lotteries of the early 18th centuries.
The lottery has been in a semi-torpor since 1826. It has now been fully
re-awakened. Whether it is to be judged as an awakening Snow White or
Frankenstein depends on your judgment.
One way or another, the numbers game is back in town.

FT  21 MAY 94 / The Long View: Gilts regain an edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Curious statistic number one: the gilt-edged market turned over Pounds 6.7bn
on average every working day of the last financial year. The Pounds
160bn-worth of UK government securities are held on average for only a few
weeks before being churned. Investors in HM Government do not take a
long-term view.
There are teasing numbers galore in the Bank of England's annual review of
the gilt market, a new publication which is part of the Bank's campaign to
market the UK's suspect paper into a fickle global market for government
bonds. In the 1993-94 financial year, the sales drive was heroically
successful, a net Pounds 49bn of gilt-edged securities being unloaded - and
at rapidly declining interest rates until February this year.
But the reliance on foreign investors left the gilt-edged market vulnerable
to sudden changes in sentiment. Last year, the wide spread between the
yields on gilts and on better-fancied government bonds, such as German bunds
and US Treasuries, narrowed sharply.
Then, the gap opened up quickly once more in the first quarter of 1994 when
the market collapsed. This is a typical phenomenon as bull markets turn
sour: investors retreat to their core investments and the differentials for
risk widen out again.
Nevertheless, foreigners mopped up Pounds 17.5bn of gilts in the financial
year, out of the total net issue of Pounds 49bn. Domestic non-bank buyers
absorbed only slightly more, at Pounds 23.5bn.
Curious statistic number two: on February 24, a record 235,000 gilt futures
contracts, worth some Pounds 12bn, were traded. The underlying foreign
buying might have been even larger than reported, given the volume of
futures activity.
Overseas purchases tailed away in the troubled January-March quarter but did
not turn into net selling. The Bank estimates that foreigners now own 23 per
cent of all the gilts on issue.
Coming right up to date, the gilt market has had a couple of good weeks,
helped by the recovery in the US Treasury bond market. Investors have
realised that a yield of 8.5 per cent on long gilts was unreasonably out of
line with 3.7 per cent on equities; in the event, the gilt yield has come
down rather than the equity yield gone up.
The Bank, however, is facing a tougher challenge this year. The Pounds 2bn
auction next Wednesday, for instance, involves not a straightforward gilt
but a convertible - a three-year maturity switchable to 18 years - showing
how the Bank is having to duck and weave in order to hold down its funding
costs.
Past sins have to be paid for. Over the past 10 years, sterling has
depreciated by on average 4 percentage points a year against the D-Mark and
7 points against the yen. Ten-year gilts now yield 1 1/2 per cent more than
bunds and 4 1/4 per cent more than Japanese government bonds which, on the
historical evidence, is rather charitable.
The government, however, is now proposing to hold inflation at 2 1/2 per
cent or less, against 5 per cent on average since 1984. You can laugh if you
like, but it puts the Bank in an embarrassing position when it has to sell
bonds yielding over 8 per cent, because the implied real interest rate is
over 5 per cent.
It has responded by confining its offerings to fairly short-dated paper on
the view that, eventually, the debt can be re-financed much more cheaply.
If things go wrong, though, that could create a re-financing crisis in a few
years.
In fact, it can be argued that the problem is not a temporary one but an
enduring consequence of a declining rate of savings in the UK - not in the
personal sector but the economy as a whole, where the deficit of the public
sector is eating up private savings. A timely study from the securities firm
Robert Fleming this week showed that the UK is right at the bottom of the
international savings league table.
Instead of selling to foreigners, the Bank could market government
securities more aggressively to domestic buyers. Why, for instance, is it
aiming to raise only Pounds 3 1/2 bn through National Savings? Presumably,
because a tougher campaign would damage the building societies, which are
already suffering a net drain of retail deposits.
Its softest target must be the Pounds 400bn occupational pension funds,
which are the biggest domestic institutions but own only 15 per cent of the
gilts in issue. At the beginning of the 1980s, they had 25 per cent of their
assets in gilts; now, they have only 6 per cent.
They could be offered specially-tailored gilts to match their pension
liabilities, and they could easily be buyers of Pounds 50bn of gilts over
two or three years. But they would have to sell equivalent quantities of
equities, which would devastate the stock market. There are just not enough
savings to go round.
Judging, however, by the way Treasury minister Stephen Dorrell is shaping up
with his review of savings and investment flows, an official attack on
'excessive' dividend payments and a tax-based diversion of institutional
funds from equities to bonds is visible on the horizon.
At the very least, the Treasury might consider levelling the tax playing
field for private investors buying gilts. Even with official headline
inflation at an historically modest 2.6 per cent, a higher-rate taxpayer is
liable to an effective tax charge of 59 per cent on real income from gilts:
it might be better, in the long run, to buy German bunds and expect some
profits on the exchange rate.
Not-so-curious statistic number three: the Pounds 23bn fall in the Bank's
provisional gilt sales target to Pounds 26bn net this financial year - a
bigger change than the Pounds 17.5bn sales to overseas investors last time -
implies that the Bank might get by without any foreign sales at all.
Given that the hedge funds have dumped gilts and moved merrily on to trade
in copper and cocoa futures, perhaps that is just as well.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Role of investor watchdog splits Commons committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cross-party Commons Treasury committee is so split over the role of the
planned watchdog to protect private investors in the UK that it may miss the
opportunity to influence its setting-up.
The MPs had hoped to agree, in the next few weeks, an interim report on the
Personal Investment Authority, which is due to become operational in
mid-July.
They have been taking evidence about the new watchdog as part of a longer
term inquiry into financial regulation.
But divisions between committee members seem so deep that a unanimous report
looks unlikely, and MPs doubt the value of publishing recommendations which
do not have full support.
Labour MPs believe the arrangements for the PIA have caused the watchdog to
lose credibility in the City and want to recommend a fresh regulatory
structure along the lines of the US Securities Exchange Commission. The
committee's Tory majority, however, supports the Treasury view that the
regulator must be given time to work, irrespective of the 'battering' it has
received from companies which are due to come under its wing.
The PIA is intended to be the single watchdog for private investors,
replacing the existing, more complex regulatory structure. It has been
criticised by many in the financial services industry but there is no
consensus about whether there should be full-blown statutory regulation or
whether the industry should regulate itself.
Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has said it will not join the
organisation and other large institutions have expressed serious doubts
about joining.
Mr John Watts, the committee's Conservative chairman, has called its members
to a final session on Monday to try to resolve the differences. This follows
a private meeting on Wednesday which broke up in disagreement.
Tory members are willing to consider some changes to the PIA if the report
gives it conditional support. The changes might include more independence in
the system for appointing public interest directors to the regulator's
board, and closer scrutiny of the watchdog's work. This could involve the
PIA reporting to the cross-party committee.
However, one of the Labour MPs said: 'It has become clear to us over the
last few months that the PIA is dead on arrival. If the Tories cannot accept
that then there will be no report.'
The government is determined not to introduce fresh regulatory legislation,
so ministers would be embarrassed by a critical report which they believe
could damage investor protection by undermining the new regulator.
Divisions have been apparent during some sessions, with a number of Tory MPs
distancing themselves from attacks on Mr Joe Palmer, the PIA chairman, by Mr
Brian Sedgemore, a Labour committee member, about regulatory failings at
Legal &amp; General where Mr Palmer was formerly chief executive.

FT  21 MAY 94 / British Gas may float business and home supply arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas is considering floating its trading business, responsible for
supplying gas to domestic and business customers, in an apparent U-turn on
evidence it gave to last year's Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry
into the gas industry.
Both the Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgas, the industry regulator,
have been informed of British Gas's plans, which would take more than a year
to complete.
The company is likely to give current British Gas shareholders shares in the
new separate trading company rather than sell it off.
The move comes as British Gas prepares to face competition in the domestic
gas market. From April 1996 the entire non-household market will be opened
up. At the same time 5 per cent of the household market will be opened to
new suppliers, followed 12 months later by another 5 per cent tranche.
Volume limits will be removed entirely in April 1998 if Ofgas is satisfied
with progress.
The MMC's report on the gas industry, published last August, recommended the
enforced breaking off of British Gas's trading arm from its transportation
assets, against the company's wishes.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, rejected the MMC's
proposal, recommending instead full internal separation of the trading arm
from transportation.
British Gas's trading arm was recently split into two parts - public gas
supply and contract trading - with combined annual turnover of more than
Pounds 8bn.
British Gas now appears to have altered its view, believing that flotation
sooner rather than later would maximise shareholder value.
Mr Peter Spring, an analyst with brokers Henderson Crosthwaite, said: 'If
you are a monopolist you only have one way to go when competition is
introduced. Splitting off trading may help shake the operation up and
prepare it for the onslaught from independent gas companies.'
The company said: 'The restructuring of the company into five units is
proceeding so that they have their own profit centres and accounts.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Mandarin takes the job of putting on tea at the Ritz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday, 88 years after it first opened its doors, the Ritz will acquire
new managers from Hong Kong in the shape of the Mandarin Oriental hotel
group.
Mandarin will not say what it wants to do with the hotel until after it
moves in next week but surprises are unlikely.
Afternoon tea at the Ritz will almost certainly retain its resolutely
English flavour. The hotel therefore looks set to remain a London icon,
along with others in Piccadilly such as the Royal Academy and Fortnum &amp;
Mason.
Trafalgar House, the shipping and industrial group which acquired the hotel
in 1976, had been hoping to sell the Ritz, but was unable to find a buyer.
It will continue to own the property, while Mandarin Oriental, which
operates hotels in Asia and San Francisco, manages it.
Trafalgar House and Mandarin Oriental have the same chairman, Mr Simon
Keswick. Jardine Matheson, which controls Mandarin Oriental, is Trafalgar's
largest shareholder.
Mr Brian Williams, who takes over as the Ritz's general manager, is British.
He is currently general manager of the Mandarin Oriental in Macau.
The Ritz has always been a cosmopolitan establishment. It was built to the
specifications of Cesar Ritz, the Swiss hotelier. He had retired by the time
it opened in 1906, but he graciously described it as 'a small house to which
I am proud to have my name attached.'
The interior is in the style of Louis XVI. Its ground floor arcade was
designed to remind visitors of the Rue de Rivoli in Paris.
Sir Nigel Broackes, former chairman of Trafalgar House, first had an inkling
he would buy the Ritz after he found a pearl in his oyster while lunching
there.
'I am a faintly superstitious person,' Sir Nigel said in his autobiography.
Two months later, Edward Erdman, the estate agent, asked him whether he
wanted to buy the hotel.
Mandarin Oriental yesterday pledged itself 'to continue the high standards
of service and the traditions for which the Ritz is renowned'.
Staff will be hoping that the new managers begin in more generous fashion
than the old ones. Sir Nigel recounts that when Trafalgar House took over,
it told the staff there was no money for a pay rise, but they could each
have a new suit instead.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Tories kill disabled bill amid Commons disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A backbench bill banning discrimination against the disabled was killed amid
farcical scenes in the Commons yesterday, as ministers fought off a
procedural ambush by opposition MPs.
The parliamentary wrangling ended all hope of further progress for the Civil
Rights (Disabled Persons) bill, which ministers say would have cost industry
Pounds 17bn.
But the outcome looked like a pyrrhic victory for the government, with all
the hallmarks of a public relations disaster.
The first casualty could be Mr Nicholas Scott, minister for the disabled,
who appeared deeply uneasy as he mounted a lone filibuster against the bill.
Mr Scott has already come under pressure to resign after being forced to
apologise for misleading MPs by denying that the government had drafted
amendments for Tory backbenchers.
In a further embarrassment for Mr Scott, his humiliation at the despatch box
was watched by his daughter Victoria, a campaigner for the disabled, who was
assisting opposition MPs.
'I think it is time we had a minister for disabled people who represented
the needs of disabled people,' a deeply upset Miss Scott said afterwards.
The wrangling began yesterday, when Mr Roger Berry, Labour MP for Kingswood,
the bill's sponsor, accepted more than 80 amendments tabled by Tory MPs
attempting to use up the bill's parliamentary time.
The bill's supporters, who included a handful of Tories, thought Mr Berry's
manoeuvre would allow rapid progress towards a final vote on the principle
of the bill.
But as Mr Scott struggled to keep the debate going, government whips spotted
that the House was inquorate - mainly because many Labour MPs were in
Edinburgh for the funeral of Mr John Smith, the late party leader.
A government MP called for a vote to close the debate, a device usually used
by supporters of a bill trying to stop a filibuster.
The vote was carried by 28 votes to one - 11 votes short of the quorum of 40
 -obliging the deputy speaker to push the bill to the bottom of a long list
of bills queueing for time.
Angry opposition MPs claimed that there were at least 12 Conservative MPs in
the Commons whose votes would have saved the bill, even if cast against the
closure.
'Millions of people outside this place will be disgusted at what they've
seen take place here today. We have seen the minister quite cynically talk
this Bill out,' Mr Berry said.
As if to prove it was not a great day for parliamentary democracy, the
government also blocked a backbench bill to reform treasure trove law,
apparently by mistake.
A government whip cried 'object' when the Treasure Bill's title was read -
the traditional way of blocking such legislation. Mr Patrick Cormack, the
Conservative sponsor, said the whip had 'got himself into a bit of
confusion'. It was that sort of day.

FT  21 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that substandard Lucas gearboxes have forced US Navy jets to make
scores of emergency landings look wide of the mark. Even so, the company's
embarrassment from the alleged use of non-conforming materials by its Lucas
Western subsidiary in Pentagon contracts is acute. The allegations follow
Lucas' admission earlier this week that AUL, another US subsidiary,
falsified test results on other kit supplied to the US military.
The direct financial damage from the affair - a fine expected to be Dollars
25m or so - is not huge. Moreover, it looks unlikely that Lucas Western will
be debarred from supplying the Navy. It is the Navy's sole supplier of
gearboxes and would be expensive to replace. In fact, the company started
providing the same equipment again only yesterday, following a suspension
which has lasted since July. Nevertheless, with a dented reputation, Lucas
could well find it harder to win future contracts from the US defence
forces.
The affair appears to reflect sloppy management at the US subsidiary and
inadequate control from the centre. Fortunately, the new management  - led
by Mr George Simpson, the highly regarded chief executive - is not tainted
by the failure to exert quality control. It has also acted swiftly to
replace management at Lucas Western and put in place a compliance regime
designed to satisfy the US that similar problems will not recur. The betting
must be that Lucas' current embarrassment will be only temporary.

FT  21 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Signet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Signet has made great strides to escape from its lurid past. The Ratners
name will soon disappear from UK high streets. The provision against
Salisburys suggests the loss-making luggage chain will soon be sold. Having
spent 1992 cutting costs and squeezing cash out of the business, Signet's
management last year delivered growth. A modest increase in sales from UK
stores is encouraging. Sales growth of 11 per cent in the US, which accounts
for more than half the group's business, is a taste of what might be
achieved if UK recovery continues.
The snag is that the Ratner legacy lingers in the balance sheet. Suspended
payments on US preference shares are accumulating at around Pounds 30m a
year. Ordinary shareholders will not see a dividend until the backlog has
been cleared. Repaying the prefs in full would now cost Pounds 380m. Since
Signet had Pounds 360m bank borrowings at the year end, replacing preference
capital with debt is hardly an option. Cash flow is not yet strong enough to
help, so additional equity will probably be required.
Yet it is difficult to judge how far ordinary shareholders face dilution.
There is no deadline for repayment of the prefs. Mr James McAdam, Signet's
chief executive, might fancy his chances of striking a deal with the holders
of that paper. If the trading recovery continues, the company's hand will be
further strengthened. While the recovery in the shares so far has been a
testament to Mr McAdam's skill as a retailer, further progress depends on
his ability as a banker.

FT  21 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise of a mere 8 points in the FT-SE 100 index over the past week says
it all. The market is uncertain how to respond to a period in which the US
raised interest rates by a full half point, while UK economic data showed
consumer spending surviving the tax cuts, but an unsettling rise in average
earnings and a fall in bank lending. The hope was that the US would now back
away from further rate rises so that bond markets could stabilise and
equities enjoy some leeway again. With the recovery well entrenched in the
UK, that should be good for London equities too.
Instead doubts remain. On the international front the main concern is the
dollar which closed last night below DM1.65. The US bond market will not
easily regain its poise unless the currency strengthens. At home, worries
about the rise in average earnings look premature; there is not much sign of
inflationary pressure and the striking feature about retail sales was growth
in volume rather than value. But the Bank of England is watching earnings
closely for signs of reviving inflationary expectations.
The weakness of bank lending may offer comfort on inflation, but the main
problem seems to be a reluctance of companies to borrow, which suggests they
are still concerned with balance sheet strength rather than new investment.
Until that changes the recovery may remain too dependent on the consumer.
Latest developments do not add up to a convincing argument for buying
equities.

FT  21 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Digging out of a hole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While Eurotunnel's impending rights issue will not be the biggest in the
history of the London equity market, it promises to be one of the most
delicately poised. Barclays and Zeneca have raised more than the Pounds 850m
Eurotunnel now looks likely to demand from shareholders. But both companies
were members of the FT-SE 100 index and core holdings for the investment
institutions which would normally be expected to underwrite the deal.
Eurotunnel's share register is dominated by private investors. Most UK funds
have little reason to care whether Eurotunnel gets its money or not.
That suggests the rights issue will have to be priced at a generous discount
to the prevailing share price to attract underwriters. Haggling between the
company and fund managers will determine the final terms. Since shareholders
have authorised the issue of only 342m new shares, though, Eurotunnel cannot
afford to give too much away. A rights price of around 250p - a 30 per cent
discount to yesterday's closing share price - is the minimum required to
raise Pounds 850m.
The company will doubtless hope to persuade underwriting institutions to
accept a narrower discount. The shares might also rise once Eurotunnel's
banks have finally agreed to provide their portion of the funding. But
uncertainty over the terms of the issue makes Eurotunnel's shares harder
than ever to value. Buying on the basis of discounted cash flow calculations
demands extraordinary faith in long-term assumptions about economic growth
and inflation. While that will not trouble true believers, sceptics have no
reason to change their minds.

FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares slip back on easier
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue chips finished modestly higher even though a soft dollar and rising
commodity prices sent the bond market into retreat, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved 7.37 to 3,766.35 on program-guided
buying which erased a 15-point deficit in the final half-hour of the
session. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.56 lower at
454.92, as declines on the Big Board led advances, 1,131 to 997.
The monthly 'double witching' expiration of stock options and future
contracts, which was responsible for the Dow's late surge, lifted trading
volume to 295m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite pushed in positive
territory, closing 1.16 better at 438.20. But the Nasdaq composite, down
0.61 to 726.70, tilted in the opposite direction. Generally stocks traced
movements in the bond market, where prices turned lower after six straight
days of improvement. Later the benchmark 30-year government bonds were
showing a solid loss as traders considered an array of unfavourable
developments.
Rising commodity prices were troubling, and the market was concerned about
an influx of next week's supply influx. Most vexing, however, was the
persistent instability of the dollar, which weakened further against the
D-mark and failed to make any progress against the yen. But even though the
long bond was down, the damage to equities was modest.
Stocks were helped by the perception that the pull-back in Treasuries mostly
reflected a technical adjustment after the surge that followed Tuesday's
move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term interest rates.
The blue chips may have ended the week on a sour note if it were not for a
Dollars 2 3/8 improvement by Philip Morris to Dollars 53 3/8 . Some 4.5m
shares exchanged hands, though there was no apparent news behind the brisk
activity.
Sears contributed to the advance with a gain of Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 50
7/8 . JC Penney dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 50 1/2 after forecasting its
1994 revenue growth at 5 to 7 per cent.
In the automobile sector, Chrysler climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 3/8 a
day after announcing a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend. Ford
added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 and GM Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 55 3/8 .
Hewlett Packard raised its dividend and was rewarded Dollars  7/8 mark-up in
its share price to Dollars 81 3/4 .
In energy, Amoco jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 57 1/4 after Prudential
Securities upgraded the stock. Chevron reversed an early loss to finish
Dollars 1 up at Dollars 88 3/4 . UAL, parent of United Airlines, dropped
Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 119 3/8 . The recent decline in the value of stock
has led the carrier's pilots to seek a renegotiation of a Dollars 4.6bn
employee buy-out deal. Other airline stocks held steady.
On the Nasdaq, technology and software stocks were mixed after a two-day
rally. Cyrix gave back Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 22 5/8 , Wellfleet slipped
Dollars 1 5/16 to Dollars 28 and Apple Dollars 1 1/16 to Dollars 31 1/8 .
But Lotus Development gained Dollars 2 to close at Dollars 60.
Canada
Toronto prices traded within a narrow range and closed a up in light trading
ahead of Canada's Victoria Day holiday weekend. The TSE-300 index gained
12.70 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 4,298.38, for a gain on the week of about
123 points. Advances led declines 400 to 338.
Volume of 59.541m was down slightly from yesterday's 59.949m. Trading value
was CDollars 644.5m CDollars 648.7m.
Gold stocks led today's advance, with an index gain of 3.89 per cent. In
that group, Placer Dome was up 1  5/8 to 32  1/4 , American Barrick rose 1
1/2 to 34  1/8 and Echo Bay added  5/8 to 15  5/8 . Brazil
Sao Paulo prices advanced for the third day in a row to end up 1.1 per cent
in moderate trade, bolstered by continued domestic and foreign buying
despite a mild bout of profit-taking in the afternoon session.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 232 at 20,317
points. Turnover was CR423.1bn (Dollars 253.7m).

FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Weaker yen helps Nikkei
ahead
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by financial institutions, encouraged by the easing of the yen
against the dollar bolstered activity, and the Nikkei index gained ground
for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 120.83 to 20,342.17 after a low of 20,255.15 and a
high of 20,438.39, a slight increase over the week. Although profit-taking
by investment trusts eroded some of the early gains, purchases of large
capital stocks by Japanese institutional investors supported the index.
'We're buyers rather than sellers next week,' said Mr Tom Hill, strategist
at SG Warburg, on expectations of lower short term interest rates, an
improved corporate profit outlook and enhanced balance sheets at the banks.
Volume was 350m shares against 258m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rebounded 8.14 to 1,642.54 while the Nikkei 300 rose 1.59 to 300.37.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was up 4.27 at 1,344.84.
Domestic institutions sought large capital steels and shipbuilders. Nippon
Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y13 to Y366 and Kawasaki Steel
added Y9 to Y397.
Higher commodity products supported mining and nonferrous metals stocks.
Sumitomo Metal Mining rose Y16 to Y929 and Showa Aluminium added Y15 to
Y505.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone continued to decline on profit-taking by
investors discouraged by the freeze on its rate increase. The stock lost
Y12,000 to Y843,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 136.23 to 22,507.65 in volume of 17.3m
shares. Aoki International, the men's suits retailer rebounded Y80 to
Y2,980.
Roundup
The region's markets closed the week with mixed performances.
SEOUL experienced a round of institutional profit-taking which left the
composite index 3.23 lower at 948.50, off a days high of 957.10, little
changed on the week.
Speculation that three trusts had been ordered to redeem all of their loans
from the central bank put further pressure on the market. The trusts are
scheduled to pay back some Won2,150bn in soft loans from the central bank by
August 10.
SINGAPORE ended little changed in subdued trading as foreign fund managers
turned their attention to Hong Kong and elsewhere. The Straits Times
Industrials index rose 7.41 to 2,337.01 in thin volume of 106.25m shares.
The market advanced 2.2 per cent over the week
MANILA was firmer after two days' of losses, and the composite index closed
up 14.75 at 2,870.32, a week's decline of 2.3 per cent.
Turnover was 795.6m pesos.
TAIPEI was generally lower although the paper sector improved slightly on
expectations for higher product prices. The weighted index declined 38.82 to
5,905.79, off 2.6 per cent on the week. Turnover fell to TDollars 50bn from
TDollars 58.3bn.
BOMBAY was on the downward track for much of the session after the market
authorities refused to back down on the severe restrictions it has
prescribed for resumption of the badla or the carry forward system of
trading. But towards the close, financial institutions resumed buying and
the BSE 30 share index finished 25.10 down at 3,783.67, after a low of
3,757.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded from its lows at the close led by some core stocks
which reacted to remarks by the finance minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, that
Malaysia would like to see a strong local currency and low interest rates to
achieve low inflation.
The composite index closed down 1.82 points at 1,001.16 after touching an
intra-day low of 993.94, but was little changed on the week.
SYDNEY was supported by a late rally in futures and the All Ordinaries index
closed up 10.2 at 2,103.9 in turnover of ADollars 1bn. The market has
advanced 1.6 per cent on the week.
Some traders noted switching from CRA and into BHP: the former declined 38
cents to ADollars 18.10 and the latter rose 36 cents to ADollars 18.36.

Johannesburg posted steady late-afternoon gains as shares rallied in
response to a stronger gold price and a general improvement in sentiment.
The overall index finished 34 better at 5,474, industrials rose 62 to 6,621
and golds collected 22 to 1,908.
A bounce in Remb Beheer after hefty losses on Thursday helped the mood. The
tobacco stock rose R3.75 to R20.75 after a R7 fall on Thursday after ANC
health officials proposed a 100 per cent rise in cigarette prices.

FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Eurotunnel beset by concern
over financing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity was muted with individual stories taking precedence as markets
anticipated Monday's holiday closure.
PARIS eased back with considerable attention being given to the 'Euro
stocks'. The CAC-40 index lost 9.92 to 2,155.43 in turnover of FFr4bn, off
1.5 per cent on the week.
Eurotunnel saw volume of some 5.5m shares in reaction to early reports that
it might have difficulty raising the cash it required from banks, with
consequent effects on its ability to launch a rights issue. The shares
touched a year's low of FFr31.60 before closing down FFr2.05 at FFr32.90.
After end of business the group said that it had secured Pounds 600m from
its banks and expected to close books on the debt next week.
EuroDisney moved in the opposite direction, up FFr33.70, as creditor banks
finally agreed the refinancing package.
ZURICH was helped higher by transactions linked to the expiry on index
futures and options. The SMI index rose 6.9 to 2,732 for a 1.9 per cent rise
on the week.
A study by Bank Vontobel concluded that small Swiss companies would
outperform their medium and large size counterparts over the period to the
year 2000. Mr Beat Philipp said that the study of 62 companies, representing
90 per cent of Swiss market capitalisation, pointed to 12 per cent average
annual earnings growth, with banks, mechanical engineers and light
electronics companies outperforming while insurers, building suppliers,
industrial holdings, the power industry and brewers underperformed.
UBS continued to make headway, adding SFr9 to SFr1,174, taking the rise over
the week to SFr60. However, analysts noted that the stock fell by 30 per
cent from its high for the year on February 4 to the low on May 9, as
switching was seen into German banks.
Roche certificates were steady at SFr6,635 after their bumpy ride earlier in
the week. Natwest Securities said that it had upgraded its forecasts for the
group as a result of the good first quarter results and the expectation that
the Syntex acquisition would enhance earnings from 1995.
FRANKFURT kept its attention directed towards the banking sector as
disappointment over Deutsche Bank results on Thursday continued to ripple
through the market. Activity was dampened by the fact the the market will be
closed on Monday.
The Dax index ended up 1.89 at 2,249.65, little changed on the week.
Turnover was DM7.2bn.
Deutsche Bank finished down a further DM2.70 at DM763.30, while Dresdner,
which reported yesterday that operating profits over the first four months
of the year had been 'satisfactory', went in the opposite direction, up DM3
at DM408.
Lufthansa, up DM4.50 to DM199.50, benefited from a positive note from Hoare
Govett yesterday. This said that with more cost savings to come and an
agreement with United Airlines of the US a significant improvement in
earnings could be expected.
MILAN remained under pressure for the second straight day as foreigners
continued to take profits and local investors showed a reluctance to make
fresh purchases. The Comit index lost 18.05 or 2.3 per cent to 776.45,
taking the fall over the week to 4 per cent.
Fiat was again under pressure after its recent strong performance, losing
L121 to L6,853, and Olivetti dipped L27 to L2,866.
Against the trend, Ciga, the hotels group, surged L64 or 5.5 per cent to
L1,228 in heavy volume of 22.9m shares, provoking renewed speculation about
stake building. A L29 advance to L2,889 in Pirelli was attributed to its
steeper than average falls in recent sessions.
AMSTERDAM slipped back on options expiry and the Aex index ended down 2.76
at 412.77, little changed on the week. Royal Dutch, which went ex dividend,
ended the session down Fl 5.60 at Fl 201.00.

FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong hears some positive news at
last - Simon Holberton on why confidence has revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong got a glimpse of a brighter future this week and it liked what it
thought it saw - an end for the time being to US interest rate rises and the
prospect of President Bill Clinton renewing unconditionally China's most
favoured status next month.
The resumption of Sino-British talks on the colony's multi-billion dollar
airport this week also gave a fillip to confidence which has been under
pressure for some months from nervousness about the residential property
market, the interest rate outlook, and lack of attention by international
investors.
Mr Ewan Cameron Watt, head of research at Warburg Securities, characterised
the mood: 'It's a revival of confidence in financial assets and we think it
is reasonably well-founded.'
Taking its lead from Wall Street, the Hang Seng Index rose nearly 5 per cent
on Wednesday in the wake of the US Federal Reserve Board's 0.5 percentage
point tightening in the Fed funds and discount rates. By the close of
trading yesterday it had risen a further 3 per cent, bringing its gain on
the week to nearly 5.5 per cent.
The prospect of further US interest rate rises in the short term seems to
have diminished, although most expect to see the Fed funds rate nudging 5
per cent by the end of the year from its current level of 4.25 per cent. US
rates are important for Hong Kong because the colony's dollar is linked the
dollar.
The market has been looking for good news for some time.
Since the beginning of the year, when Hong Kong and other Asian markets fell
out of favour with international investors, share prices have fallen by
nearly a third from their peak in early January.
The change in the direction of interest rates - heralded by the Fed in
February with its first rise in the cost of borrowing for five years - also
undermined confidence.
In addition, comments by Mr Chris Pattern, the governor at Easter that the
high level of residential property prices, in Hong Kong was of concern and
needed 'exceptional' measures further eroded sentiment.
Over recent weeks, however, initial gloom has given way to a slightly more
positive outlook. This is reflected in property, where the market has come
to realise two things.
Mr Patten does not want to be associated with measures which lead to the
collapse of the colony's property market. The governor's 'exceptional'
measures now look like being no more than an attempt to increase the supply
of land for building. Analysts reckon that, at worst prices, may fall 20 per
cent, 10 per cent of which has already occurred.
With a two to three year building cycle that should leave the house
builders' earnings pretty much intact for the near term. Seen in this light
the market has overdone its down-rating of the colony's house builders.
Mr Peter Churchouse, head of research at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank,
said that New World Development was trading at a 44 per cent discount to its
net asset value, Sino Land 43 per cent and Hang Lung 35 per cent. 'You could
argue that the property developers are undervalued,' he said.
Mr Cameron Watt noted that discounts to NAV of these magnitudes have not
been seen in Hong Kong since 1989-90 when there was a political crisis in
China and Hong Kong. Little wonder that in this week's rally it was the
house builders' who performed best.
The outlook on MFN renewal has also improved in the judgement of some. Hong
Kong's investment community believes that come June 3 President Clinton will
finally renew MFN.
When Dr Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state, passed through
Hong Kong earlier this week, he told assorted groups of businessmen that in
his view Mr Clinton would renew MFN unconditionally.
Analysts think at most the President might try to penalise exports from
state- or military-controlled companies. Though quite how the US customs
service would determine such an origin has people in Hong Kong stumped.
'If he doesn't renew the market is going to be in for an almighty shock. The
market is expecting it to go through,' says Ms Janice Wallace, head of
research at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
Ms Wallace remains cautious, however, about the Hong Kong market. She notes
that international investors are still wary of the colony's property market
 -believing there exists a possibility of 'melt down' - and the Chinese
economy, where inflation remains stubbornly high but the incipient slowdown
in economic activity has produced a rise in inter-company debt of large
proportions.
'Most overseas investors are being defensive, waiting to see signs of
stability,' she said.
This week's rally in Hong Kong has been notable for one lacklustre sector:
the China related companies. The attraction for China companies - be they
'H' share issues or the so called 'red chips' - has diminished considerably
over the past few months.
An indication of just how much the enthusiasm has cooled was given on
Tuesday with the debut of Tianjin Bohai Chemical. It became the first
H-share company to see its share price fall below the offer price on its
first day of trading.

FT  21 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities improve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Water stocks made rapid progress towards them close of trading and were said
to have appreciated even further in unofficial trading ahead of the start of
the preliminary results season which commences next Wednesday. There were
also widespread rumours in the market that Ofwat, the water industry
regulator, was about to indicate better than expected 'K factors' to the
companies. Ofwat is expected give indications to the water companies of its
intentions regarding K factors.
The results season begins on Wednesday with figures from North West Water
and runs through till the end of June when Wessex reports.
Thames, the biggest of the water companies, jumped 11 to 491p, while North
West rose 7 to 505p, Anglian 6 to 493p and Severn Trent 4 to 500p.
The electricity generators tended to give ground after making good progress
earlier in the week but the 'recs' provided a strong performer in Northern
Electricity, viewed as one of the sector's prime takeover targets, which
added 13 at 657p, after 661p. Northern Ireland Electricity, due to report
preliminary figures on June 1, moved up 5 to 239p.
The two classes of BT stock made rapid progress throughout the busiest
single-day's trading since early February, as a number of influential
broking firms recommended the shares. James Capel, the leading agency
broker, was among those promoting the shares. The ordinaries moved up 10 1/2
to 387p, after turnover of 16m, as did the partly-paids, 269p, following
turnover of 12m.
Shares in Granada Group were in the doldrums, closing 10 lighter at 527p, on
speculation that the Great British Lottery Company consortium of which
Granada is a part is unlikely to win the licence to operate the UK National
lottery. An announcement is to be made on Wednesday about the outcome of the
bids.
Dealers remained optimistic about the prospects for the Lotco consortium
which includes Rank Organisation. Shares in Rank put on 5 to 418p, on volume
of 4.2m and were supported by a buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson.
Kleinwort said: 'Rank is standing on a market multiple for the year to
October 1995,is delivering growth ahead of the market and does not need to
undertake major corporate activities, unlike several other sector companies
in which the market is anticipating significant disposals and acquisitions
to justify exceptionally high ratings.'
Shares in Ladbroke, part of Games For Good Causes consortium pitching for
the UK National Lottery, moved 4 ahead to 199p.
The best individual performance in the FT-SE 100 came from Bowater, the
paper and packaging group, whose shares jumped 14, or 3.1 per cent to 456p
after encouraging comments at the annual meeting.
Bowater said its operating profits and earnings are ahead of last year and
somewhat better than expectations. The performance of its American and
Australian business is ahead of the same period last year while the European
business were in line with the company's expectations, the group said.
Bowater shares have fallen sharply since mid-March when the stock price
reached 517p.
Glaxo was one of the worst performers in a pharmaceuticals sector upset by
concerns about government inquiries into the comparative costs of drugs and
cost effectiveness studies for new pharmaceutical products. Glaxo shares
dropped 12 to 539p after relatively heavy turnover of 4.6.
Lasmo shares began to move forward strongly in mid-afternoon amid
speculation that a cash alternative may soon be injected into the bid from
Enterprise Oil. Lasmo closed 4 higher at 157p while Enterprise edged up to
428p.
Housebuilders attracted keen support with Bryant leading the sector higher
and finally 8 to the good at 160p after buy recommendations from NatWest
Securities and James Capel.
Continuing worries about its financing together with talk that the market
may be faced with a bigger than anticipated rights issue combined to make
Eurotunnel, the day's worst performing stock. The shares fell 30 to 375p,
though reports after the market close said the channel tunnel operator had
obtained around Pounds 600m in new bank lending.
Nervous trading ahead of Monday's figures left British Airways  1/2 lighter
at 377 1/2 p, after trade of 5.1m. Analysts expect the company to break even
in the fourth quarter.
A satisfactory statement at Next's annual meeting helped the shares firm 4
to 245p. Further consideration of the AGM statement at Laura Ashley, the
previous day saw the shares appreciate 7 to 84p.
Good results from Fine Arts Development earlier in the week continued to
support the shares and they gained another 18 to 523p.

FT  21 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: US fears unsettle Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering group Lucas Industries tumbled 15 to 175p, on fears that it may
be forced to make provisions following a US press report alleging that Lucas
equipment was to blame for 167 emergency naval jet landings in the last 18
months.
However, a company statement just before the market close said the reports
from the US were a 'misrepresentation' of the facts.
Heavy trading in the stock brought turnover of 11m as researchers talked of
provisions to cover a fine and the cost of correcting the equipment defects,
if investigators find against Lucas. There was also talk that other work
done for the US Government may also be in jeopardy. Total turnover from work
carried out for the various parts of the US Government amounts to around
Dollars 180m a year.
The US press report said the Pentagon has proposed barring Lucas from future
contracts after investigator's claims that its substandard aircraft parts
posed a hazard to pilots.
One analyst said: 'I think the shares will remain under a cloud until this
issue is resolved or we know what the actual implications are. This may be a
legacy of the old management. But it is also important to point out the
strength of the balance sheet. '

FT  21 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Currency and bond weakness upsets
equities - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another nervous and erratic session in UK equities yesterday saw share
prices quickly shedding early gains towards the close as weakness in the US
dollar unsettled sterling and impacted on British government bonds. By the
close, an early gain of nearly 17 points on the FT-SE Index had been cut to
only 4.5 for a final reading of 3,127.3.
The session had started well, with the Footsie moving up to 3,139.7 on the
back of Wall Street's strength overnight and the continued hopes that this
week's determined action on US interest rates by the Federal Reserve would
reinvigorate global bond markets.
Although sterling was unsettled by the announcement that domestic M4 money
supply had risen by Pounds 500m in April, stock markets made no initial
response. But London securities markets were quickly upset later in the
session when US markets began to turn off. By the close of trading in the
London market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a fall of more than 7
points.
While there was no great selling pressure in London - Friday afternoons
often see cautious movements in share prices rather than activity by fund
managers - the weakness in bonds was received badly.
Market strategists, having at first given a favourable response to this
week's sharp rises in US Federal funds and discount rates, had become
increasingly unhappy with the easier trend in the US dollar which should, by
normal market criteria, have responded favourably to higher rates in the US.
The London market, in particular, has shown itself vulnerable to adverse
moves in the UK Treasury financing sectors, and there are now fears that
lower interest rates in Europe may not help UK stocks.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, having given ground for the past fortnight, against
the trend of the FT-SE 100 Index, made little progress yesterday, closing a
mere 1.1 ahead at 3,714.6. Seaq volume increased to 708.2m shares from
Thursday's 621.9m, which was worth Pounds 1.52bn in retail business.
By the close of trading last night, the FT-SE 100 Index was showing a gain
of only 8 points on the week, an unimpressive response to the
widely-predicted rate hikes from the Federal Reserve which had been seen as
a potential saviour for global bond markets and, therefore, for equities. UK
share prices have found it difficult to follow Wall Street higher because
dollar weakness has undermined optimism in the bond market.
Once again, share prices found difficulty in establishing a firm trend
yesterday and by the close the picture was more irregular than the Footsie
Index suggested. Pharmaceuticals and banks closed easier and the blue chip
sectors were boosted by gains in a handful of special situations including
BT and British Gas, both still responding to trading statements on the
previous day.
However, store and retail stocks continued to respond well to the view of
the independent Treasury advisers on Thursday that there was no need for
domestic interest rates to rise at present.
Profit-taking in the engineering and motor industry sectors suggested that
this week's gains had been insecurely based and may have reflected little
more than bargain hunting by small investors rather than investment
decisions by the managers of the big pension funds.

Stock index futures gave up the early advance as dealers followed the
retreat in both UK and US bonds, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,121, down 4 on its previous
close and at a 4 point discount to cash. Volume remained low reaching 10,306
contracts by the close.
Turnover in the traded options jumped to 47,439 lots of which 17,916 was

FT  21 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar struggles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar slipped yesterday to levels that raised the prospect of renewed
central bank intervention to support the currency, writes Philip Gawith.
Traders said the market was probing the downside in search of the central
banks. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6463 from DM1.6551 on Thursday.
Against the yen it finished at Y103.910 from Y104.065.
Elsewhere the Greek drachma remained in the spotlight with interest rates
rising as high as 500 per cent, and widespread rumours of a possible weekend
devaluation.
There was also furious activity in the euromark futures market. Comments
from Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer, suggesting that the pace of
German rate cuts might slow, prompted heavy selling, which spilled over into
the French PIBOR futures too.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the dollar's
weakness reflected market efforts to flush out the central banks. He said
there was evidence of heavy selling by US funds.
Also contributing to the dollar's woes were Mr Tietmeyer's comments made in
a magazine interview. Not only did he cast doubt over the likely pace of
monetary easing, but other observations he made were interpreted by the
market as indicating a Bundesbank preference for a stronger D-Mark.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments had most resonance in the futures market where
enormous volumes were traded. The December euromark contract traded over
110,000 lots. The price settled at 94.89, 23 basis points down on the day.
The French market also suffered, with analysts noting that it was a case of
'Germany sneezes, France catches cold.' The December PIBOR contract closed
at 94.57, 24 basis points below Thursday's close.
Sterling futures performed relatively well by comparison. The December
contract traded nearly 28,000 lots, and actually finished two basis points
firmer at 94.07.
The drachma struggled to the end of a torrid week, amid widespread
speculation that the government might be forced to announce a devaluation
over the weekend.
Overnight rates rose to 150-500 per cent, and the drachma was fixed at
Dr150.700 from Thursday's Dr148.980. Dealers, however, said that most price
action took place in the Dr151-153 range.
Economists speculate that the central bank has now spent as much as Dollars
1.5bn out of total foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 10bn in its defence
of the currency.
Mr MacKinnon, of Citibank, said the drachma was overvalued by as much as 30
per cent against other European currencies. He predicted a devaluation of up
to 15 per cent.
Although the government has ruled out this prospect, few in the market
believe it can be avoided. High interest rates exact too high a cost to be
maintained for long. Also, recent European history shows that high interest
rates do not provide long term protection to a weak currency.
Sterling slipped lower against the D-Mark, in sympathy with the weaker
dollar. It finished one pfennig lower at DM2.4856 from DM2.4954.
In the money markets the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 850m shortage with
comparative ease.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee wins over doubters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surge in coffee futures that began early in April was punctuated by
analysts' warnings that the market had risen 'too far, too fast' and that a
major downward correction could not be put off for long.
In the middle of this week it seemed to many observers that that correction
had arrived; but they were quickly disabused.
Most of Wednesday morning's Dollars 113-a-tonne plunge in the July position
at the London Commodity Exchange had been recouped by the close, and the
rest was eliminated at Thursday's opening as a preliminary to a renewed
charge to fresh five-year highs.
Since then there has been little talk of retreat and the selling that pushed
the July price down Dollars 97 to Dollars 2,150 a tonne at one point
yesterday was shrugged off as 'gentle profit-taking'. By the close the price
had recovered to Dollars 2,185, down Dollars 62 on the day but still Dollars
228 up on the week.
There is no denying that the recent Dollars 800 advance has been fuelled by
speculative funds attracted by technical considerations. But attention is
now focusing more on the coffee market's constructive fundamental outlook.
This was underlined yesterday by the latest supply/ demand assessment from
FO Licht, the German commodity statistic agency, which cut its forecast of
world production in 1993-94 to 89.85m bags (60kg each) from the 92m bags it
was projecting in December.
'A short glance at the production side reveals the situation is even bleaker
than last year,' Licht said, adding that this would lead to 'a significant
drawdown in stocks'.
The slow reaction of supply to changes in the world market would result in
shortages continuing into 1994-95, it warned. 'Indeed, the situation could
get out of hand if there should be any weather-induced production shortfalls
in the forthcoming season.'
Supply/demand factors have also underpinned the Dollars 400-a-tonne rise in
copper prices over the past five weeks, though, as with coffee, constructive
chart patterns may have exaggerated the movement.
The London Metal Exchange three months delivery price closed yesterday at
Dollars 2,229.50 a tonne, up Dollars 50.50 on the week but Dollars 50 below
Thursday's 17-month peak. Near term moves for copper were impossible to
predict in the current climate, traders told the Reuter news agency, but
chartists said the correction could continue for some way before it even
started to threaten the overall bullish pattern.
This week's rise was encouraged by the announcement on Tuesday of an
18,625-tonne cut in LME warehouse stocks of copper, but yesterday's
6,350-tonne fall to 399,725 tonnes was much smaller than most dealers
expected.
At the London bullion market the silver market again led gold higher as
encouraging economic indicators attracted buyers to the predominantly
industrial white metal. Cash silver closed yesterday at Dollars 5.63 1/2 a
troy ounce, up 21 cents on the week, while gold consolidated last week's
move above Dollars 380 with a Dollars 3.85 rise to Dollars 384.20 an ounce.
A bout of profit-taking hit oil futures following the rally that had lifted
nearby positions by Dollars 4 from mid-February's five year lows. But the
buyers soon returned and in late trading yesterday the August delivery Brent
blend contract at the International Petroleum Exchange, which had dipped
below Dollars 16 a barrel in mid-week, was back at Dollars 16.23, down just
2 cents overall.

FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: DTB plans promotion for link-up
with Matif
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's screen-based derivatives market, plans
to launch an intensive marketing exercise in France.
The campaign will start before the first DTB terminals are installed in
Paris in September as part of the German exchange's co-operation with Matif,
its French equivalent.
The DTB is also close to winning the regulatory approval which will allow it
to expand into the UK, the US, and continental European countries, Mr Jorg
Franke, the DTB's joint chief executive, said yesterday. At present, the DTB
has only one screen outside Germany, in Amsterdam.
Further international expansion will follow the DTB's declaration this week
that it intends to join Globex, the electronic futures trading system
developed and operated by Reuters, the financial information and news group.
However, Mr Franke warned it would take a year from the signing of a
contract with Reuters for DTB technology to be adapted to that of Globex, at
a cost of between DM6m (Dollars 3.5m) and DM8m.
He said he expected five or six French institutions to be trading DTB
products out of Paris 'from the very beginning'. The products available to
the French, via a computer link with the German system, will be the DTB's
futures contracts on five- and 10-year German government securities coupled
with the corresponding options.
The agreement with Matif envisages that by the end of next year, members
will have full access to the DTB's dealing and settlement technology.
DTB announced pre-tax profits for last year were DM47.9m, up from DM42.2m in
1992. This reflected a 44 per cent increase in trading volume, from 34.8m to
50m contracts, offsetting a reduction in fees.

FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: France reiterates resolve to
sell Renault
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The French government yesterday stressed its commitment to the privatisation
of Renault, the state-owned automotive group, but played down reports it was
considering a partial sell-off this year.
'We are studying the Renault dossier with respect to privatisation,' said an
industry ministry official. 'But we have not taken any decisions on how the
sale is to be implemented.'
Speculation on the idea of a partial privatisation this year, with a full
privatisation in 1995, was triggered by a report in the Tribune Desfosses,
the French business daily.
According to the report, the government is considering the sale of between
15 and 25 per cent of Renault's shares as early as this autumn, and could
combine the sale with a capital increase for the automotive group.
The sale could take part in two tranches: one for individual investors
through a public offer for sale, and the second for institutional investors
and industrial partners.
Industry observers said there were several advantages in such a scenario.
For one, it would confirm the government's intention to privatise Renault,
following its omission from the latest list of public companies slated for
sale. The list, announced in March, included Assurances Generales de France
and Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer.
A flotation of part of the French government's 80 per cent stake in Renault
would also facilitate the reduction of Volvo's 20 per cent holding in the
company. The Swedish group has retained the stake since the collapse of its
planned merger with Renault at the end of last year.
A partial privatisation would allow the formation of a 'noyau dur', a group
of long-term stable shareholders. Lagardere Group, which co-operates with
Renault on the production of the Espace vehicle, and Elf-Aquitaine, the oil
group, are potential long-term investors.

Williams Companies, the diversified energy group, yesterday rejected a
Dollars 2bn offer from LDDS Communications, an acquisitive US
telecommunications group, to buy its subsidiary WilTel, which runs the
nation's fourth-largest long-distance network.
However, Williams's board said it had authorised management to explore other
forms of co-operation with LDDS. Management was also looking at possible
alliances with one or more other partners.
LDDS, which announced its offer earlier this month, is a long-distance
reseller, buying access to long-distance lines in bulk and reselling the
access at a profit.
It is WilTel's second-largest customer, and has been negotiating a new,
long-term contract for services.

FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Paramount costs leave Viacom
Dollars 454m in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An after-tax charge of Dollars 332m to cover costs involved in the takeover
of Paramount Communications has left Viacom, the US entertainment group,
with a total net loss of Dollars 454m, or Dollars 3.59 a share, for the
first quarter.
The charge stems from the merger of some of its businesses with those of
Paramount, as well as 'related management and strategic changes', Viacom
said.
Some Dollars 224m of the charge was taken in the entertainment division,
which has been created by bringing together Paramount's movie and television
operations and Viacom's production businesses.
The company said it had adjusted the value of some of its programming
assets, 'based upon new management strategies and additional programming
sources'.
Without the charge, Viacom's net loss for the period would have amounted to
94 cents a share, slightly more than most analysts' expectations.
The first-quarter figures include just one month of Paramount's results. If
Paramount's results for the full period had been included, the net loss
would have been Dollars 332.9m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, before the one-off
merger charge, Viacom said.
The results reflect a poor performance from Paramount's movie division, with
revenues from the company's feature films below expectations. The inclusion
of one month of Paramount figures contributed an operating loss of Dollars
51m, Dollars 35m of it in entertainment and Dollars 15m from publishing.
Viacom's pre-merger businesses, by contrast, reported operating earnings of
Dollars 83m for the quarter, Dollars 66m of it from the MTV and Showtime
networks. MTV continued its growth of recent quarters, with revenues up 30
per cent from a year ago, at Dollars 174m, and operating earnings up 21 per
cent to Dollars 55m.
Commenting on the results, Mr Frank Biondi, president and chief executive,
said: 'The main structural issues and associated costs are clearly behind us
and we are poised for excellent performance and growth.'
The sale of the company's one-third interest in Lifetime Television, for a
pre-tax profit of Dollars 267m, will appear in the current quarter's
figures.
Viacom has already announced it is exploring the sale of other assets in a
move that would reduce the debts taken on with the acquisition of Paramount.

FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Dresdner sees no need for
provision against Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank has no need to make any provisions against its loans to the
collapsed Jurgen Schneider property group, chairman Mr Jurgen Sarrazin told
shareholders yesterday.
The bank's main involvement was in the financing of two of the group's
projects. Dresdner's loans, concentrated on two properties in Berlin and
Leipzig, were secured against the value of the projects.
Addressing the annual meeting a day after Deutsche Bank announced provisions
of DM500m (Dollars 303m) against its exposure to Schneider, Mr Sarrazin said
both projects would be completed to increase their value.
The bank had taken over responsibility for the sites and paid contractors
and other suppliers for work done. Meanwhile, Dresdner was negotiating over
the conditions under which the projects could be passed into 'other hands'.
After allowing for risk provisions, the bank's operating profits showed
'pleasing' growth in the first four months of this year, Mr Sarrazin said.
Deutsche earlier reported a 10 per cent decline over the same period.
Offering no more details, he said he expected a satisfactory result for the
full year, although it was too early to make forecasts. This was partly
because of uncertainties over the need for provisions against bad debts.
Commenting on progress so far, Mr Sarrazin said although own-account trading
results were markedly down, he expected market activity and prices to
improve during the the year.
On the other hand, risk provisioning had been reduced and interest and fee
income had both increased.

FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong yen buffets Honda profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Honda, buffetted by the sharp appreciation of the yen and weak markets in
Japan and Europe last year, recorded a sharp deterioration in results for
the year to March 1994.
The Japanese automotive group saw consolidated sales decline 6.5 per cent to
Y3,863bn (Dollars 32.3bn) from Y4,132bn, while pre-tax profits plunged 47
per cent to Y46.89bn from Y88.56bn.
Net income was 36 per cent lower at Y23.69bn, against Y37.16bn, although
this figure was helped by a better performance from Rover, the UK-based car
company in which Honda owns a 20 per cent stake. Honda said, however, it
expected a strong improvement this year with the launch of new models,
including a recreational vehicle it is developing and sport utility vehicles
it is marketing on an original equipment manufacturing basis.
Consolidated sales are forecast to rise 3.6 per cent this year, to about
Y4,000bn.
The car company also expects net income to surge 119 per cent to about
Y52bn, largely as a result of off-loading its equity holding in Rover this
year, and expected strong sales in the US.
Honda and Rover have agreed to unwind their cross-shareholding. This will
have a significant impact on Honda's net income as the Japanese company has
had to reflect a 20 per cent share of Rover's results in its accounts at the
net level.
Total sales fell 7 per cent in Japan, 4 per cent in North America and 21 per
cent in Europe. The results for North America and Europe were influenced
significantly by the higher yen, which Honda said had caused a fall in
operating profits of Y147bn. The yen's appreciation easily wiped out
cost-cutting efforts and gains generated from lower research and development
expenses.
To minimise the impact of currency fluctuations, Honda is moving a greater
proportion of its manufacturing overseas.
It is targeting sales of 1.87m units for cars globally, compared with 1.75m
units in fiscal 1993. At home, Honda expects model launches to help boost
unit sales by 9.5 per cent, rising to 620,000 units from 566,000 last year.
Other sales targets for cars this year are 860,000 units in North America,
compared with 828,000; 160,000 against 156,000 in Europe; and 230,000
elsewhere, compared with 203,000.
For the parent company, sales totalled Y2,505bn, down 7 per cent from
Y2,695bn, while pre-tax profits fell 55 per cent to Y22.7bn from Y50.2bn.
Net income declined 52 per cent to Y14.3bn, from Y30.1bn.

Pasminco
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian minerals group, said yesterday it was retaining a 10 per
cent shareholding in Pasminco, the Melbourne-based zinc and metals
processing company. It has also undertaken not to dispose of the stake for
at least 12 months, except to a trade buyer or buyers.
The company confirmed it had succeeded in placing the remainder of its large
minority stake in Pasminco.
CRA directors said the company had sold almost 309.2m Pasminco shares,
representing almost 39 per cent of its capital, to a large number of
domestic and overseas buyers through Potter Warburg and Bain Capital
Markets, two stockbroking firms.
The shares, placed at ADollars 1.70 each, raised more than ADollars 525m
(USDollars 383.2m), making the placement one of the largest involving an
Australian company.
The sale included a stake of 19.1 per cent in Pasminco which CRA controlled
through an option agreement with North Broken Hill Peko, another Australian
mining group.
CRA had said it was planning to shed its Pasminco holding earlier this year,
suggesting it would use the funds raised to develop the New Century mine in
Queensland.
At that stage, CRA gave no firm indication of how the stake would be
disposed of, but said it was willing to consider offers for all or part of
the holding.
Yesterday, Mr Peter Barnett, Pasminco's managing director, said he was
pleased that uncertainty over the company's ownership had been promptly
resolved. He believed the wider spread of ownership would lead to
maintenance of its current credit rating.

FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japan's electronics groups in
reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A batch of Japanese consumer electronics groups reported weak sales and
depressed profits yesterday.
Matsushita Electric reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits for the third
year running . It blamed continuing slow demand in key markets and the
strong rise of the yen against leading currencies.
The world's largest consumer electronics company suffered a 6 per cent drop
in consolidated sales, to Y6,624bn (Dollars 63.9bn) from a previous
Y7,056bn, while pre-tax profits declined 21 per cent to Y128.2bn from
Y162.2bn. Net income fell 34 per cent to Y24.5bn from Y37.3bn.
Matsushita said sales in the Japanese market were hit by slow consumer
spending and weak private capital expenditure. While innovative products,
such as high-tech rice cookers and washing machines, fared well, the
unusually cold summer last year knocked air conditioner sales, normally an
important contributor to revenues.
Meanwhile, overseas business was hit by the yen's appreciation. The
currency's rise led to a decline in overseas sales, which were up on a local
currency basis.
Sales of audio-visual equipment declined significantly due to a shift in
consumer preference for lower-priced products.
Sales of communication and industrial equipment fell, too. This was despite
strong demand for cordless and cellular phones, and largely because of weak
demand for industrial equipment as Japanese private businesses remained in
the doldrums.
Entertainment revenues, including sales from MCA, declined in yen terms.
They were, however, boosted in dollar terms by the huge success of the film
Jurassic Park. That film surpassed ET to become the highest grossing film of
all time, reaping Dollars 870m in box office revenues.
Parent company revenues declined 4 per cent to Y4,349.6bn from Y4,550bn, and
pre-tax profits fell 34 per cent to Y63.9bn from Y96.7bn. Net income was 15
per cent lower at Y43.2bn, against Y51bn.
The company expects the economic climate to remain depressed, but is looking
for a significant turnround in operating profit for this fiscal year. It is
carrying out manufacturing reforms overseas, increasing parts-procurement
from abroad, stepping up restructuring efforts and launching new, innovative
products. A director of Matsushita has been appointed president of Victor
Company of Japan (JVC), the troubled audio-visual company in which it has a
52 per cent stake. JVC, which introduced the VHS video cassette tape, has
appointed Mr Takeo Shuzui as president in place of Mr Takuro Bojo, who has
been at thehelm of JVC since 1991.
JVC has been hit by the slump in the consumer electronics market and has
incurred heavy losses. It is expected to report another loss when it
announces its results next week.
Pioneer, the audio-visual company, reported a 14 per cent drop in
consolidated sales, to Y509.9bn from Y589.7bn, and a 92 per cent plunge in
operating profits, to Y2.4bn from Y28.7bn, for the full year ended March.
Net income was down 30 per cent to Y6.6bn against Y10.8bn. Parent company
sales declined 15 per cent to Y326.4bn from Y382.8bn, and Pioneer incurred
an operating loss of Y5.7bn against Y6.9bn profit last time. Pre-tax profits
were Y1.7bn, down heavily from Y16.5bn.
Kenwood, the specialist audio maker, reported a Y1.2bn pre-tax loss, against
Y4bn profit for the same period last year, on sales down 6 per cent to
Y197.4bn from Y210.6bn.

<TEXT>
USAir, the troubled US carrier in which British Airways holds a 22 per cent
stake, yesterday announced plans to subcontract its air freight and mail
handling operations in 35 cities. The move is part of a cost-cutting drive.
It said the change would save Dollars 10m a year. The operations employed
510 full-time and 122 part-time workers, and those affected would be invited
to apply for other jobs within the company.
USAir also announced it was evaluating the savings potential of
subcontracting its in-flight catering services at airports later this year.
Although food preparation is usually undertaken by sub-contractors, other
parts of the operation, such as loading of food and drinks, are carried out
by airline employees.
USAir suffered net losses of Dollars 349.4m last year, and warned in March
its deficit would be even bigger this year. British Airways has said it will
not invest any more in the airline until it gets to grips with costs.
Of all the large US carriers, USAir has by far the highest costs in relation
to miles flown.
Its difficulties have recently intensified because two low-cost carriers,
Southwest Airlines and Continental Airlines, have swept into its main
markets offering much lower fares.

FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Veag to invest DM20bn ahead of
sell-off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Veag, eastern Germany's largest utility, will invest more than DM20bn
(Dollars 12.1bn) in modernising and upgrading the region's electricity
infrastructure, Mr Karlheinz Steiner, a board member, said yesterday.
Much of the planned investment programme will involve building brown
coal-fired power stations and installing emission-reducing equipment. Over
11,450 MegaWatts of Vega's total 14,225MW, are generated by brown coal.
The company, which is still under the Treuhand privatisation agency,
increased turnover last year by 2.4 per cent, to DM6.5bn compared with the
previous year, despite the continuing fall in energy consumption throughout
eastern Germany.
However, profits last year were reduced to zero from DM7m in 1992 because of
heavy restructuring costs, including redundancy payments, high investment
commitments, and the transfer of DM4bn in liquid assets to the Treuhand.
Primary energy consumption in the region had been traditionally dominated by
brown coal: it held 68 per cent share of the energy market. However, with
the collapse of manufacturing, primary energy consumption fell from 128.3m
tonnes in 1989 to 83m tonnes in 1991.
Mr Steiner said the company would have to tap capital markets to finance its
investment programme, a move supported by the advisory board, which approved
borrowings of up to DM2.3bn for 1994. The workforce has been cut from 29,000
in 1990 to 13,513 last year, and a further 2,000 jobs are expected to be
lost this year.
Mr Steiner said the company, which has a monopoly in the generation and
distribution of electricity throughout eastern Germany, would be finally
privatised 'around the middle of the year'. It will be sold for an estimated
DM8bn to West Germany's largest utilities, headed by RWE, PreussenElektra
and Bayernwerk.
However, the successful privatisation of Veag remains dependent on the
Treuhand completing the sale of Laubag, the large brown coalfields which
will feed the Veag electricity grid. Laubag will be sold to a consortium led
by Rheinbraun, the coal subsidiary of RWE.

FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull closer to sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer group, yesterday appointed
Banque Indosuez and SG Warburg as advisers to its planned privatisation.
The announcement marks a new stage in the privatisation, which is one of the
more complex sales in the French government's plans to transfer 21
publicly-owned groups to the private sector.
Unlike previous privatisation issues, such as that of Rhone Poulenc, the
chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, and Elf Aquitaine, the oil company,
Groupe Bull will not be sold through a public offer.
Instead, the government's 75.8 per cent stake is due to be reduced to a
minority through the participation of industrial partners and the company's
staff.
Groupe Bull's financial situation also stands in marked contrast to previous
privatisation issues. It has lost more than FFr15bn (Dollars 2.64bn) over
the past three years, although a recovery strategy implemented by Mr
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who took over as chairman last year, brought a
sharp improvement in first-quarter results.
Net losses in the first three months were reduced by 45 per cent, to
FFr942m.
The privatisation is expected to take place in stages. Mr Descarpentries has
said, however, he hopes to reduce the government's stake to a minority by
the end of the year.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fenner ends search for chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fenner, the Hull-based industrial group, yesterday announced it was
promoting Mr Mark Abrahams, 38, from finance director to chief executive
with immediate effect.
The announcement ends a five-month search by Fenner and Mr Colin Cooke, its
non-executive chairman, for a chief executive. In December, Mr Julian
Bigden, the former managing director, returned to his previous job running
Fenner's US polymers operation.
Mr Cooke said in March that he had three candidates in mind for the job of
chief executive, and it was thought that the appointee would come from
outside the company.
However, in a short statement yesterday Fenner said that since Mr Abrahams
joined the board in 1990 on his appointment as finance director, he had made
a considerable contribution to the restructuring of the group's finances and
its return to a more profitable performance.
Mr Cooke said yesterday that Mr Abrahams was the best of the three
candidates for the job. 'He knows Fenner well, is a strategic thinker, and
has all the attributes we were looking for.'
Mr Cooke and Mr Abrahams have worked together closely in the past year in
the restructuring of the company. The search is now on for a new finance
director.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey sets up Japanese joint
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group, has tackled two key
elements of its corporate strategy in a deal with Mitsubishi Kasei, the
Japanese chemicals company.
They are to set up a joint venture to supply sputtering targets to the
Japanese semiconductor industry.
Sputtering targets are made of high purity metal - aluminium or titanium -
and used to deposit a thin film on semiconductor chips and computer
processors, both for the metal's electrical properties and to control the
heat generated in these devices.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said yesterday the deal would enable JM
immediately to have profitable operations in Japan while at the same time
expanding its electronic materials business to become worldwide market
leader in sputtering targets.
The partners will merge their existing Japanese operations into the new
joint company, Ryoka Matthey, which will continue to manufacture at a plant
in Noetsu. JM's initial cash contribution will be 'small' but after five
years it will take its stake from 50 to 66 per cent at a cost of Pounds
1.8m.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Signet to close remaining Ratners stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise and fall of Ratners, one of the best-known retailing names of the
1980s, was completed yesterday as Signet, the jewellery group, said the name
would vanish from the high street within the next few months.
The group, which announced increased pre-tax losses for the year to January
29 although it returned to profit at the operating level, said sales at the
chain were falling and it had decided it could not be saved. Remaining
Ratners stores would be closed or converted to other formats.
Mr Gerald Ratner, the former chairman, transformed UK jewellery retailing by
bringing affordable products to the mass market, and built the group into
Europe's biggest jeweller.
But Mr Ratner's fate was sealed by a remark to a meeting of the Institute of
Directors in April 1991 that a sherry decanter with six glasses on a silver
plated tray which sold in his shops at Pounds 4.95 was 'total crap'. This
combined with recession and rising debt to bring the group close to
collapse. It changed its name to Signet but attempted to keep the Ratners
trading name.
Sales at Ratners fell by 8 per cent last year, and increases at renamed
stores were smaller than expected, suggesting that problems went deeper.
Mr James McAdam, chairman, was careful to avoid blaming the chain's demise
on Mr Ratner. 'It would be simplistic to suggest it was the result of one
remark,' he said. 'There were important demographic changes, changes in
customers' buying habits, and the recession.'
Signet has also decided to sell the lossmaking Salisbury's handbag chain,
making an Pounds 87.1m provision comprising Pounds 76.3m goodwill previously
written off to reserves and a Pounds 10.8m asset write-down. That increased
the pre-tax loss from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 85.4m.
Stripping out the provision and a Pounds 5.3m trading loss at Salisbury's,
the pre-tax profit for the jewellery businesses would have been Pounds 6.9m.
Group turnover amounted to Pounds 988m (Pounds 929m). Operating profits were
Pounds 37.3m (losses Pounds 2.1m).
The biggest improvement was in the 900-store Sterling group in the US, which
accounts for 60 per cent of Signet's business. Like-for-like sales increased
by 11 per cent, and operating profits doubled from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds
40.4m.
Like-for-like sales increased by 2 per cent in the UK jewellery business,
which after the closure of Ratners will comprise just Ernest Jones and H
Samuel, plus three experimental stores called Equa. It made operating
profits of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 20.2m losses).
Signet passed the dividend again, and Mr McAdam said it would be
'inappropriate' at this stage for a capital reconstruction, to pay back the
Pounds 64.3m owed to preference shareholders. Group debt was little changed
at Pounds 361.9m.
Losses per share, including the Salisbury's provision, increased from 19.2p
to 38.3p.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Bank chief may postpone retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has been asked by the board
to postpone his retirement, and is not now expected to retire until the end
of 1996, the bank said yesterday.
Mr Pitman, who is now 62, was previously expected to leave his post at the
end of 1995.
Even on that basis he would be continuing well beyond the bank's normal
retirement age of 60.
Assuming the bank's Pounds 1.8bn offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building
Society is allowed by the courts to go ahead, the transaction itself is not
expected to be completed until the second quarter of next year, and the task
of making the deal work will continue well beyond that date.
In other moves announced yesterday, Mr John Davies is to retire as deputy
chief executive at the end of October this year, but will remain a director
and become a deputy chairman after the annual meeting in 1995.
At the same time, Mr Michael Thompson, a deputy chairman, will retire from
the board.
Mr Alan Moore, director of corporate banking and treasury, will become
deputy chief executive and treasurer from the beginning of November 1994.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: W'hampton &amp; Dudley edges ahead to Pounds
17.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries yesterday reported slightly higher
first-half profits, helped by a 4.8 per cent increase in turnover and a
modest improvement in trading margins.
Pre-tax profits, including a Pounds 12,000 contribution from property
disposals, increased by 3.4 per cent to Pounds 17.2m in the 26 weeks to
April 3.
The comparable figure of Pounds 16.7m included property disposals profits of
Pounds 677,000.
Earnings per share slipped to 17.5p (17.7p) mainly reflecting an increased
tax charge of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.03m). The interim dividend is lifted
from 4.7p to 5.1p. The shares closed 11p higher at 554p.
Turnover increased to Pounds 112.4m (Pounds 107.3m) although total barrelage
slipped by 1.7 per cent mainly because of the run-off of low margin brewing
contracts which came with the Camerons brewery acquisition in late 1991.
Mr David Thompson, managing director, said turnover benefited from a strong
performance by restaurants and managed houses. Covers in the Milestone
Restaurants rose by 3.4 per cent on a like-for-like basis and by 27.6 per
cent in the group's Taverns.
Trading profits increased by 6.3 per cent to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 18.5m)
highlighting a solid performance by the group's brands, which include
Banks's Mild and Camerons Scotch.
Mr David Miller, chairman, noted that in the north-east good news about the
economy has been rare and the group's customers have not felt any
improvement in their circumstances.
Instead, he suggested 'improvements to trading have been driven more by
uplifts to pubs, acquisition and market share gains in free trade'.
Trading margins improved from 17.3 per cent to 17.5 per cent, mainly due to
improved productivity, higher income from games machines, which grew by 11.4
per cent, but partly offset by higher pub repair costs which rose by 12.7
per cent.
COMMENT
Wolverhampton and Dudley's management is refreshingly honest about the state
of the beer market and the pressures on industry margins. Nevertheless,
these are solid results and a good base to build on. Comparisons in this 52
week year - last year covered 53 weeks - will be made more difficult by the
higher tax charge which is likely to rise from 30.4 per cent to 32.5 per
cent, and by lower property profits. However, pre-tax profits should reach
Pounds 37m for earnings of 37.2p. The shares are trading on a prospective
p/e of 14.9 and look a reasonable buy.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Putting the right leaves on a classic
English tree - Neil Buckley looks at the well-cut and tailored expansion
plans of Aquascutum's new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The favourite tailor of Lady Thatcher might not necessarily be expected to
be so popular in Shanghai. But China is one of the markets Aquascutum has
its eye on.
The arrival at the group's headquarters on London's Regent Street last
November of a new chief executive, Mr James Pow, a 42-year-old Scot, has
brought a new era of expansion and brand development.
It parallels the changes occurring elsewhere on this famous shopping street.
Towards Oxford Circus, Liberty, the retailing and fabric group, is
enfranchising its non-voting shares, and virtually next door, Dickins &amp;
Jones, part of the newly-floated House of Fraser group, is to undergo a
Pounds 3m revamp. A few doors down, Hamleys, one of the world's best-known
toy retailers, has undergone a Pounds 1.3m refit and has just been
successfully floated.
Aquascutum, one of the UK's most prestigious clothing and retail groups
whose name means 'water shield', was founded in 1851 when Mr John Emary
patented a process for shower-proofing woollen fabric.
In the first world war, Aquascutum used the technique to develop the first
trench coat for officers, which later became popular civilian wear. By the
1980s it had become a premium British brand alongside the likes of Burberry,
Daks, Jaeger and Austin Reed with operations in Europe, east Asia and North
America and sales of close to Pounds 50m a year. It found favour with Lady
Thatcher after providing her with coats for a trip to Moscow.
However, late in the decade this most traditional of retailers was facing
pressure from a dissident shareholder group for a radical shake-up. That
ended in April 1990 with the Pounds 74m takeover by Renown, Japan's largest
clothing manufacturer.
While the takeover helped the group to expand its business in east Asia,
Aquascutum by last autumn was stagnating. Then came Mr Pow. Formerly with
Hackett, a subsidiary of Dunhill, and responsible for opening Hackett's
flagship store in London's Sloane Square, he understood the potential of
premium British brands.
He realised, as he puts it, that 'the Aquascutum label was sitting on a
goldmine if it refocused itself'. In less than six months he has swept
through the company, holding presentations of his plans in management
offices, stores and on factory floors.
The first task was to reorganise the management - bringing divisions in
Canada, the US, Europe and east Asia together under one headquarters and
centralising functions wherever possible.
Mr Pow says the divisions were run as separate empires, but with a 'spider's
web of overlapping functions'.
He cut 40 jobs in the UK, mainly in service functions in Regent Street, with
similar cost-cutting programmes in the US and Canada. He appointed a
creative director, operations director, finance director and sales director
responsible for both the retail and wholesale sides of the business - all
with worldwide responsibility.
The next priority was to regain control of the Aquascutum brand.
Aquascutum, says Mr Pow, represents 'the classic English company worldwide'.
But it had licensed the name to manufacturers who had used it on unsuitable
and poor-quality products from bed linen to jewellery, far removed from the
quality clothing for which it had been a byword.
Mr Pow aims to ensure that the name appears only on quality goods and has
set up a London-based international merchandise committee to monitor the
'price, imagery and general aesthetics' of every Aquascutum product sold
worldwide.
He also intends to modernise Aquascutum's core raincoat range. 'Fifteen
years ago, the company didn't look at what was happening in the coats area.
Lightweight textiles were regarded as not suitable for a traditional house.'
Now, Aquascutum will be looking at high-technology performance fabrics, such
as 'memory fibres', which are conditioned always to return to their original
state - 'solar fibres' which retain heat from the sun's rays, and fine
waterproofed wools.
Furthermore, it plans a range of branded sports and leisure wear, especially
in the sailing and ski-wear markets. Both the new raincoats and leisure wear
ranges should be on sale by spring 1995.
By introducing these, Mr Pow hopes to attract a younger clientele - current
typical customers are in their mid-40s 'with a fairly good lifestyle, who
currently buys three or four main labels'. However, he says the business
needs to attract customers of 35 and upwards to build up the brand for the
future.
Other strategies are being adopted to entice shoppers into the stores. Work
will shortly begin on refitting the Regent Street flagship store inside and
out, with each floor given a different theme - manor house, town house and
stately home - designed to capture the store's quintessential Englishness.
Stores in New York and Boston in the US will be similarly refurbished.
Mr Pow sums up what he is doing like this: 'I recognised that Aquascutum was
a very strong tree. All the branches were there, but they had been covered
by the wrong leaves.'
The final part of his strategy involves expanding the group's international
business. New stores are planned for the US in Chicago, Washington and San
Francisco over the next three years as well as three stores in Prague.
Aquascutum also hopes to open a joint venture retail operation in Shanghai
later this year.
Mr Pow believes that Aquascutum will be as popular in China as it is
elsewhere in east Asia - especially in Japan, where it has more than 120
in-store outlets. It has benefited from the experience of its parent Renown,
which already has four Chinese joint ventures.
'The Shanghai-ese are already the biggest capitalists in the world,' he
adds.
Mr Pow says his reforms are already bearing fruit, with sales currently
running 22 per cent ahead of the same period last year, and 9 per cent above
budget.
The likely cost of his regeneration plan for Aquascutum is Pounds 10m to
Pounds 15m, but funding is already in place, and the pay-back period is
expected to be less than two years.
'I can see the headroom in the business,' says Mr Pow, 'and so can the
banks.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Premier Health cuts losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.91m were announced by Premier Health Group, the
healthcare services concern, for the year to December 31. There were
restated losses of Pounds 9.37m for 1992.
The result was struck after Pounds 640,000 exceptional charges resulting
from the sale of IMC Europe, its continuity sales arm, and Pounds 486,000
refinancing and restructuring costs.
The company said the year was one of consolidation, including the
refinancing completed on September 3, which included a capital reduction
involving the cancellation of Pounds 16.8m share capital and Pounds 26.5m
share premium against the deficit on the profit and loss account.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 17.2m) including Pounds 173,000
(Pounds 4.22m) from discontinued activities. Increased operating losses of
Pounds 2m (Pounds 595,000) were 'disappointing', the company said, but
reflected the rebuilding of Nursing Management Services, its international
healthcare business which has relocated from California to Atlanta.
There were losses of Pounds 203,000 from IMC and its disposal in April
marked the final step in focusing the group on healthcare.
Losses per share fell to 1p (3.2p).

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brackenbridge to expand as new chairman is
appointed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Brackenbridge, the bridalwear retailer formerly known as Cupid,
firmed 2p to 13 1/2p yesterday on the appointment of Mr George Wardale as
executive chairman.
Mr Wardale has overseen a smart recovery at French Connection, the
USM-traded fashion clothing group, since taking the chair in February 1992.
Mr Hugh Osmond, one of a team of investors which effectively rescued Cupid
after it breached banking covenants, confirmed that the group would be
seeking acquisitions. 'We haven't brought George on board just to run the
existing business,' he said, adding that any purchase would be 'bigger
rather than smaller'.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fleming Indian Trust Pounds 16m short of
target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Fleming Indian Investment Trust, the first London-listed trust to
specialise in India, has raised Pounds 84m from a placing and public offer -
short of its original Pounds 100m target.
Mr Patrick Gifford, chairman of Fleming Investment Trust Management, said he
was delighted by the response to the fund against a background of difficult
stock market conditions.
The public offer brought in Pounds 26.4m, of which Pounds 3.4m was an
application on behalf of Robert Fleming Investment Trust. An initial placing
raised Pounds 54.6m, with an additional 2.94m shares taken up as a
consequence of the level of applications in the public offer.
The proportion of the total which came from private investors - either
directly or via intermediaries - was comparatively large for a trust of this
highly-specialised, risky nature.
Shares are being issued at 100p with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis.
Separate dealings in the shares and warrants are due to start on May 26.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: McKechnie raises Pounds 11m from South
African sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McKechnie, the plastics and metal components group, has raised Pounds 11m
from the sale of Cobra, its sole South African investment, and has further
built up its presence in Australia through a Pounds 6m acquisition.
The company sold Eachairn Holdings, which holds an 18.8 per cent stake in
Cobra, a bathroom products manufacturer, to Delta, the UK electricals
company.
Mr Michael Ost, McKechnie's chief executive, said: 'The disposal of
McKechnie's last remaining interest in South Africa would provide funds for
the development of its other businesses.'
Over half of it is already invested, through the purchase of Regency Group
for ADollars 12.5m (Pounds 5.99m). Regency manufactures shower screens and
wardrobes and also produces and markets security doors and pool fencing.
Regency fits in with McKechnie's other Australian interests in bathroom and
security products. It demonstrates the Walsall-based company's determination
to expand its core businesses in what has already become an important market
place for the group.
Last year, it acquired businesses in New Zealand and Australia, and in the
six months to January, the Pacific region contributed Pounds 5.3m to profits
before interest, representing 38 per cent of the total.
The company is also expanding in the UK, and recently announced the agreed
Pounds 28m takeover of Linread, a Midlands manufacturer of fasteners and
precision components.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BAT commits Dollars 40m to Volga factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the Anglo-American tobacco and insurance company, is taking
another step into the former Soviet Union with a Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m)
investment in a Russian cigarette factory.
BAT is buying about 75 per cent of the shares in the Saratov Tobacco
Factory, which is situated on the Volga, about 700km south-east of Moscow.
The announcement came only days after the group agreed to invest Dollars
200m in return for a majority stake in the tobacco industry of the former
Soviet republic of Uzbekistan.
In both cases BAT said its priority was to increase the quantity and quality
of the cigarettes produced.
The Saratov factory currently makes approximately 5bn cigarettes a year, a
total which BAT plans to increase to 10bn over three years.
The company is committed to investing a total of Dollars 40m, including the
purchase price, over the period.
Mr Ulrich Herter, managing director of BAT's tobacco businesses, said: 'This
is an important first step in our investment plans for Russia. We have been
very impressed with the management team at Saratov, who have negotiated with
a real sense of purpose and commitment, enabling us to make rapid progress.
'This augurs well for our future co-operation.'
BAT is also in advanced negotiations with the Java Factory in Moscow, which
currently makes about 14bn cigarettes a year.
The two factories together would have potential capacity of 30bn cigarettes
a year, compared with a total Russian market of some 250bn.

FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dobson Park Pounds 4.8m in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dobson Park Industries, the industrial electronics and toys group which last
year merged its mining equipment business with a rival, yesterday reported
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.81m compared with a Pounds 714,000 loss.
The results for the six months to April 2 were struck after a Pounds 498,000
profit on the sale of land and buildings while there was a Pounds 4.36m loss
last time on the disposal of the Power Tools and Revere Aerospace
businesses.
Turnover fell from Pounds 71.8m to Pounds 46.6m, but excluding discontinued
operations and mining equipment sales for the first quarter turnover was
marginally ahead of last time's Pounds 45.2m.
The group combined its mining equipment side with Meco International, a 1989
buy-out from the division of Dowty Group, in January last year to form
Longwall International.
Earnings per share of 2.49p compared with losses of 1.12p and the interim
dividend is maintained at 1.2p.
Commenting on the results, Mr Alan Kaye, chairman, said the improvement in
profits 'mainly resulted from the earlier substantial reorganisation
measures and the continued application of stringent operational controls'.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 4.09m), but a Pounds 1.84m
contribution from associates boosted net operating income to Pounds 4.49m
(Pounds 4.1m). Net interest costs were Pounds 181,000 (Pounds 454,000).
All divisions contributed to the improved performance. However, Mr Kaye said
that except for the improvement in the toys and plastics division, the group
had not benefited so far from improving economic conditions in the UK and
US.
The industrial electronics division lifted operating profits to Pounds 2.56m
(Pounds 2.18m) on flat turnover of Pounds 37.8m (Pounds 37.5m) while toys
and plastics contributed Pounds 525,000 (Pounds 254,000) on turnover of
Pounds 8.55m (Pounds 7.7m). The group's share of mining equipment profits
increased to Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 1.3m).

FT  21 MAY 94 / A public queen and a private person: Jurek Martin unravels
the legacy of a First Lady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On both sides of the Atlantic this week, the tabloid pack was massing, but
only in London did it sink its teeth into a royal target. On Thursday night,
in a spacious Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis died from cancer, not only free at last from the camera's prying
lenses but with her own privacy intact.
That this should be so is remarkable. For the public scrutiny which is the
lot of British royalty was first elevated to its current pitch more than 30
years ago by American fascination, soon to spread around the world, with the
glamorous young woman married to the handsome young 35th president of the
United States, who together briefly formed America's royal family.
Mrs Onassis (or Jackie or Jackie O, after her marriage to the Greek shipping
magnate) was never out of the news. But this graceful icon of a new form of
American womanhood, alternately the subject of much adulation and some
vilification, came to the end of her life almost prosaically, as a private
citizen, as a grandmother, and as a career woman.
The span of her public life, from Jacqueline Bouvier, the debutante, to a
senior editor's job at Doubleday, the publishers, is in its always
privileged and off-centred way very much the American story of the times.
She glittered in the 1950s with her marriage to the ambitious young
politician from Massachussetts in a decade when her country was
rediscovering the taste of prosperity after the war.
She dazzled in the White House of the 1960s, as a new generation took over
Washington and made power and style inseparable. Part of her enduring appeal
was because, as Gloria Steinem, the feminist writer, recently put it, 'she
is the remaining familiar face from a time of hope in this country'.
As that hope crumbled, she suffered, and her country saw the agony etched on
her face, as John Kennedy was shot to death next to her in Dallas, and
again, five years later, when her brother-in-law, Robert F Kennedy, was cut
down in Los Angeles. The first assassination was a seminal moment in the
development of television as a mass medium and she was its first tragic
heroine.
She escaped in 1968 into a second marriage and great wealth with Aristotle
Onassis, an international jetsetter who blazed the way for a later
generation of what has come to be known as Eurotrash. In so doing, she
married a succesful businessman much older than her - and would be described
in today's terms as the ultimate 'trophy wife'.
Then, though she never needed financially to earn another cent, she went to
work, just as American women began to spread themselves into employment.
Finally, she spent the last 15 years or so of her life as the constant
companion of a man who was never divorced from his wife.
Of course, much of her early fame was based on her marriages, especially to
a Kennedy, the closest the US has come to a royal dynasty and as flawed as
most of the European varieties. It was not publicly known then that the
president chased women in droves and the partnership seemed to conform
precisely to the image of the king and queen of Camelot.
But, for reasons that now seem understandable, she seemed to have kept her
personal distance from that most extraordinary of American families. After
JFK's death, she and her two surviving children rarely joined the summer
clan gatherings on Cape Cod. And she married Onassis just months after RFK
was laid to rest with what was seen as scant regard for the sensibilities of
a country which thought she should remain a Kennedy queen forever.
That relationship was the only one which temporarily tarnished her
reputation. The supermarket magazines portrayed her as snobbish, avaricious
and self-centred, forever on shopping trips with bottomless pockets. The
Onassis connection returned to haunt her later, in 1988, when she was
criticised for refusing to attend the funeral of her stepdaughter, Christina
Onassis.
But her greatest achievement must surely be that it is still possible even
for those on whom the public spotlight is always turned to preserve privacy
and dignity. That ability may have been innate, for she was always a
disciplined character (a lifelong heavy smoker, she hardly ever allowed
herself to be caught in public with a cigarette in her mouth). She was also
taught in a tough school by a Kennedy family which, whatever its qualities,
was never tolerant of privacy.
Just last month Hillary Rodham Clinton, no softie herself, was musing on the
conflict between public demands and private considerations and seemed half
to admit that her emphasis on the latter, motivated in good measure by the
imperative of protecting her daughter, was misplaced.
Mrs Onassis, also a good mother, would probably have disagreed with her  -
and may have done so when the two women met privately during and after the
1992 election campaign. Mrs Clinton acknowledged as much in a tribute
yesterday, recalling that Mrs Onassis had once told her: 'if you bungle
raising your children, I don't think whatever else you do matters very
much.'
To that end, in the last 20 years of her life, just about the only
interviews she gave were about her work in publishing - and she cut off
those friends who had the temerity to talk about her to the media. One who
did speak observed, anonymously but kindly, that it 'is queer that her
public persona and real self should be so unlike'.
First Ladies often learn the hard way to be tough. For some, like Pat Nixon
and Betty Ford, who was thrust into the job on short notice, the lessons
were unbearably painful. But a modern lineage which runs from Eleanor
Roosevelt through Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan to the present incumbent
reveals a group of women expected not only to support their husbands but
also to develop with determination their own agenda, with Mrs Clinton and
Mrs Roosevelt pushing furthest into the policy arena.
Mrs Onassis was true to this pedigree. Her distinctive contribution was to
be a beacon of modern American style - practically the inventor of it. As
such she set standards for subsequent First Ladies long after her pill box
hats, outsize sun glasses and designer dresses had passed out of fashion.
These standards and this style, which reduced even Charles de Gaulle to
blithering incoherence in admiration, have never quite been emulated since
though not, as Mrs Reagan showed, for want of trying.
That might not seem substantive for a country founded on good republican
principles, but fascination with royalty has not been extinguished by 218
years of independence. And in Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, public queen and
private person, America was served by a role model which nations with
monarchies going back centuries might well envy.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Little joy in a good news week: Perils may lurk beneath
optimistic forecasts for steady economic growth in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month's UK economic statistics have confounded the Cassandras. Although
yesterday brought news of a fall in bank lending in April, the overall
picture is of an economy that is growing well, with low inflation in spite
of last month's tax increases.
The past fortnight has brought news of rising first-quarter industrial
output, record retail sales last month, a fall of 260,000 in unemployment
over the past year and the lowest rate of underlying retail price inflation
for a generation. Both Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England, have held out the prospect of
an extended period of steady growth.
'The opportunity that we have now,' said Mr George, 'is to continue the
expansion at or perhaps a bit above its recent rate, bringing a continuing
gradual fall in unemployment, with continuing low inflation, for several
years ahead.'
However, Mr George made clear that 'this won't come about automatically or
of its own accord'. Rosy though Britain's outlook seems, there are some
worries.
In spite of the welter of official figures over the past two weeks and the
plethora of comment that these have generated, Britain is still largely
shrouded in statistical fog. The data that policymakers and markets have
been given on trade, manufacturing output and retail sales are, to varying
degrees, unreliable.
A big question mark continues to hang over Britain's trade figures even
though the Central Statistical Office and the Customs and Excise last week
unveiled the results of a far-reaching review and quality audit of the new
system used to collect trade data in the European Union, known as Intrastat.
The CSO's analysis resulted in only a small upwards revision of last year's
visible trade deficit to Pounds 13.7bn from Pounds 13.4bn previously. But it
has failed to convince many UK economists. The Treasury's independent
forecasters, the so-called six 'wise men', said this week that they 'remain
concerned about the reliability of the trade figures'. Some panel members
still found the figures 'implausible' and suggested that the annual trade
deficit could be understated by Pounds 3bn.
Distorted figures for trade and export prices have potentially serious
implications for our understanding of domestic UK economic activity. Because
industrial production figures are largely computed by adjusting output or
sales data to take account of price increases, any error in the way
Britain's export prices have been measured could have a big effect on the
figures for manufacturing output and economic growth.
Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist of Goldman Sachs International and a member
of the Treasury panel, believes official statistics could have overestimated
the rise in UK export prices by about 4 to 6 per cent. In that case
manufacturing output could have been underestimated by about 1.5 to 2 per
cent and real economic growth in 1993 by about 0.5 per cent.
In his contribution to the recent discussions of the 'wise men', Mr Davies
observed that UK gross domestic product, instead of growing at an annual
rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent in recent quarters, 'might be revised to show
growth of 3 to 3.5 per cent'.
Such uncertainties make it extremely difficult to forecast the economy and
to assess how much slack remains following the recession. Doubts about the
amount of spare capacity in turn add to the difficulties of assessing how
far the UK is threatened by a rebirth of inflation.
Even the shortest of short-term forecasts of inflation can go wrong. Twelve
days ago, the Bank of England published a projection that the April's annual
rate of underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, would
move above 2.5 per cent towards 3 per cent. As figures this week showed, it
fell to 2.3 per cent in April from 2.4 per cent in March.
The current low level of retail price inflation is good news. But it
reflects past events and gives no guarantee of future price stability.
It is concern about future inflation that has prompted the Bank of England,
the Treasury and the Department of Employment to sound the alarm about
rising wages. Wednesday's news of a 4 per cent underlying increase in UK
average earnings in the year to March was well above market expectations of
a 3.5 per cent rise. Even though the jump largely reflected higher bonus and
overtime payments, the general level of wage settlements is also moving
upwards.
Rising pay may be starting to chip away at Britain's international
competitiveness. According to Mr Robbie Gilbert, the Confederation of
British Industry's director of employment affairs: 'Earnings are feeding
through into unit labour costs, which are also moving upwards, while those
of Germany and the US are moving down.'
The rise in incomes, together with falling mortgage rates and a run-down of
savings, helps explain the continued strength of consumer demand. The
recovery of the past two years has been remarkable for having been sustained
entirely by growth in consumption. Trade, even allowing for deficient
statistics, is thought to have made a negative contribution to UK economic
growth last year. On balance, the Treasury's panel of wise men expects that
trade will continue to make a small negative contribution to GDP this year
and next, as imports grow slightly faster than exports in volume terms.
There has been little sign so far of an upturn in investment.
However, the trend in investments may be about to turn. The Bank of England
has pointed out that the UK corporate sector came through the last recession
with greater profitability than in the previous two recessions. Although a
minority of companies continues to be burdened by excessive debts, the
overall financial position of UK companies is strong. The Treasury panel
generally expects investment growth of about 5 per cent this year and a
further rise of about 6.5 per cent in 1995.
A revival of investment cannot come too soon if the recovery is to gain in
breadth and strength. There are signs, however, that the reluctance of
companies to spend on plant, machinery and buildings may be part of a bigger
problem of adjusting to the changed economic conditions of the 1990s.
Recent surveys conducted by the CBI and Bank of England indicate that
worries about inadequate rates of return are curbing capital spending. The
Bank has suggested that, after 20 years in which inflation has averaged
nearly 10 per cent, companies have not yet adjusted their horizons to
Britain's new low inflation environment.
Similar adjustment problems affect the population at large. In his speech to
the CBI this week, Mr Clarke lamented that 'the public appear still to
believe we are in a recession' two years into recovery. 'Too many people
still hanker after the go-go growth in living standards they enjoyed in the
years of boom,' he said.
Such news is especially bad for Mr Clarke. While the chancellor underlined
this week that he and Mr George 'share the same aim of low inflation and
sound money', he is acutely aware of the absence of a 'feel-good factor' in
the current recovery when his party is being hammered in the opinion polls
and faces defeat in the European elections.
The divergence of interests between Mr Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr
Clarke, the politician, may explain the nuanced differences with Mr George
on whether to lower interest rates. These emerged when the minutes of their
meeting at the end of March were published this week.
But if Mr Clarke is serious in saying that he 'does not want a boom because
boom gets followed by bust', he may have to get used to a joyless recovery.
And if growth turns out to be faster than recent statistics suggest, he
could be discussing an increase rather than a reduction in interest rates
with Mr George before the year's end.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not just a case of economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER BACKHOUSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Starkie is incorrect in ascribing inadequate economic benefits to
the CrossRail scheme (Letters: 'CrossRail would be folly', May 18). Few, if
any, of London's great tube schemes ever showed an adequate rate of return
on the capital invested in them but they made and continue to make an
indispensable contribution to the life and economy of London. So it will be
with CrossRail. London is a major block to through travel. It takes as long
to go from Ilford to Paddington, a modest 11 miles, as it does from
Paddington to Oxford which is five times further. As the commercial
functions of London have dispersed to suburbs and the south-east, the need
for better through services and orbital routes has increased. CrossRail is
just one of the schemes that should be provided.
Unfortunately the government prefers to pour money into road schemes of
dubious value in the countryside rather than invest in the network of rail
services London needs to maintain its position as a world-class capital.
Your editorial ('CrossRail debacle', May 12) was right about the need for
CrossRail.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: No nasty surprises on exercise of
warrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERNEST FENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Serious Money: 'Robbing Peter to pay Peter' (14 May), discussed points
raised in the latest Credit Lyonnais Laing Investment Trust yearbook. You
added, however, your own point at the end on warrants.
We feel it is important to clarify a recent, and unfortunately misinformed,
view which seems to have arisen concerning warrants; namely that upon
exercise of warrants the net asset value experiences an unforeseen fall,
potentially catching investors unawares.
Investment trust companies which have issued warrants publish two net asset
values; one on an 'undiluted' basis, ie, a valuation of the existing
portfolio, and the other on a 'diluted' basis, ie, a valuation of the
portfolio assuming all warrants in issue have been exercised (increasing the
assets and number of shares).
It is standard practice in the investment trust industry to use the diluted
NAV for valuing the company if warrants are 'in the money and dilution would
occur', ie, if the undiluted NAV is higher than the exercise price of the
warrants, making it likely that warrant holders may exercise. The AITC
follows this practice in monthly information service as does the Financial
Times in its London share service. Discounts published are based on the
lower, diluted NAV.
As a result, investors are not subject to a nasty surprise when the final
exercise of warrants takes place. This is because the lower NAV has been
used when applicable throughout the life of the warrant and discounts
published have reflected this.
The investment trust industry appreciates the importance of ensuring
investors have accurate and meaningful figures on which to base decisions.
The AITC has been careful to ensure best practice in use and publication of
diluted and undiluted NAVs when valuing investment trusts.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bias to fee-based advisers who are
weak on specifics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN DONOVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your excellent series on fee-based financial advisers (Weekend: Finance
and the Family) by Joanna Slaughter was perhaps too heavily biased in their
favour.
Commission earners may be over-anxious for clients to deal or buy a product
but fee-earners are primarily motivated by a desire to get 'funds under
management'. What happens to those funds is as often a matter of luck as
judgment.
Ms Slaughter may or may not have noticed that fee-earners tend to be strong
on generalities but weak on specifics. Commission earners seem to be more
market-oriented and this may give their clients the edge when it comes to
bottom line performance.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Let us drink Evian: Is the City swapping wine for water?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some London executives mourn the days when their City staff went down to the
wine bars in Bow Lane to drink from personalised bottles of port. 'In those
days you could always pretend you were someone else and get a free glass of
port,' says one corporate finance manager.
Today, wine bar owners are just as likely to set aside crates of Evian for
their business customers. A report this week that six out of 10 senior
managers never touch alcohol during the day was corroborated by many
financiers. They agreed with the findings of the Portman Group, which is
sponsored by eight UK drinks companies to encourage 'sensible drinking'.
The stereotype - and sometimes the reality - of a London business lunch in
the early 1980s was that it began at noon, ended at 3.30pm and involved gin
and tonic, several bottles of wine, and brandy.
Business lunches in the 1990s are decidedly more restrained. 'The old days
of a decanter of port hitting the table and lunch going on until 4pm bit the
dust at the end of the 1980s,' says Alex Sandburg, chairman of College Hill,
a financial public relations company. 'At the banks where I go for lunch
everyone goes for the tomato juice and water before lunch and then has a
glass of wine with the meal.'
Inside corporate dining rooms, executives and their guests are limiting
themselves to one or two glasses of wine. At the investment bank SG Warburg,
one dining room has traditionally been dry, while guests in another dining
room, where alcohol is served, 'rarely empty a bottle of wine'.
Lunches are shorter and more strictly businesslike. 'Lunch means getting
down to some pretty hard stuff,' says one merchant banker.
Many other City bosses note a change in corporate culture. 'Before, by the
time you got back from lunch at 3.30pm, the market was closed. It was not an
issue whether you could function or not,' says an investment bank analyst.
'Now, with much longer trading days and people having meetings after the
market closes, people are a bit more responsible and are drinking less.'
At some companies alcohol consumption has fallen victim to policy reforms as
well as culture. BT has an alcohol-free building. At Shell UK and Shell
International headquarters, alcohol is generally kept off the premises,
except for special occasions such as Christmas or retirement parties.
National Westminster Bank has closed down its two employee bars.
Recession and increased competition have exacerbated the trend towards fizzy
water. 'There is more anxiety about business, and the pace of it has
increased,' says Anthony Cardew, chairman of Cardew &amp; Co, a financial public
relations company. 'People want to be on the ball at all times.'
Such attitudes do not seem to have taken root across the Channel. Most
French businessmen still appear to see wine and lunch as inseparable. 'Most
of my clients will have a glass or two of wine at lunch,' says one merchant
banker. 'Overall we may drink less than we did in the past, but that is
perhaps because the lunches are often shorter, more Anglo-Saxon.'
In the US, business people have been abstemious for much longer. 'I would
not want someone to see me drinking alcohol at lunch,' says a financial
analyst at Wertheim Schroeder, the investment bank, in New York. 'It would
raise eyebrows. I would not even have a glass of wine.'
In Japan, while most financiers would also consider it unconscionable to
drink at lunch, they have no qualms about relaxing with clients after hours
at restaurants and karaoke bars.
'The important thing is to let the clients know how much you're spending on
them,' says Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson, the investment
managers. During the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s, banks and brokers
were prepared to spend upwards of Y500,000 (Pounds 3,185) a night on
entertaining clients, though recession has cramped the corporate
entertainment scene since then.
While similar economic constraints have afflicted the City, Derek Richards,
director of Smith NewCourt, the stockbroker, is sceptical about the notion
of a teetotal London. Business people are just changing the time of day that
they drink, he says. 'The wine bars are chock-a-block from 5pm to 6pm.'
Still, some - notably journalists - are lamenting the demise of the long
lunch. 'Have you ever known anybody tell you more over a glass of water than
a glass of good chablis?' asks Daniel McGrory, chief foreign correspondent
of the Daily Express. 'I mourn as everyone does the passing of the old lunch
customs of Fleet Street where we went out and behaved appallingly.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Just one funeral, four weddings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I've just caught up with Nigel Andrews' review of Four Weddings and a
Funeral (Arts: May 12). He appears to believe that the character I played
dies of Aids. He doesn't. Indeed, one of the many reasons that I wanted to
play the part was that it is almost unknown nowadays for a gay character to
die of anything else. I'm a little bewildered that Nigel Andrews should be
so confused about what Aids is like. Much nastier, Mr Andrews, than the
heart attack which so decisively and efficiently fells Gareth in Four
Weddings.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: A non-enterprising legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAN STRANESCU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is ironic some western companies are experiencing difficulties as
investors in Romania, for reasons to which they have themselves contributed
during Ceaucescu's years of forced industrial expansion ('Shoddy meets
quality in Transylvania', May 18).
Romania's swollen industries have absorbed for more than a generation large
numbers of impoverished farm workers with few relevant skills.
However low the resulting productivity, the dismally low pay helped achieve
international competitiveness in selected areas, including those which have
benefited Ikea as buyers of furniture 'for more than two decades'.
By the 'western standards' to which Mr Gunnerling (the specialist in turning
around failing companies) refers, Magura Codlea factory was as bankrupt then
as it is now. As such it is a good investment, particularly when the
Romanian furniture industry has adapted well to change over the past three
years and expanded its export markets.
What Ikea must address, however, beyond providing efficient production
facilities, is the cultural bias against true enterprise, an enduring legacy
of the Ceaucescu regime.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Man in the News: Rocket scientist with a billion-dollar
brain - Flavio Bartmann
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives, the complex financial instruments which Flavio Bartmann designs
and sells, earned his US investment bank Dollars 753m in revenue last year.
The trading floor by his office at Merrill Lynch's London headquarters is
packed with traders selling forwards, futures, options, swaptions and all
manner of financial exotica. Bartman has only one regret about the way his
working life has evolved.
'A year ago, I was flying to New York with my boss,' says the 41-year-old
Brazilian, 'and he asked me if I could start again, would I choose this job,
or being a professor at Harvard? I said I would take Harvard.' As he talks,
derivatives traders tap at rows of computers so sophisticated that they are
coveted by university mathematics departments.
Bartmann, a former assistant professor of statistics at Columbia University
in New York, is what old-fashioned bankers call a 'rocket scientist'. They
are people with advanced degrees and doctorates in mathematics, statistics,
even astrophysics, who have been lured in their hundreds by banks in Wall
Street and the City of London.
They need mathematical knowledge and ease with computer models because the
financial products they sell are so complicated that only mathematicians can
calculate the inherent risks. If a bank miscalculated these risks badly, and
sold billions of dollars worth of contracts that went wrong, its capital
could be wiped out by having to pay the bill.
That is not a happy prospect for the world's financial system, given that
the failure of any of the large US banks and investment banks which dominate
the Dollars 12,000bn derivatives market could drag down others. Central
banks such as the US Federal Reserve would probably have to prop up the bank
involved rather than risk a chain reaction across financial markets.
Derivatives contracts allow companies to swap obligations - for example by
exchanging variable interest payments on a loan with fixed ones - or buy or
sell a currency or a commodity at a fixed price in the future. This allows
them to 'hedge' risks, for example protecting themselves from losses if the
currency in which they are selling something falls in value.
Worry about derivatives is part of a more general concern that US banks are
increasingly using capital to take bets on financial markets. The latest
flurry of concern erupted this week when the US General Accounting Office
called for the derivatives trading of banks and investment banks to be
federally regulated. It said that the risk management systems of banks
contained weaknesses, and the US government was ill-prepared for the crisis
that could ensue from a large derivatives user defaulting.
Yet banks continue to pour money into recruiting rocket scientists to design
derivatives. Those that dominate the business make large profits from what
are called 'over-the-counter' derivatives - contracts designed by banks for
individual customers rather than standard contracts traded on exchanges such
as the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe).
The most money is to be made from the most bespoke - and therefore the
hardest to construct and understand - derivatives. Bartmann estimates that
50 per cent of Merrill's derivatives earnings come from products invented,
or combined, in the past five years.
The demand for this expertise means that US universities, from which most of
the cleverest traders are drawn, have little chance of paying enough to
retain them. An average swaps trader in London made between Pounds 140,000
and Pounds 280,000 last year. The best rocket scientists earn far more: at
Merrill Lynch about 10 derivatives specialists are thought to have been paid
more than Dollars 1m in 1993.
They have changed the atmosphere of trading floors. While the archetypal
trader of the 1980s was the brash, aggressive bond salesman, they are a
quieter, more introverted breed. One investment banker tells of wandering
past a room in which derivatives traders were discussing mathematical
formulae. 'It was like Re-Union Of The Nerds,' he says.
Bartmann, now a managing director and head of commodity derivatives at
Merrill, joined JP Morgan, the US bank, from Columbia in 1986. He had
degrees in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics from Brazilian
institutes, and a PhD in statistics from Princeton. He wanted a change, and
knew mathematicians who had been in the first wave to join Wall Street.
He joined a five-strong 'think tank' of scientists recruited en bloc by
Merrill in 1988. They included Judith Pearlstein, a computer programmer, and
Richard Malone, a mathematician. 'I would think up a quick and dirty answer
to a problem, Richard would turn it into a solid mathematical solution, and
Judith would programme it quick as a flash,' he recalls.
Bartmann argues that a lot of standard derivatives mathematics can be
understood quite easily, but the size and complexity of the
multi-billion-dollar portfolios held by banks require arcane skills. 'I
could sit here and in half an hour explain to you how to price a single
option, but it is quite different to manage daily risks in large
portfolios,' he says.
Such risks can only be calculated using mathematical models run on
computers. Yet no matter how clever the mathematics it involves, a model is
only as good as its assumptions. Many bank regulators worry that an
unpredicted financial event - for example a sustained divergence in dollar
and sterling interest rates - could undo such assumptions, leaving banks
exposed.
Bartmann says that most derivatives contracts are safe because banks match
one against another. 'If I buy a 10-year swap of a fixed obligation against
a floating one, and hedge it with futures, and then tomorrow I go out and do
exactly the opposite, there might be trillions of dollars involved, but
there is zero risk on any model,' he says.
Yet he admits that models can be stretched on the newest derivatives for
which underlying mathematics is still developing. He cites the example of a
currency swap 'index note' which emerged two years ago. 'When they were
first sold, I think that people did not fully understand the risks in them,
but in a matter of a few months or weeks, they caught up,' he says.
It is not only because banks gain the best profits on these new and untested
products that they most excite rocket scientists. They also provide more
intellectual interest than standard contracts. 'Sometimes you have very
repetitive days doing something very simple, and filling a lot of reports
in. I never had to do that at university,' Bartmann says, a little
wist-fully.
Yet most derivatives specialists who join banks do not return to academia.
The financial rewards in derivatives are far higher, and the opportunities
to do pure research at universities are growing scarcer. 'People come for
the money, and because there are fewer alternatives than before. The budget
for academic research in the States is much smaller,' says Bartmann.
Money for research is scarcely a problem at Merrill. The intellectual high
point of Bartmann's career there was preparing a 200-page proposal for the
ratings agency Moody's Investor Services, when Merrill invested Dollars 300m
of capital to set up a separate unit for derivatives trading in 1991. He had
to persuade the agency that the new unit was so safe that it deserved a
triple A rating.
The proposal is riddled with mathematical formulae, regressions and charts
demonstrating the risks of different portfolios of derivatives under
different trading conditions. 'We linked 32 computers together, and ran them
for a week to make the calculations,' says the investment banker who
sometimes wishes he was a professor. 'Of course, I knew the answer already.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Leading Article: On the Fed's coat tails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having teased the world's capital markets for three and a half months with
slow, small and painful increases in interest rates, the US Federal Reserve
this week showed a more decisive bent. In raising both the federal funds
rate and the largely symbolic discount rate by half a point apiece, the Fed
took its monetary policy closer to a neutral stance after a prolonged period
in which real interest rates had been held artificially low to restore the
banking system to health.
In the short run it was rewarded with a positive response in the bond
markets. Are things finally back to normal, after the period of turbulence
that has afflicted bond, equity and currency markets since February?
Not entirely, for reasons that will become apparent. But this is no
criticism of the Fed and its chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan. The Fed lacks the
autonomy of the Bundesbank. It operates in a political climate where it is
not easy to raise rates before there is general agreement on the necessity
to do so. Yet consensus invariably comes too late for monetary policy to
perform the task of pre-empting inflationary pressures as opposed to
fire-fighting when things are already out of control.
By describing his policy as a return to neutrality, the persuasive Mr
Greenspan has conveyed the impression that he is simply delivering a little
less of what everyone wants, rather than piling on the agony. And he appears
to have persuaded the administration that there is political advantage in
slowing growth in 1994 to pave the way for a buoyant economy before the 1996
presidential election.
His reward has been to see President Clinton accept the latest rise in
short-term interest rate with as much equanimity as the bond market. That is
not something that the average Fed chairman expects at this point in the
economic cycle.
Further turbulence
After a choppy period in which bond investors took fright at the robustness
of recent economic data and questioned the administration's commitment to
price and exchange rate stability, US bond prices are now more or less back
to where they were a month ago. One reason for thinking that the market
turbulence is not over yet is that so many other bond markets are in
precisely the same position. UK gilts are no exception, even after their
recent fillip. For while the premium in gilt yields over German bond yields
narrowed this week, the picture over one month is scarcely very different in
either country.
This tendency of the bond markets to move in sync, following the US lead,
means that many economies that lag far behind the US recovery are saddled
with unsuitable and unsustainable real long-term rates of interest. Exchange
rates are failing to compensate for these apparent misalignments in bond
rates. The implication, if this continues, is that some economies may have
to adjust to market perversity by retreating back into recession, since high
real bond rates can have a powerful contractionary influence.
Another more specific indication of the pent-up pressure is the behaviour of
the dollar. Despite the magnitude of the Fed's interest rate increase, the
US currency continued to defy those who expect currencies to respond to
interest rate differentials.
Market intervention
This was no doubt disappointing to US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who
had presumably hoped that the Fed's move would complete an operation that
started with a statement that he saw 'no advantage in an undervalued
currency' and which was buttressed by co-ordinated exchange market
intervention. The aim had been to put a floor under the dollar and
reactivate long-term capital flows into the US.
The trouble is that the industrialised countries balance of payments and
capital flows, like their economies, are out of line. Not only does the US
have a structural current account deficit; it is exporting long-term
portfolio capital again, having been a substantial capital importer under
the Reagan and Bush administrations.
But by knocking the stuffing out of US bond and equity markets with its
decision to tighten policy, the Fed has deterred portfolio investors from
abroad. And the Japanese, who have lost too much in dollar assets over the
past 10 years to take a statement from the US Treasury secretary on trust,
have pulled in their horns.
Confronted with this problem of a current account deficit and excessive
capital outflow, the US can either seek an adjustment by letting relative
prices change - letting the dollar drop - or have the adjustment come
through a change in economic activity in the US relative to its trading
partners. That means other countries growing faster.
The latter course is not impossible with signs of economic recovery in
Europe. And with the inflow of short-term capital into the US being replaced
by a build-up of official foreign reserves, notably in Japan, the
possibility of rapid Japanese money supply growth is on the cards again.
That would help to reignite Japanese economic growth which in turn would go
a long way to redressing the US problem.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Chance to turn the political tide: The battle for Germany's
presidency is a test of the coalition government's electoral strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chances are that by Monday evening the rather splendidly named Mr Roman
Herzog (his name means Roman Duke in English) will have been elected the
next federal president of Germany.
The bluff Bavarian judge who heads Germany's constitutional court is not the
most popular choice. That would have been Mr Johannes Rau, the former leader
of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), and prime minister of the
state of North Rhine-Westphalia since 1978.
Nor is the election all over bar the shouting. The complex arithmetic in the
cumbersome electoral college known as the federal assembly still has
political analysts scribbling alternative scenarios on the backs of their
envelopes.
But the political probabilities are that Mr Herzog will win through in the
third round of voting, where he requires a simple majority, to provide
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union with a much-needed
psychological boost in a marathon election year.
That is in spite of the fact that he is his own party's second choice of
candidate. Mr Kohl's first runner, the east German, Mr Steffen Heitmann, was
unceremoniously ditched when he proved to be altogether too gauche,
inexperienced and conservative to enjoy any cross-party backing.
It was inevitable that the outcome of the presidential vote would be decided
on the basis of party politics, once it was clear that it would fall in the
middle of no fewer than 18 other federal, state, local and European
elections.
In spite of the fact that the federal president's job is largely powerless
and ceremonial, it is highly symbolic and very visible. Above all at such a
crucial moment in the post-war history of the federal republic, when the
country is struggling with the unique task and expense of reunifying the
former communist east with the capitalist west, it bears a special
responsibility.
President Richard von Weizsacker, the incumbent, has used the post with
considerable success to promote a greater sense of national unity, at a time
of resentment on both sides of the national divide at the cost and pain of
the process. He has also worked tirelessly to reinforce Germany's
international image as a force for reconciliation and stability, and counter
any fears of the revival of an overbearing German national state at the
heart of Europe.
When a rash of racist attacks on asylum-seekers and foreign workers in
Germany threatened to dent that international image, Mr von Weizsacker was
among the first to speak out in condemnation, and urge practical action to
promote better race relations. In attending the funerals of the victims, and
visiting the bereaved, he demonstrated a considerably clearer political
instinct than most party politicians, including Chancellor Kohl himself.
His personal relations with the chancellor have become increasingly frosty,
both because of his publicly stated criticism of the whole party system, and
because of his tendency to preach from a high moral platform. Few close
observers doubt that his personal views are more national-conservative than
those of the passionately pro-European German chancellor.
Yet few would contest that Mr von Weizsacker's 10 years in office have
enhanced both the presidency, and Germany's national image. Everyone agrees
it would have been better not to have a party contest for the succession.
But nobody really knows how it could have been done.
In the event, the polling on Monday in the old Reichstag building in Berlin,
still awaiting refurbishment as the future home of the German parliament,
will be acutely political.
Ironically, the outcome hinges on the voting split not between the two main
parties of right and left - Mr Kohl's CDU and the opposition SPD - but on
the split within the minority Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior
partner in the Bonn coalition, eternal kingmaker of postwar politics, and
currently suffering a disastrous slump in prestige and popularity.
There are 1,324 members in the federal assembly - 662 from the Bundestag,
the directly elected lower house of parliament, and the same number from the
16 state parliaments. The vote is supposed to be secret, but the delegates
reflect the political composition of their respective institutions. That
gives Mr Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social
Union (CSU), 619 members in the assembly, the SPD 502, and the FDP 111.
After them come the Greens, with 44, the Democratic Socialists (the former
east German communists) with 33, and others, including the far-right
Republicans, with 15.
Apart from Messrs Herzog and Rau, there are two other candidates: Mrs
Hildegard Hamm-Brucher, a grand old lady representing the true liberal wing
of the FDP, who was put up by the party when it still looked as if Mr
Heitmann might run; and Mr Jens Reich, the only easterner standing, a
thoroughly independent-minded academic and former hero of the civic
revolution which overthrew the communist dictatorship there. Neither is
likely to dent the big parties' dominance, and the question is only when
they will withdraw from the race.
That would leave Mr Rau picking up pretty well united support from the left
 -still short of an overall majority - and Mr Herzog in the same position on
the right. The balance would lie in the hands of the fractious FDP.
The liberals are divided between Mr Klaus Kinkel, its leader and foreign
minister, who is inclined to back Mr Herzog, and thus the current coalition,
and Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister and would-be party
leader, who supports Mr Rau and a future coalition with the SPD. How they
split depends on how they read the political tea leaves in this election
year.
Mr Robert Leicht, editor-in-chief of the respected weekly newspaper Die
Zeit, traditionally SPD-inclined, argues that the FDP can only be truly
liberal by supporting Mr Rau. A vote for Mr Herzog, he says, would be a vote
to hang on to power in the present exhausted coalition at all costs.
Mr Rau has long been seen as an obvious candidate for the presidency, and as
one who could enjoy broad cross-party support. After the refusal of Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former FDP leader, to run for the office, it
appeared there could be a broad coalition behind him. But the SPD played its
cards too soon: by putting him up as the party candidate early in the race,
it embarrassed Mr Kohl into looking for his own alternative. Once he had
embarked on that exercise, there was no going back to a cross-party
compromise.
It must be said that Mr Rau is not everybody's cup of tea. He is himself
rather inclined to preach, a la Weizsacker, from his moral position as a
pious northern protestant. His health is also uncertain, since he had a
kidney operation in 1992. And given his former position as SPD party leader,
he is actually the most party political of all the candidates.
Mr Herzog, on the other hand, is very much a southerner in style and
temperament: in spite of his position as the ultimate arbiter of the
country's constitution, he is a humorous and often self-deprecating speaker,
a quality all too rare on the German political scene.
It counts against him in the public perception that he was always a close
ally of Mr Kohl. As a minister in the state government of Baden-Wurttemberg,
where he was responsible for law and order, he enjoyed the reputation of a
strict conservative. Yet since going to the constitutional court in
Karlsruhe, he has been seen far more as a legal liberal, suggesting an
altogether more humanitarian disposition.
Two factors could yet upset the Herzog bandwagon. One is the perception that
he is too conservative. The other is a possible revolt by easterners,
including those in the CDU.
He managed to stir up a controversy with an interview in which he apparently
expressed the view that, while all second- and third-generation foreigners
in Germany should be given every opportunity to take out German citizenship,
those who declined should be encouraged to return home.
Mr Herzog insists he was misunderstood. Most of the interview in question,
in Focus magazine, was devoted to a rather careful and balanced view of
German nationalism. 'I am convinced that the concept of nation, in itself,
is no longer a real force,' he said. 'The idea that we are historically all
of one blood is historical nonsense. Only an old Nazi could believe that.'
The second factor that could make it difficult for Mr Herzog is that his
relaxed southern attitude does not seem to appeal to the embattled
easterners. They are bitter at the failure of the campaign for an electable
eastern candidate, which Mr Kohl had promised. The CDU members in the east,
who won the unification elections in 1990 with ease, now face decimation in
the coming state and national elections. They may feel the need to show
their independence from Mr Kohl and the western establishment.
Those are the dangers, not just for Mr Herzog's candidacy, but also for the
chancellor himself: for he desperately needs a good result to boost his own
re-election prospects.
So far, the political omens seem to be improving for Mr Kohl. His own low
popularity is picking up, the economy is just starting to improve, and the
mood in the country at large, including the east, is gradually moving from
pessimism to optimism. The SPD, led by Mr Rudolf Scharping, is clearly ahead
in the opinion polls, but it is not as far ahead as it needs to be for a
clear victory in the general election in October. Everything is left to play
for.
If Mr Herzog can win the presidential poll decisively, it would be just the
public demonstration Mr Kohl needs to turn the tide.
If he were to lose, it would be politically disastrous: it would show that
the FDP no longer has any faith in its present coalition partners, and that
the chancellor's once-sure political touch has deserted him. It would be the
clearest indication yet of the beginning of the end.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Leadership Contest: Close call in Labour grassroots vote -
David Owen finds modernisers may just have the edge among constituency
members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The evidence shows that as far as the grassroots are concerned, it will be
a very close race.' Mr Patrick Seyd's forecast for the Labour leadership
contest carries more weight than most. A senior politics lecturer at the
University of Sheffield, he is probably Britain's leading expert on the
party's rank-and-file membership.
It was his book - co-authored with Mr Paul Whiteley - which two years ago
provided the statistical ballast to back up what many people had long
suspected: that the average constituency Labour party was no longer
dominated by hard-left activists.
The two men's research, based on a survey of more than 5,000 party members,
demonstrated that Labour's grassroots consists predominantly of middle-class
home owners in public-sector non-manual jobs, and nearly two-thirds are
male.
Mr Seyd said: 'While Labour's membership is principled, it is keen to get
power. The Kinnock reforms have grassroots support.'
These people - Labour's 250,000 party members - will have one-third of the
say, along with the two other segments of the party's electoral college,
over who succeeds John Smith.
The decidedly un-radical picture which emerges from Mr Seyd's book appears
to be a positive sign for Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the two Labour
modernisers who are most likely to run for the leadership. They may be
further helped by the steps taken by Labour in recent years to empower the
ordinary rank-and-file at the expense of dedicated activists.
This should ensure that even the least active members vote. According to Mr
Ian Cruickshank, chairman of the Glasgow Garscadden constituency Labour
party: 'I don't see many people not returning their ballot paper.'
The results of a survey conducted by Mr Seyd 18 months ago among 1,300 new
members who joined during the 1992 general election campaign seem to provide
further reassurance for the party's leading modernisers.
Asked who they would want to be leader if it were not Mr Smith, 26 per cent
said Mr Brown and 15 per cent Mr Blair. Mr John Prescott and Mr Robin Cook,
two of the leading potential traditionalist candidates, polled only 6 per
cent and 4 per cent respectively.
Mr Seyd, however, is cautious about the conclusions that should be drawn
from this, pointing out the survey took place when Mr Brown's star was at
its zenith.
He sets more store by a survey of the full membership sample on their
attitudes towards shadow-cabinet members. This ranked the four potential
candidates more or less equally.
Recent results of the annual elections to the constituency section of the
party's ruling national executive committee also point to a tight outcome.
While the hard-left vote has fallen sharply, the poll was topped last year
by Mr David Blunkett, a prominent traditionalist. Mr Blair and Mr Brown were
sixth and seventh of the seven candidates elected.
But inquiries around a random selection of constituencies suggest that the
modernisers may indeed have the edge in this section of the electoral
college. Mr Iain McIntosh, secretary of the west London Ealing Southall
constituency party - Labour's biggest in terms of membership - said he
thought Mr Blair's handling of the crime issue had 'resonated quite well' in
that 'very traditional' relatively poor community. Ealing Southall voted
'solidly' for Mr Smith and the deputy leader Mrs Margaret Beckett, and would
vote for a 'similar sort of ticket' this time, Mr McIntosh said.
If its turnout matches or exceeds the average, Ealing Southall will have the
biggest say of any constituency in deciding Labour's next leader since for
the first time all votes will count nationally. Under the old system, all
constituencies were given an equal weighting and all of a constituency's
votes were cast for one candidate. The change will work in favour of the
southern constituencies which tend to have a larger membership.
The chairman of a key Tory-held marginal critical to Labour's hopes of
winning the next general election predicts Mr Blair would 'probably have the
edge'. He added: 'This is a constituency where we came so close last time
there is a real will to win. People will be looking for someone who will win
over the last few wavering voters.'
In Glasgow Garscadden, with its relatively elderly constituency profile and
towering Labour majority, Mr Cruickshank said local members have 'a tendency
to be more to the left than the right' but 'not particularly hard-left'.
He predicted there would be a 'Scottish tinge' to the outcome in the
constituency. 'A lot of people say Gordon Brown would be the Scottish
successor to John Smith.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Admiral Crowe adds a hat to his collection: George Graham
reports on the diplomatic priorities facing the new US ambassador in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When he retired from the US navy in 1989, Admiral William Crowe presented
his collection of about 1,000 hats to a museum in his native Oklahoma.
'What I overlooked was that people assumed I continued to collect hats, so
they continued to send them to me,' he said.
On Tuesday he will add another hat to his collection when he arrives in
London as the US ambassador to the UK, just two weeks before President Bill
Clinton arrives to take part in D-day commemorations.
For Admiral Crowe, who was a midshipman at the Annapolis Naval Academy at
the time of the Normandy landings, the occasion offers an auspicious start
to a posting that may no longer be the plum it once was.
In an interview with British reporters in Washington, shortly after taking
his oath of office, Admiral Crowe was careful to play down the seriousness
of the policy differences between the US and the UK, most notably on
Northern Ireland and Bosnia.
'I have characterised our relationship as like a vast iceberg, and the
things we disagree on are the tip of the iceberg,' he said.
Admiral Crowe avoided detailed questions on Northern Ireland, but said one
of his priorities was to visit the region as soon as possible.
More importantly, however, Admiral Crowe, who served as chairman of the US
joint chiefs of staff under President Ronald Reagan, argues that differences
of opinion are inevitable in the uncertain world following the Soviet
Union's collapse.
'We lost the benchmarks of the cold war and the way forward is somewhat
murky, and not only for London and Washington,' Admiral Crowe said. 'In many
senses the whole international community is groping.'
Admiral Crowe acknowledges that Mr Clinton's foreign policy doctrine may be
'a little more vague than some of his critics would want' but insists that a
doctrine exists.
'The people who shape foreign policy are not given enough credit. The
international community is in disarray right now,' he said.
As a US ambassador, Admiral Crowe says his first priority will be to dispel
uncertainty over where his country stands.
'There's often an understanding among laymen that the purpose of diplomacy
is to be nice. I'm not sure that is the proper view. The purpose of
diplomacy is to make sure that the views of your country are properly
represented and conveyed,' he said.
Admiral Crowe, who wrote his Princeton doctoral thesis on 'The policy roots
of the modern Royal Navy, 1946-63,' is no stranger to the UK, although his
new residence in Regent's Park will be more lavish than his previous flat in
Kensington Church Street.
These larger quarters will soon be filled, however, with about 100 selected
items of headgear, ranging from western Stetsons and deerstalkers to
guardsmen's bearskins and Royal Navy antiques.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Sinn Fein hails 'step for peace'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of an end to the five-month impasse blocking progress towards peace in
Northern Ireland were lifted last night when a senior Sinn Fein figure
commented positively on London's response to questions about last December's
joint declaration.
Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of the ruling executive of the IRA's
political wing, said the government's decision to respond to republican
calls for clarification of the UK-Irish document represented 'a small step
in the slowly evolving peace process'.
Sinn Fein was determined to play a full and positive role in an effective
peace process, which must 'embrace everyone and exclude no one'.
Mr McGuinness's remarks came less than 24 hours after London stepped up
pressure on the IRA to halt its 25-year campaign of violence by publishing a
detailed commentary on Sinn Fein's 20 questions, answering one of them
directly.
The painstaking nature of the government's reply was welcomed by unionists
and nationalists alike.
Mr McGuinness hinted that Sinn Fein was unlikely to decide how to respond to
the government's comments until after next month's European elections,
saying its policy of undertaking broad consultations at all levels of its
membership would cause a delay.
Meanwhile, pressure on unionist paramilitaries to end their violence has
intensified. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said
yesterday that the Downing Street declaration had made clear there was no
distinction between republican or loyalist paramilitary oganisations
engaging in exploratory talks once the violence ended.
Mr Ruairi Quinn, a senior Irish cabinet minister, said Sinn Fein's initial
comments on the British response were encouraging. There were 'clearly
tensions within the Sinn Fein-IRA movement'. One could only hope they would
be resolved 'in the interests of peace'.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Remaining miners meet deadline for flexible hours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A majority of British Coal's remaining 9,300 miners yesterday met a deadline
that required them to accept more flexible working hours as part of a
package which also entitles them to a Pounds 6,000 lump sum. Miners signed
the deal after British Coal said no applications would be accepted after
midnight.
The two largest mining unions opposed the deal, which also provides maximum
redundancy payments of Pounds 27,000 - less than miners have previously
received but more than the statutory minimum.
By late yesterday 83 per cent of Midlands miners and 40 per cent of those in
the Yorkshire region had signed up. More were expected to follow

FT  21 MAY 94 / Hanson to shun British Coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the industrial conglomerate with worldwide coal interests, has ruled
itself out of buying any British Coal mines in the forthcoming privatisation
of the corporation.
It has decided not to make any payments to take part in the
pre-qualification exercise, one of Hanson's financial advisers said.
Companies considering bids must pay the government Pounds 15,000 by
Wednesday for each of the five regions in which they are interested. The
Department of Trade and Industry confirmed yesterday that companies that
failed to do so could not tender.
RTZ, the other large UK company with international coal interests, is
understood to be planning to pre-qualify in all five regions. It is
considered unlikely to make bids but wants to see the details of what is on
offer.
Hanson has often indicated it was an unlikely bidder but other companies
planning tenders had expected it to pay to register for the right to bid, if
only to keep its options open.
Both Hanson and RTZ have been put off by the likely fragmentation of the
industry. Although they would be able to bid for all five regions, the
chances of success in all are slim. The government has said it would
consider selling the whole industry to one bidder, but is keen to inject
competition into the coal market.
Each of the regions is tiny in comparison with RTZ's and Hanson's worldwide
interests and would therefore be un-attractive to them.
Several UK companies, including RJB Mining and Coal Investments, plan to pay
the Pounds 75,000 needed to qualify for all regions. Some will also pay to
qualify to bid for six 'non-core' pits which have been closed by British
Coal and are being offered separately from the regional packages.
Pre-qualification for each stand-alone pit will cost Pounds 5,000.
RJB Mining, led by Mr Richard Budge, is one of the few groups considering
tendering for all five regions. Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards,
former British Coal commercial director, is less likely to seek control of
all regions but wants to see what is on offer. Ryan Group, another coal
company, said yesterday it wanted to pre-qualify for the south Wales region.
It is also, in alliance with others, hoping to bid in north-east England and
Scotland.
Other companies likely to pre-qualify include Mining (Scotland), a
consortium which wants to buy the Scottish region, and Caledonian Mining,
which is interested in the north-east.
The Union of Democratic Mineworkers is considering bidding for the central
and south regions, and management buy-out teams are likely to emerge in
several regions.
The Yorkshire area of the National Union of Mineworkers will have to
re-ballot its members over its proposed transfer of assets to the national
union, the Certification Officer for Trade Unions and Employer Organisations
ruled yesterday, Robert Taylor writes.
The certification officer said he would give the reasons for his decision at
a later date. However, his office said that not all members of the Yorkshire
area had been accorded equal entitlement to vote.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Heseltine plans to expand training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals to expand youth training credits, to extend the Minis management
information system and to privatise the Civil Aviation Authority's air
traffic control are all expected in the government white paper on
competitiveness to be published on Tuesday.
The document, postponed for a week after the death of Labour leader John
Smith, will be given a high-profile launch by the prime minister and seven
cabinet ministers.
But it is expected to include few policy initiatives and even fewer
financial commitments.
One senior Whitehall official said: 'There is a lot of diagnosis of the
competitiveness problem and a lot of pulling together of existing
initiatives to show that we do have a strategic approach, but there is not
much genuinely new in it.'
The area which receives the most critical analysis is education and
training. The white paper will unveil an extension of career development
loans, provide a new training package for small companies and spell out the
funding details for the new modern apprenticeship scheme, with the
government expected to fund the college-based element of the training.
On youth credits it had been planned to expand the existing experiment, now
covering about 60,000 people, to all training and enterprise councils, which
deliver government training initiatives in England and Wales.
The new proposal embraces people aged 16 to 19, who will be able to use a
credit to buy an academic sixth-form education, technical training at a
further education college or a modern apprenticeship place with an employer.
Funding through credits should help bring more equality of status between
academic and vocational education. But in the past it has been resisted by
the Department for Education and the Further Education Funding Council. It
has been pushed hard by the Confederation of British Industry and will raise
the status of careers guidance officers.
Most of the funding for credits will come from existing budgets. The
government plans to spend Pounds 185m on youth credits and modern
apprenticeships in the current year, rising to Pounds 706m in 1996-97.
The white paper is likely to please most wings of the Conservative party and
business opinion.
Rightwingers will be wary about the broad range of interests being pursued
by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, under the mantle
of competitiveness. But they may also be pleased at the lack of expensive,
interventionist proposals and the aggressively de-regulatory tone in parts
of the document.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Big advertiser set to make series for ITV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer-products group and inventor of the soap
opera, is set to make programmes for ITV in the first deal of its kind in
the UK.
The company, which is the world's biggest advertiser, is negotiating the
sale to the ITV network of a game show called Go Bingo. The Independent
Television Commission, which sets out strict rules about the influence
advertisers are allowed to have on programmes, said the show would not be
permitted to push Procter's products.
The deal would go much further than the present sponsorship arrangements
between commercial companies and TV programmes. Procter owns the rights to
Go Bingo. This contrasts with sponsored programmes, which are made
independently, and sponsors are then invited to associate themselves with
the finished programme.
TV sponsorship is becoming increasingly popular: Midland Bank is the latest
company to announce a link with a TV programme. It said on Monday that it
would sponsor Moving Story, a Carlton Television comedy series.
Ryvita, the crispbread manufacturer, is another company which has recently
moved into sponsorship - it will be associated with Swank, a weekly
afternoon fashion programme.
ITV, which confirmed that negotiations with Procter were in progress, said
there would be a straight sale of the bingo programme and there would be no
question of Procter bartering the programme in return for advertising
airtime. Bartering is a common practice elsewhere in Europe. In some
countries advertisers supply programmes complete with advertisements at the
beginning and end of the show.
The ITC said there had been a small number of advertiser-supplied programmes
shown in the UK since new rules made the practice possible in 1991. These
have included a Tina Turner concert made by Pepsi, the soft-drink producer,
and Indy car racing supplied by Texaco, the US oil group. However, it will
be the first time a multinational will have sold a series to the ITV
network.
To comply with ITC rules, Procter will have to state at the beginning and
end of the show that it has made the programme.
Mr Ed Artzt, Procter's chairman and chief executive, recently told a
conference of US advertising chiefs that the company was exploring
alternatives worldwide to conventional TV advertising because of the
increasing fragmentation of audiences and new media developments which mean
that viewers can choose not to receive advertisements.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Industrial groups propose Pounds 100m Tees clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the UK's biggest estuary clean-up projects, intended to help
transform the polluted Tees into a salmon river, has been proposed by
Northumbrian Water and Imperial Chemical Industries.
Northumbrian has this week submitted to Cleveland County Council a planning
application for an effluent treatment works on a disused ICI waste-disposal
site to deal with sewage from 400,000 Teesside residents and industrial
discharges from ICI's Wilton petrochemicals complex.
The eventual Pounds 100m cost of the two-phase project will be borne by
Northumbrian from its capital programme. ICI will pay fees for each tonne of
waste treated.
Industrial development turned the Tees' lower reaches into one of Britain's
filthiest waterways. It has improved since the 1960s due to environmental
improvements by industry. But ICI, which has spent Pounds 100m since 1990 on
environmental upgrading on Teesside, and Northumbrian are under pressure to
do more.
At present the National Rivers Authority, the watchdog, permits ICI's Wilton
site a biochemical oxygen demand - a measure of river oxygen depletion due
to pollution - of 80 tonnes a day, but has said it must be reduced to 50
tonnes by 1996. ICI hopes to achieve much of this cut by using the proposed
plant to treat its pta (pure terephthalic acid) waste before discharge.
To meet the authority's goal of bringing migratory fish back to the Tees by
1996, Northumbrian needs to change its Teesside sewage disposal methods.
The first Pounds 50m stage of the project includes construction of a Pounds
35m underground transfer sewer along the Tees' south bank, so sewage is
discharged nearer the river mouth. The second stage will include a higher
standard of sewage treatment to meet the European Urban Waste Water
Dir-ective, due to come into effect in the year 2001, and treatment of more
ICI effluents.
Mr Doug Shearer, Northumbrian's general manager of projects, said the plant
would not involve incineration or the import of waste - both contentious
issues on Teesside. It would use conventional biological treatment methods.
'Sewage is a wonderful food, the bugs love it,' he said.
Cleveland County Council said there would be extensive consultation before a
decision. The go-ahead is subject to the consent of the boards of both
Northumbrian and ICI Chemicals and Polymers.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Tracking device finds stolen crane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 60,000 motorway main-tenance crane stolen in East Sussex has been
recovered by police who followed a hidden electronic tracking device fitted
to the vehicle.
The crane, traced to a yard in Reigate, Surrey, is the first heavy
commercial vehicle to be recovered using the Tracker system, Subsequently
five other stolen vehicles were discovered at the yard.
Some 40 stolen cars fitted with Tracker have been recovered since
installations of the system, manufactured by the US electronics company
Motorola, began in the UK last year.
Police and insurance companies, initially wary of the possible effectiveness
of the system, now appear to regard it as the potentially definitive system
for curbing car thefts estimated to number more than 1,000 a day.
The UK sales subsidiaries of BMW and Saab have signed contracts with Tracker
Network, the UK distributor, to fit it to new cars, with several other
manufacturers preparing to follow suit. The Automobile Association is
retailing the system to private motorists. It charges Pounds 160 for the
equipment plus Pounds 60 annual subscription to the system, or a one-off fee
of Pounds 350.
Some 12,000 units have been fitted and Tracker Network said yesterday
installations were running at 2,000 a month and 'rising steeply'.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Lending and money growth weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank lending and money supply growth were weak in April, providing some
tentative evidence that the economy may have been affected by last month's
tax increases.
But analysts pointed out that the lending figures are erratic in nature and
could have been distorted by seasonal factors.
M4, the broadest measure of the money supply, rose by a seasonally adjusted
0.1 per cent between March and April, according to figures from the Bank of
England yesterday.
During the 12 months to April, M4 increased by a seasonally adjusted 5.7 per
cent, down from 5.9 per cent in March and below market expectations of a 6
per cent rise. The government's monitoring range for M4 growth is 3 per cent
to 9 per cent.
Sterling lending to the M4 private sector (defined as all UK residents other
than banks, building societies and the public sector) was just Pounds 500m,
compared with market expectations of Pounds 2bn.
Meanwhile, the British Bankers' Association reported that sterling lending
by leading British banking groups to the private sector fell Pounds 911m in
April on a seasonally adjusted basis. This was the first monthly fall since
December 1992 and followed an increase in lending of Pounds 3bn in March,
the largest monthly increase for four years.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, said: 'Such a sharp
contrast requires some explanation. The most obvious is the incidence of
Easter, which fell at the very beginning of April, and which may have
brought forward transactions, and borrowing, into March at the expense of
April.'
The incidence of Easter may also have affected the sterling M4 lending
statistics, of which the association's figures are an important component.
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe), said
this was 'one series of figures where seasonal adjustment has always caused
problems'.
Two substantial reasons for the decline in the association's figures were a
Pounds 1.1bn drop in lending to building societies, and a Pounds 432m fall
in lending to securities dealers. But there was also a fall in lending to
the corporate sector, and lending to persons, at Pounds 360m, was lower than
in previous months.
'There has been weak credit demand across the economy over the last six
months but that has been masked by lending to securities houses to finance
their positions in the markets,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG
Warburg Securities.
Consumers spent Pounds 35bn on their credit cards last year, a rise of 7 per
cent on 1992, according to the Credit Card Research Group. More than half of
all credit-card spending takes place away from high-street shops.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Plain farewell for lost leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The life of John Smith, the Labour leader who died last week, was
commemorated yesterday at a funeral in Edinburgh which underlined his
Scottish roots.
Although the prime minister, many English Labour MPs and some foreign
representatives attended, the majority of the congregation at Cluny parish
church in Morningside were from Scotland.
The service in the sandstone church which Mr Smith attended was plain, even
for a funeral. Outside the wind was bitter, even for Edinburgh, and the sky
grey.
Inside, the congregation heard Mr Smith's closest friends from his days at
Glasgow University rekindle his memory with touching addresses. They
portrayed a man of unpretentiousness, honesty and consistency, but also of
ambition and tenacity who had been cruelly denied his ultimate political
objective of becoming prime minister.
Mr Jimmy Gordon, chief executive of Radio Clyde, said Mr Smith was 'someone
people could relate to. He was one of us, not one of them.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said Mr Smith had not
been interested 'in the trappings of power - he wanted power itself'. There
would be many people who disagreed with him on political issues.
'But no one would deny the sincerity, the tenacity of the man. Consistency
was at the core of him. His life, his work, his reassuring presence were a
standing reproach to the easy cynicism that brands politics as a dishonest
game.'
He also spoke of Mr Smith's warmth, saying he could 'start a party in an
empty room, and often did'. He would walk through walls to help a friend, he
said.
The 900 mourners had been arriving in the quiet side street by the church
for more than an hour before the service. There were Scottish judges,
advocates and solicitors, reflecting Mr Smith's past as a QC, and
delegations from local government and from his Monklands constituency.
Also present were Scottish cabinet ministers, including Lord Mackay, the
Lord Chancellor, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary.
From London came Labour party figures including Mr Neil Kinnock, whose wife
Glenys helped Mr Michael Foot, another former Labour leader, up the steps to
the church. The contenders for Mr Smith's succession, Mr Gordon Brown, Mr
Tony Blair, Mr John Prescott and Mr Robin Cook, were there, as was Mr Tony
Benn.
The former prime ministers Sir Edward Heath and Lord Callaghan, the latter
representing the Queen, were in the congregation, as were English trade
union leaders and the political editors of the national newspapers. Mrs
Margaret Beckett, Labour's acting leader, read one of the lessons.
After the service Mrs Elizabeth Smith, Mr Smith's widow, led her three
daughters behind the coffin, facing about 2,000 people who had gathered
outside to hear the service over loudspeakers.
Today Mr Smith will be buried privately on the Hebridean island of Iona, the
resting place of Scotland's early kings.

The operator of the lorry which ran out of control and killed six people at
Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, will not face prosecution for corporate
manslaughter.
The Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence against
Fewston Transport, of Skipton, North Yorkshire, although the inquest into
the deaths had recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. The company is due in
court next week to face charges of using a lorry with defective brakes after
its vehicle hit a van on a hill and crashed into a row of shops and houses.
Both drivers died along with three women and a two-year-old girl.

Unions yesterday forecast disruption next weekend for travellers using
British Airways because of industrial action among staff, including check-in
and baggage supervisors.
Some 2,530 of the 12,000 administrative workers at BA, where about half the
total are union members, voted for action short of a strike, with 1,467 in
favour and 1,039 against. The dispute is over a number of issues, including
changes to terms and conditions of employment.
The TGWU general union said talks with BA were scheduled for Monday, but if
the issues were not resolved action would begin next weekend. It had given
management the seven-day notice of industrial action required by law. BA
said it was not anticipating disruption at this stage because discussions
were scheduled for next week.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, the regulatory body for the
commercial sector, yesterday renewed his plea that the BBC should give
promises of performance on its radio services and stick to them.
The decision to turn Radio 5 into a news and sport channel ahead of the
launch of a national speech-based commercial radio network underlined the
need for such commitments, he said.
'This would ensure that the BBC, in line with the commercial sector, could
not make dramatic changes to the character of its services (which could
narrow listening choice) without concern for its listeners as a whole,' Lord
Chalfont says in the authority's annual report.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Motor insurance discounts boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct Line, the tele-phone-based motor and home insurer, is raising the
competitive pressure in the motor insurance industry by increasing the
maximum no-claims discount it offers to the safest drivers, Bethan Hutton
writes.
Direct Line has until now given drivers with a five-year claim-free record a
65 per cent discount on standard rates. The industry norm is a 60 per cent
to 65 per cent discount. Direct Line will now offer a 70 per cent discount
to drivers aged over 50 who qualify for the existing maximum.
Government figures show that drivers over 50 accounted for 35 per cent of
the driving population in 1992, but were involved in less than 20 per cent
of accidents. The change should benefit about a quarter of Direct Line's
1.6m customers, but the company's main aim is to raise its share of the 5.6m
people who form the target market of over-50s with full no-claims bonuses.
Competition for this sector is intense.
Rival insurer Norwich Union said Direct Line's move was only a different
approach to the same conditions which led Norwich to introduce a special
policy for the over-50s.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Demand for new homes still rising
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further sharp rise in demand for new homes has provided evidence that
consumer confidence has not been derailed by April's tax increases,
according to a survey of more than 400 housebuilders.
The survey published today by the Housebuilders Federation shows a bigger
rise in sales of new homes than in the general housing market.
According to the federation, net reservations of new homes - agreed sales on
which deposits have been paid, less cancellations - increased in every month
this year compared with the corresponding months last year.
The federation said sales of other homes have risen more slowly judging by
recently published estate agents' figures. These were inflated last spring
by sales from the private sector to housing associations and Business
Expansion Schemes.
The federation said that the proportion of builders reporting house-price
increases had risen steadily since the beginning of this year.
Almost a third of builders reported last month that prices had increased in
the past 12 months, with a quarter saying that prices had risen by 1 per
cent to 2 per cent. This compares with 65 per cent reporting static prices
and only 2 per cent reporting price falls.
Sales figures were more impressive with 64 per cent of companies reporting
an increase in net reservations compared with April last year  - 16 per cent
said net reservations had fallen and 20 per cent said they were static.
Four-fifths of builders expected sales to increase this year compared with
1993.
The sales rise has been supported by a big increase in site visitors with 61
per cent of companies reporting a rise in site visits in April compared with
12 months earlier.
The federation said that the proportion of companies reporting sales and
price increases was higher last month than in March.
The strongest growth in site visitors and net reservations was in north-west
England, East Anglia, Greater London and south-east England.
Mr Richard Adamson, the federation's chairman, said the market, after a
dipping a little in the previous month, had bounced back in April with 'new
homes sales leading the housing market as a whole.
'Clearly the anticipation of April's tax increase had more effect on the
market than the reality of the increases, and it's reassuring to see this
reflected in the April figures,' he added.
Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender, has forecast
that house prices could rise by at least 5 per cent this year provided
consumer confidence does not subsequently weaken because of tax increases.
House sales on the same basis could rise by 10 per cent or 15 per cent.
Most observers, however, say it is too early to assess the full impact of
tax increases.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Insurer acts against mis-selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Dunbar, one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, has changed the
contracts of its 350 sales managers to encourage them to take greater
responsibility for the activities of sales staff and cut down on possible
mis-selling.
From this month, instead of being mainly on commission, they will become
salaried.
Sales managers will also receive a bonus based on recruitment, retention and
supervision of their staff.
The change is to encourage managers to take greater care to ensure sales
staff sell customers the appropriate products.
During the past year the industry has been affected by controversy about
possible large-scale mis-selling of financial products, especially pensions.
New contracts of employment for managers give details about the amount of
time they must spend supervising sales staff, most of whom are self-employed
and will continue to be paid on commission.
Each Allied Dunbar manager has responsibility for an area and is in charge
of about 15 sales staff.
There are just less than 4,000 sales staff.
In the past managers' earnings have comprised commission calculated
according to the sales of their staff, plus a small bonus.
Now 60 per cent of their pay will be salary, with a bonus accounting for the
rest.
Under rules drawn up by Lautro, the industry regulator, companies have to
adhere to specific training standards and supervise managers and sales staff
to make sure customers are given the best advice about products.
Allied Dunbar said it was unable to say whether the average pay of managers
would change under the new system.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Veterans replace rookies to polish up industry's image:
Sales agents are being put through gruelling training courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is 5pm on a sunny spring day, the classroom is stuffy and Mr Keith Burden
is getting tired. 'When's the next train out of here?' he groaned.
Mr Burden is in a group of 10 salespeople working for Allied Dunbar, one of
Britain's biggest insurers, who yesterday finished a gruelling introductory
training course.
Although new to Allied Dunbar, all have several years' experience with other
insurance companies. They are keen to deny suggestions that insurance and
pensions agents are out to trick people into buying inappropriate products.
The industry has been under the spotlight in the past few months, partly as
a result of a series of fines handed out to big companies by Lautro, the
self-regulating body for the life industry.
Largely as a result of tighter Lautro regulations, the number licensed by
this body to sell life products has been roughly halved since 1990 to about
100,000, with roughly 2,500 a month still leaving the sector.
'In any profession, you get dodgy people,' said Mr Burden, who has been in
the industry 14 years and whose previous employers were Abbey Life and
United Friendly. 'But if your dentist gives you poor treatment, you don't
stop going to the dentist - you shop around.'
Some of those on the Allied Dunbar course, displaying the legendary ability
of salespeople to turn negatives into positives, think the controversy about
the industry's prac-tices may work in their favour.
'If you are a professional, you can say to customers you are doing the job
better than the ones being booted out of the industry,' said Mr David
Freeman, who previously worked for Cornhill.
The nine men and one woman on the course, held at Allied Dunbar's Pounds 20m
training centre in rolling countryside near Swindon, Wiltshire, are among
about 6,000 of the company's salespeople and managers likely to spend some
time at the centre this year.
Like many companies in the industry, Allied Dunbar is trying to recruit more
experienced salespeople to reduce possible mis-selling. While last year the
novices taken on by Allied Dunbar outnumbered the veterans by nearly 10 to
one, this year the company has trained roughly four times as many veterans
as newcomers.
All recruits get an initial two weeks' training at Swindon, followed by
further training of several weeks during their first two years with the
company.
The two-week course for industry 'vets' at Swindon is especially rigorous,
covering 14 different types of Allied Dunbar product including pension and
life plans, endowments and health insurance. The veterans have to pass 20
45-minute examinations to gain their full complement of Lautro licences
allowing them to sell.
Of the 10 on this course, half are agents who will be paid by commission,
while the others will work for Allied Dunbar on salaries as branch managers,
each in charge of about 15 agents.
Mr Martin Tranter, a form er life-products salesman who is the trainer in
charge of the course, stresses ethical issues. He nods approvingly when his
charges give the correct answer to a trick question about pension transfers
and calms the fears of one trainee, Ms Ros Morris, about the degree of
form-filling to meet new Lautro requirements on keeping records.
The stars of the course are Mr Robert Milton, an extravert Scot who is to
become an Allied Dunbar manager in Liverpool, and the professorial Mr Bill
Lee, whose last employer was Equitable Life. Mr Lee is quicker than most of
his colleagues in answering questions and is good at catchy sales lines. He
advises saying products are 'good value' rather than 'cheap'.
When Mr Tranter asks for volunteers to demonstrate their favourite sales
approach, Mr Marc Turner, a salesman at Allied Dunbar's Manchester office,
draws a sketch of two people, both supposed to be in their 60s and with
umbrellas. The first, who has a personal pension, is lying on a sunbed
sipping a drink; the other, who relies on the state scheme, is trudging in
the rain towards a post office.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Business outlook in north 'positive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The outlook for the majority of companies in the north of England is 'quite
positive', Mr David Cranston, northern chairman of the Confederation of
British Industry, said yesterday.
Speaking after the latest two-monthly meeting of the confederation's
northern regional council, which covers north-east England and Cumbria, Mr
Cranston said many companies had seen a sustained improvement in orders for
some time. The UK and Far East were particularly fruitful markets, although
those in continental Europe remained sluggish. A large number of companies
were planning to increase capacity or considering doing so, he said, and
some businesses represented at the meeting in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, were
recruiting. There was some concern, he added, at the state of retail demand
because of recent tax increases. But Mr Cranston, also chief executive of
Northumbrian Water, believed the general optimistic picture would lead to a
sustained improvement in fortunes, feeding through to the consumer.
The regional council represents a cross-section of companies. The sectors
include engineering, electronics, chemicals, giftware, construction,
financial services, road haulage and the utilities.
Mr Cranston said the overall mood of the meeting was one of cautious
optimism. 'There was a general feeling that people were looking to the
future and making plans in an atmosphere of confidence.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Retail deposits to societies increase sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
April is the kindest month for building society retail deposits, according
to the monthly savings figures produced by the Building Societies
Association.
The net retail funds received by societies in April last year came to more
than the net inflow for the previous three months put together, while last
month's figures represented the first net inflow since October.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the association, said that the
turnaround in April's figures released yesterday to a net inflow of Pounds
385m showed that the outflows in previous months had been caused by a series
of special factors.
These factors included the pre-payment of fuel bills to avoid the imposition
of value added tax, and the success of the pensioners' guaranteed income
bond which was launched in January.
He acknowledged, however, that because of the seasonal nature of the
figures, there could still be some net outflows in the coming months.
However, he added that he did not expect them to be on the near-record scale
of the outflows of Pounds 653m and Pounds 404m in March and February
respectively.
Societies expect the improvements in the public finances to be reflected in
less competition from National Savings products, and believe that the
popularity of unit trusts will also fall away somewhat over the year.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, association chairman, predicted earlier this week that
more funding for societies would come from retail savings in the coming
months, in contrast to societies' decision in the first quarter of this year
to fund their mortgage lending more cheaply through wholesale funds.
Mr Coles said yesterday that the inflow of savings, taken together with the
Pounds 376m interest credited to accounts, was closer to the rise in
societies' mortgage lending than it had been in March.
This was reflected in the smaller amounts of wholesale funding raised, he
added.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Call on exam standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales agents in the pensions and insurance industry should be made to sit
examinations invigilated by independent experts rather than their own
companies, according to Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive of BAT
Industries which is one of the UK's biggest insurers, Peter Marsh writes.
Voicing general concern about the standards for training and competence
proposed by the new Personal Investment Authority, Mr Broughton said
external invigilation was one way to assure the public that the industry was
operating ethically.
BAT, which owns the insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, has still to
decide whether to join the authority, which is due to take over in the
summer as the umbrella regulatory organisation to protect the private
investor.
In recent months BAT had proposed specific suggestions to the authority for
improving its standards on training, but the discussions had come to
nothing, Mr Broughton said in an interview.
Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of the Lautro insurance watchdog which is to
be subsumed into the new authority, said the idea of external invigilation
was a 'red herring' because many companies had improved their training
standards under Lautro guidance in the past two years.
Critics have said that in the past, sales agents have lacked expertise about
available products and also been under intense pressure to sell because most
of them are paid on a commission basis.

Unions yesterday forecast disruption next weekend for travellers using
British Airways because of industrial action among staff, including check-in
and baggage supervisory workers.
Some 2,530 of the 12,000 administrative workers at BA, where about half the
total are union members, voted for action short of a strike, with 1,467 in
favour and 1,039 against. The dispute is over a number of issues, including
changes to terms and conditions of employment.
The TGWU general union said that talks with BA were scheduled for Monday,
but if the issues were not resolved action would begin next weekend. BA said
it was not anticipating disruption at this stage because discussions were
scheduled for next week.

said yesterday there was 'widespread support' for Britain's call for full
implementation of the so-called Trinidad terms. These involve an immediate
write-off of more than half the debt owed to governments by highly-indebted
low-income countries, mostly in Africa. Total public bilateral debt owed by
severely-indebted low-income countries topped Dollars 110bn in 1992, up from
Dollars 80bn in 1986.

Mr Anthony Cheung, a founder member of Hong Kong's new coalition Democratic

Beijing just one week before he was due to be formally appointed, Louise
Lucas writes from Hong Kong. China's move has been broadly criticised, even
by pro-Chinese figures. The implication is that those with dissenting views
will not be seen as suitable advisers and Beijing will listen merely to
sycophantic voices. The newly created Democratic Party brought under one
roof Mr Cheung's own party, Meeting Point, and the United Democrats, the
pro-democracy group led by Mr Martin Lee which is considered subversive by
the Chinese.

the three groups told the government the base price of Dollars 62m was too

President Bill Clinton's lawyers are expected to file a motion in court soon
asking for the dismissal of sexual harassment charges laid against him
earlier this month by a former Arkansas state employee, George Graham writes
from Washington. Mr Robert Bennett, who is acting as Mr Clinton's lawyer in
the case, is expected to argue for the suit to be dismissed because of a
broad presidential immunity to civil charges.
Ms Paula Jones charged in her suit that Mr Clinton pressed her for sex in a
hotel room three years ago, when he was still governor of Arkansas. The
Justice Department's office of legal counsel has been researching the
institutional implications of the case for the executive branch and the
presidency in general, but officials said yesterday that the department had
not yet 'formulated a decision or an opinion'. Officials added that no one
was yet working on a brief, but that it was likely that the judge in the
case would ask for the department's views on whether the president can be
sued.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Israeli soldiers shot dead by militants: PLO and Israeli
security forces to hold joint patrols in Gaza Strip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The PLO and Israeli security forces are to hold joint patrols in the Gaza
strip following the killing of two Israeli soldiers by radical Palestinian
gunmen yesterday.
The shootings put to the test policing arrangements between Israeli and
Palestinian police for the first time since Israeli military withdrawal.
The gunmen, belonging to extremist Islamic movements opposed to the
Palestinian self-rule agreement, shot the soldiers at a checkpoint a few
hundred metres inside the strip and then fled into the self-rule areas
controlled since Wednesday by Palestinian police.
Under the self-rule agreement Israeli security forces only have the right of
'hot pursuit' into the Palestinian-ruled area, but otherwise must work
through Palestinian police to try and secure the arrest of Palestinian
attackers.
Israel reacted by barring all Palestinians from entering the Jewish state
for nine days saying the closure would enable Palestinian policemen to firm
up security checks and curb further attacks. Since Israel eased a complete
closure last month at least 2,500 Palestinians had been crossing daily into
Israel to work.
The way in which Palestinian police handle their first security test and
take measures to curb violence by Palestinian extremists may well determine
future Israeli-PLO negotiations to expand self-rule to the rest of the
occupied West Bank and ultimately to statehood.
Mr Yossi Sarid, the Israeli environment minister, warned yesterday that
unless Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, took stiff measures against
extremists he would 'end his career as the mayor of Jericho because that
will be the end of the experiment'.
Palestinian security forces have said they intend to disarm radical factions
like the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement who have vowed to continue armed
struggle against Israel from inside the self-rule areas. The 10 factions
opposed to the agreement, led by Hamas, have warned such a move could spark
an internal Palestinian civil war.
Major-General Nasr Yousef, head of the Palestinian police force, tried to
reassure Israel after yesterday's attack. 'There is no doubt we shall
exercise our right as the authority. We shall take the necessary measure,'
he said.
Mr Nabil Shaath, a senior PLO official who paid a surprise visit to the Gaza
from Cairo yesterday to bring money to the Palestinian police, said: 'I knew
some incidents would happen. I am very sorry that they happened. We have to
do our best to pre-empt and prevent them from recurring.'
PLO officials said the Palestinian police were not yet ready and would only
be firmly in control within a week. Yesterday's attack coincided with
mounting concern inside Israel about the ability of the PLO to govern the
faction-riven Strip of 800,000 Palestinians packed in teeming refugee camps
and squalid towns. Israeli military officers have warned that the
Palestinian police are underfunded and have failed to take control of law
and order.

Radioactive fuel rods removed from North Korea's nuclear reactor are still
under the supervision of international inspectors and have not been diverted
to make bomb-grade plutonium, US officials said yesterday.
North Korea's decision to press ahead with the discharge of fuel from its
reactor without making proper inspection arrangements with the International
Atomic Energy Agency constituted 'a serious safeguards violation,' officials
said, but the situation could still be retrieved.
'The IAEA, in fact, has told us that it is confident there is no diversion
of the fuel that has just been discharged,' said Mr William Perry, the
defence secretary, describing this as a hopeful sign.
On Wednesday Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the US would
increase the already high 'readiness level' of its troops in South Korea if
it proved necessary to seek sanctions against North Korea.
Tension over the refuelling of the North Korean reactor has centred on the
IAEA's ability to ensure continuous monitoring of Pyongyang's nuclear
facilities.
Inspectors want to be able to reconstruct the reactor's operating history in
order to verify that North Korea did not remove more fuel than it declared
during a previous discharge in 1989.
To do this, they must set aside a precise sample of the fuel rods from the
current discharge for a later analysis to determine the isotopic burn-up,
which would yield proof of North Korea's declarations.
With the discharged rods now in a storage pond, it is still possible to
reach agreement on this sample, but US officials warned that if North Korea
did not suspend the discharge, as IAEA officials have asked, or reach a
quick agreement with the IAEA on the sampling methodology, the opportunity
for this type of analysis could be lost.
'If the fuel is discharged without preserving the opportunity for this kind
of analysis, then it's irrevocably lost,' said Mr Robert Gallucci, who heads
the US policy steering group on Korea.

In a case brought in 1982 against President Richard Nixon, the Supreme Court
ruled by a 5-4 margin that the president had absolute immunity from personal
liability for his actions while in office.
Although the suit did not address actions undertaken before becoming
president, the Court's reasoning, in an opinion written by Justice Lewis
Powell, would appear still to apply in such cases.
Justice Powell argued 'because of the singular importance of the President's
duties, diversion of his energies by private lawsuits would raise unique
risks to effective functioning of government.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Japan surplus 'threatens' global trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world is threatening the global
trading system, Mr Walter Mondale, the US ambassador in Tokyo, said
yesterday.
'We have a Dollars 130bn (Pounds 86.60bn) trade account imbalance. This
threatens the world trading system. It fuels protectionism. It exports
unemployment. It's got to change,' he said.
The attack came moments before Japan's ministry of finance released figures
showing a higher than expected trade surplus during April. The surplus
reached a record Dollars 11.12bn, up 8.1 per cent year on year. Analysts had
been expecting a year on year decline of 1.3 per cent to Dollars 10.3bn.
Japan's surplus with the US, the source of continual political conflict with
Washington, rose 8.9 per cent to a record Dollars 4.38bn. The surplus with
the EU reached Dollars 2.31bn, while that with Asia was Dollars 5.3bn.
Economists said the latest increase had been caused almost exclusively by
the continuing rise of the yen and corresponding depreciation of the dollar.
Although the yen's appreciation reins back exports by making Japanese goods
more expensive overseas, it also reduces the dollar value of imports. In yen
terms, the overall surplus fell 1.6 per cent to Y1,160bn.
Only one more set of trade figures is due before the next round of formal
negotiations between the US and Japan and the G7 meeting in Naples during
June and there were few conclusive signs of adjustment, said stockbroker
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. It warned that the surplus remained uncomfortably
high, with little evidence of trade volumes having an effect on headline
dollar numbers. There would be little respite for the yen, it added.
Imports had been weaker than expected, increasing only 6.6 per cent to
Dollars 21.76, while exports rose 7.1 per cent to Dollars 32.88bn. In yen,
exports fell 2.7 per cent to Y3.434bn, while imports declined 3.2 per cent
to Y2.273bn.
Mr Mondale said exploratory talks between the US and Japan in Washington on
Thursday suggested progress could be made. The discussions, which continued
yesterday, followed the breakdown of formal negotiations in February. 'Based
on the first reports I have received, I am hopeful that progress would be
made. It's too early to say, but there is some movement,' he said.
The US has been demanding that the Japanese government reflate the economy
to draw in more imports as a way to reduce the trade surplus. But yesterday
the Bank of Japan said the economy was recovering.
The Bank of Japan's comments came as the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said industrial production had increased 4.6 per cent in March
compared with the previous month.

FT  21 MAY 94 / De Klerk's plea to win back 'lost generation': In an FT
interview South Africa's deputy president backs the ANC's social aims, but
warns over funding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr F W de Klerk, South Africa's joint deputy president yesterday forecast
there would be a coalition administration after the government of national
unity ended its five-year term, and urged the west to help South Africa play
a constructive role in Africa.
In a wide-ranging interview during lunch at the Financial Times, Mr de Klerk
stressed the importance of economic growth to meet the needs of what he
called 'a lost generation' of South Africans.
But he also gave a sharp warning against any attempt to undermine the status
of the Afrikaans language, saying it would drive many of his National Party
supporters into the arms of the far right.
A relaxed and good-humoured Mr de Klerk, showing no signs of strain after a
gruelling election campaign made clear that he looked forward to contesting
the presidency in the next election.
The National Party, he said, had won support from about 1m black voters in
addition to over 3m votes from whites, coloureds and Indians.
He was determined to help make the coalition led by President Nelson Mandela
work, he said, adding that the National Party would be able to claim a share
of success when contesting the next election. The party accepted the need to
tackle housing backlogs and improve health and educational facilities for
black South Africa - any difference with the ANC was 'not about the needs of
the people, but how you fund the programme.'
This in turn depended on sustained economic growth, partly through export
promotion and encouraging foreign investment.
He insisted that the Reconstruction and Development Programme drawn up by
the ANC should be treated as the policy not of a single party, but of the
government of national unity. 'But we must be assured that we will not give
way on the need for fiscal discipline', he said.
How, Mr de Klerk was asked, could he reconcile support for the coalition
government and the need for a watchdog opposition role? 'I am on a learning
curve on this,' replied Mr de Klerk. But from discussions with leaders of
coalition governments in Europe, he went on, it seemed there were two
options. 'You can either have a continuing argument in a coalition or you
can do your homework initially . . . and agree in detail what joint policy
will be, and then test everything that happens against this (agreement)' -
and this was the approach he had adopted.
He accepted that there had been some hard bargaining over the composition of
the cabinet, but welcomed the reappointment of Mr Derek Keys as finance
minister as one of the critical portfolios, in addition to agriculture,
constitutional affairs, as well as his own role as executive vice president.
Asked whether the government of national unity could become 'more or less
permanent', Mr de Klerk replied: 'Not necessarily in this form.'
'Power sharing', he went on, 'should be a feature of the final constitution
(to be drawn up by the country's National Assembly)' arguing, as he has done
frequently in the past, that a party that gets 51 per cent of the vote
should not get 100 per cent of the power.
But he stressed that 'there are other ways of achieving it than though an
enforced coalition. One would be to give to the regions more powers, though
not necessarily more functions,' he said.
'For certain types of important decisions the president might not be able to
take them on his own, he must call in the premiers of the nine provinces'.
Alternatively, Mr de Klerk suggested, 'the senate could more effectively
represent minority interests, to control the power of the party with the
majority.'
But he underlined the fact that 'it is not about vetoes - it is about
effectively preventing the misuse of power to the detriment of language,
religion, certain black minority groups'.
'I don't think we should have enforced coalitions,' Mr de Klerk went on,
'but when (the current system) falls away, we need to broaden the package of
how to share power in other ways, through local government for example.'
'We have got to balance the situation between the fears of minorities and
the democratic need to have real power which comes with being a majority
(party).'
'An enforced coalition', he continued, 'will not wash, it won't work either.
But I predict we are going to have coalitions any way.'
Turning to the role of post-apartheid South Africa, Mr de Klerk urged the
international community 'not to remove us from their agenda. They need us,
they need to address the problems of Africa. We have a pivotal role to play
 -but only if we are successful (at home) can we play that role (in Africa)
to the full.'
'We need sustained dynamic economic growth,' said Mr de Klerk. 'We will be
focusing on exports and developing the new markets that have become
available to us, we have to get our productivity up, and develop the
potential of tourism, with lots of jobs.'
Mr de Klerk was at his most passionate, however, when he responded to
questions about the future of Afrikaans. It was 'very dangerous' he warned,
to undermine the language, pointing as an example to the dropping of
announcements in Afrikaans on board South African Airways.
'It was the language issue which made the Afrikaner the force that they are
today . . . if you want me to lose their support, rub them up the wrong way
about the language. You will drive back into the arms of the far right.'
Mr de Klerk was reluctant to give reasons for the last minute decision of
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, to take
part in the election.
'Realism took over,' he said. 'If Chief Buthelezi didn't come aboard we
might have faced a very very serious security situation'. All parties,
including Chief Buthelezi, realised this.
Mr de Klerk dismissed reports in the South African press that he had struck
a deal to secure Chief Buthelezi's participation, giving extra land to the
former Kwazulu homeland within Natal. 'At no time was I involved in any
discussion on that issue that was election related'
Turning to the need for land redistribution, Mr de Klerk said it was 'at
tremendously emotional issue with conflict potential' but it 'can be managed
in an orderly way.' The government has 'already identified vast tracts of
land' which could be made available to people dispossessed during the
apartheid era.
But Mr de Klerk cautioned against expectations that South Africa could play
a major role in Rwanda. First the country's security forces had successfully
to conclude the integration of regular units and members of the ANC armed
wing. South Africa also needed to help resolve disputes closer to home, he
said, notably the war in Angola.
Mr de Klerk was in London to deliver the Sunday Times Nobel Laureate
lecture. The combination of a strong economy and a large middle class placed
South Africa 'qualitatively and quantitively in quite a different league
from any other African society,' he told the audience. 'We will be able to
break the cycle of Third World poverty and despair and we will ensure that
many of our African neighbours share our success.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Malawi slips at last from iron grip of Banda: Michael Holman
and Nick Young on the end of an era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and NICK YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who ruled Malawi from independence from Britain in
1964 until this week was the last of Africa's colonial autocrats.
Popularly known as the Ngwazi (Saviour) he led the former Nyasaland to
independence, consolidated his grip on power by turning the independent
state of Malawi into a one-party fiefdom run with a combination of Victorian
principles and an iron fist.
He once said: 'I do things; let others explain why.' But few have been able
to. He ruled according to his own whims and fancies, managing in the early
years of independence to achieve remarkable economic growth for a deeply
impoverished colonial backwater.
His legacy is one of human rights abuses, belated economic reforms
undermined by a reluctance to distinguish between legitimate personal
resources and state assets, and illusions of grandeur demonstrated by a
string of palaces and presidential retreats around the country, and a
personality cult as destructive as it was colourful.
With fly whisk in hand, and dressed in sombre suit, homburg and dark
glasses, he cut an incongruous figure as he joined the ever present M'bumba,
the redoubtable women who danced in attendance at public gatherings.
He was the product of an extraordinary childhood: the traditional missionary
education was followed by 40 years abroad as a student in the US and medical
doctor in the UK.
Regarded by many as a ruthless tyrant, Dr Banda was a shrewd, hard-working
and calculating politician. Using traditional culture, he set up a
well-oiled party machinery backed by a powerful security service that
controlled almost all aspects of Malawian life.
He personally controlled large parts of the economy 'in the interests of the
nation' including the giant Press Holdings said to account for more than a
third of GDP, until he reluctantly allowed economic reforms pressed on
Malawi by the World Bank to take state resources out of his hands.
A member of the Chewa tribe of central Malawi, Kamuzu Banda was born near
Kasungu in 1906 - although the date has always been the subject of
controversy. It may have been 1898.
He took the name of Hastings after the missionary who baptised him; studied
at the Livingstonia mission school near Lake Malawi and then set out to walk
over 1,000 miles to South Africa. On the way he found a job as a hospital
orderly in Rhodesia.
He studied medicine, history and politics in the US and further did studies
at Edinburgh and Glasgow.
He set up his first practice in Liverpool in 1941 and moved to London in
1946 where he joined the Labour Party and became the representative of the
Nyasaland African Congress, lobbying from his surgery against the British
government's imposition of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
In 1957 he moved to the Gold Coast (now Ghana). When unrest flared in
Nyasaland a year later he was invited back home by local leaders.
On July 5 1964 Malawi was born and Dr Banda, its first premier, said: 'One
leader, one party, one government and no nonsense about it.'
In 1970 he declared himself President for Life. Ministers suspected of
plotting against him were imprisoned or forced into exile. A few died in
suspicious circumstances. In 1983 three ministers, including Dick Matenje, a
potential successor, were killed in a car crash.
Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have been summarily detained over the
years for breaking rank with a ruling party - of which all Malawians had to
be be members - that demanded Unity, Loyalty, Obedience and Discipline. Yet
despite this, his key role in the independence movement, which he never
allowed people to forget, ensured a near-divine reverence.
'Whoever takes over,' said one observer, 'will be a mere mortal.'

Regional rivalries last night threatened efforts by Malawi's President-elect
Bakili Muluzi to establish a coalition government after his southern-based
United Democratic Party appeared to fall short of an overall majority in the
country's 177 seat national assembly, Nick Young reports from Lilongwe.
Poll results showed the three main parties winning support from north, south
and central regions, raising fears Malawi politics may be dominated by local
tensions.
Mr Muluzi's UDF won 84 parliamentary seats, five short of an outright
majority. He has so far ruled without co-operation with former President
Hastings Banda's outgoing Malawi Congress Party, which won 52 seats.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Goldman Sachs to assist with rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa has appointed Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, to assist
the country in acquiring an international credit rating. Mr Derek Keys,
South Africa's finance minister, said yesterday that a formal long-term
credit rating would be the most tangible step towards the country's return
to the international capital markets.
Bankers said South Africa was likely to make submissions to Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's, the two leading international rating agencies. The rating
process would at least a few months to complete, they added.
South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating
which would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to
the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers.
Bankers said South Africa's infrastructure was more advanced than other
'emerging markets' but these achievements were offset by the country's
political risk and the high unemployment.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Brussels at sea on shipwrecked steel rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The survival of the European Commission's rescue plan for the steel industry
looked increasingly doubtful last night, after senior officials confessed
they did not know how to achieve essential capacity cuts.
In spite of the Commission's efforts to distance itself from comments by Mr
Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, that the plan was dead, it was
unclear what Brussels would do next to salvage it.
A proposal by Mr Van Miert to reduce production at mills in Brescia,
northern Italy, was rejected by his fellow commissioners on Wednesday,
because of the questionable legality of state aid to the steel companies in
return for capacity cuts.
Yesterday, officials close to Mr Van Miert insisted there were no
alternative solutions for achieving the minimum 19m tonnes of finished
product capacity cuts required under the plan.
'If you take away the Bresciani contribution, I can't see where the capacity
cuts will come from,' said a senior steel official. 'All the other ideas are
even more unacceptable.'
However, a spokesman for Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner,
suggested there was still hope for the plan, adding that all sides agreed
that a solution to the crisis in the steel industry had to be found.
The commission said it would review the future of the rescue plan before
reporting to European Union industry ministers when they meet on June 21.
Under the plan, the commission hoped to persuade the EU's steel sector to
cut capacity of hot rolled steel products by between 19m and 25m tonnes. So
far, only 11m tonnes of capacity cuts have been achieved. Mr Van Miert's
proposals would have produced at most a further 5m tonnes of capacity cuts.
But this would have involved bending rules on state aid, leaving the
commission open to legal action from unsubsidised steel producers as well as
the US authorities, with whom the EU is attempting to forge a multilateral
steel agreement.
Last night, as Europe's big steel companies were attempting to assess the
implications of Mr Van Miert's remarks, the consensus was that the plan was
not dead, but was clearly in deep trouble.
The rescue plan began at the end of 1992 as an attempt to cut 25-30m tons of
crude steel capacity out of a total of 170m tonnes, reducing the
recession-torn industry's overcapacity.
Talks between the Commission and the Italian government over the future of
Ilva, the state-owned producer, became seriously bogged down last summer.
Another major problem area was Eko Stahl, the struggling eastern German
producer. The German steel industry and other European steelmakers wanted it
to shut while the German government pushed hard for it to be saved.
Eventually, European industry ministers reached agreement in December to
approve nearly Ecu7bn (Pounds 5.4bn) of state aid for public sector steel
producers in return for 5.5m tonnes of cuts in finished product capacity in
Italy, Spain, Germany and Portugal.
The deal was meant to pave the way for cuts from the non-aided steelmakers,
producing the total reduction of 19m-25m tonnes. But the industry almost
immediately resisted.
British Steel and other producers claimed that a rescue plan for
Klockner-Werke's Bremen mill - now being investigated by the Commission -
amounted to state aid, and thus contravened ministers' declaration in
December that there would be no more subsidies.
With tempers becoming frayed as an April deadline approached for the
non-aided sector to provide a viable restructuring plan, the Commission
agreed in March to give the industry until November to finalise the capacity
cuts.
In spite of this week's events, producers still believe that talks on the
rescue can continue. Usinor-Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group,
said Mr Van Miert had overreacted. 'There is no reason to say that the plan
is finished,' said Mr Jean-Yves Gilet, director of international affairs at
the French group. He admitted, however, that the Commission's objective of
reducing rolled steel capacity by 19m tonnes would be difficult to achieve.
Meanwhile, hopes that an integrated steel plant can still be built at Eko
Stahl will come under further pressure in coming weeks because of
uncertainty over the European rescue plan.
While the European Commission had already approved plans by Riva, the
Italian group which pulled out last week, to increase capacity at Eko Stahl,
a rescue package for the plant is likely to be more difficult to assemble
amid fears that there would now be no overall limits on European steel
production.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, is under considerable pressure to
find a solution for Eko Stahl, the main employer in Eisenhuttenstadt where
unemployment is already high.
However, Thyssen, Germany's biggest steelmaker which is advising the
government, sees prospects only for a cold rolling mill which would mean
further job cuts for the 3,000-strong workforce, already down from 12,000 in
1989.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Interest rates of 500% fail to revive drachma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Greek drachma, facing sustained pressure for the past week, slipped
yesterday against the D-Mark despite another sharp rise in short-term
interest rates.
The drachma fell to DM152.5 from DM148.9 on Thursday, triggering speculation
that a devaluation was imminent, before closing at DM150.
The government's claim yesterday that it was 'satisfied' with the drachma's
performance in the week since capital controls were lifted did nothing to
restore confidence among bankers and economists.
There is growing concern that Mr Andreas Papandreou, the ailing socialist
prime minister, is not prepared to let the economy ministry push through new
fiscal measures ahead of next month's European parliament elections.
Mr Papandreou has made no statement on the currency crisis since he
commented that drachma was in 'business as usual' during a parliamentary
debate on Monday, the first day of upheaval on Greek financial markets.
Moreover, Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the new economy minister, has failed to
follow up on promises that the privatisation programme would be expanded to
help close a revenue gap in this year's budget projected at Dr450-500bn.
Mr Papantoniou's insistence that no new taxes would be introduced this year,
appears increasingly unrealistic, given Greece's deepening economic
predicament.
Analysts said that if currency stability is to be restored, the government
must accompany a faster depreciation of the drachma, expected next week,
with a specific package of measures.
To convince the markets that the socialists are serious about reducing the
public sector deficits, these would have to include spending curbs and more
rigorous measures to improve tax collection.
The surge in short-term interest rates, which yesterday reached a record 500
per cent, has failed to protect the drachma following the freeing of
short-term capital movement.
The Bank of Greece was estimated to have spent more than Dollars 300m
yesterday to support the drachma, bringing foreign exchange losses to over
Dollars 700m for the week.
One dealer said: 'If devaluation is to be avoided, depreciation must
accelerate. These interest rates can't be kept up for more than a few days.'
However, while smaller Greek companies faced a cash squeeze because of the
explosion in interest rates, several banks said they were still lending to
corporate customers at less than 40 per cent.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Scandal casts shadow over autonomy for Bank of Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, should be celebrating
that the institution he has run for nearly two years has gained a
Bundesbank-like independence. Instead he is picking up the broken crockery
caused by the scandal involving his predecessor Mr Mariano Rubio.
'The public seems to think that everyone in the Bank of Spain is under
suspicion,' says Mr Rojo with a stab at humour. The situation clearly
infuriates this intense academic who held the chair of economic theory at
Madrid University before he joined the bank to set up its research
department in the 1970s.
The fallout from the Rubio affair is reflected in the Bank of Spain autonomy
statute that was approved by the Spanish parliament on Thursday. The
legislators introduced amendments to the draft law that subject portfolio
investments by senior central bank officials to strict guidelines and
supervision.
Mr Rubio was coincidently released on Pta15m (Pounds 72,400) bail after
spending two weeks in prison on the same day that the Bank of Spain gained
its independence. He is being investigated for tax evasion and insider
dealing in connection with a Pta115m stock market portfolio that was managed
for him by the failed Ibercorp financial services group in the late 1980s
when he was the central bank governor.
Mr Rojo says that what the public has not fully understood is that the
probity of the bank of Spain as an institution outweighs by far whatever
scams might be conducted by those who sat a given moment might represent it.
'Supposing (the allegations about Mr Rubio) are true; the mechanisms of the
Bank of Spain are such that whatever frailties and temptations its governor
might have will be neutralised,' says Mr Rojo. 'It is extraordinarily
difficult for a senior official to favour a financial institution and get
away with it.'
Mr Rojo argues that the scandal surrounding Ibercorp, a bank which sought
out fashionable wealthy clients, and the former governor, bears out his
point; it was a Bank of Spain inspection of Ibercorp's assets, when Mr Rubio
was still governor, that prevented a proposed merger within the group and
prompted its collapse - and Mr Rubio's ruin.
He concedes, however, that it might take time to restore the bank's
credibility. It irks Mr Rojo that the scandal dominated the headlines last
month just at the time when the central bank was successfully concluding the
rescue of Banesto, the troubled banking group whose board he peremptorily
dismissed on the grounds of gross mismanagement.
Mr Rojo does however have now a golden opportunity to project the Bank of
Spain's virtues as well as his own professionalism. In line with the
Maastricht treaty's provisions for central bank autonomy, the bank has the
responsibility for setting monetary policy and Mr Rojo becomes the effective
guardian of price stability.
It is clear that he relishes the prospect and is undeterred by potential
conflicts with politicians. 'Our basic priority may not necessarily be to
create employment. Our job is to ensure price stability and that is an
objective that hardly anyone in politics is interested in.'
He hopes to raise the bank's image through 'open government' procedures that
will include detailed progress reports on inflation and regular appearances
before parliament's economy and finance committee.
He would also like to follow the example of Bank of England governor Mr
Eddie George and have formal meetings with the economy and finance minister
at which minutes are taken and subsequently made public.
'At the moment the minister and I just talk on the phone and see each other
informally, perhaps twice a week, when we have the time to do so. I like
Eddie George's initiative with the Chancellor of the Exchequer but it
depends on my minister here liking it too.'

FT  21 MAY 94 / Bank lays claim to Tapie art collection

The tangled fortunes of Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French entrepreneur
whose radical-left party is making waves in the European election campaign,
yesterday took another twist when Credit Lyonnais, his bank, terminated the
agreement whereby he has five years to repay his FFr1.2bn (Pounds 130m)
debts.
Credit Lyonnais, which is cleaning up its balance sheet after recently
unveiling heavy losses and a FFr44.9bn government-backed rescue package,
early yesterday morning sent a baliff to Mr Tapie's opulent townhouse off
Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris.
The baliff, accompanied by a policeman, served official notice on Mr Tapie
and his wife, Dominique, that the bank had terminated the loan repayment
agreement and was claiming possession of his furniture and art collections.
Mr Tapie, who cites 'furniture and art of the 18th century' as his
'interest' in Who's Who, had offered the collections as security for part of
his debts.
Mr Tapie later in the day accused the French establishment of 'trying to
destroy me'. 'Having tried throwing me into solitary confinement, they're
now trying to make me a pauper,' he added.
When Mr Tapie earlier this year negotiated the terms of his debt repayment
agreement with Credit Lyonnais, he claimed his furniture was worth FFr300m.
One of the conditions of the agreement was that he would provide the bank
with a full valuation by March 31. But Mr Tapie failed to do so.
The bank also yesterday sent a team of art experts to Mr Tapie's home to
make an inventory of the contents with a photographer who took a picture of
each object. It said it would leave the furniture and art in the house with
the Tapies as 'guarantors'.
Credit Lyonnais said another reason for terminating the debt agreement was
its concern about the recent 'deterioration' in Mr Tapie's finances
following the relegation of Olympique-Marseille, his football club, to the
second division and reports of investigations into his tax affairs.
The bank said it had 'not yet decided' what further action to take regarding
the repayment of Mr Tapie's debts.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Blow to Sweden over Dollars 2.5bn bridge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A project to build a Dollars 2.5bn bridge and tunnel link between Sweden and
Denmark was further delayed yesterday in an embarrassing setback to Sweden's
centre-right government.
A commission expected to clear the remaining environmental objections said
it was not satisfied on the key question of water flows through the Oresund
strait.
Its findings mean that a final decision on the project is unlikely to be
taken before Sweden's September general election, following further
investigations.
The 17km combined road and rail link between Copenhagen and the southern
Swedish city of Malmo would be one of Europe's largest infrastructure
projects. The plan, which was first agreed by the Danish and Swedish
governments in 1991, has received strong backing from most Swedish and
Danish politicians, as well as industry and unions.
However, Sweden's Centre Party, one of the partners in the four party
coalition of prime minister Carl Bildt, has come out strongly against the
project. It forced a detailed environmental investigation of the plan last
January by threatening to leave the government.
The central issue is whether the bridge will impede water flows into and out
of the heavily polluted Baltic Sea. The aim has to been to secure a
so-called 'zero solution, ensuring the water flows are not disturbed at all.
Yesterday, Sweden's Water Rights Court said the bridge consortium had not
shown that a 'zero solution' could be achieved in line with its criteria.
Stressing that a 'zero solution' was still 'technically possible,' it called
for the consortium to carry out new measurements before reporting back to
the government.
The government, accepting that the decision was a setback, said it would not
necessarily be an electoral disadvantage if it meant that the Centre Party
picked up extra votes from environmentalists. It directed its anger at the
consortium for having failed to provide the Water Court with the information
it required. 'They've blown it,' said one government source.
The decision to proceed may end up being taken by the opposition Social
Democrats. They are favoured to win the September election and have made it
clear that they want the bridge to be built. Clearance work on the
approaches to the bridge has already begun on the Danish side although it
was suspended earlier this year pending a final decision from Sweden.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Craxi may seek refuge in Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Italian Socialist leader, yesterday failed to
return to Italy and turn himself over to Milan magistrates to answer a
string of corruption charges.
He now risks becoming the first former prime minister to have an
international arrest warrant issued against him.
Since losing his immunity from arrest with the convening of the new
parliament a month ago, Mr Craxi has made himself scarce. From his second
home in Hammamet, Tunisia or from Paris, he has communicated with the press
through a series of faxes whose tone alternated between vituperation and
self-defence.
But the last fax this week was a medical certificate from one of his
Tunisian doctors claiming he was ill. Affected by diabetes, he was unable to
return to Italy. His wife, Anna, has been besieged at their Hammamet villa
by reporters who can find no trace of Mr Craxi in any clinic registers.
This has inevitably prompted speculation the disgraced politician is hiding
behind the smokescreen of illness to avoid returning to Italy. Mr Craxi
himself has frequently claimed he is a victim of a campaign to discredit the
Socialist party and fears for his own safety.
Of all the politicians involved in the corruption scandals, he is the figure
who has aroused the most public animosity. On the rare occasions he stepped
out in the street he has been jostled and jeered.
Mr Craxi's behaviour suggests either he intends to seek exile in Tunisia or
that he is simply playing for time while also being ill. A year ago Mr Craxi
is reported to have approached his old French Socialist friend, President
Francois Mitterrand, about retiring to France. Even if his request was
considered favourably, this diplomatic form of exile became impossible with
the arrival of the Balladur government.
Mr Craxi wife has powerful friends in the Tunisian government, as well as
the Tunis-based Palestinian Liberation Oragnisation, which he secretly
helped finance. Lawyers are doubtful whether Mr Craxi could be returned
under existing Italian-Tunisian extradition agreements especially as he
would claim he was being tried politically.
Others who claim to know Mr Craxi well believe he is a wily fighter, who
will bide his time to return. He may genuinely be ill and also be waiting to
see whether the new Berlusconi government will introduce some sort of
amnesty for crimes of political corruption.
The magistrates are still ill-disposed towards the idea of an amnesty.
Yesterday Milan magistrates announced the arrest of Mr Franco Ambrosio, head
of Italgranni and the so-called Naples 'king of grain', and Mr Giovanni
Piero Elia, managing director of the Mediocredito Centrale, the state owned
credit institute, on corruption charges.
Mr Ambrosio was briefly arrested last October regarding the recycling of
treasury bonds used as part of the L150bn in bribes paid in the Enimont
affair that involved the reorganisation of chemicals industry. It appeared
yesterday's arrests were linked to further investigations into the use of
these treasury bonds. It is the first time the treasury-owned Mediocredito
has been linked to the corruption scandals.

FT  21 MAY 94 / E Germans win compensation
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's lower house yesterday finally agreed on a compensation package for
former owners whose property was confiscated by the Nazis or communists in
eastern Germany.
At the same time, a limited compensation fund has been granted to former
land owners whose property was expropriated by the Soviet authorities
between 1945 and 1949.
The long-awaited decision removes a major obstacle hindering investment in
eastern Germany. It also ends four years of amendments, debates and
divisions within the governing Christian Democratic Union coalition, and
between eastern and western German deputies about how to compensate former
property owners.
Under the terms of the unification treaty, former owners whose land was
confiscated by the Nazis between 1933-1945 and by the communists between
1949-1990 are entitled to restitution or compensation. No similar rights
were extended to the large aristocratic landowners whose property was
expropriated by the Soviet authorities.
The new measures involve the setting up of a DM18bn compensation fund,
issued in bonds. Some DM12bn will be allocated to former owners whose
property was confiscated between 1933-1945 and 1949-1990. The amount of
compensation for each individual will be based on the 1935 value of
property, and multiplied by several factors depending on whether the
property was land or housing. The bonds will not be fully redeemable until
2004.
In addition the Bundestag yesterday put aside DM3.4bn compensation, and will
allow former landowners to buy back a percentage of their property at below
market prices.
A further DM2bn has been granted to east Germans who had suffered under the
Nazis but received no compensation under the communists.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Crimea rebels head for crisis
</HEADLINE>

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Crimea's pro-Russian parliament virtually declared independence from Ukraine
yesterday by voting to restore their short-lived May 1992 constitution. The
'constitution' calls on Ukrainian-Crimean relations to be governed by
treaties, as between two sovereign states, as well as creating Crimean
citizenship and opening the door for Crimea to establish its own military
units.
Immediately after the Crimean vote, Ukraine's parliament went into closed
session and passed a resolution setting a series of deadlines for Crimea to
revoke the constitution.
Mr Nikolai Mikhailchenko, President Leonid Kravchuk's chief domestic
adviser: said 'There is a line which cannot be crossed, that of the
territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Crimean parliament has just crossed
that line.' But he gave no indication of the likely Ukrainian response.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president stepped into the crisis warning that
no force should be used against Crimea. 'Crimea is an independent republic
within Ukraine. It has the right to its own political stand, to make its own
political decisions,' he said.
Mr Kravchuk had earlier attempted to put the peninsula's Internal Affairs
and Security (former KGB) branches under Kiev's direct control. But this was
flouted on Thursday by Crimean leaders who appointed their own men into
newly re-styled Crimean security ministries.
Western diplomats in Kiev warned that an armed confrontation over Crimea
could deteriorate into a Russian-Ukrainian conflict. 'President Boris
Yeltsin will stay out of a verbal showdown, but if anything physical happens
it will be hard for Russia to stay silent,' one diplomat warned.
The Crimean peninsula, once the balmy seaside playground of Russian tsars
and the Soviet elite, already contains 50-60,000 Ukrainian troops.
Significant Russian forces, part of the Black Sea fleet equipped with rifles
and armoured vehicles, are also stationed there.
On Thursday Crimea accused Ukraine of deploying 1,000 additional troops and
seizing buildings while Kiev radio accused Russia of landing two paratroop
divisions. There was also a bomb scare at the Crimean parliament building
although these reports could not be confirmed.
Tensions have flared on and off between Kiev and Crimea since Ukraine became
an independent state in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Though
Crimeans, nearly 70 per cent ethnic Russian, voted for an independent
Ukraine in 1991 Ukraine's appalling economic decline has driven the Russian
majority to seek integration with Russia.
Yesterday's restored constitution was initially passed in May 1992. Conflict
was averted when Mr Kravchuk brokered a deal in which Crimea was granted
autonomy in exchange for annulling its independence and toning down its
constitution.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Lucas faces Pentagon probe over quality control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries has confirmed it is under investigation by the Pentagon for
allegedly supplying gearboxes that fell below specified standards for the US
Navy's F/A-18 fighter aircraft.
Shares in the UK aerospace and automotive components manufacturer fell
sharply by 15p to 175p yesterday on reports that it might be fined and
barred from new contracts with the US Department of Defence.
Lucas has shipped 3,000 sets of the gearbox equipment for the US Navy over
15 years.
Management at the company's Utah and Los Angeles plants is alleged to have
passed equipment which was below specification. The Defence Department then
launched an investigation.
In Washington, US Navy officials refused to comment.
Mr John Grant, Lucas finance director, acknowledged that quality controls at
the plants which made the gearboxes had been poor for a number of years.
He also said senior management in the subsidiary, Lucas Western, had been
replaced and that the company was co-operating with the US Navy and the
Pentagon to resolve the issue.
This is the second time Lucas has encountered difficulties in the US. It
recently agreed to pay Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) to settle a dispute over the
supply of unsatisfactory components for the Maverick air-to-ground missile.
Lucas denied a report yesterday in the Wall Street Journal which said its
gearboxes had caused 167 emergency landings of F/A-18s in the past year and
a half. 'We have had no indication from the US Navy or the Department of
Defence that there have been any operational problems,' said Mr Grant.
Lucas has annual business with the US Defence Department worth some Pounds
170m, but analysts say it would be unusual for any ban on new orders to
extend across the whole of a company's business. The military turnover of
the US gearbox operations is about Pounds 15m a year.
Even a ban on supplies from Lucas Western may not materialise since Lucas is
the sole supplier of such equipment. It has also been awarded the contract
to supply gearboxes for the advanced F-22 stealth fighter, which is under
development.
If Lucas is found guilty of shipping shoddy equipment, it could face a
substantial fine, possibly in the region of Dollars 25m.
Defence analysts on both sides of the Atlantic played down the risks to
Lucas's business and long-term reputation.
'It is run of the mill for US companies to have tremendous quality problems.
It usually ends up with slaps on the wrist,' said Mr Marcus Corbin, an
analyst with the Centre for Defence Information, a Washington defence policy
organisation.
Defence procurement officials have had a long-running battle over quality
control and overbilling with many of their largest suppliers. One
investigation, Operation Ill Wind, has already resulted in criminal
convictions of more than 65 companies and individuals, and is expected to
reap more than Dollars 250m in penalties for the Pentagon.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel confident of raising debt ahead of a rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel was last night confident of raising almost all the Pounds 700m
senior bank debt which the Channel tunnel operator needs before launching an
Pounds 850m rights issue. This could take place towards the end of next
week.
By yesterday afternoon, commitments had been received from banks for Pounds
580m, still well short of the required sum. But in a remarkable shift from
bleak pessimism to cautious optimism in just 24 hours, the group's bankers
said last night they were confident of 'delivering what the company
requires'.
'There is a whole new mood at Eurotunnel,' said a banker.
The Bank of England has played an important role over the past two weeks in
persuading recalcitrant banks to contribute. It is highly unlikely that
Eurotunnel's four main Japanese bank creditors - Bank of Tokyo, Long Term
Credit Bank, Sanwa and Industrial Bank of Japan - would have agreed to make
contributions to the senior debt without pressure from the Bank.
It also emerged that the refinancing would have failed without the
participation in the senior debt offer of two public sector banks, the
European Investment Bank, which contributed more than Pounds 50m, and
Germany's reconstruction bank, KFW. The 200-bank syndicate hopes to complete
its side of the fund-raising exercise by the middle of next week. The rights
issue would be launched immediately afterwards.
Leading fund managers said underwriting the issue would be extremely
difficult. They will insist on an issue price at a substantial discount to
last night's price of 374p for Eurotunnel units, down 30p on the day.
In a separate development, Mr Richard Morris, Eurotunnel's safety director,
said yesterday he was under instructions to 'meet and cajole' the
Anglo-French Intergovernmental Commission on safety to grant a safety
certificate for passenger services as soon as possible.
While stressing there was no intention of compromising safety, Mr Morris
said he was optimistic that the latest target for the start up of passenger
services will be brought forward from September to late July, in time for
the peak summer period.

FT  21 MAY 94 / Building society lending declines but savers return:
Strength of consumer demand unclear as new home sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, PHILIP COGGAN and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British savers flocked back to building society accounts last month,
providing a surprise twist to two weeks of growing evidence of strong
consumer demand.
At the same time, April figures showed a drop in net new mortgage
commitments by building societies and a sharp slowdown in bank and building
society lending.
There were signs, however, that tax increases which took effect last month
have so far had only a slight impact on the gradual recovery in the UK
housing market.
Taken together, the statistics published yesterday gave no clear picture of
the UK economy.
The decline in lending and rise in savings implies a lack of confidence on
the part of consumers and businesses.
But the Housebuilders Federation said yesterday that sales and prices of new
homes were rising faster than at any time since the recession began in 1990.
A survey of more than 400 housebuilders showed that the housing recovery,
which slowed slightly in March, resumed its upward progress last month.
The Bank of England meanwhile announced that M4, its broad measure of the
money supply, and bank lending in April were weak. The annual growth of M4
slipped back to 5.7 per cent in April, from 5.9 per cent in March, while M4
lending was just Pounds 500m, compared with the Pounds 2bn expected by City
analysts.
A contributing factor was a Pounds 911m drop in lending by the biggest
British banks. This, according to the British Bankers Association, was the
first monthly decline since December 1992.
Net new mortgage commitments by building societies totalled Pounds 3.1bn
last month - down from Pounds 3.7bn in March but broadly in line with April
last year. The number of new commitments was 54,000 last month, compared
with 50,000 in April 1993, said the Building Societies Association.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the BSA, said the fall in net new
commitments came after a very sharp rise in March which had been linked to
the timing of the Easter weekend. But he emphasised the increase in
societies' net lending compared with this time last year.
The net inflow to societies of Pounds 385m in April ended a five-month
period of withdrawals from the sector and represented the highest level of
deposits since May last year.
Heavy withdrawals resulted in a net monthly outflow of Pounds 653m in March,
the highest since September 1986.
Although, as Mr Coles pointed out, the turnround in the pattern of savings
over March and April was the strongest for several years, the inflow for
April was still weak compared with the Pounds 1.1bn recorded in the same
month last year.
Savers have been turning to investments such as unit trusts or national
savings products. Societies have had to rely more heavily on the interest
automatically credited to accounts, and the wholesale money markets, to
finance lending.
Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said that
although competition from unit trusts and national savings products might be
waning, societies were facing more competition from the high street banks
for personal customers.
Although the weak bank and building society lending figures may reflect the
impact of April's tax increases, analysts warned that the figures were
highly erratic.
The Treasury said the recent trend, which showed slow growth in lending, was
consistent with a low inflation environment.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (7): A paler shade of green -
Environment taxes lose some of their sting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the UK government published its long-awaited audit of its environmental
performance, one of the notable omissions was its failure to introduce
much-heralded taxes on energy and waste.
The 650-point audit, published 10 days ago, commented on the UK's earlier
commitment to 'take forward' European proposals for an energy tax. It said
the government had concluded that the tax was 'neither appropriate nor
necessary for the UK at this stage'. That response points to the cooling of
recent enthusiasm for 'green' taxes in many industrialised countries, as the
implications of the taxes have become clearer.
In the past few years, European and North American governments have been
particularly loud in vowing to use 'market mechanisms' such as taxes and
permits to bring about environmental goals. Their fondness for these
instruments followed two decades in which legislation was the main tool for
cleaning up the environment.
In those two decades, governments wished on themselves layers of
environmental regulation at local, national and international level. Only
then did the difficulties of enforcing these rules emerge, as well as the
frequently high costs of complying. In contrast, financial instruments
appeared to offer a simpler way of achieving environmental goals, with more
predictable impacts on the economy.
However, the two main international thrusts of environmental taxation in the
past few years - on energy and on waste disposal - have proved
controversial. So far, they have been implemented only in part.
Initiatives for energy taxes were given impetus by the 1992 Rio de Janeiro
Earth Summit, at which developed countries pledged to bring emissions of
carbon dioxide - implicated in global warming - back to 1990 levels by the
year 2000. The purpose of the taxes is to encourage industry and households
to use energy more efficiently.
However, many economists - such as Oxera, the Oxford-based forecasting group
 -have argued that demand for energy responds little to changes in its
price. Environmental pressure groups such as Friends of the Earth and
Greenpeace have appeared ambivalent, welcoming attempts to combat global
warming, but suspicious that the taxes were motivated more by governments'
need to raise money than by green concerns.
Moreover, the proposed taxes have aroused fierce opposition from
industrialists in many countries - they have complained that the taxes would
harm competitiveness.
President Clinton's proposals for an energy tax - the core of the US's
initial plan to meet this target - were dropped last year in the face of
fierce opposition from senators in oil-producing states.
Proposals for a Europe-wide tax on energy, one of Europe's longest running
and most-publicised environmental initiatives, have also stalled because of
disagreements between countries with very different energy structures.
Under the proposals, the energy tax would be based partly on fuels' carbon
content. Oil and coal would be taxed more heavily than nuclear energy, which
does not emit carbon. However, France, which derives most of its energy from
nuclear power, objected that any tax on non-fossil fuels was unfair as they
did not damage the atmosphere. The UK also protested at imposition of a
uniform European tax on the grounds that it would burden different
countries' industries unequally.
Instead, in last year's Budget, the UK made clear it would go its own way in
designing taxes. In imposing value added tax on household fuel for the first
time, and in laying out plans for steadily rising road and motor fuel taxes,
it claimed that it had opened the way for a coordinated European approach to
energy taxes. The form of taxes could vary considerably from country to
country, ministers argued.
Whether this proves acceptable to other European Union members will take
months to become clear - the issue still remains on the negotiating table.
Pressure is on European countries to reach an agreement as they collectively
ratified the Rio climate change convention at the end of last year, despite
their failure to find a way to meet the targets.
However, industrialists have commented that the UK suggestion fails to
address the original worries that competitiveness and free trade could
suffer from taxes.
Similar problems have arisen in those European countries which are
considering introducing taxes on waste disposal. The UK government, for
example, has suggested imposing a levy on waste tipped into landfills
(licensed rubbish dumps). The levy would encourage companies to use
resources more efficiently and to recycle more waste.
However, UK industrialists, who have criticised European recycling quotas,
say that landfill taxes do not recognise that waste disposal costs will
always vary widely between different countries. Differences in geology make
different waste disposal methods appropriate, they say.
According to waste industry estimates, the UK, which has many empty quarries
suitable for conversion into landfill, has some of Europe's lowest landfill
costs at between Pounds 6 and Pounds 18 a tonne, while Germany and Italy
have some of the highest costs at between Pounds 40 and Pounds 60 a tonne.
Taxes will erode this 'natural' competitive advantage, UK industrialists
argue.
The political difficulties which these proposals for taxes have encountered
emphasise that some of politicians' enthusiasm for financial instruments may
have been misplaced. The fact that the costs of a tax are evident before it
is implemented, where the costs of regulation tend to emerge years
afterwards, was one of the characteristics of green taxes which politicians
have most praised. However, that very transparency means that green taxes
are proving, even for their most enthusiastic champions, a political
minefield.

FT  20 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (2):
Disposals put on hold as politics comes back - With the state-controlled
banks slow to modernise, the private sector is making further gains in
market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 23rd May 1994) appended to this article.
After a gap of several years, politics re-entered Greek banking when a
socialist government returned to power last autumn, reviving doubts about
the state-controlled banks' commitment to modernising.
Greece's four state-owned banking groups, which control 62.2 per cent of
loans and 73.6 per cent of deposits between them, acquired governors with
close ties to the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) but little
recent experience of commercial banking in Greece's increasingly competitive
environment.
Reflecting socialist reservations about their conservative predecessors'
privatisation programme, the state-owned banks' plans to dispose of equity
participations, including sales of subsidiary banks, hotels and insurance
companies - some of them at an advanced stage - have been placed on hold.
The state-controlled development bank, ETVA, burdened both with equity
participations in loss-making industrial enterprises and a high percentage
of non-performing loans, has already received a Dr205bn capital injection
from the government in the form of long-term bonds.
The other state development bank, ETEVA, keen to expand into commercial
banking, is negotiating with the government to acquire the Bank of Crete,
which is still administered by a commissioner from the central bank more
than five years after a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal there was cleaned
up, without losses to depositors.
The private sector banks, which have invested heavily in information
technology in the past few years and maintain lower staffing levels, now
appear poised to make further inroads into the state banks' market share.
Many routine operations at state-owned banks are carried out manually.
Credit card operations and ATM networks are still underdeveloped by
comparison with the private sector.
The efficiency gap is demonstrated by figures for net profits per employee:
National Bank, the largest state bank, recorded only Dr1.4m per employee in
1992, compared to Dr4.6m per employee for Credit Bank, the largest private
bank. The state banks have also been hardest hit by last year's law which
bans banks from accruing interest on loans left unserviced for more than 12
months. Non-performing loans are estimated to account for more than 14 per
cent of National Bank's loan portfolio, while the figure for Ionian Bank
reached 20 per cent.
By comparison, the average for the eight private banks is less than 3 per
cent.
Yet despite higher provisions and shrinking margins resulting from increased
competition, banks' profits grew steadily in 1993. One banker said: 'Spreads
are still good, whatever anyone says, and even the state banks have been
improving fee and commission-based income.'
However, last year's earnings figures were increased by a requirement for
banks to publish consolidated accounts for the first time.
Conditions may be more difficult this year, with most banks expected to
increase provisions as recession persists. Hopes for growth are pinned on
the socialist government's decision to raise the consumer credit ceiling to
Dr8m. Again, this offers greater opportunities for the private banks, which
are more flexible in developing new products.
If the new managers at the state banks have little to say about
cost-cutting, they are well aware of the challenges ahead. Mr Panagiotis
Poulis, chairman of Commercial Bank, says: 'We have a strong deposit base
and a good branch network, but the range of variety of products, not to
mention quality of services, leaves a lot to be desired.'
Commercial Bank's plans for expansion suffered a setback last year when the
bank was unable to raise more than Dr35bn of a projected Dr50bn rights
issue. Nevertheless it is going ahead with plans to improve its ATM network
and offer a range of new consumer-oriented products. It has also taken a
bold decision - by Greek banking standards - in going ahead with the
liquidation of Investment Bank, a loss-making subsidiary.
Ionian Bank, Commercial Bank's subsidiary and main rival, is planning to
strengthen its balance sheet through a Dr30bn rights issue later this year.
Mr Panayotis Korliras, the bank's chairman, says: 'We have to expand our
fee-based activities quickly to increase competitiveness.'
Ionian has lost considerable ground to Credit Bank, growing steadily as
several years of investment in technology and branch expansion start to
bring results. Following a recent Dr30bn rights issue, Credit Bank is now
the largest Greek bank in terms of market capitalisation. Its aim is to
become a broad-based financial services group which can compete on western
European terms.
Like several of its rivals in the state sector, Credit Bank also sees
opportunities for growth in the Balkans, where Greek companies already
active in trade are starting to make long-term investments. Through its
investment banking subsidiary, Alpha Finance, the bank is setting up a
commercial bank in Bucharest, with equity participation from the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Meanwhile, Commercial Bank is planning to take a 35 per cent stake in a new
Romanian private bank, Co-operative Bank of Bucharest. Not to be outdone,
Ionian Bank intends to set up a subsidiary bank in Bulgaria, with a group of
Greek businessmen taking a minority stake.
Attica Bank, a small state-owned bank, plans a similar venture in Albania
with Greek companies already active there. The bank will use the branch
network of the Albanian Savings Bank, which will also have an equity
participation. The banks' Balkan ventures are intended to focus on trade
finance, while gradually developing a local currency deposit base.
Mr Korliras says: 'The capital outlay is not great and overheads are fairly
low. Greece is a medium-technology banking country, so its banks can
usefully bridge the gap between the existing Bulgarian system and European
commercial banking.'
But the Balkan ventures are suffering considerable delays - blamed on the
absence of a regulatory framework for banking in all three countries and
difficulties both in finding suitable staff and setting up adequate computer
and communications links with Athens.

FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Expro to float with expected Pounds 100m
tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Expro, a specialist provider of technical services to the upstream oil and
gas industry, will float on the London Stock Exchange this summer through a
placing and a public offering.
Market capitalisation is expected to be about Pounds 100m.
The company, formed in 1973 at the start of the North Sea oil boom, was the
subject in 1992 of a Pounds 52.4m management buy-out from Flextech, the
mainly media group.
Expro's directors said they were seeking a listing in order to broaden the
shareholder base and to enable the company to compete for larger contracts.
Proceeds from the flotation will also enable it to make a substantial
reduction in the Pounds 58m of debt, much of it related to the buy-out.
Expro employs about 750 people in four operating divisions. These range from
well maintenance and testing to drilling and project management.
The company made a net profit of Pounds 3.1m in the year to end-March 1993
on turnover of Pounds 50.1m. About 55 per cent of profits come from overseas
operations. Work for British Petroleum and Shell accounted for about 45 per
cent of last year's UK profits.
Mr John Dawson, chief executive, said the company's prospects were not
dependent on the oil price. About two thirds of turnover comes from work on
projects in the development and production phase. Only a third is related to
more price sensitive exploration and assessment activities.
He also said Expro was actually benefiting from some of the changes taking
place in the industry due to weak prices.

FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Capital gains lift SCA quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCA, the Swedish pulp and paper group, yesterday announced a SKr566m
(Dollars 73.44m) profit after financial items for the first quarter, more
than double the SKr271m it achieved a year earlier.
But it had to rely on capital gains and lower interest payments to
compensate for a weaker performance in many of its main businesses.
The recent improvement in prices and volumes was not felt during the
quarter, but it will influence the group's figures over the rest of the
year. The company is sticking to a forecast of a full-year profit of between
SKr1.7bn and SKr2.2bn, excluding one-off items.
The main first-quarter influence was a SKr371m capital gain from the sale of
shares in fellow Swedish forestry concern MoDo. It left SCA with a SKr255m
exceptional gain, after deducting a SKr116m restructuring charge.
Lower interest rates and a reduced net debt also had a positive impact,
cutting net financial expenses to SKr181m from SKr252m.
Both factors helped compensate for the poorer performance from three of the
group's four main divisions. Molnlycke, the hygiene division, saw operating
profits fall 11 per cent to SKr276m. Lower board prices hit the packaging
division, cutting profits to SKr146m from SKr153m. The graphic paper unit
broke even, following a SKr37m profit, due to lower prices and the
strengthening Swedish krona.
Only SCA Forest and Timber produced better figures, profits rising to
SKr146m from SKr61m.
Group sales fell to SKr7.78bn from SKr8.59bn, and operating profit
(excluding the exceptional gain) dropped to SKr492m from SKr523m.

hydro-electric output

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Verbundgesellschaft, Austria's largest electricity and power group, has
reported a 30 per cent rise in profits for 1993, but will keep its dividend
unchanged at 16 per cent.
Group pre-tax profits were Sch1.51bn (Dollars 129m) compared with Sch1.15bn
in 1992. Sales rose slightly from Sch19.4bn in 1992 to Sch19.5bn last year.
Mr Johann Haider, chief executive, said results were boosted by favourable
climatic conditions that helped raise hydro-electricity output and reduce
imports. He added that prospects for 1994 looked good, with
hydro-electricity output rising by 17 per cent in the first quarter.
The company which is 51 per cent state-owned, plans further rationalisations
to improve efficiency. The 5,300 workforce will be cut by 700-800 by the end
of 1997.
It has requested authorisation from the government to raise electricity
prices by 6 per cent, but this is still under review.
It plans to invest Sch5.8bn from cash flow this year, following investments
of Sch4.1bn in 1993.

FT  20 MAY 94 / BT raises dividend on flat result

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications's final dividend of 10.05p raised its total 7.1
per cent to 16.7p but Sir Iain Vallance, chairman, refused to be drawn on
future dividend growth.
The company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.76bn (Dollars 4.14bn) for
the year to March 31, against Pounds 1.97bn. Leaving aside redundancy
charges, disposals and other non-recurring items, the increase was less than
3 per cent. Operating profits were Pounds 3.53bn (Pounds 3.47bn) before
redundancy charges of Pounds 517m (Pounds 1.03bn).
At Pounds 13.7bn, BT's annual turnover rose 3.3 per cent. Earnings per share
were 28.5p, against 19.8p. Before one-off items the increase was 0.4 per
cent.
Growth was stronger than expected in the UK, but the Pounds 750m of
redundancy charges to be taken in this year's figures were larger than
analysts had anticipated. The high cost, against the past year's Pounds 517m
(down from Pounds 1.03bn), is due to a new emphasis on cutting management
jobs. BT is set to shed a further 15,000 jobs this year.
The company has raised the possibility of regional phone pricing in the UK,
after the introduction of a new charging system next year, which will
replace unit-based prices with per-second charges.
Analysts believe the change has clear attractions for BT in its battle with
competing operators building local or regional networks.
BT's share price has fallen by nearly 20 per cent against the FT-A All-Share
index over the past year amid fears about regulation and strong UK telecoms
competition.
Inland call volumes were 6 per cent up on 1992-93, increasing turnover by
1.9 per cent despite the effects of a price cap agreed with Oftel, the
telecoms regulator, obliging BT to cut its prices by 7.5 per cent after
allowing for inflation. BT is bound by the same price cap this year.
Sir Iain committed BT to vigorous efforts to attract customers back from
competitors who have taken about 11 per cent of the UK market. Mr Hepher
promised an intensification of the marketing campaign aimed at the
residential sector. The objective was to build 'a high phone-usage culture
in the UK'.
BT will make a special Pounds 250m contribution to its pension scheme this
year following a revaluation, after an Pounds 800m special payment last
year.
BT's gearing was down to 9 per cent at the end of March, but will rise
sharply this year if its Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the US
long-distance carrier, is cleared by US regulators.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Pressure in Nigeria over forex market

Nigeria's military government is under increasing pressure to reintroduce a
parallel foreign exchange market, which was banned in January.
Such a move would be a first step towards establishing a market-determined
rate for the naira, an essential condition for renewal of the lapsed
agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Most members of the cabinet,
however, continue to resist this condition, and the government is likely to
tighten its control over foreign exchange allocations.
The official supply of foreign exchange has proved inadequate and last
week's allocation of Dollars 100m is only 3.6 per cent of demand for the
manufacturing sector, which receives 60 per cent of the total.
The parallel market last year helped industry pay for its imports by buying
hard currency from exporters or investors bringing money into Nigeria at
market rates.
After the budget in January pegged the exchange rate and outlawed the
parallel foreign currency market, both inward investment and export earnings
returning to the country have declined sharply.
Since February the government has allocated about Dollars 100m each
fortnight, at a fixed rate of N22 to the dollar, on a pro rata basis to
companies which can prove that they need imports.
The dollar trades for about N48 on the black market and there is enormous
demand by importers for the scarce supply of foreign currency at the
subsidised rate.
Pressure on the supply of foreign exchange will remain intense. Early
reports indicate that the budget deficit for the first quarter of this year
reached N18bn (Dollars 800m), and the government owes more than Dollars 700m
to multinational oil companies for production costs.
Finance minister Kalu Kalu is a leading advocate of economic deregulation,
which international donors continue to press for but he is isolated in a
cabinet dominated by populist politicians who oppose liberalisation of the
economy, and are backed by the head of state, Gen Sani Abacha.
Most of the cabinet, led by Mr Lateef Jakande, housing minister, say they
need more state control to allocate foreign exchange correctly.
A committee at the central bank which oversees foreign exchange allocation
pro rata to applicants is to be dismissed and is likely to be replaced by a
committee of cabinet ministers which will allocate foreign exchange to
companies at its own discretion, according to sources close the government.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (15): Cautious toes dip
into equity markets / Noting a shift from cash to capital markets in fleet
financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE BRIGGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greek shipowners spent almost Dollars 3bn last year on acquiring some 400
secondhand ships, totalling 23m deadweight tons.
The figures sound startling, even by shipping industry standards. What is
more surprising, a high percentage of transactions were in cash, with no
financing raised.
The extent of Greek shipowners' liquidity is proverbial, but it cannot be
accurately estimated, according to bankers. Yet few would dispute a market
rumour that a well-known owner recently came up with enough cash to fund a
new building order for three vessels.
However, Greek owners less well provided with cash are more likely to raise
funds for ship purchases through bank financing, often on more stringent
terms than in the past. Spreads are now higher and loan periods shorter.
Some lenders also attach a requirement to generate fee-paying business for
the bank.
Nevertheless, the unprecedented surge in sales and purchases by Greek owners
in the past couple of years has generated concern about the cost of fleet
renewal. There is growing interest in tapping both domestic and
international capital markets for funds.
So far, the shipowners' efforts to find new sources of financing have
concerned debt rather than equity.
Last year, Eletson Corporation, the Piraeus-based product carrier operator,
launched the first public bond to be issued by a Greek shipping company,
raising Dollars 140m in first preferred ship mortgage notes against six of
its vessels. Priced to yield accrued interest of 9.25 per cent, the 10-year
notes are not redeemable before 1998.
The US offering, underwritten and sold by Citibank Securities, was more than
twice oversubscribed. Credit agencies gave the bond a rating considered
encouraging - BA2 from Moody's and BB from Standard and Poor's - given
institutional investors' suspicions of the shipping industry.
Eletson said it would use Dollars 100m of the funds raised to write down
outstanding ship mortgages and the remainder as working capital. The company
is considered a good risk because of the age of its 17-vessel fleet. With
five new ships due to be delivered over the next two years and seven
disposals of older vessels, the fleet will have an average age of 2.5 years,
compared to an average of more than 10 years for the industry.
However, only a few Greek companies are expected to tap the international
capital market for long-term funding.
Ms Marianna Moschou, general manager of Citibank Shipping Bank in Piraeus,
says: 'Few companies will meet the prerequisites for a public offering, and
even fewer will want to go through the gruelling procedures involved,
including full disclosure and the due diligence process required by the US
Securities and Exchange Commission.'
Shipowners worldwide raised only Dollars 1bn last year in the US market
through public bond offerings, suggesting that they are still a fledgling
instrument for the shipping industry.
Nor are private placements common, although they are sometimes used in
restructuring debt. Adriatic Tankers Shipping, which operates a mixed fleet
of chemicals, product and crude oil carriers, completed a Dollars 80m
private debt placement earlier this year. The 10-year facility, carrying a 9
per cent interest rate, was secured by first preferred mortgages on 20 of
the company's vessels.
Nevertheless, Greek shipowners are also dipping a cautious toe into the
equity market.
The Tsakos Shipping Group, which set up the US-listed Global Ocean Carriers,
a bulk carrier operation for which the group acts as technical manager, now
has another investment vehicle, listed on the Norwegian stock exchange.
Shares in the Maritime Investment Fund, a tanker operation also managed by
Tsakos, started trading on Oslo's small board at the end of 1993.
Another manager, Stelmar Tankers Management, was set up in 1992 with the aim
of going public once it acquires a track record that can attract investors.
Trying to dispel the accepted image of shipping as a high-risk investment,
Stelmar has geared its operation to the requirements of a stock market
listing, acquiring Greece's first-ever ISO 9002 management qualification,
together with its first certification under the International Ship
Management Code.
'Going public is the way to raise money from the market. I'm not in favour
of public debt issued by a private company,' says Mr Stelios Hadji-Ioannou,
Stelmar's owner.
The Athens Stock Exchange, despite its comparatively small size, is starting
to attract passenger shipping companies. Two 'back door' entries were
achieved through the acquisition by shipping concerns of holding groups
already listed.
One, Attica Enterprises, bought and sold a package of shares in Strintzis
Lines, a ferry operator that has since obtained approval for a listing on
its own account, and disposed of a chain of household goods stores before
focusing on passenger shipping. It has placed a Dollars 146m order for two
ro-ro ferries and has an option on building two more.
The other, Cosmos Maritime, is a subsidiary of the Cosmos Group, with
interests in textiles and food processing. It is controlled by Mr Dimitris
Hatzis, a shipowner who has been diversifying in recent years.
Cosmos Maritime indirectly links ocean-going vessels with the Athens
exchange, through a co-operation agreement with the Monaco-based Vlasov
group to handle shipbuilding and repair activities in Greece, together with
bareboat charters on two dry cargo vessels.
However, the Capital Markets Committee, the watchdog for the exchange, is
tightening its regulations to prevent more shipping companies from following
suit. While passenger shipping operators will be admitted to the bourse,
though under more stringent conditions than they might have expected, the
committee is reluctant to permit other shipping concerns to join the market.
Strintzis Lines, which operates passenger ferries in the Adriatic and the
Aegean, as well as a passenger line between Swansea and Cork, had to
restructure its operation, increasing its liabilities, to secure approval
for a Dr5.1bn public offering.
There are problems, too, with Dane Shipping Lines, a joint stock company
with a limited number of shareholders, which wants to raise Dr2.5bn through
a flotation on the bourse. The company, based on the island of Rhodes,
operates passenger ferries in the eastern Aegean islands.
Dane is being forced to restructure after its original application for a
listing was turned down.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (16): Floated on the
exchange / Profile of Strintzis Lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Strintzis Lines used to be a thoroughly traditional Greek ferry company.
Controlled by the Strintzis family from Cephalonia, the company started its
passenger operations using a converted US navy vessel. More recently,
Strintzis acquired a reputation as an efficient, low-cost operator running
ferries to popular resorts in the Aegean and on the main routes linking
Greece and Italy.
In line with established Greek practice, each of its half-dozen ferries
belonged to a separate company controlled by the Strintzis family. The
vessels, built in the 1960s and 1970s, were regularly renovated at Greek
yards, enabling Strintzis to remain competitive as other passenger shipping
companies started renewing their fleets. All this is changing as the company
looks ahead to the lifting of cabotage restrictions at the end of the 1990s,
which will open up Greek passenger shipping to outside competition.
Strintzis is the first Greek ferry operator to join the Athens stock
exchange, raising Dr5.1bn through a 25 per cent capital increase. The first
step was to call in Arthur Andersen, the firm of accountants, to carry out
an audit to international standards. The ferry operation was then
restructured as a holding company.
Barclays advised on a private placement, which raised Dr3bn. A share
package, amounting to 20 per cent of the company's equity, was transferred
to another holding group listed on the Athens bourse. In preparation for
Strintzis' own flotation, the share package was re-purchased by the company.
Faced with more stringent stock exchange regulations, the holding group had
to be restructured as a ship-owning company, with increased liability for
the eight-vessel fleet.
To escape the constraints of fares set by the government on Greek routes,
the Strintzis family looked for opportunities abroad, chartering vessels in
Tunisia and acquiring an Irish ferry operator. Strintzis paid Dollars 2.1m
to acquire Swansea Cork Ferries, undertaking to operate the line year-round
for five years. One of its ferries underwent a Dollars 3m conversion,
doubling passenger and vehicle capacity on the Swansea-Cork route. Earnings
from the two foreign operations accounted for more than 80 per cent of
Strintzis Lines' pre-tax profits of Dr2.2bn last year.
This year, the company is operating a newly acquired ferry on the Adriatic
crossing under an innovative hire-purchase agreement. Strintzis will pay
Dollars 31.5m to Viamare, the Italian state shipping line, for a
two-year-old ferry over the next two years, under an agreement based on a
daily charter rate of Dollars 7,000. The Adriatic route, used by some 2m
tourists last year, has become increasingly competitive since the conflict
in the former Yugoslavia blocked the main overland route between Greece and
northern Europe.
'It's not enough, any longer, to operate an efficient ferry service. You
have to provide standards of service and entertainment that can match a
cruise ship, even if it's only a 24-hour crossing,' Mr Strintzis says.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (11): Overshadowed by
the budget deficit / Review of bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Europe's last emerging bond market, the Greek drachma sector has
attracted much attention in recent months.
Not only have four supranational borrowers and two corporate borrowers
raised Dr65bn in bonds since February, but the Greek government is now
planning to deepen the market by issuing fixed-rate bonds with maturities of
over one year.
However, while the sector's double-digit yields are expected to attract a
growing number of international investors, it remains overshadowed by
Greece's massive budget deficit, stubborn inflation and currency instability
following the recent removal of currency controls.
Nevertheless, the growth of a fixed-rate drachma bond market 'is a very,
very positive development,' says Ms Miranda Xafa, an analyst at Salomon
Brothers in London. 'For the first time, Greece will have a yield curve.'
That is important for business investment, as it will allow entrepreneurs to
gauge the cost of longer-term capital.
'It is very important for the government to tap this market,' says Ms Xafa.
'If it starts issuing three- to five-year bonds, its cost of funding will
drop from 18 1/2 per cent to around 16 per cent. This will lower the cost of
funding the budget deficit.'
The European Investment Bank opened up the foreign drachma bond market -
dubbed 'Marathon' market - in February with an issue of 17 1/2 per cent
five-year bonds. With a double-digit yield attracting huge investor demand,
the bonds put on a stellar performance.
Other supranationals - the World Bank, the International Financing
Corporation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - soon
followed, taking advantage not only of international demand for
high-yielding bonds, but also of swap opportunities which allowed them to
achieve funding at a significantly wider sub-Libor margin than in other
currencies.
Bayerische Vereinsbank and Abbey National followed, in effect opening a
Eurodrachma market outside Greece. Their arrival provoked a chorus of
disapproval from bankers in London and Athens, not only because they tapped
the market at the same time as the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), making that issue harder to place, but also because the
Eurodrachma escapes the control of the Greek authorities.
Marathon bonds are listed in Athens and require approval from several
regulatory bodies; Eurodrachma bonds are listed outside Greece and in effect
are unregulated. Thus, the creation of an offshore drachma market is seen to
weaken the Greek authorities' control over their money supply and currency.
Moreover, a growing Eurodrachma market could exhaust demand for drachma
bonds and crowd the government out of the market when it chooses to issue
its bonds, bankers warn.
In the domestic market, the government currently issues bonds with
maturities of up to seven years, but all bonds over one year pay floating
interest rates pegged to 12-month Treasury bills. One-year bills currently
pay a coupon of 18 1/2 per cent, and seven-year floaters pay 200 basis
points above that.
Under its new borrowing plans, the Greek government intends to issue
fixed-rate bonds with maturities of up to three years initially, and has
planned to lengthen the yield curve as inflation and interest rates continue
declining.
However, while inflation has fallen significantly in recent months - to a
year-on-year rate of 10.4 per cent in April from the 1993 average of 14.4
per cent - Ms Vincenzina Santoro, economist at JP Morgan in New York, warns
that inflation pressures could revive later this year. 'Agricultural prices
are sprouting, wage pressures may resurface and the budget deficit is
widening because the tax measures may not reap sufficient revenues this
year,' she warns.
She expects consumer price inflation to dip briefly below 10 per cent, but
to average 11 per cent in 1994.
The main risk now lies in the tumultuous state of the currency market, where
heavy drachma selling by domestic and foreign investors has forced the
government to hike short-term interest rates sharply after lifting its
reserve controls last weekend. On Monday May 16, overnight rates rose as
high as 70 per cent to stem the selling.
Until recently, the Greek authorities have pursued a policy of a controlled
depreciation of the drachma, aiming to reduce the extent of the depreciation
each year. It went from a decline of 12 per cent against the Ecu in 1990 to
a depreciation of 6.5 per cent in 1993.
Although the Bank of Greece still appears committed to its 'hard drachma'
policy, some observers warn that a one-off depreciation may now have to take
place to take pressure off the currency.
More importantly, however, the Greek authorities will have to undertake
stringent fiscal tightening, market observers say.
'The current mix of monetary and fiscal policy is not sustainable - interest
rates are very, very high, but fiscal policy is not very tight at all,' says
one analyst. 'They have to do something about their fiscal deficit - and
quick,' he adds. 'There is not prospect for lower interest rates until they
cut the deficit.'
Greece continues to grapple with a debilitating debt burden which it
finances at high interest rates, thus further inflating its growing budget
deficit. Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio was 138 per cent at the beginning of the
year - by far the highest in the European Union.
In February, concerns over Greece's fiscal position prompted Moody's, the US
credit rating agency, to place the foreign currency debt rating of the Bank
of Greece (the government's borrowing conduit until 1994) under review for
possible downgrading.
It said the review was prompted by the continued deterioration in the
country's fiscal balances, exacerbated by a rapidly growing debt burden.
After the general budget deficit grew to 14 per cent of GDP in 1993 - nearly
double the 7.9 per cent budgetary target - most observers say this year's
12.8 per cent target is also unlikely to be met, despite the government's
attempts at shoring up its revenues through a recent tax reform. Indeed,
some fear the deficit could rise as high as 18-20 per cent of GDP.
While the recent tax reforms will bolster state revenues, 'in themselves
they are highly unlikely to enable the government to achieve its budget
deficit target,' says Mr Colin Warren, European analyst at HILFE, an
economic and political research house in London. He says a mini-budget in
the second half of the year may be needed if the government is to stand any
chance of staying below its 12.8 per cent ceiling.
The government may be reluctant to get tough on the fiscal front in order to
preserve its popularity ahead of the European elections in June and
presidential elections in May 1995. If no two-thirds majority is found for
any one candidate at the presidential elections, a general election must be
held.
However, according to Salomon's Ms Xafa, politics is not the problem.
'We had a change of government in October but that hasn't caused a change of
direction. All parties know the constraints - with that volume of debt, they
don't have much room for manoeuvre.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (12): Tax free era is
over - Mutual funds have room for growth despite recent legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MCDONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mutual funds in Greece have experienced explosive growth over the past five
years: numbers have have risen from two to more than 70, with a total of
Dr1,320bn under management at the end of the first quarter this year.
This pattern looked likely to continue, when the socialist government
unexpectedly imposed a 15 per cent tax on distributed dividends from the
funds' earnings from previously untaxed sources such as government
securities, capital gains on equities and foreign earnings. A second blow
came when the government decided to tax interest earned on 'repos'  -
fixed-term repurchase agreements - at 15 per cent, too.
Previously, income from government securities had been wholly tax-free,
although interest earnings on bank deposits were taxed at 15 per cent.
Both measures were included in a new fiscal package voted through parliament
last month, intended to raise revenues and curb tax evasion. However, they
are expected to slow down the growth of mutual funds over the next 12
months. Furthermore, according to some fund managers, they could lead to
redemptions.
'Some people will leave as an emotional reaction - rather than a logical one
 -simply because they don't want to pay tax,' says Mr Dimitris Paparistides,
a fund manager with Intertrust.
Other investors may redeem their holdings in order to buy government bonds -
still tax-free for individual investors. However, they are not likely to
take up the five- and seven-year bonds which the state has been selling to
the funds in order to extend its debt profit.
With Greek holdings in mutual funds equivalent to only about 14 per cent of
bank deposits, compared to 60 per cent in France, there is still
considerable potential for growth.
However, the funds have more than 70 per cent of their holdings invested in
government securities, paying real interest rates of 8-10 per cent, while
many of them have been using repos as the equivalent of short-term bank
deposits. Neither will fund managers be able to bypass the new legislation
through ploughing back gains from investments now subject to tax. While
profits from capital gains need not be distributed, dividends and coupon
earnings must be paid in full. Mr Paparistides says: 'Unless government
bonds are also taxed, the rapid increase in the growth of funds will be
halted.'
The cynical view is that the government has decided to tax mutual funds as
part of its drive to reduce tax evasion. There are an estimated 200,000
small- and medium-sized investors with holdings in mutual funds, of which a
sizeable portion derives from the black economy.
At worst, investors may decide to take a tax-free profit by redeeming their
holdings before December 31, when dividends are distributed. According to
the Union of Greek Institutional Investors, this would force the funds to
liquidate large volumes of holdings, with potentially disastrous effects on
the Athens stock market.
Mutual funds took off in Greece as part of the liberalisation of financial
markets at the end of the 1980s, while the lifting of controls on
medium-term capital movements offered the option of making investments
abroad. Both banks and insurance companies have been active in setting up
funds, which are required to have minimum capitalisation of Dr200m and are
managed by independent companies. Large Greek insurance companies are well
placed to market the funds to small investors through their extensive sales
networks.
While the funds can invest freely in Greek or European Union equities and
new issues, no more than 20 per cent of holdings can be invested in stock
markets outside the EU.
Funds are not permitted to invest more than 10 per cent of net worth in a
single company and cannot hold more than 40 per cent of its portfolio in
companies in which it owns five per cent or more.
The maximum stake a fund can take in an individual company is 10 per cent.
The maximum holding in one company by all the funds managed by a single
investment company is limited to 30 per cent. As a result, a parent bank or
insurance company cannot lean on fund managers to shore up prices or
indirectly underwrite capital increases. Before the new tax measures, mutual
fund managers were predicting another year of healthy growth, with total
investment rising to well over Dr2,000bn. The projections have fallen, but
some managers remain optimistic.
'We still believe that funds under management can rise to around Dr1,700bn
this year in spite of the tax,' says Mr Spyros Kriticopoulos, investment
director at Alico Eurobank.
Alico found itself in the uncomfortable position of launching a fixed income
fund just after the new measures were introduced, together with a US dollar
bond fund. While subscriptions for the fixed income fund were considerably
lower than originally anticipated, the bond fund attracted 'a lot of
interest, suggesting that investors are willing to diversify rather than
liquidate their holdings,' Mr Kriticopoulos adds.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (13): Growth potential
is huge - The insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MCDONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scope for growth in the Greek insurance industry is enormous: only one
in six Greeks has insurance cover.
Outlay per head on insurance in 1992 was just Dr28,500 (Dollars 103). Total
premium income that year amounted to Dr287.8bn - equivalent to 1.9 per cent
of gross domestic product. This compares with a European average of 5 per
cent of GDP.
The largest Greek insurers are subsidiaries of the state-controlled banks,
while the larger private sector companies are linked to insurance concerns
in northern Europe. Allianz, for example, is connected both with Ergobank,
the private Greek bank, and with Dresdner Bank. Inter-American is linked
with Interbank, which is controlled by a UAP subsidiary, Banque Worms.
Greek companies - 105 out of the country's 161 insurance concerns - will not
necessarily be threatened by the arrival of the single European market in
insurance in July. Mr Ieronymos Delendas, chairman of Allianz, says: 'The
majors are already here and local service is important.'
Although insurance companies will be able to operate in any EU member state
under a licence granted and controls exercised in its home country, some
restrictions will be continued in Greece.
With some exceptions for life insurers, foreign insurance companies will
still have to form technical reserves in Greece and will have to provide
information to the commerce ministry on tariffs and policy conditions.
Life insurance is the fastest-growing sector in Greece, accounting for 45.6
per cent of premium income in 1992, compared to 10 per cent a decade
earlier. Most of this new business has gone to the private sector, which has
proved more innovative. However, both private and public sector companies
are moving into 'banc-assurance', providing packages which include banking
and mortgage facilities, together with life and non-life insurance cover.
Under current legislation, the banking and insurance arms must be separate
companies with separate managers, although the insurance companies are
permitted to have an agent in the bank. Nevertheless, until recently it was
not uncommon for a bank manager to refuse a loan unless the cover was placed
within his group.
The boom in private life cover was partly triggered by reforms now under way
in the state insurance sector. Greece's insurance system offers basic cover
through the state social insurance fund (IKA), which provides pensions,
health care and other benefits such as maternity allowances.
Auxiliary funds, which are comparable to occupational schemes elsewhere in
the EU, are mixed up with the state sector because they have been
part-financed by special levies, such as a tax on all doctors'
prescriptions, destined for the pharmacists' pension fund.
Until recently, private cover was an option taken up by only a few Greeks.
Now, however, the inequitable auxiliary funds - which provided top-up ratios
ranging from just 3 per cent to 200 per cent - are being phased out.
With tight regulations in force in the life market, competition is confined
to ancillary products, where the private insurers have an edge.
Companies are required to use common mortality tables, based on French
statistics, and a common guaranteed technical interest rate. There are
controls, too, on administrative and commission costs.
Health cover is the principal ancillary, with most companies offering
clients health cards allowing them to go into hospital without laying out
cash. Education policies for children are also a growth product.
But tax-free allowances on premiums are limited to four per cent of income,
with the maximum allowance set at Dr200,000. While this sum is large in
relation to current per capita outlays on insurance, it is meant to cover an
entire family. For Greece's burgeoning middle class, it is no longer
adequate.
'I don't see why there should be any cap. The limit should be a percentage
of total income, say 10 per cent. It would help the economy draw funds away
from consumption into long-term investment,' says Mr Dimitris Kondominas,
chairman of InterAmerican, Greece's largest life insurance company.
The phasing-out of the auxiliary funds has also brought an increase in group
insurance schemes, where the law is more accommodating, permitting unlimited
deductions as operating expenses on both insurance and pension premiums.
It is a sector of the market that seems set to grow, although companies
claim that profits are slim because of strong competition.
The bane of general insurers is motor insurance, a loss-making sector in a
country where car ownership has grown rapidly and there are many
inexperienced drivers. The sector's losses amounted to Dr16bn in 1992.
While companies are legally obliged to write motor business, many try to
avoid it, to the extent of not advertising the facility.
Companies have also managed to postpone implementing new EU regulations,
raising third party liability cover to Dr7m for material damage and Dr35m
for bodily injury, which would have doubled premiums overnight.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (14): Cash flow is the
problem - Prospects for the construction industry have rarely looked
brighter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drive south from Athens on a road that switches without warning from
six-lane motorway to dusty construction site and you have a picture of the
problems faced by Greek contractors.
Prospects for the construction industry have rarely looked brighter, with
the government due to start drawing down funds later this year from the
European Union's new structural package for poorer member-states. EU
co-financing for infrastructure projects in Greece should amount to Ecu7bn
over the next five years, in some cases covering as much as 80 per cent of
project cost.
However, companies bidding for EU-backed projects need to raise substantial
amounts of working capital, as well as funds to buy new equipment.
'These are very big projects by Greek standards and companies need to adapt
quickly,' says Mr Andrew Rizopoulos of Mechaniki, a large contractor.
Maintaining cash flow has been a serious problem even for big companies.
With interest rates on working capital averaging more than 25 per cent for
the past three years, contractors often preferred to finance projects out of
their own funds. The market is highly fragmented, adding to constraints on
financing. Contracts for road projects, for example, may be awarded in
segments of as little as 10 kilometres each, rather than to a single bidder,
because of regulations that set ceilings on participation in tenders.
Even the largest construction companies cannot submit bids valued at more
than Dr4.5bn (Dollars 18.25m). This makes joint ventures essential for
carrying out sizeable projects, and prevents the emergence of contractors
that can compete with construction companies from elsewhere in the EU to
build complex projects.
Fierce competition for public sector contracts, which account for at least
50 per cent of overall investment in construction, means that companies
offer deep discounts to win bids, paring profit margins to a minimum. The
solution for contractors has been to raise funds through the Athens stock
exchange. Since November, the number of construction listings has risen from
four to 11, while 12 more applications are under way.
The total amount raised so far through public offerings and rights issues
exceeds Dr40bn. Demand for shares in construction companies is strong: so
far, every issue has been oversubscribed and some recently listed companies
are already planning rights issues.
The government is allocating a sizeable amount of EU funding to road
improvements. Completion of the Egnatia highway, linking Igoumenitsa in
north-western Greece with the Turkish border in Thrace at a cost of almost
Dr400bn, is considered a priority.
The port at Igoumenitsa is being expanded to handle increased traffic. More
Greek exporters now ship goods through Italy as the main overland route to
western Europe was closed by the conflict in former Yugoslavia. For the same
reason, tourists travelling by car from northern Europe now use the Adriatic
ferry crossing.
The road from Patras in western Greece to Athens and Thessaloniki, a
distance of 800km, is being upgraded to motorway standard at a cost of
Dr350bn. However, several projects are being undertaken on a BOT -
build-operate-transfer - basis. These include the new Dollars 1.5bn Athens
airport to be built at Spata, the Dr90bn Thessaloniki city metro, and a
Dr150bn suspension bridge across the eastern end of the Corinth Gulf.
While these projects will include some grant aid from the EU package, most
financing will be raised privately. Though Greek companies hold small stakes
in the international consortia bidding for these projects, their
participation involves a financial commitment.
Mr Loukas Kyriacopoulos of Helleniki Technodomiki, which raised Dr3.2bn
through a listing last month, says: 'We'll use 60 per cent of funds raised
for working capital and the rest for equipment purchases and reorganising.
For the self-financed projects, we need much more capital behind us.'
Earlier this year, Mechaniki, listed on the Athens exchange several years
ago, raised Dr9.2bn in a rights issue intended to cover project financing
needs.
In addition to participating in consortia bidding for the Athens airport and
Thessaloniki metro projects, the company has undertaken the first BOT
project in Greece, a Dr2bn underground car park and shopping mall in central
Athens on a site owned by the Athens municipality.
The company is a member of international consortia tendering for road
projects in Albania and Hungary. It has also acquired a metal construction
company and a pipe manufacturer.
Mr Rizopoulos says: 'There are too many companies chasing contracts, so we
decided to start diversifying and go abroad - where the next stage of growth
will be.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (9): Corporate dilemmas / Jonathan
Schwarz discusses the agonising choice of a headquarters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN SCHWARZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The internationalisation of business has meant that multinational companies
have needed to establish regional headquarters for coordinating and
supervising their activity in a number of countries.
The emergence of regional trading blocks such as the EU and more latterly
the EEA, Nafta as well as other regional free trade areas has focused
attention increasingly on centralisation of management activities within
those areas. Headquarters locations are chosen for a variety of reasons
apart from the tax rules. These will include the qualify of life for senior
executives, proximity to markets, communications and quality of local labour
sources.
Many countries offer incentives and tailor their tax rules to attract
headquarters operations on the basis that they create employment,
particularly in services, and may encourage other local investment.
Headquarters operations comprise a wide range of activities. Traditionally,
this has included the provision of head office services to members of a
multinational group including administration and financing, accounting,
lobbying, marketing and advertising.
Increasingly in regional trading blocks, the functions are often expanded
beyond group financing and administration to group procurement and
purchasing of raw material and selling to multinational customers.
Within Europe, a number of countries have vied with each other to attract
headquarters operations. A number of countries including France, Germany,
Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands and the UK have all offered so-called 'cost
plus' arrangements.
In essence, this means tax authorities have been prepared to apply transfer
pricing rules on the provision of group administrative services on the basis
of a profit mark-up element charged over the cost of providing the services
to group companies. The attraction of such arrangements for multinational
companies is that they bring certainty to the overall tax position of the
group by agreeing in advance the contribution of those activities to the
group as a whole.
The manner in which the arrangements are provided varies enormously.
The UK, for example, which attracts the highest number of headquarters
operations in Europe, has no formal rulings process. Others, such as the
Belgium Coordination Centre, have a formal legal basis. Similarly, although
the cost plus arrangement is widely used, the actual application varies from
country to country.
The profit mark-up may range anywhere between 5 and and 30 per cent.
The costs which are to be included and excluded also vary from one country
to another. Similarly, all activities are not viewed in the same way by all
tax authorities. Activities which relate directly to the business of the
multinational company itself such as group purchasing or selling will
probably be most closely scrutinised.
A second important headquarters function is that of group holding company.
In Europe, this market has historically been dominated by the Netherlands
with other countries such as Luxembourg or Austria playing a very much
secondary role.
The passing of the EU Parent Subsidiary Directive has however opened up the
playing field considerably. The Directive requires EU member states to
eliminate withholding tax on dividends to parent companies in other EU
member states.
It also requires member states where parent companies are located
effectively to eliminate double taxation on these distributions by either
exempting them from tax or giving credit for corporate income tax paid by
the subsidiary.
The impact of this Directive and amendments that have been made in several
member states offer a wider variety of choice to the multinational company
in choosing a European group holding company location.
Although the UK attracts a significant number of administrative headquarters
operations, the impact of Advance Corporation Tax previously placed the UK
off-limits as a holding company location.
The introduction of an International Headquarters Company Regime in the 1994
Finance Act is a move towards attracting such companies. An International
Headquarters Company is one that is essentially foreign owned. No ACT is
payable on dividends paid to its foreign parent company out of dividends
received from its own foreign subsidiaries. The new regime falls short of
the ideal requirements for an international holding company, but is widely
regarded as a step in the right direction.
Other centralised activities such as group financing or licensing operations
are highly sensitive to the tax environment.
Since they are not dependent for their operations on a physical
establishment, these operations are carried out in many cases away from the
headquarters in locations such as the Netherlands or the Irish Dublin Docks
area.
No single country fulfils all the wishes of a typical multinational group
and therefore the various activities are spread among a number of countries.
Personal taxation of executives forms a crucial element in the package to
attract international headquarters operations.
Again a number of countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands offer
attractive tax regimes aimed at foreign executives on secondment. This is an
area where the UK has traditionally held the lead.
Its long established system of taxing non-domiciled individuals is regarded
as one of the central features in maintaining London's preeminence as an
international financial centre.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (8): Islands in the sun - and ice /
Offshore centres
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax havens, offshore centres, areas of low tax. Whatever the label, the
times are getting tougher for the growing number of jurisdictions trying to
lure corporations and high wealth individuals around the world.
As small island economies around the world struggle to generate business and
diversify from tourism or primary industry, they have sought the help of
consultants to promote their attractions.
The big accountancy firms have been well in evidence: Price Waterhouse
advising Gibraltar, KPMG Peat Marwick helping Malta and Trinidad &amp; Tobago,
for example.
An unseemly struggle has developed between many centres, with glossy
marketing brochures and international conferences on the rise. The Isle of
Man is competing against the Channel Islands, and even the more sedate
Jersey and Guernsey are at each other's throats, hiring public relations
firms and holding presentations in London, Paris and other leading cities to
gather potential business.
Mr Patrick Way, an expert on offshore centres who is soon to be admitted to
the tax bar, says: 'I do think it's fair to say that in the last 15 years
there has been a shift with offshore centres becoming much more like
companies trying to go out and get business. People travel much more easily
now and are picking and choosing where to go.'
Meanwhile, there has been an explosion in the number of centres and enormous
flux in the range of tactics the centres have used in efforts to attract new
business: introducing new products, amending tax legislation, diluting
corporate disclosure and registration requirements.
'You can count the number of havens in three digits now,' says Mr Ian McDade
of Price Waterhouse. 'It's become a pretty crowded market and very
competitive.'
Caroline Doggart, author of a regular survey of tax havens,* says that
Campione, on the border of Switzerland and Italy, was the first tax haven
when both nations abdicated their fiscal responsibility for the region.
One of the most recent, designed to exploit existing tax treaties, is Labuan
off Malaysia, while a reef, between Tonga and Fiji, has been mooted as the
world's first underwater retreat]
In between come a vast array of locations, generally in relatively tropical
climes: Bermuda, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin
Islands, the Cook Islands, and so on.
There are also the colder environs: the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man,
the Falklands, Norway's Svalbard Islands and Ascension. Others are
landlocked: such as Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, or even Albania. However,
Doggart also highlights less likely low tax areas, not least the UK, which
remains a very attractive low-tax centre for non-residents, and the US
compared with many European countries.
Mr Roger White of KPMG Peat Marwick, says he draws 'a sharp distinction'
between the less reputable centres and those such as the Channel Islands or
Hong Kong with economies in their own right and a developed, sophisticated,
responsible approach. He believes this two tier split will accentuate in the
future.
The problem is that the islands have become increasingly aggressive at a
time when the demand is slowing down as a result of recession in many parts
of the world. Mr John Fairley, partner in charge of the international tax
group at Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'Clearly there is a greater need at the moment
to get your cash back home.'
Equally, he highlights a tightening up in the global network of tax
treaties, increased cooperation by fiscal authorities around the world, and
the growing use of controlled foreign corporation legislation to clamp down
on companies using tax havens.
In 1981, a report by Richard Gordon, special counsel to the US Internal
Revenue Service, led to calls in the US legislature for a ban on flights to
some of the more questionable offshore jurisdictions.
In practice, the action taken by the US may have been less visible but it
has proved at least as powerful, with the Internal Revenue Service taking an
increasingly aggressive line on revising or simply tearing up existing tax
treaties.
One of the most significant such examples is the US-Dutch double taxation
treaty. Initially drafted in 1948, it was one of the oldest in the
industrialised world. It was the primary reason why the Netherlands appears
consistently each year as the largest foreign investor in the US after Japan
and Britain.
Most such investment was in reality coming from other places, such as Hong
Kong, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin America, which had no treaty
of their own with the US. This route saved them at least 20 per cent in
taxes. The changes mean it has almost dried up.
Reluctantly the Dutch agreed revised terms with the US last year under
threat of otherwise losing the continuation of any agreement. Now the US has
focused on other double tax agreements, including those with Denmark,
Luxembourg and Switzerland.
The risk among offshore centres is that rising competition will cause a
flight from quality in regulation and disclosure. However, Ms Doggart
suggests that the greater risk is that attempts by consultants to recommend
changes in line with the more successful centres will simply lead to a lack
of differentiation.
She adds that, ironically, more business is coming to those centres - such
as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man - which have toughened up their
regulation, improving inspections and limiting entry.
Ms Doggart is less concerned about the moral issues that may be involved in
those seeking to place assets or base operations in offshore centres. 'I
don't think morality comes into it, except when talking about drugs or money
laundering,' she says. 'As long as there's not universal tax harmonisation,
there will be havens.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (7): System suits the
self-employed - Kerin Hope finds franchising and leasing arrangements both
flourishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the highest percentage of self-employed businessmen and professionals
of any European Union member-state, Greece is a place where both franchising
and leasing arrangements can flourish.
Moreover, because interest rates on lending to small businesses are still
depressingly high (averaging more than 24 per cent), there is considerable
demand for alternative forms of financing.
Liberalisation of the Greek banking system enabled both franchising and
leasing to take off at the end of the 1980s. Franchising has grown by leaps
and bounds as deregulation of the banking system reduced the obstacles to
repatriating earnings in foreign currency.
At the same time, the appeal of foreign brand names in Greece helps to
attract well qualified applicants for franchises, especially for master
franchises covering the whole country, which are seen as the fast track to
wealth.
Restaurant chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, Wendy's and Pizza Hut lead
the franchise market, but other sectors are expanding fast.
Imported clothing labels are sold through different franchise systems.
Storehouse, the UK retailer, sells through a Greek store, Klaoudatos, in
Athens and Thessaloniki. Benetton outlets, on the other hand, can be found
in every provincial Greek city.
'Whether it's food or retailing, franchising is seen as a way of acquiring
expertise from abroad that gives a competitive advantage in the local
market. At the same time, the franchise arrangement provides a sense of
security,' says Mr Aris Ikkos of Metrotech Development Consultants.
While Greek franchising is dominated by food businesses, from ice-cream and
hamburger chains to patisserie and sandwich, accounting for some 25 per cent
of franchises, the system operates successfully in other sectors.
Neoset, a furniture producer with 50 franchise outlets which posted sales of
Dr6.5bn (Dollars 26m) last year, has expanded abroad, with half a dozen
franchisees in Poland and the Czech republic. Germanos, a battery producer,
sells through a network of 19 franchise outlets which claims to provide
batteries for anything 'from a watch to a helicopter.'
For manufacturers, a franchising arrangement helps to develop an effective
distribution network without the need for heavy capital investment .
'It's a system that suits the Greek business scene, where a high proportion
of people prefer to work for themselves, often in small businesses where
there's flexibility in operating methods,' Mr Ikkos says.
The average initial investment for a franchise in Greece is around Dr36m,
with an additional Dr16m required for working capital. Royalty payments
range between 5 and 10 per cent of turnover, in some cases including an
advertising levy.
The most innovative franchise in Greece is held by Southeastern European
Airlines, an Athens-based private operator, which flies the Athens-London
route for Virgin Airlines. SEEA's aircraft are painted in Virgin livery and
offer in-flight service to Virgin standards in what is billed as the
airline's industry first franchise arrangement.
'Virgin provided training and keeps a sharp eye on maintaining standards,'
says Mr Tassos Pantazopoulos, SEEA's managing director. 'We've kept prices
competitive, especially over the winter, and managed a load factor of more
than 70 per cent in the year since the flight started.'
Greece's 20 largest franchise networks averaged sales of around Dr2.5 bn
last year, against Dr1.5bn in 1992, according to a study by Alexander Young
Horwath, the business consultants. The country's biggest franchiser,
Goody's, a restaurant and cafe chain, made pre-tax profits of Dr1.2bn on
turnover of Dr10 bn.
For foreign franchisers, however, repatriating royalties can still be a
battle. Last year, commercial banks took over responsibility from the
central bank for processing payments, but procedures are still slow.
'The banks don't have personnel to handle royalty payments and after years
of just waiting for central bank approval, they're afraid to take on the
responsibility. Franchisors have to be very patient, ' says Mr Yanos
Gramatidis, an Athens lawyer who specialises in franchising.
Other problems affecting franchise operations include Greece's unpredictable
tax system and, in legal disputes, the Greek judiciary's tendency to favour
the franchisee, Mr Gramatidis adds.
If franchising has become established in Greece, leasing remains in its
infancy, with only 7 per cent of total investment financed through leasing
contracts, against a European average of 25 per cent.
The sector remains strictly regulated: all 10 Greek leasing companies
operations are subsidiaries of banks, mainly because individuals setting up
leasing operations are required to put up Dr4bn in capital, equivalent to
acquiring a banking licence.
Finance leasing, with contracts where the lessee has paid most of the value
of the equipment or machinery by the expiry date, is still the only form of
leasing available.
Leasing contracts are used to finance medical equipment for private clinics
and practitioners, machinery for smaller manufacturers, office, hotel and
restaurant equipment, computers and cars.
Most Greek lessees are responsible for finding the equipment themselves
before coming to the leasing company to arrange financing.
The services sector accounts for over 40 per cent of leasing contracts, with
another 35 per cent going to manufacturing. Despite continuing recession,
leasing activity is increasing at a rate of more than 30 per cent yearly,
helped by tax incentives for lessees. At the end of 1993, the total value of
leases reached more than Dr250bn.
'Though medical equipment is still the second-largest single item, the
biggest growth is in industrial machinery and car leasing,' says Mr
Vassilios Sarris, manager of Alpha Leasing, Greece's biggest leasing
company.
Machinery covered Dr16bn out of Alpha Leasing's total contracts of Dr46bn
last year, against Dr11.3bn for medical equipment.
Most leasing contracts run for four to five years and are paid through
monthly instalments. Bad debts are rarely a problem, Mr Sarris says, because
most lessees arrange contracts with the leasing subsidiary of their bank.
Although growth in both manufacturing and services is now faster in
provincial centres than in Athens, leasing is still largely confined to the
capital and its surroundings, where more than two-thirds of contracts are
arranged.
'The market potential for leasing is huge, considering that businessmen in
the provinces have been slow to realise its potential,' Mr Sarris says.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (8): A door opens on
knowhow / Profile of Pizza Hut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Location is what makes the difference in this business, then quality of
service,' says Mr Paul Tsouloufris of Food Plus, which took over the Pizza
Hut franchise for Greece two years ago.
Pizza Hut, part of the Pepsico group, had made little progress in Athens
under its first franchisee, although pizzas were already popular in Greece
and other foreign franchising operations were growing fast.
Since Food Plus acquired the franchise the number of outlets has grown from
two to six. Most are situated in the Athens suburbs in order to exploit
opportunities for home delivery and take-out services.
Mr Tsouloufris says that Food Plus differs from other Greek franchisees in
seeing Pizza Hut as an investment opportunity rather than a source of quick
returns. The company is putting Dr1bn (Dollars 4m) into developing the Pizza
Hut network - considerably more than any other local franchise operation in
Greece.
'Pizza could become the number one fast food in Greece by the end of the
decade,' he says. 'We decided we should operate and manage all the outlets
ourselves, although it meant that growth would be slower.'
Turnover this year is forecast at about Dr2bn, up from Dr570m in 1993.
Profits are projected at about Dr200m, against a loss of Dr200,000 last
year.
Food Plus aims at opening another 20 Pizza Hut outlets around Greece in the
next three years. By then, Mr Tsouloufris says, it should have become
Greece's leading pizza chain in delivery. Food Plus also aims at achieving
standards of service which will set Pizza Hut apart from other fast-food
chains.
Its outlets are designed to compete with restaurants and attract customers
in their 20s and 30s, Mr Tsouloufris says. 'Eating in is how the brand gets
established, so we want to impress people with quality, both product and
service. At the moment, too, Greek customers will pay a premium for good
service.'
The list of reminders for Pizza Hut waiters includes details often
overlooked in Greek tavernas, such as opening the door for customers or
offering to hang up their coats.
Mr Tsouloufris says that a few concessions are made to Greek tastes in
pizza, including one that features olives and feta cheese, 'but the concern
is really to maintain a consistent product. The great advantage is having
access to Pizza Hut's knowhow. In Greece we're bad at organising, and that's
where the franchisor really helps.'

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (10): Entrepreneurs move
in - Venture capital investment in the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<TEXT>
Considering the gaping holes in the region's investment framework, not to
mention its political instability, the Euromerchant Balkan Fund, a venture
capital fund to be based in Bulgaria, has attracted strong backing.
The World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have
agreed to cover 50 per cent of the fund's Dollars 25m capital.
The rest comes from Euromerchant Bank, a private Greek bank belonging to the
Latsis shipping organisation, the fund's sponsor, and from a group of
international and Greek investors. Several are Greek businessmen already
investing in the Balkans.
'We think we can become the most successful venture capitalists in the area
because many of our shareholders are active entrepreneurs. This will help
overcome the problem faced by others - generating high quality deal flow,'
says Mr Angelos Plakopittas, managing director of Global Finance, the
Athens-based venture capital company which will manage the fund.
Mr Plakopittas sees the relative absence of German and US investment in the
Balkans, in comparison with the rest of eastern Europe, as an opportunity.
The fund, he says, will enable local companies to grow to the point where
they can be acquired by foreign investors entering the market, providing an
exit for his investors.
The minimum investment for participants in the fund is Dollars 1m, to be
invested over three to five years. Scheduled to start operating later this
year, the fund will give priority to acquiring minority stakes in ventures
by European companies setting up in Bulgaria. Later, as privatisation there
gathers pace, the fund will help finance acquisitions of state-owned
companies.
'We expect to back companies in food production, retailing and construction
at first. But there's potential both in companies that export to the former
Soviet Union, and ones that provide added value at lower cost, such as
textiles and software.'
Global Finance pioneered venture capital and private equity investment in
Greece. It already manages two funds with equity totalling about Dr3bn
(Dollars 12m). Baring Venture Partners, the British bank's venture capital
arm, participates in one fund and acts as management adviser to the company.
Three years after Global opened its doors, two of the six Greek companies in
its portfolio are poised to join the Athens Stock Exchange and another is
expected to go public later this year.
The company considered over 200 investment proposals in selecting its
portfolio. It currently has Dr1.2bn committed in funds, taking equity stakes
of between 5 and 30 per cent in fast-growing companies offering products and
services new to Greece.
Iatron, in which Global has a 30 per cent stake, offers wholesale diagnostic
services through a network of affiliations with diagnostic centres. It
manages check-up services offered by leading insurance companies and plans
to enter the retail diagnostic market.
Epifaneia, of which Global has 20 per cent, is involved with specialised
publishing and printed corporate communications. It expects to increase
turnover by 50 per cent to Dr900m this year, while profits should double to
Dr175m. It is preparing to join the small board on the Athens bourse.
Mr Plakopittas says that Global is now well placed to move into the Balkans.
Three companies already in its portfolio, a restaurant chain, a snack
manufacturer and an optical goods chain, are planning to move into Bulgaria,
'and we've identified other opportunities in furniture production,
advertising and pharmaceuticals distribution'.
'We need to be based in the region we're operating in, so we're setting up
in Sofia. Providing professional hands-on management will be crucial.'
Bulgaria has attracted only a small amount of investment compared with other
eastern European countries, with a large percentage coming from Greece.
Greek companies are estimated to have invested Dollars 46m there in the past
three years.
Obstacles such as the lack of a bankruptcy law in Bulgaria, a primitive
banking system, high inflation and foreign exchange risk and opaque
accounting methods are among the challenges awaiting the fund's management
team.
From Sofia, the fund hopes to expand into Romania, Albania and the former
Yugoslav republics as Bulgarian-based companies in its portfolio enter other
Balkan markets. However, no more than 30 per cent of its capital can be
placed outside Bulgaria, a reflection of the relatively higher financial and
political risk elsewhere.
'If economic growth in the region picks up during the fund's 10-year life
span, the exit for investors may come through flotations on the local
capital market,' Mr Plakopittas says.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (9): A man with his work
cut out - Greece has the EU's highest debt to GDP ratio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind the desk of Mr Nikos Kyriazides, the deputy finance minister, stands
a late 19th century safe - a leftover from a period when Greece declared
itself bankrupt more than once.
It is a sobering reminder for Greece's new debt manager as he addresses a
public debt that has ballooned from 98 per cent of gross domestic product in
1989 to 138 per cent of GDP in January this year.
Greece has the highest debt to GDP ratio of any EU member, almost double the
target for economic convergence under the terms of the Maastricht treaty.
Last year the government borrowing requirement reached 13.9 per cent of GDP
against a target of 7.9 per cent.
What should have been a manageable shortfall in budget revenues turned into
a yawning gap as a result of a burst of pre-election spending by the former
conservative government and the loss of more than Dr300bn in expected
privatisation revenues.
So far, the socialist government is proving no more efficient at collecting
taxes than its conservative predecessor. Unless radical measures are taken
to boost revenues, this year's budget revenue shortfall will bring central
government borrowing up to 17 per cent of GDP, against a target of 12.8 per
cent.
Clearly, Mr Kyriazides, a former executive director of the IMF who has also
served as deputy governor of the Bank of Greece, the central bank, has his
work cut out.
Apart from the problem of financing a mounting deficit at interest rates
approaching 20 per cent, an additional Dr3,600bn of government debt has been
revealed, which will have to be securitised in 1994.
'We managed to cover the end-of-year problem through increased borrowing
abroad,' Mr Kyriazides says. 'The question now is getting interest rates
down to lighten the burden of financing both new and existing debt.'
In addition to raising Y340m on the Japanese market, the government borrowed
Dr200bn from four Greek banks through a seven-year bond issue with interest
at 2.25 per cent above the rate for 12-month Treasury bills.
The newly discovered debt includes Dr280bn in obligations by the state-owned
Agricultural Bank and another Dr350bn in state-guaranteed debt, with the
remainder in claims against the government by the central bank, which must
be recognised under the terms of the Maastricht treaty.
While part of the new debt can be securitised without increasing net
borrowing, the Bank of Greece is demanding market rates of interest on the
government's residual debt, which will add to the government's borrowing
problem.
The government has tried to ease the pressure by extending its debt profile,
issuing three- and five-year bonds which have proved popular with
institutional investors in Greece and elsewhere. However, these offer no
real respite as they carry floating rates linked to that of the 12-month
Treasury bill.
'The policy is now changing: over the next few months, we plan to start
issuing fixed-coupon drachma bonds at longer maturities, now that that the
supranationals have done so,' Mr Kyriazides says.
The successful launch of 'marathon' bonds by the European Investment Bank
and World Bank earlier this year has soothed the government's fears that
fixed-coupon bonds would prove unattractive to investors. While the annual
inflation rate has steadily declined, falling from a peak of 16.4 per cent
in March 1993 to 10.2 per cent in March this year, interest rates on the
12-month bill have moved down more slowly, from 22 per cent in to 18.5 per
cent over the same period.
As a result, real interest rates reached a record 8.3 per cent last month.
They seem unlikely to decline further; the inflation rate is edging up again
and there are signs of fatigue among investors, underlined by last month's
shortfall of about Dr60bn in renewals of Treasury bills.
Real rates must also remain high enough to continue attracting investors
from abroad, while allowing for depreciation of the drachma.
However, the government's unexpected decision to liberalise short-term
capital movements six weeks ahead of the July 1 deadline could alter the
picture dramatically.
The liberalisation was designed to pre-empt speculative attacks against the
drachma in the run-up to July 1 and avert a possible devaluation. It remains
to be seen whether the central bank's policy of hiking interest rates on the
interbank market to record levels in order to protect the currency can be
sustained for more than a few weeks.
There is no doubt that interest rates on government bonds will have to rise
sharply, to buttress the drachma against the likelihood of massive capital
outflows.
Greek bankers predict that devaluation can be held off, at least for the
moment, through faster depreciation of the drachma. Whatever happens, the
prospects for lightening the debt burden this year are fading fast.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (5): Transferring the pain - How
companies switch profits to low tax areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN SCHWARZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International transfer pricing is perhaps the single most important
recurring issue in the international tax context. It has long been an
instrument of multinational companies in maximising their global after-tax
profits by attempting to shift income from high to low tax areas.
For more than 60 years, the arm's length standard has been almost
universally accepted as the measure for determining the proper level of
charges between related entities in different countries.
The concept is simple: related parties should be treated for tax purposes as
if they are unrelated in settling the proper level of charges. However, the
application of the concept has been far from simple. While a number of
different methodologies have been developed, no single approach is
applicable in all circumstances and, even if a particular method is agreed,
there is no single correct 'arm's length price'. Although the issue has been
around for a long time, it has only recently been elevated to an important
political issue centred on the US.
Unitary taxation which has been adopted by a number of states seeks to
ignore the arm's length principle and to allocate income of multinational
businesses according to a fixed formula.
This issue has now become enormously complex and highly politicised.
California and other unitary states have amended their unitary tax law to
meet some of the criticisms that have been levelled by multinational
companies and foreign governments.
Much of the debate has centred around the key case of Barclays Bank v
California. Although the decision awaited from the Supreme Court now only
covers past taxes, it has become something of a political hot potato.
The Bush Administration supported foreign companies and governments in
condemning unitary taxation. The Clinton Administration on the other hand
has been supportive of the California position. In Washington, unitary tax
is also now being discussed in some circles as a solution to transfer
pricing at the Federal level.
Foreign companies are accused of manipulating prices in relation to their US
operations, allegedly to deprive the US Treasury of vast amounts of money.
Although more sober, considered opinions have tended to discount the
estimates given, the political perception remains that the US is being
plundered and that existing rules are inadequate to deal with this.
The reality may be somewhat different. Although legislation embodying the
arm's length principle has been seen by most governments as a defensive
method against price manipulation by multinational companies, a new
perspective has emerged recently.
Governments hard pressed for revenues are seeking transfer pricing as a
possible revenue source. The attraction is that no tax increases need be
legislated and the idea that foreign companies are not paying their fair
share of taxes wins more votes than domestic tax increases.
Although the US Administration has taken an increasingly tough line, the IRS
has been somewhat unsuccessful in persuading the US tax courts to accept
their views on pricing in specific cases.
Evidence of the heights of desperation in dealing with this is shown by a
statement of Senator Carl Levin before the Senate Committee on Governmental
Affairs that a formulary apportionment method needs to be developed 'to get
us out of this transfer pricing problem'.
The IRS has deployed considerable resources into international transfer
pricing. The US rules have been tightened considerably and the penalty
provisions have become a significant issue for foreign companies doing
business in the US. At the same time, armies of tax professionals are now
engaged in advising on transfer pricing or locked in dispute with the IRS.
Traditionally, disputes as to which country should be entitled to tax
profits have been resolved using the competent authority provisions of tax
treaties.
These are confidential government to government negotiations. However, there
have been several transfer pricing disputes recently which have been aired
in public. The Japanese Government's proposed Dollars 145m tax adjustment
for Coca Cola is a good example.
Some commentators have noted that the amount of the assessment is virtually
identical to the refund of Japanese tax agreed as a result of competent
authority proceedings in November 1993 involving Nissan motors.
AIU, the US insurance company has also announced publicly the result of
competent authority proceedings between the US and Japanese tax authorities
which has resulted in a repayment by Japan's national tax administration.
Other transfer pricing issues involving the company are still being
discussed between US and Japanese competent authorities.
One ray of hope emanating from the US is the Advanced Pricing Agreement
(APA). Taxpayers, the IRS and possibly authorities in other countries enter
into an agreement on acceptable transfer pricing policies and levels. The
first such agreement involving Apple Computers, the US and Australia has
been in place for some years.
Recently, multi-country APAs have been signed in the area of global trading
in financial instruments. Countries outside the US in the leading financial
centres have reacted favourably to advanced pricing agreements between the
countries concerned and the taxpayer on allocation of profits, particularly
in the area of global trading.
This is an area where it is often difficult to allocate profits given the
nature of the business and tax authorities along with taxpayers see this as
a method of avoiding protracted resource consuming disputes.
Transfer pricing issues are not restricted to the US. Although the issue is
an important one in Europe, it has not received the public attention that it
has commanded in the US. It continues to be an issue in developing
countries. China, for example, has recently introduced a transfer pricing
provision as part of its tax reform programme, although many developing
countries still rely heavily on currency controls to regulate transfer
pricing.
Notwithstanding these problems, virtually all countries outside the US are
committed to the arm's length standard and the game will continue to be
played between taxpayers and tax collectors in the foreseeable future.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (6): Relief without pleasure /
Assessing reactions to the UK's new advanced corporation tax rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer will see the first payments of cash dividends by UK companies
which will not attract advance corporation tax for many years.
Changes announced in last November's budget will allow companies to reclaim
ACT on dividends if certain conditions are met. However, so far only one,
BAT Industries, has said it will take advantage of the rule change which
takes effect from July 1.
Since the imputation system of tax on dividends was introduced in 1973,
companies have been obliged to act as income tax collectors for the Inland
Revenue. They must pay dividends to shareholders net of basic rate income
tax, and pass on the tax due to the Treasury.
Those shareholders entitled to receive income gross - such as pension funds
 -must apply for a refund of tax, while higher rate taxpayers must pay the
difference between the basic rate already paid by the company and their
marginal tax rate.
Meanwhile, the companies, having paid the tax in advance, can then offset it
against their mainstream corporation tax payments, hence the name advance
corporation tax.
The system appears very neat. But it has proved increasingly unpopular with
companies. A problem arises if a company has too low a UK corporation tax
liability to offset the whole of the ACT it has paid on the dividends.
If that is the case, the company ends up paying a greater proportion of its
profits in tax than it is strictly liable to do. So-called 'unrelieved ACT'
can be carried over to future years, but some companies find they can never
offset it against corporation tax and must evenutally write it off.
In other words, as Mr Barry Bracewell-Milnes, an expert on the subject, has
put it, 'in certain circumstances ACT is not an advance tax but a final
tax'.
Companies build up unrelieved ACT when they have a UK corporation tax
liability disproportionately low relative to the dividends paid. At the last
estimate, the total of surplus ACT was Pounds 5.5bn, and the mountain was
increasing at the rate of Pounds 700m a year.
This can occur for two main reasons; either when a company's UK profits have
dropped but it decides to maintain dividends at a high level, or where a
company's overseas activities have become dominant in total profits.
The Treasury has little sympathy in the former, so-called cyclical case  -
and is now investigating why companies have continued to pay dividends at
pre-recession levels through the downturn - which could in any case be cured
when profits recover.
However, the latter, structural, problem is both long term and a worrying
deterrent to companies expanding outside the UK. Arguably, if companies do
not compete internationally, they will eventually be unable to compete at
home.
The ACT problem was having a distorting effect on companies' behaviour. For
instance, encouraging the purchase of non-trading companies' with a
maintstream corporation tax record and the moving of costs - such as head
offices, research and development establishments or borrowings - off-shore
so as to depress foreign earnings and boost UK profits.
Then, last year a rash of enhanced scrip dividends appeared, which made
significant inroads to the Treasury's receipts from ACT. Companies used the
enhanced scrip idea because dividends paid in shares rather than in cash do
not attract ACT. The trick was to make the share dividend so much more
attractive than the cash dividend - by setting it 50 per cent higher - that
most, if not all, shareholders would plump for the paper.
Years of lobbying by companies, the increasing size of the problem, with
unrelieved ACT mounting, and the prevalence of the enhanced scrips finally
broke through the Treasury's natural resistance to losing part of its
income. And in last year's March budget Mr Norman Lamont, then Chancellor of
the Exchequer, acknowledged that 'something must be done' about ACT by
bringing up the idea of a 'foreign income dividend' scheme (FID). Put
simply, the idea was that if companies could show dividends were paid out of
foreign profits they could reclaim the ACT on them.
A period of consultation followed which left companies divided over whether
the scheme would be beneficial. Many thought it did not go far enough, since
it tackled only the 'structural' not the 'cyclical' problem. Others thought
it would be cumbersome to operate.
But the greatest concern was that it would divide shareholders against each
other. Under the outlined scheme the position of a taxpaying shareholder
would be unchanged and the dividend would be treated as if basic rate tax
had been paid on it.
However, non-taxpayers, those who reclaim the tax credit, would not be able
to claw back that income from a FID. That would mean they would lose a
sizeable portion of their income, and could lead them to sell shares in
companies which paid FIDs, distorting stock market values.
So when Mr Kenneth Clarke revealed his Budget in November, there was some
surprise that the FID scheme was introduced much as originally suggested.
And the scheme met only a guarded welcome.
Nor has the response become more enthusiastic since further details were
published in the Finance Bill. So far only BAT - the company which pioneered
enhanced scrip dividends last year - has said it will definitely pay a FID,
its final dividend for 1993, which will be delayed until July to take
advantage of the new rules.
The tobacco and insurance group makes about 70 per cent of its profits
outside the UK and has been suffering high tax rates as a result of
unrelieved ACT. By making its final dividend a FID it will save about Pounds
90m in ACT.
However, in order to address the concerns of non-tax paying shareholders,
which make up about 40 per cent of BAT's shareholder register, the company
will pass the ACT saving to investors through a 25 per cent higher dividend.
In spite of BAT's lead, announced in March, no other large companies have
yet followed. The complexity of the FID scheme may well deter companies,
since they must pay the ACT on dividends and then reclaim it by proving that
the dividend has been paid from foreign income. Some companies find that
repatriating cash from overseas to pay a FID brings extra costs which might
outweigh the benefits of saving ACT.
No doubt finance directors and tax experts are looking closely at the
scheme. But it may take a further reform of the rules before there is a
wider interest in using it.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (4): Governments cling to their
autonomy - The European Union is crawling cautiously towards harmonisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN SCHWARZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People who are sceptical about European tax harmonisation and integration
commonly point to the failure of the Ruding Commission to make any real
impact on European tax systems in the Single Market. They note that various
measures proposed to harmonise corporate income tax in Europe have failed to
be enacted. The Transitional VAT Regime which has been in place since
January 1, 1993 is criticised for its complexity and other shortcomings.
The doctrine of subsidiarity has had a significant impact on tax
harmonisation in the post-Maastricht period.
Under the direction of Taxation Commissioner Christiane Scrivener, the
Commission has changed tack somewhat in relation to its programme. Member
state autonomy has been emphasised and a number of direct tax harmonisation
measures previously proposed no longer form the main thrust of the
Commission's direct tax activities.
The Commission is now focusing specifically on cross-border activities. It
has issued detailed recommendations on how cross-border or frontier
employees are to be taxed in order to avoid arguments about tax
discrimination against employees from one member state working in another.
Other projects include the harmonisation and simplification of procedures
for claims under intra-Community tax treaties relating to repayment of
withholding tax and other reductions of taxes. They are also examining the
improvement of exchange of information procedures in order to counter
cross-border tax evasion.
Neither of these are likely to result in high profile legislative
amendments, but will undoubtedly contribute to the integration of tax
administration and ease of cross-border investment.
The European tax system is indeed developing rapidly and has taken a number
of significant steps forward. Some of these changes receive relatively
little publicity, but nonetheless have an important unifying effect.
The Community Customs Code which came into force on January 1, 1994
consolidates and amends European Customs law in its entirety. It has been
adopted by way of EU Regulation. As a result, it is automatically binding in
all member states and needs no further legislation to make it directly
applicable. Although administration and enforcement is left to member
states, a single accessible body of rules emphasises the singularity of the
Customs Union.
The most significant recent step is the introduction of the Transitional VAT
Regime on January 1, 1993. It is a hybrid system combining both a
'destination' principle for cross-border commercial transactions and an
'origin' principle broadly for non-commercial transactions. Although the
lifting of internal border controls and the doing away of some 60m
administrative documents have been hailed as a success, the introductory
period has not been easy. A fundamental change in the rules has left tax
administrators and payers alike with an enormous task both in understanding
the new system and implementing it. Some have claimed that it merely
replaces one form of bureaucracy by another.
Some of the difficulties raised by the new rules have already been smoothed
out. For example, the so-called Simplification Directive aims at minimising
the tax burden in so-called 'triangular' transactions where delivery of
goods does not follow the same path as legal title.
The fundamental issue is that the current rules are intended to be replaced
by a 'definitive' VAT system by the beginning of 1997. The definitive system
is expected to be based entirely on the origin basis of taxation. Such a
system will clearly favour member states which supply goods and services at
the expense of those in which the goods and services are consumed. Doubts
have therefore been expressed as to whether a 'definitive' system will
emerge and what form it will take.
The year 1997 also marks one of the target dates for direct tax
harmonisation in accordance with the Ruding Committee proposals. Both these
deadlines must be seen in the context of wider European integration. While
the tax integration is intended to follow political and monetary union,
undoubtedly their futures will be tied up with the outcome of that debate.
The Commission's controversial carbon/energy tax proposal for a levy of
Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent has met with considerable
opposition. Nonetheless, the Environment Commissioner, Yannis Paleokrassas,
has suggested a shift overall in the tax burden away from taxes on
employment such as social security taxes to pollution and resources.
He has also suggested a new system of land use and building use and vehicle
taxes to improve environmental and fiscal conditions of cities. He has been
at pains to suggest that this should not increase the overall tax burden.
The Ruding Committee and the Commission have both emphasised the necessity
for completing bilateral tax treaties between member states in order to
minimise double taxation within the EU.
Treaties have been signed between Greece and Luxembourg, and between
Portugal and Ireland. Neither of these are yet in force. Portugal still has
no treaty with the Netherlands, and Greece has no treaty with Ireland or
with Spain.
Some of the most important European Union tax developments have occurred
outside the overt political arena.
The European Court has given judgment on a number of crucial issues
affecting the ability of member states to do as they please in tax matters.
In the Commerzbank case, the European Court found that the UK rules which
allowed only UK residents interest (the 'repayment supplement') on tax
overpayments was discriminatory and contrary to European law.
A similar line has been taken recently by the Advocate General in the
Halliburton case where the Advocate General has issued an opinion condemning
Dutch property transfer tax rules which discriminate against cross-border
corporate reorganisations as being contrary to the law of the European
Union. In each case, disputes have arisen on the validity of the tax laws of
member states not in relation to the taxation directives, but in relation to
the basic European law as set out in the Treaty of Rome.
The European Court has shown no mercy in striking down a miscellany of taxes
imposed by member states which are contrary to European law.
Recent examples include a Portuguese tax on the sales of domestic and
imported paper pulp, Italian annual payments for the registration of
companies, and Italian penalties which discriminate more severely in
relation to cross-border tax offences than offences relating to domestic
transactions.
The Court has examined closely the manner in which member states have given
effect to VAT law, striking down those rules that are not consistent with
VAT Directives.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (5): Soaring volumes
strain the stock exchange system / Investigating the impact of electronic
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When electronic trading was introduced on the Athens stock exchange two
years ago, brokers complained that their day's work would be over in less
than an hour. Now the system threatens to collapse under the strain of
soaring volumes and a stream of new listings.
The growth in volume underlines how much interest institutional investors
have been taking in Greece. The daily average rose from around Dr1.3bn in
1992 to Dr5.8bn in the final quarter of last year, increasing to Dr8bn on
days of heavy trading.
A shortage of large share packages meant that Athens benefited less than
other emerging markets from last year's buying spree by US institutions.
However, overseas investors drove the market to a two-year high in January
and are still thought to account for more than 30 per cent of the free
float.
Market capitalisation at the end of the first quarter totalled Dr3,377bn,
equivalent to 17 per cent of Greece's gross domestic product. The
screen-based trading system is now being upgraded, but the pace of new
listings will slow for most of this year. More than 30 flotations are
planned, together with another 25 rights issues.
The lack of an efficient settlement system also frustrates foreign
investors. The surge in activity means that settlement can take up to a week
rather than the statutory three days.
'The market's development is being held back by the absence of paperless
settlement. You can work around the limitations of the trading system, but
overseas clients need proper settlement procedures,' says Mr Dimitris
Verriopoulos of Alpha Brokerage.
The wave of new listings indicates how attitudes have changed as Greek
companies plan strategies for staying competitive in the European market and
expanding into eastern Europe.
Many large Greek companies remain family-owned and managed. Some older
generation managers still claim that the benefits of going public are
outweighed by the disadvantages of becoming accountable to shareholders and
assuming a higher profile for the tax authorities.
But high interest rates make the stock market an attractive proposition,
while family owners need not lose control: the minimum capital increase
required for a listing is 25 per cent.
Construction companies started to take the plunge last year, in preparation
for bidding for infrastructure projects being co-financed by the European
Union. Other new entrants this year will include the first passenger
shipping line to be listed, Greece's largest electronic media group, several
software manufacturers and textile concerns, a restaurant chain and a fish
farm.
If the construction company example holds good, several more companies in
each of the other sectors will follow suit.
'The business environment is changing so fast that once a market leader in
one sector is floated, others must follow in order to safeguard
competitiveness. This is widening and deepening the market at an
unprecedented rate,' says Mr John Markopoulos, chairman of Sigma Securities.
On the other hand, the market's development is constrained by the absence of
Greek institutional investors. Although pension funds have large
shareholdings, mainly in state-controlled banks, administrative restrictions
mean they are rarely traded. While private pension funds invest in mutual
funds, they have not yet taken full advantage of deregulation to set up
active management operations.
According to some estimates, over Dr300bn would become available for trading
if the pension funds decided to become active in the market.
However, there appears to be no shortage of liquidity, despite high interest
rates on tax-free government bonds. Some Dr60bn was raised on the stock
market in the first quarter, of which rights issues by listed companies
accounted for Dr51bn. The construction company offerings, averaging around
Dr3bn each, have been hugely oversubscribed.
Bankers involved in underwriting issues say that, given the depth of
liquidity, the stock exchange authorities are over-cautious about the size
and price of offerings.
Only a few companies seek to raise more than Dr5bn, which leaves little
margin for placing shares with foreign investors. Under a new regulation,
companies will be restricted to one rights issue a year. But a handful of
blue chip companies have won approval without difficulty for much larger
issues, mostly including an international tranche of 20-25 per cent.
Credit Bank, Greece's largest private bank, recently raised Dr31bn through a
rights issue, of which 25 per cent was placed with institutional investors
abroad. Ionian Bank, a state-controlled bank, also plans a Dr30bn rights
issue. Intracom, the telecoms equipment manufacturer, intends to raise about
Dr20bn through a rights issue.
However, the structuring of Greek issues, where the price is fixed well
ahead of a subscription period lasting several weeks, means there is little
flexibility on pricing for an international tranche.
'The way it works at present, buyers can't get access to their holdings for
several weeks. This raises problems for institutional investors,' says Mr
Mario Sophroniou of Barings, which placed the Credit Bank international
tranche.
But even large Greek offerings pale beside the partial flotation of OTE (the
Greek state telecoms monopoly), planned for October. The government intends
to sell some 30 per cent of the company through the Athens bourse, although
up to half the issue will be offered to buyers abroad.
It is hoped to raise at least Dr250bn from the flotation. Advisers at the
economy ministry dismiss brokers' fears that the issue might swamp the
market, while admitting that it will pose a challenge to local underwriters.
If successful, the OTE flotation may be followed by listings of other public
utilities such as oil refineries or the public power and gas corporations.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (6): Regulations become
stricter - Kerin Hope meets Manolis Xanthakis, president of the Athens stock
exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Manolis Xanthakis, president of the Athens Stock Exchange, is
taking a sabbatical in order to put some of his ideas into practice.
A financial markets specialist in the economics faculty at Athens
University, he taught many of the brokers now working on the bourse.
He deals briskly with the suggestion that an academic background may not be
ideal for controlling a boisterous emerging market: 'The university's
financial markets group has already done much to shape the development of
capital markets in Greece. I'm continuing the practice.'
Prof Xanthakis's appointment last autumn coincided with an unprecedented
spate of applications for listings on the stock exchange which shows no sign
of diminishing. However, regulations for public offerings have become
stricter as the role of the capital markets committee, which approves
proposed listings before they reach the stock exchange board, was
strengthened.
From a loose grouping of bankers from the big state-controlled banks and
financial experts, all holding other jobs, the committee is 'becoming a more
independent and serious regulator of the market,' he says.
So also is the stock exchange board.
Its latest requirements include stricter auditing of companies seeking
listings, while listed companies planning large rights issues will be
subject to audits of results for the five previous years, to be carried out
by the quasi-state Body of Sworn Accountants (SOL). 'We don't want to deter
applications, quite the contrary. But there has to be more transparency,'
Prof Xanthakis says.
Bringing more small companies to the market is another priority.
A study is under way to determine whether to add a third tier to the Athens
stock market - 'not exactly an over-the-counter market, but one designed to
speed growth by small companies that have little access to bank financing at
present and are forced to go outside the the system to raise funds.'
The tokoglyphoi - the private lenders who charge exorbitant interest rates
to small companies in need of cash advances - are part of the demonology of
Greek business life.
The parallel market, set up three years ago, is not much of a success,
attracting only half a dozen entrants in the three years since it was
established. It has also suffered as participants moved more quickly than
expected to join the main board. But Prof Xanthakis believes the parallel
market remains the 'natural home of small but sophisticated companies', such
as electronics manufacturers and software companies in need of relatively
small amounts of capital.
Introducing new products such as futures and options will depend on how fast
the electronic trading system can be upgraded, he says. 'What is more
important, for the moment, is extending access to the system, for example by
starting on-line trading for brokers based in Thessaloniki.'
Although Thessaloniki is as big a manufacturing centre as Athens, and trade
is growing as more northern Greek companies set up joint ventures in
Bulgaria and Romania, only a handful of companies based there are listed on
the Athens stock exchange.
'There are a number of dynamic smaller companies in northern Greece that
ought to be listed. Setting up closer trading links with Thessaloniki should
help to encourage them,' Prof Xanthakis says.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (3): The dog that did not bark -
Tax issues are obscured by Bill Clinton's other political troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a fierce battle in 1993 over the first budget of President Bill
Clinton's new administration, the US Congress this year has pushed taxes
much lower on its agenda.
The House of Representatives Ways and Means committee and the Senate Finance
committee, which handle taxation issues, have plenty to keep them busy with
the ramifications of health care reform, in which they play a central role.
But few major tax measures are likely to come up for legislation this year.
Indeed, taxation has to a considerable extent faded into the political
landscape, to the disgruntlement of Republicans who hoped that the top rate
increases in personal and corporate income tax passed last year in the
fiscal 1994 budget would come back to haunt Mr Clinton.
Pollsters for both the Republicans and the Democrats agree that most voters
put taxes well down their lists of problems. Although most people still
think their tax bill is going up, the Congressional Budget Office found that
80 per cent of the increase fell on roughly 1.4m families with incomes above
Dollars 200,000 a year; even the well-off, with incomes between Dollars
100,000 and Dollars 200,000, faced an average bill of only Dollars 649.
'On April 15th, the American people will discover the truth about what we
did last year on taxes. Only the top one - yeah - the top 1.2 per cent of
Americans, as I said all along, will face higher income tax rates,' Mr
Clinton exulted in his state of the union speech earlier this year.
Raising taxes remains, nevertheless, politically incendiary.
With strict budget rules still in place, every single revenue-losing measure
passed by the Congress must be offset either with spending cuts or tax
increases. That led to a fierce last-minute struggle a year ago to finance
the tariff cuts contained in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and is
causing heartburn this year as the administration finds ways to offset the
Dollars 13.9bn of tariff cuts it agreed to in the just completed Uruguay
Round of trade negotiations.
So politicians search hard for ways of justifying a tax increase by letting
the punishment fit the crime. User fees have become popular, while the
financial cornerstone of the Clinton health care reform plan is a hefty
increase in the tax on cigarettes - singled out because of their deleterious
effect on health. Other unhealthy products such as guns and alcohol were,
after much consideration, spared a tax increase to pay for health care
reform. Gambling, which had been targeted by some not wholly lucid thought
process as a suitable source of revenues to fund Mr Clinton's planned reform
of the welfare system, has now also been spared.
For tobacco, however, it is now open season. Although Mr Clinton proposed an
increase of only 75 cents a pack, taking the rate to 99 cents, in order to
avoid alienating members of Congress from tobacco-growing states,
congressional committees are already trying to push the rate up to Dollars
1.49 a pack.
The prospect of an increase in federal tobacco taxes, however, is spurring
the states to raise their own cigarette taxes, in anticipation that revenues
will drop in the face of higher prices - but also because tobacco is the
most convenient horse to flog.
New York had already raised its cigarette tax last year, and Michigan
slapped on an extra 50 cents a pack as part of a sweeping package in which
it replaced local property taxes with higher sales taxes as a way of
financing education in the state. At least five other states are proposing
to follow suit.
Overall, however, state finances are more stable than they have been for the
last five years, according to a recent survey by the National Council of
State Legislatures. The survey showed that 45 out of 50 states claimed to be
fiscally sound this year, twice as many as a year earlier.
Nevertheless, many of the most contentious issues now filtering up through
the tax courts involve states' efforts to push the outside of their fiscal
envelope: from the Barclays case against California's unitary tax assessment
system to the fallout from the Supreme Court's earlier decision in the Quill
case on whether a state may require out-of-state mail order companies to
levy taxes on sales to its inhabitants.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the Barclays case next month. The
immediate impact, however, is likely to be small, since California last year
changed its tax code to eliminate virtually everything that foreign
companies and governments find objectionable about unitary assessments,
which attempt to calculate a company's tax as a percentage of its worldwide
income, rather than only of income earned in the state.
But a ruling in California's favour could encourage the state, and many
others which find unitary assessments much simpler to administer than the
conventional arm's length standard, to revert to the controversial formula.
Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, long an admirer of unitary
assessments, would also like to introduce the system at the federal level.
He is not expected to make immediate headway, since such a move would wreak
havoc in the entire worldwide taxation system, but pressure could build
unless the Internal Revenue Service improves its success rate in transfer
pricing cases brought under the arm's length standard.
In the Quill case, decided in 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that North
Dakota could not levy a use tax from Quill Inc., an Illinois office products
company - but only because it would interfere with interstate commerce, not
because it would violate Quill's constitutional right to due process.
The decision was seen as a virtual invitation to Congress to authorise tax
collections from out-of-state mail order companies, and Senator Dale Bumpers
of Arkansas has duly obliged with the 'Tax Fairness for Main Street
Business' bill.
The bill would allow a state to require an out-of-state company to collect
sales tax for them if its total US sales exceed Dollars 3m and its sales in
the state topped Dollars 100,000, and if it had 'personal jurisdiction,' a
relationship involving much less than the 'physical contact' now required to
establish tax collection responsibilities.
'This legislation is significant because it would change some fundamental
rules regarding when a state or local government may impose a tax,'
commented Mr Tom Grudichak, director of Coopers and Lybrand's multistate tax
services in Chicago.
Implementation could open a can of worms, but the measure could prove
popular in Congress, because states claim they now lose Dollars 2.2bn a year
because of their inability to collect sales taxes from the booming mail
order industry.
In any event, tax experts expects states to continue testing the limits of
their taxing power for years to come.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (2): Stimuli for freer trade /
Probing the reasons for the continuing spread of bilateral tax treaties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN SCHWARZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Double tax treaties form a crucial link between the tax systems of nation
states.
They allocate taxing authority between contracting countries and bring
certainty to the taxation of cross-border transactions.
The presence or absence of a tax treaty is often a factor in international
business and investment location decisions.
It is now fully accepted that treaties facilitate international flows of
goods, capital, services and technology.
However, countries sign treaties for different motives. Most OECD countries
regard treaties as providing a standard framework for all countries in
allocating taxing jurisdiction.
The US now sees treaties as primarily a tool for obtaining information for
tax compliance purposes and to deal with double taxation in relation to
specific trading and investment relationships. Developing countries view
treaties as an indication of fiscal stability.
The most dense network of bilateral treaties is among OECD members. The
network between the most industrialised countries is now largely complete
and activity is generally limited to re-negotiating and updating treaties to
deal with changes in domestic law and new thinking on treaty issues.
Among emerging market countries, however, the treaty network is expanding
rapidly. India, Mexico and South Africa are swiftly expanding and updating
their tax treaty relations as they modernise their economies and open up to
increased foreign investment. Such countries commonly view tax treaties as a
key tool in giving foreign investors confidence in their stability.
As a result, most new treaties entered by emerging market countries tend to
be with major capital exporting countries.
Although the basic framework of international tax treaties has been
established for some time, both in the OECD and United Unions Model Treaty,
several key issues have emerged recently.
In order to encourage investment in developing countries, a number of them
have introduced so-called tax sparing credits. This arrangement is designed
to ensure that tax incentives given in developing countries are not
neutralised when foreign investors repatriate their profits to the home
country.
The mechanism treats income which has not been taxed in the developing
countries, because of local incentives, as if it had been taxed for the
purpose of applying the foreign tax credit at the multinational's corporate
headquarters.
A number of countries are increasingly questioning this policy. The UK, for
example, is only prepared to provide tax sparing relief for very specific
incentives in developing countries.
This has largely arisen as a result of the fact that businesses in emerging
markets are now competing with those in developed countries aided by the tax
sparing credit. This is particularly so in the area where local tax reliefs
are aimed at export industries. The US has never agreed to tax sparing in
its treaties and has stated that it will not do so.
In many cases, the tax issues in double tax treaties end up involving issues
of allocation of tax income between the two countries in question. The
taxpayer is caught in the middle of this process and, in some cases, may
even have little interest in the outcome.
Arbitration clauses are becoming a popular way to resolve these issues. New
treaties negotiated by the US with Germany, Mexico and the Netherlands
contain arbitration clauses. Similar clauses are also found in new German
treaties with Sweden and France. While there are many unresolved questions,
this is an idea whose time has come.
Treaty shopping is also emerging as a crucial issue in relation to both the
negotiation of new tax treaties and the application of existing treaties.
While most tax administrations seem to agree that this is a bad thing, there
is little agreement on the solution.
The US has taken the lead and sought to include extremely broad
comprehensive anti-abuse provisions. In testimony before the US Senate
foreign relations committee, assistant Secretary (Tax Policy) Leslie Samuel
said that the previous Dutch tax treaty was one of the most widely abused of
the US treaties. He claimed it was used by investors from all over the world
for investing in the US in order to receive benefits to which they were not
properly entitled. In the new US-Netherlands Treaty, there is a detailed
rigorous anti-abuse provision.
Other countries take a more focused view. The UK Inland Revenue, for
example, has stated that it prefers narrowly targeted responses to perceived
problems. These have mainly comprised specific provisions on such matters as
interest and royalties.
The Netherlands too has taken a more pragmatic approach. It has been
suggested there, for example, that the concepts of beneficial ownership and
residence provide a reasonable basis for combating improper use,
particularly when supplemented by an adequate exchange of information.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (4): Fears persist of a
forced devaluation - The drachma looks more fragile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drachma is looking increasingly fragile in the wake of Greece's sudden
decision on May 14 to lift all remaining curbs on short-term capital
movement.
While the move was welcomed as a bold attempt to pre-empt speculative
assaults on the Greek currency, fears persist that the government may be
forced to devalue.
In theory, the July 1 deadline for bringing Greece into line with the rest
of the EU on freedom of capital movement could have been extended by six
months. But as recent events on Greece's currency markets have shown, a
prolonged waiting period would only encourage speculation against the
drachma.
In raising interest rates to record levels immediately after the
liberalisation, Greece followed the strategy of other European governments
faced with a currency crisis. Opinion remains divided over whether it will
be enough to protect the drachma.
Pressure on the Greek currency eased when the interbank lending rate jumped
to over 100 per cent following capital movement liberalisation. Clearly,
such high interest rates cannot be sustained for long: most Greek dealers
set the end of May as the limit.
'The moment that interest rates start to decline, the pressure will build
again,' a dealer said. 'It's hard to believe that devaluation can be staved
off.'
The optimists are betting on a faster depreciation of the drachma over the
next few weeks as a way out. This would upset the central bank's 'hard
drachma' policy, intended to restrict depreciation this year to about 7 per
cent, but would not necessarily - according to some analysts - have a big
impact on the inflation rate
The Bank of Greece is already at a disadvantage in not being able to call on
other EU central banks to help support the drachma, as Greece has never been
a member of the union's exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
Devaluation is to be avoided at all costs, the government claims, because
the effects on inflation, now hovering around the 10 per cent mark after a
slow but steady decline, would outweigh the advantages to Greek exporters.
With exports covering only one-third of the import bill, the argument
carries considerable weight.
And a devaluation would be bad for Greece's growing trade with its Balkan
neighbours, where large amounts of drachma are hoarded as a convertible
currency and a hedge for the unpredictable Albanian lek, Bulgarian lev and
Romanian lei. 'There is an active but informal drachma zone in the Balkans
and confidence would be shaken by a devaluation, especially since a lot of
trade is conducted on a cash basis because of weaknesses in the local
banking systems,' one economist said.
Greece's own foreign exchange reserves were at record levels until the
central bank spent about Dollars 1bn to support the drachma in the week
before capital controls were lifted.
High interest rates on Ecu- and dollar-linked bonds, which attract
institutional investors from abroad, together with large transfers of EU
funds helped to boost Greece's reserves to over Dollars 10bn at the end of
1993 - enough to cover almost two-thirds of yearly imports.
Two new Ecu- and dollar-linked issues were launched immediately after
capital liberalisation was announced, as part of the government's strategy
to prevent an outflow of capital. At the same time, the complex
administrative procedures for handling short-term capital movements are
likely to discourage many small and medium Greek investors from transferring
funds abroad.
Among other things, details of an investor's tax status are required for
transfers above Ecu2,000. This measure will help to deter Greeks from moving
funds abroad that derive from the black economy. At present, a high
percentage of such income is invested in tax-free government bonds.
The government's next task, as it tries to preserve currency stability, will
be to reduce the deficits that make Greece's overall financial position so
precarious.
As a result of the drachma crisis, the finance ministry had to cancel its
mid-month issue of treasury bills, the main instrument used to finance the
public sector deficit. When the next issue takes place at the end of May,
economists predict a sharp rise in interest rates.
Expanding the privatisation programme is one way of increasing revenues,
according to government officials. In addition to the planned flotation of
the state telecoms company on the Athens stock exchange, discussions are
under way on a listing later this year for two profitable state-controlled
oil refineries.
The finance ministry is preparing additional measures aimed at curbing tax
evasion, with a view to raising an extra Dr200bn this year.
'The constraints imposed by Greece's new exposure to the realities of
international financial markets realities should encourage the government to
follow more responsible economic policies,' a banker said.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (3): Climate of mistrust
slowly begins to dissipate - The government is rethinking its ideological
opposition to privatisation in the light of a gaping budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently, investment bankers were viewed with suspicion by officials
in Greece's socialist government, who claimed that their conservative
predecessors paid out excessive amounts in advisory fees with little in the
way of results.
The ambitious privatisation programme undertaken by the conservatives
brought many international investment bankers to Athens for the first time.
While a number of mandates were awarded, union opposition and government
in-fighting meant that only a few transactions were completed. Even the
much-vaunted privatisation of OTE, the state telecoms company, fell through
when the government changed.
Faced with a gaping budget deficit and a desperate shortage of funds for
upgrading public utilities, the socialists have been forced to reverse their
ideological opposition to privatisation. However, they have chosen a more
diluted form: partial flotations of a handful of state-owned enterprises on
the Athens stock exchange.
Where the investment banks are concerned, the climate of mistrust is
dissipating slowly as the government examines ways of maximising revenue
from the proposed flotations, scheduled to start this autumn. 'It is
accepted that commissions are going to be slimmer this time and that some
imaginative solutions over share distribution will have to be worked out in
order to bring the unions on board,' says a government adviser.
A dozen investment banks are vying for the lead manager's role in the
flotation of 25-30 per cent of the telecoms company, of which at least half
will take the form of an international tranche to be sold in Europe, the US
and Japan.
Credit Suisse First Boston and J. Henry Schroder Wagg, which have been
appointed global co-ordinators and joint lead managers for the issue's
international tranche by the conservatives, are hoping that willingness to
reduce their commission will overcome lingering political doubts over their
association with the previous government.
Their re-appointment would certainly speed up the flotation from which the
government hopes to raise at least Dr300bn. If successful, it should be
followed by listings of the Public Power Corporation and two state oil
refineries.
Financial advisers from abroad are also in demand for public works projects
as the government assesses bids for projects with a sizeable percentage of
EU funding. Several projects, such as a toll highway through northern
Athens, the new Athens airport to be built at Spata, and a suspension bridge
across the Corinth Gulf, include a self-financing component together with EU
assistance, with little or no contribution from the government's investment
budget.
Arrival of the international investment banks also coincided with the
emergence of corporate finance specialists at Greek banks, who sharpened
their skills while advising on mergers and acquisitions of Greek companies
by European competitors in the run-up to the single market.
This local expertise was tapped by the previous government - both in making
initial valuations of companies scheduled for disposal and in finding buyers
for smaller enterprises.
The OTE (Greek telecom company) listing also offers a large slice of
business for local banks. Like the international bankers, Credit Bank
(Greece's largest private bank) is hoping to be reappointed lead manager of
the domestic tranche of the OTE listing. There will be at least half a dozen
other Greek banks involved in underwriting what will be by far the largest
issue ever made in Greece.
'While we are unlikely to handle a really big deal on our own, our advantage
is that we know the local market, we offer a diversity of skills and we can
accept smaller deals that no international investment bank would be
interested in,' says Mr Panagis Vourloumis, managing director of Alpha
Finance, the investment arm of Credit Bank.
Alpha Finance combines underwriting, corporate advisory and fund management
services under one roof. It is also setting up a bank in Romania, which will
combine commercial and investment banking, with the aim of offering
corporate advisory services to Greek companies active there and in playing a
role in Romania's privatisation programme.
For the moment, however, Alpha Finance, like other local investment bankers,
is focusing on bringing Greek companies to the Athens Stock Exchange.
'Equity business picked up sharply just as privatisation was falling off and
there is now a line of listings stretching to the end of the year,' Mr
Vourloumis says.
The growth of fee-based business in Greece has encouraged Barclays de Zoete
Wedd to set up an Athens-based operation based in the same building as
Barclay's Athens headquarters. BZW Hellas is also handling flotations,
especially those that can also be marketed to institutional investors
abroad.
'There is an increasing amount of financial intermediation going on in
Greece, so it makes sense to have a local presence. We have also been able
to capitalise on existing client relationships,' says Mr Christos Megalou of
BZW Hellas.
The range of business is likely to grow as Greek companies get used to the
idea of calling in an investment banker. Treasury management services and
financial restructuring are two areas where demand is expected to increase.
A new round of acquisitions is also expected as consolidation affects more
sectors, with large Athens-based companies, for example, taking over smaller
rivals in northern Greece. BZW acted as financial adviser last year in the
biggest local acquisition for some time: Veropoulos Supermarkets' Dr4bn
takeover of three rival supermarket chains.
Although there is unlikely to be room for more than two or three
full-fledged investment banks in Athens, several boutique operations have
managed to carve out niches in the market.
'There is a cultural change under way. Companies are looking to corporate
finance specialists to provide the kind of solutions that their local bank
is not equipped for,' says Mr Victor Pisante, of Telesis Capital, a small
investment banking operation which has the support of a brokerage
subsidiary.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of World Taxation (1): Long arms of the revenue
collectors - National borders are losing their effectiveness as barriers
between tax payers and collecting agencies. Andrew Jack explains the reasons
for the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Tax has never been such an international issue, and never have the domestic
financial affairs of individuals and companies been so affected by
developments in other countries.
The expansion of corporations, the spread of complex new transactions and
the aggressive role of governments and their tax authorities have all been
more evident than ever.
The emergence of a series of regional political and economic blocs - notably
the North American Free Trade Area, the European Union and the European
Economic Area - has influenced the process.
Nowhere has the internationalisation of tax been played out more powerfully
than within the EU. The formal creation of the single European market
brought with it from the start of 1993 a harmonisation of the system of
indirect taxation.
There have been many complaints about the administration of the new system,
and many suggestions about how to handle 'triangular trade' between
companies with operations in a number of different member states.
Yet to a large extent, the teething difficulties have been overcome. Border
controls have been relaxed, new administrative procedures have been put in
place, and there are even some signs of the market beginning to drive down
differentials in value added tax (VAT) rates across borders.
A more important issue for the EU now is whether it will be able to switch
from the current partially 'destination-based' system of VAT to its original
stated objective: a regime in which all goods and services sold across
borders are subject to tax in their country of origin.
There is also the vexed question of greater harmonisation of direct taxes
across Europe. The Ruding Commission, set up to examine the issue, has
apparently been left to gather dust at a time of such political turmoil and
the growing emphasis on subsidiarity.
However, the EU has not entirely given up, with relevant directives being
issued on mergers and reconstructions, withholding tax between parent and
subsidiary companies and transfer pricing arbitration, for example.
Elsewhere around the world, US President Clinton's threat early in his term
in 1992 to clamp down more firmly on foreign corporations suspected of
paying insufficient tax has proved largely hollow.
That is not to say there is any complacency. The US Internal Revenue Service
has long set an example followed by many of its counterparts elsewhere, with
a growing hostility towards perceived evasion and avoidance.
In the UK, this has been reflected in a mammoth finance act - easily the
longest ever at 463 pages in small print - much of which is concerned with
an ever increasing number of general anti-avoidance provisions as well as
specific measures to close loopholes abused in the past.
There have been recent tensions between the US and Japan in particular, with
tax as a battleground in the larger trade war between the two countries. It
has not gone unnoticed that the Japanese government's proposed Dollars 145m
tax adjustment for Coca Cola is almost identical to the refund of Japanese
tax agreed late last year with Nissan.
Equally, eyes remain fixed on the US Supreme Court, and its imminent
judgment on the highly politicised dispute between Barclays bank and the
state of California, which is attempting to levy taxes on a unitary basis on
the company's worldwide profits.
It looks as though the case may turn against Barclays, though the
indications are that this would be unlikely to spark any retaliation by the
UK or other jurisdictions, given that California has since provided
alternatives to unitary tax.
This highlights one of the most important developing issues in international
tax: transfer pricing. While countries in the past were content to leave
charges between related corporate parties across borders at arm's length,
they are now interfering more aggressively to tackle perceived avoidance.
'Among my corporate clients there is a desire not to avoid tax by transfer
pricing but just to get it right,' says Mr Roger White from KPMG Peat
Marwick in London.
One potential solution receiving favourable attention at present may be the
development of advance pricing agreements, such as the long-standing
arrangement in place for Apple Computers between the US and Australia.
Outside the large trade blocs, and eager to exploit loopholes in tax and
company formation legislation, have been the offshore centres - the tax
havens or, as they prefer to be known, the areas of low tax.
The number of centres seeking to attract business and prop up local
economies continues to grow, but the competition between them is
intensifying just at a time when recession in many parts of the world has
reduced the amount of potential business available.
More important, tax authorities are taking a more hostile line towards
regimes that may permit evasion.
On the one hand, double tax treaties with some of the newer developing
states in south America and the former Communist regimes are growing apace.
On the other, after decades in which a network of international tax treaties
between countries has been developed, many existing documents now face the
prospect of being ripped to shreds.
Most significant is the US-Dutch tax treaty, which threatens the structure
of many companies who have traditionally used the Netherlands to take
advantage of differential tax rates.
US officials have already indicated that harsh revisions of other treaties -
such as those with Denmark, Luxembourg and Switzerland - are now in their
sights.
This is one factor driving what Mr Peter Cussons of Price Waterhouse sees as
a new emphasis by companies considering the tax implications of where they
locate - such as the recently announced restructuring of Ford into global
centres.
'We have been talking to a lot of clients in the last 12 to 18 months about
organising on a European regional basis,' he says. 'The historical
structures are out of date.' He sees a move towards a single holding company
able to offset reliefs against profits across its operations.
Globally, there has been a clear trend since the 1980s towards lower
headline rates of tax. That certainly does not mean that the tax take has
actually reduced, but rather that governments have been able to tweak the
fine print.
They have achieved change largely through a shift from direct to indirect
taxation. In addition, allowances, deductions and reliefs in many countries
have been eroded and definitions of profit changed.
Attention is also spreading to new targets for tax. In the UK, in spite of
memories of the poll tax which contributed to the defeat of Mrs Thatcher by
her own party, the government seems to have weathered the controversy over
the extension of VAT to domestic fuel.
In the US, the Clinton administration has singled out tax on tobacco as a
way to fund its planned reforms of the health care system. The EU has
suggested a controversial carbon/energy tax levied on oil, and its
Environment Commissioner has argued for a gradual shift to taxes on
pollution and resources.
Meanwhile, Mr White also highlights the shift in the world towards
self-assessment systems in which the responsibility and costs of tax
collection are increasingly shifted on to individual taxpayers. This is
allowing fiscal authorities to reduce their staff and focus far more on
'auditing' tax returns submitted to them.
Mr John Fairley, partner in charge of the international tax group at Ernst &amp;
Young, says cooperation on investigations between many revenue authorities
has also been growing. 'There has been a significant increase in the
exchange of information since the 1970s.'
As examples he cites the Group of Four - the UK, France, Germany and the US
 -with its own code of practice, and the Pacific Association of Tax
Administrators - comprising Canada, the US, Japan and Australia.
The authorities are providing each other with data on taxpayers and also
launching simultaneous examinations of their tax affairs. His concern is
that this often takes place without the knowledge of the taxpayer, as well
as involving the possible transfer of sensitive information such as trade
secrets.
The restructuring of fiscal authorities is also creating new challenges and
opportunities for the growing number and variety of tax professionals -
including lawyers, accountants and new retail providers of financial
services. Such a shift may well affect how they operate, and how much longer
they escape the currently relatively loose net of regulation that surrounds
them.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (1): A sudden change in
the landscape - The outlook for the banking sector is positive, but hard
economic decisions face the Greek government if it is to close the gap with
the rest of the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's unexpected decision this week to liberalise short-term
capital movement ahead of the EU deadline of July 1, with the aim of
averting a devaluation of the drachma, has suddenly changed Greece's
financial landscape.
Even if the government succeeds in maintaining confidence in the drachma by
keeping interest rates at spectacularly high levels for the next few weeks,
some hard economic decisions will now have to be speeded up.
Instead of converging, Greece is drifting further away from the rest of the
member states in the EU. Recovery is barely visible, with growth in gross
domestic product projected at about 1 per cent this year, against 0.2 per
cent in 1993.
The European Commission has expressed concern over the government's failure
to curb a rising public sector deficit, financed mostly through short-term
Treasury bills, which is fuelling a public debt already equivalent to 138
per cent of GDP.
Yet, there are positive signs too. The black economy - estimated at nearly
40 per cent of GDP - pumps liquidity into capital markets, as a substantial
proportion of untaxed earnings is invested in Treasury bills, mutual funds
and shares on the Athens stock exchange.
And, while the socialist government's latest attempts to address tax evasion
include a 15 per cent tax on both mutual fund dividends and 'repos' -
fixed-term repurchase agreements - there are no plans to introduce a capital
gains tax or to investigate the source of funds entering capital markets.
Moreover, larger Greek companies commanding a comfortable market share are
weathering the recession successfully, some by expanding into neighbouring
Balkan countries where the possibilities of rapid growth in turnover are
seen as outweighing political and economic risks.
Against the odds, too, Greece's banking and financial services industry has
decoupled itself both from gloomy developments in other sectors of the
country's economy and from the uncertainty arising from political tension in
the Balkans as a result of the violent upheavals in the former Yugoslavia.
The 25 domestic banks increased their profits last year by an average 15 per
cent, despite the impact of recession on the smaller businesses which
dominate Greek manufacturing and services, and the negative effect on
balance sheets of the imposition of stricter rules for interest accrual on
non-performing loans.
The foreign banks which compete mainly for corporate and shipping business
are not required to disclose results. But as one foreign banker recently put
it: 'The market may be growing tighter but there are more ways of making
money than there used to be.'
The outlook this year is still positive, although banks will have to
increase provisions because of declining loan quality - the result of a
projected fall in corporate profits and problems business customers are
facing with payments.
Last year's drop in private sector lending by the Greek domestic banks, from
5.9 to 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product, is attributed as much to
increased borrowing abroad by companies keen to take advantage of lower
interest rates as to the recession. Both state-controlled and private banks
are planning to follow some of their corporate clients into Bulgaria,
Romania and Albania, notwithstanding the difficulties according to one
banker of 'setting up in a regulatory vacuum.' So far only Xiosbank, a
private bank, has started operating, (with a branch in Sofia), but other
banks expect to launch Balkan ventures this year.
Another encouraging sign is the improved profitability of seven private
banks established since 1990. Controlled for the most part by Greek
shipowners and insurance companies - and in one case by a Cyprus-based bank
 -the new banks have set the pace in consumer lending, most recently in
devising products to take advantage of a higher loan ceiling of Dr8m.
Although the new banks' combined market share amounts to less than 4 per
cent, they have fewer overheads and more flexibility. They are not
constrained by having a sizeable percentage of deposits tied up in
government bonds, the remnants of the old system of compulsory reserve
requirements.
Their presence also encourages the two big private banks, Credit Bank and
Ergobank, to mount a more aggressive challenge to the four big state banking
groups that control 70 per cent of the market. Following last month's Dr31bn
capital increase, Credit Bank now ranks ahead of National Bank, the
state-controlled giant, in market capitalisation. Its energetic subsidiaries
in fund management, investment banking, leasing and brokerage activities
underline Credit Bank's aspirations to become a European-sized financial
services group.
The state-controlled banks are trying to catch up on automation, as the best
way of retaining market share. Automated teller machines, formerly the
preserve of private and foreign banks, now brighten up the dull facades of
the state banks.
Upgrading dealing rooms and establishing financial subsidiaries, as well as
increasing income, have the additional advantage of providing more jobs
under the pervasive patronage system.
The state banks have become fiefdoms of the governing Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, following a clean sweep of bank governors after last year's
general election.
Its conservative predecessor tried to loosen the state's grip on the banking
system, by persuading Greek bankers working abroad to return to run state
banks, then by abolishing the finance minister's right to a proxy vote for
important shareholders such as state insurance companies and pension funds.
If, in theory, the shareholders now can choose a board headed by a truly
professional banker, there are few signs that the new freedom will be
exercised. Nor are the pension funds yet exploiting the opportunities for
active management of their portfolios - also introduced by the previous
government.
It was left to institutional investors from abroad to increase turnover on
the Athens stock exchange last year. The market shrugged off political
instability in the Balkans, worsening economic indicators and fears that the
socialists would abandon privatisation to become one of the world's more
stable emerging markets. It is likely to acquire depth, with more than 50
flotations and rights issues expected this year, raising the number of
actively traded stocks by about one-third. For growth-minded Greek
companies, a listing on the bourse is becoming an attractive alternative to
bank borrowing.
Privatisation is back on the agenda despite the socialists' initial pledge
to cancel the programme of disposals. However, privatisation no longer
includes sales of banking subsidiaries. Plans to unload four small
state-owned banks through transfers of share packages on the bourse,
following the example of the South Korean Hanwha group's purchase of Bank of
Athens last year, have been dropped.
Even if the socialists oppose dismantling the big state banks, they have
nevertheless embraced the idea of creating a broad share-owning public,
through partial flotations of public enterprises. The first test will be the
flotation of 30 per cent of OTE, the state telecommunications company.
Scheduled for this autumn, it is projected to raise more than Dr300bn.
Even with an international tranche amounting to 15 per cent of the company,
the sheer size of the offering will place tremendous strain on the market's
capacity to absorb an issue five times larger than any to date, not to
mention the underwriting banks' ability to market and distribute shares.
But if the OTE flotation comes off, Greece's financial sector can no longer
be called immature.

FT  20 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise move by Mr Conrad Black, owner of the Telegraph group, to
reduce his holding in the publishing company prompted speculation over
whether the 12.5m shares had all been successfully placed.
According to a spokeswoman at the Telegraph, the shares were sold to
Cazenove and Goldman Sachs, and by the close of business yesterday the Seaq
screen was showing only 10m traded both ways. There was strong speculation
from rival marketmakers that the two brokers were still sitting on stock.
Neither Goldman nor Cazenove would comment.
The shares were sold by Mr Black's Hollinger company at 587p apiece,
reducing his holding in the Telegraph from 66.2 per cent to 56.95 per cent.
The stock retreated 20 to 600p.
Wellcome shares came in for some rough handling by the market, sliding 13 to
561p, having reacted to a story circulating late in the session that the
company may be encountering strong opposition to the 'over-the-counter' sale
of the new highly successful version of its anti-herpes drug Zovirax.
A hearing of the US Food and Drug Administration was said to be under way
yesterday and that much of the evidence being heard had come from opponents
of the drug.
Specialists said the drug's proponents had yet to speak and that the outcome
was still expected to come down in favour of Wellcome.
First-quarter results and another report from the gas industry watchdog
Ofgas combined to produce a good showing by British Gas shares yesterday.
Dealers said the main upside in Gas shares came following the Ofgas
consultation document on competition in the non-domestic gas market. One
analyst described the Ofgas report as 'possibly another little victory for
Gas in its campaign for an easing of the regulatory stranglehold it finds
itself in'. At the close Gas shares were 4 1/2 higher at 284p after rather
disappointing turnover of 7.5m
BT, on the other hand, slipped 2 1/2 to 376 1/2 p, with the partly-paid 2
off at 258 1/2 p, after the company delivered preliminary profits in line
with expectations but slightly disappointing the market with a 7 per cent
increase in the dividend total. Turnover in BT ordinary was 9.4m but
significantly higher at 13m in the partly-paid stock.
The strong performance of Burmah Castrol, up 7 more at 881p, was said to
have reflected further keen support for the stock ahead of a presentation to
analysts next week, but also amid vague stories that the company could be a
break-up prospect to a predator.
Shares in Burton, the store group, firmed on a positive analysts meeting
after the retailer had unveiled a slight decline in underlying first-half
profits. While Debenhams turned in another strong performance, results from
Principles and Top Shop remained poor. However, stores specialists described
the mood of the meeting as 'honest and pragmatic', although few were
committing themselves to outright buy recommendations. Reflecting the
hesitant mood, forecasts were being both trimmed and edged forward. The
shares gained 2 1/2 at 56 1/2 p on turnover of 13m.
As expected, WH Smith announced the restructuring of its shares, with the
'A' stock adding 2 at 512p.
Results from Fine Art Developments sent the shares rising 11 to 505p. A
positive Mr John Chataway at London Wall estimated that the group's 15 per
cent stake in the Grattan mail order business, which has just returned to
profit, was now worth Pounds 44m, and that this factored in to his 1994-95
earnings estimate put the stock on an undemanding 12 multiple, or a 25 per
cent discount to the sector.
A predictable agm statement from Guinness helped the shares recover from
their worst, closing 5 1/2 down at 488p.
Restructuring at HP Bulmer, the cider maker, helped the stock rise 8 to
397p.
A James Capel buy note was said to be behind a bounce of 18 to 1120p by
Thorn EMI.
GKN was lifted by an upbeat statement at the company's annual meeting. The
shares jumped 15 to 596p. Kleinwort Benson was also reported to have become
more positive on the stock and upgraded current year profits estimates by
Pounds 22m to Pounds 170m.
A Smith New Court recommendation helped TI Group firm 6 to 374p. However,
engineering group IMI was friendless after BZW was said to be negative on
the stock. The shares relinquished 2 to 343p.
British Aerospace bounced 9 to 484p after news that BAe Sema, jointly owned
by BAe and Sema Group, had won a contract from the South Korean navy.
Defence electronics group GEC closed 1 1/2 ahead at 313p after a positive
conference on the defence sector at Robert Fleming Securities. Volume was 2m
at the close.
Tough trading conditions at Iceland were revealed at the company's agm and
the shares slid 6 to 146p.
A surprise Pounds 40m rights issue from NSM, the coal mining group, saw the
stock plunge 43, or 20 per cent, to 174p.
Shares in Jackson, the Ipswich-based construction group, leaped 11 to 66p
after a return to profits and a 20 per cent dividend increase.

FT  20 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Willis Corroon retreats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market's response to acutely disappointing first- quarter figures from
Willis Corroon, the second largest UK insurance broker, was instantaneous as
marketmakers chopped their opening quotations in an attempt to head off any
large-scale selling pressure by institutions.
However, the markdown in the share price failed to stem the selling
pressure, which built up again following what was described by analysts as a
sombre post-figures meeting.
Willis's profits came in at Pounds 42.4m, against estimates which ranged up
to Pounds 59m. Willis shares were eventually down 47 1/2 p, or 20 per cent,
to 191 1/2 p after turnover of 17m, the heaviest recorded in the stock since
the merger with Corroon &amp; Black in October 1990.
Most analysts reduced their current year forecasts, previously around the
Pounds 95m to Pounds 100m mark, to Pounds 70m. Mr Andrew Pitt, insurance
broking specialist at BZW, and a long term bear of the stock, predicted
further downside risk in the stock and said that 'a fair price for the
shares is 180p'.

FT  20 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retail sales figures help an
uncertain market - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further signs of recovery in the domestic economy and favourable comments on
the near-term outlook for base rates helped UK stocks regain some ground
yesterday. Shares closed well below the day's best levels, however, and
trading volume was unexciting.
The mood turned less positive in the afternoon when Wall Street and the US
Federal bond market made an uncertain start to the new session, although the
Dow Average soon turned higher to show a gain of 14 points as London went
home for the day. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,122.8
for a net gain of 6.3 points.
In early trading, the Footsie had moved up to 3,131.1, helped by news that
domestic retail sales had risen by 0.4 per cent in April to show record
levels for the three-month period. UK government bonds flinched only
momentarily on this news and resumed their upward move as the Bank of France
confirmed expectations of a cut in its intervention rate.
Some nervousness over the US dollar, which has so far failed to respond to
the increase in key rates by the Federal Reserve, marred the second half of
the trading session, although hints of a renewed support operation for the
US currency found no support on the bond trading desks.
Also unsettling were reported views of the president of the Bundesbank that
the interest rate horizon was now clear - translated by market analysts as a
hint that no more cuts in German rates are planned at present.
However, the markets took a favourable view of comments from the panel of
independent forecasters to the British Treasury which said it saw no need
for a rate rise in the UK at present. Gilts closed very firmly and equities
noted that two panel members had wanted a further cut in rates.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index edged higher by 1.8 to a close of 3,713.5. Seaq
volume was a healthy 621.9m shares, boosted by activity related to trading
statements from a handful of leading British companies. On Wednesday, 722.4m
shares through the Seaq network were worth Pounds 1.66bn at retail level.
The further recovery in gilt-edged stocks, in spite of underlying worries
about the outlook for domestic interest rates, was regarded by market
strategists as favourable for any advance by the equity market.
'The latest Fed move may well usher in a period of stability on short-term
US rates which should provide a more stable platform for global bonds and
equity markets,' commented the global strategy team at NatWest Markets.
At Nikko, strategists looked for the securities markets to take a 'more
considered view' of the Fed's move over the next few days, noting that
currency markets have failed so far to shake off the recent negative stance.
There were signs of significant underlying activity as the institutions
picked up stock in sectors which have suffered over the past fortnight.
Motor industry shares recovered ground, and the investment focus turned back
in favour of the manufacturing sectors.
Support for the consumer-orientated stocks was more selective and centred on
recent trading statements from leading names. Financial sectors were left to
drift as investors sought out opportunities elsewhere, although there was
some interest in property shares, which were again seen as offering
significant recovery potential.

FT  20 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives traders reported a more positive tone to trading following the
release of improved retail sales figures, though the futures contract later
fell back with the publication of US economic data, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,120,
in line with the cash market. It advanced with the release of the UK retail
sales figures to a peak of 3,139, pulling the underlying cash market higher.
However, the premium to cash was only a few points for most of the session,
leaving traders few opportunities for arbitrage trading. The day's range was
a mere 13 points.
The larger institutions were said to have been selective in their activity
in the market yesterday, leaving one dealer to comment: 'Institutions are
only going for value at this stage.'
US data, which revealed a higher than expected March trade deficit,
unsettled June in the afternoon, leaving it to drift lower. It closed at
3,125, up 15 from its previous close and at a 2-point premium to cash.
Volume, at 10,436 lots, was poor.
Turnover in the traded options slipped back to 32,877 contracts. In the
index options, 12,034 were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,720 in the
Euro FT-SE.
Hanson was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,019 contracts dealt.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil soars 12 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed optimism over former economy minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
presidential candidacy spurred stock prices 12.1 per cent higher in heavy
trading on the Sao Paulo bourse.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares closed 2,176 up at 20,085.
Turnover was high at Cr430.1bn (Dollars 262.2m).
Analysts said the congressional approval late on Wednesday of a key
presidential decree creating Brazil's single price index (URV) and the
possibility of new support from former president Jose Sarney were seen as
helping Mr Cardoso's candidacy.
Mr Sarney still had not decided what to do after a Supreme Court decision on
Wednesday virtually blocked him from running for the presidency. But
analysts said there was a great chance he would support Mr Cardoso.
Brazilian stocks dropped sharply over recent weeks after opinion polls
showed leftist candidade Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had extended his lead to
41 per cent, against 17 per cent for Mr Cardoso.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Firmer bonds sector helps to
lift Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A wave of program-guided buying lifted US stocks near midday yesterday, and
a firmer bond market supported share prices through the rest of the
afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 26.09 higher at 3,758.98 and the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.79 ahead at 456.48 in moderately
heavy New York SE volume of 303m shares. In the secondary markets, the
American SE composite was 2.14 better at 437.04 and the Nasdaq composite
added 5.41 at 727.31.
Early on, the temptation to book profits on the Dow's net gain of 61 points
over the previous two sessions proved too great for some investors. In the
morning, the bellwether index softened in listless activity in parallel to a
weaker tone in the US Treasury market.
The day's economic news was mostly favourable for equities. The Commerce
Department said the US trade deficit had narrowed by 15.6 per cent from
February to March. Record levels of both exports and imports indicated that
the economy was expanding at a healthy pace, economists said.
This interpretation was supported by news of a small decline in claims for
unemployment benefit last week. Further evidence of a robust economy came
from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's monthly survey of business
conditions, which showed a moderate acceleration of activity after five
months of decline.
Best of all for stocks, the bond market held up relatively well amid the
data barrage. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government security had
reversed course and pushed into positive ground, mostly because of a firming
trend in the dollar. The currency rallied from overnight weakness on
optimistic remarks by US officials on trade relations with Japan.
With other financial markets lending support, the blue chips were free to
resume their advance. Most of the Dow components posted moderate gains on
the day. Walt Disney was ahead Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 44 1/4 .
Semiconductor stocks were in demand after a report that some analysts were
predicting a period of sustained growth by the computer industry. Micron
Technology climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 33 7/8 and National
Semiconductor gained Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 19 7/8 .
The car makers were stronger, with General Motors appreciating Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 55 1/4 and Ford Motor Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 59 1/4 . Chrysler
put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 47 1/8 after announcing a dividend increase.
Woolworth, up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 16 3/8 , turned in a good
performance. The stock improved after an internal investigation of
accounting irregularities found that no senior executive had sought personal
gain.
The report was released after the close of trading on Wednesday, when the
stock fell sharply on news of disappointing quarterly earnings by the
retailer.
In telecommunications, AT&amp;T advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 3/4 after
Bell Atlantic selected the company to supply equipment for a new multimedia
network. General Instrument, which also won a contract, jumped Dollars 4 1/4
to Dollars 59 1/8 , while DSC Communications, which was passed over, plunged
Dollars 8 3/8 to Dollars 49 on the Nasdaq.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa golds rebound
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares bounced higher in Johannesburg in line with stronger bullion
prices after three days of steady decline, but industrials remained
sluggish. Renewed foreign demand was seen, however, after the recent
selling. The overall index rose 52 to 5,440, industrials dipped 13 to 6,558
and golds rebounded 113 to 1,886.
Tobacco-related stocks displayed weakness following news that ANC health
officials were proposing a 100 per cent rise in cigarette prices, but
analysts noted that the government had yet to consider proposals.
Tobacco-based Remgro shed R1.75 to R30 in heavy trading. Remb Beheer dropped
R6 to R17.
De Beers was 25 cents lower at R107.50 after recent losses on the Nasdaq,
but Anglos rose R2 to R230. Gencor added 60 cents at R10.20, Richemont put
on 35 cents at R41 and SAB collected R1 at R99 after recent declines.
Samancor rose R7.50 to R52.50.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Strengthening yen puts
check on Nikkei's advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in the yen discouraged investors and heavy selling initially
depressed share prices, before arbitrage buying brought a recovery and left
the Nikkei 225 average moderately ahead on the day, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The index gained 68.61 at 20,221.34 after a low of 20,034.21 and high of
20,302.46. The yen's advance to the Y103 level dampened investor confidence
as many market participants had hoped for a retreat in the Japanese currency
against the dollar after the increase in US interest rates.
Selling by Nomura Securities depressed sentiment during the morning session,
but a later rise in the futures market prompted index-linked arbitrage
buying and small-lot bargain hunting.
Volume amounted to 260m shares, against Wednesday's 290m. In spite of the
fall in activity, some traders were optimistic due to buying support around
the 20,000 level.
The Topix index of all first section stocks was 0.29 easier at 1,634.40,
while the Nikkei 300 closed 0.10 off at 298.78. Declines led rises by 522 to
430, with 217 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
2.39 to 1,334.47.
Index-linked buying helped banks, which are heavily weighted in the Topix
index. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank rose Y40 to Y1,990 and Bank of Tokyo Y30 to
Y1,670.
Brokers were also higher, with Nomura Securities up Y20 to Y2,290 and Daiwa
Securities gaining Y30 at Y1,690. The top four brokers reported the first
rebound in earnings since 1989-90 thanks to a rise in brokerage and
underwriting commissions.
Some analysts pointed out that the brokers' own profits forecasts for the
current year to next March seemed too conservative since active cost-cutting
would help profits. 'The companies are still a long way from being truly
healthy, but they are moving in the right direction,' said Mr Mark Faulkner,
banking analyst at SG Warburg.
The rise in the yen upset high-technology stocks. Hitachi, the most active
issue of the day, fell Y18 to Y992 and Sony declined Y100 to Y5,840.
The government's announcement to freeze increases in public service charges
until next year depressed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which had been
applying for a rate increase for local calls. The stock dropped Y24,000 to
Y855,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 47.57 to 22,371.42 in volume of 10.9m shares.
Roundup
Profit-taking eroded recent gains in some of the Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG encountered profit-taking after Wednesday's strong advance, the
Hang Seng index ending 121.66, or 1.3 per cent, down at 9,354.98. The
underlying mood remained buoyant, however, in response to the revival of
Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's new airport.
Turnover was a strong HKDollars 4.99bn, but down from Wednesday's revised
HKDollars 6.93bn.
HK Telecom, which reported slightly better than expected 1993-94 results,
picked up from a day's low of HKDollars 14.80 to end 20 cents down at
HKDollars 14.90.
Property issues were among the big losers. Cheung Kong fell HKDollars 1.25
to HKDollars 38.50 and Henderson Land slid HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 42
but SHK Properties was steady at HKDollars 53.
KUALA LUMPUR was mostly lower, with buying mainly focused on cash-rich
Malayan United Industries (MUI), which announced the acquisition of
additional shares in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post. The composite
index shed 7.29 to 1,002.98.
MUI, which surged 32 cents to MDollars 4.02 in volume of 2.7m shares, has
been aggressively seeking acquisitions since selling its MUI Bank and MUI
Finance in January for MDollars 1.1bn. It bought another 5 per cent of SCMP
to raise its stake in the newspaper concern to 20.6 per cent.
TAIPEI's consolidation went on, with much of the selling aimed at
industrials. The weighted index retreated 38.64 to 5,944.61 in turnover that
fell to TDollars 58.31bn from Wednesday's TDollars 62.8bn.
Late profit-taking was heavy in paper and plastic stocks, which posted
moderate gains during previous advances.
MANILA suffered for the second consecutive day because of anxieties over the
extent of the damage caused by investigations into Bancapital Development
Corporation, an unlicensed investment house that appeared to have closed
leaving a trail of undelivered Treasury bills.
The Composite index declined 43.78, or 1.5 per cent, to 2,855.57 in volume
that fell to 739.97m shares, from 1.88bn on Wednesday.
SYDNEY lost ground as profit-taking and a sharp overnight fall in commodity
prices overshadowed the positive interim results announced by National
Australia Bank.
The All Ordinaries index closed 14.1 down at 2,093.7, but off a low of
2,084.6, in volume of 214.1m shares.
NAB, which posted interim net profits of ADollars 868.8m, up from ADollars
507.3m, finished 2 cents higher at ADollars 12.16 after an early low of
ADollars 12.00.
Westpac, which returned to a ADollars 320.9m net interim profit, against a
loss of ADollars 204.6m, slipped 15 cents to ADollars 4.84.
WELLINGTON gave back most of the gains made on Wednesday, the NZSE-40
capital index falling 30.25 to 2,124.85.
BANGKOK saw foreign demand push the SET index 25.64, or 1.9 per cent, ahead
to 1,351.11 in heavy turnover of Bt8bn.
The property development sector jumped 3.9 per cent, led by Natural Park,
which rose Bt14 to Bt155, and Sammakorn, up Bt13 at Bt149.
SINGAPORE edged higher, with much of the day's attention focused on Neptune
Orient Lines, the shipping group, amid rumours of a bonus issue, the
positive impact of a road show ahead of the listing of its US subsidiary,
and talks of freight rate increases.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 6.44 to 2,329.60 in volume of
135.99m shares, while NOL closed 19 cents higher at SDollars 2.62 in
turnover of 13.24m shares.
SEOUL saw renewed institutional buying for large-capitalisation
manufacturing issues which sent the composite index 4.86 higher to 951.73.
However, swift profit-taking limited gains in primary blue chips. Posco, the
steelmaker, was unchanged at Won67,300, off a day's high of Won68,800.
JAKARTA moved higher for the fourth straight day, in spite of local
profit-taking towards the close in response to rises in key domestic
discount rates which may herald higher deposit returns. Strong foreign
demand left the Jardine index 1.18 up at 101.67.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt is disappointed by
Deutsche Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Continent's markets remained impassive, with profit-taking in evidence.
NatWest Markets argued yesterday that while, in the short term, a final
bounce could be expected in European markets, the longer term picture was
less rosy.
'As the interest rate reduction process is in its final stages we would urge
longer term caution. With expectations regarding earnings rebounds offering
little scope for positive surprises, the European markets are already on
high multiples, and this will limit their performance on a 12-month view.'
FRANKFURT finished weaker on a combination of futures activity - options
expiry takes place today - and a further decline in shares of Deutsche Bank.
The Dax index ended off 19.65 at 2,247.76 and eased a little further in the
post-bourse to close at 2,246.58. Turnover was DM7.5bn.
Deutsche Bank disappointed the market after reporting that four-month group
operating profits were down some 10 per cent from the year-ago level. The
shares slipped DM9 to DM776 in the official session, and after going
ex-dividend finished after-hours' trading at DM757.10.
Elsewhere in the sector, Dresdner Bank lost DM3.50 to DM405.00 and
Commerzbank shed DM1.50 to DM360.50.
Car stocks were also pressured, with BMW falling DM7.00 to DM932.50 in spite
of forecasting an increase in profits this year.
Volkswagen slipped DM1 to DM528 ahead of a press conference scheduled for
last night.
PARIS had already discounted a further cut in French rates and the market
lost ground as some profits were booked. The CAC-40 index ended 18.64 down
at 2,165.35. Turnover was FFr4.2bn.
Pernod Ricard was among the day's heaviest losers as the drinks group made a
cautious forecast for 1994 as well as reporting a 5 per cent increase in
first quarter sales. The shares slid FFr22.50 to FFr387.50.
Trading in Moulinex remained suspended for the second day, at the company's
request, as talks continued on restructuring plans.
ZURICH was lower in subdued trading, as many investors decided to pocket
gains seen in recent days and were reluctant to open new positions ahead of
the forthcoming long weekend. The SMI index lost 14.8 to 2,725.8.
UBS continued its comeback, gaining SFr14 to SFr1,165 but SBC lost SFr7 to
SFr403 and CS Holding fell SFr4 to SFr617.
The insurance sector lost ground on profit-taking, as Zurich fell SFr22 to
SFr1,350, Winterthur shed SFr19 to SFr720, and Swiss Re dropped SFr35 to
SFr630.
Roche certificates continued to struggle, losing SFr45 to SFr6,635, and
Nestle fell SFr7 to SFr1,135.
Brown Boveri picked up another SFr8 to SFr1,296 in continued response to
ABB's first quarter results and as Mr Simon Street at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
upgraded 1994 and 1995 net profit forecast for ABB.
AMSTERDAM moved a little lower in lacklustre trading and the AEX index
finished the day off 0.51 at 415.53.
Chemicals were featured as some institutions were seen switching out of this
sector and into financials. DSM fell Fl 1.70 to Fl 139.50 and Akzo Fl 3.00
to Fl 215.00.
MILAN fell 1.5 per cent on a wave of profit-taking after Wednesday night's
confidence vote and the Comit index finished 11.78 lower at 794.50.
Foreign investors who have fuelled the market's recent rises were sellers,
but some buying by Italian funds was reported at the lower levels.
Blue chip industrials, recent favourites with foreign investors, were among
the hardest hit. Fiat sank L164 to L6,980 while Olivetti slipped L100 to
L2,893. Pirelli fell L140 to L2,860.
Mediobanca, the merchant bank, declined L540 to L17,520 and Generali slid
L1,300 to L47,250.
The telecommunications sector, where formal approval was being given to
merger ahead of privatisation, was also sold. Sip fell L96 to L4,593 as it
said it would buy back shares from stockholders not wanting to accept the
merger into Telecom Italia at L4,078 per share. Stet was L212 lower at
L5,634.
Against the trend, Alitalia, the flagship carrier rose L40 to L1,370 amid
reports that it planned to invest some L5,000bn between 1995 and 1997.
ATHENS fell sharply as pressure on the drachma continued in the money
markets. The general index lost 2.15 per cent to 906.47, its lowest level
this year, as turnover exceeded Dr1bn.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges wary of dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar was fairly stable on foreign exchanges yesterday, although
sentiment towards the US currency remains negative, writes Philip Gawith.
The market shrugged off a very positive set of March trade figures, and the
dollar closed in London at DM1.6551, from DM1.6596 on Wednesday.
Against the yen, the dollar finished firmer at Y104.065 from Y103.665,
helped by positive comments about the possible resumption of US-Japan trade
talks. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.6577 and Y104.25.
Elsewhere, interest rates remained high in Greece, as the government sought
to defend the drachma amid talk of a possible devaluation. The Austrian
National Bank reduced the GOMEX money market rate to 5 per cent from 5.1 per
cent.
In the UK, firmer retail sales figures, and comments from the Treasury 'wise
men' that higher interest rates were not required now, triggered a rally in
eurosterling futures. Sterling closed slightly lower at DM2.4954 from
DM2.5002 against the D-Mark, weighed down by the weaker dollar.
The March US trade figures were very positive, with the trade gap falling by
18.5 per cent to Dollars 7.46bn. Total exports rose by 9.6 per cent to
Dollars 58.33bn, while imports were 5.4 per cent higher. 'In the past these
numbers would have led to a stronger dollar via expectations of higher
interest rates,' said Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW.
But the dollar has been capped by Tuesday's statement from the US Federal
Reserve, that monetary policy is approaching neutrality. This is taken to
mean that higher US interest rates are unlikely in the short term.
Mr Turner added that there appeared to be a standoff at the moment, with the
market wanting to take the dollar lower, but wary of the prospect of central
bank intervention.
European currencies were rangebound, with the D-Mark's performance mixed. It
finished at L958.3 from L956.8 against the Italian lira.
The French franc closed firmer at FFr3.423, from FFr3.426, against the
D-Mark, in spite of the Bank of France trimming the intervention rate to
5.40 per cent from 5.50 per cent. Mr Turner said it was notable that the
franc had held up well recently despite the weakness of the dollar.
Normally, the franc suffers under these circumstances, because of D-Mark
strength.
One possible reason for this is that the recent quickening in German rate
cuts has brought them down to levels which the French find more manageable.
Mr Turner said there were also signs of investors returning to European
bonds, with France particularly attractive, and this lent support to the
franc.
In Greece, meanwhile, interest rates stayed high as authorities sought to
defend the drachma. The currency was trading near to Dr149 to the D-Mark
from a previous close of Dr148.30. Rates were kept high, with overnight
money quoted at 175/250 per cent.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, predicted a
fairly substantial devaluation in the near future. He said high interest
rates were a deterrent to speculators, but not to domestic investors, and it
was they who were selling the currency.
Portugal trimmed its emergency lending rate by 0.375 percentage point to
11.375 per cent, but the escudo took this in its stride, ending at Es103.2
from Es103.1 per D-Mark.
A buoyant set of UK retail sales figures, with year-on-year growth in April
of 4.4 per cent, provided the unlikely stimulus for a strong rally in
eurosterling futures. The December contract saw nearly 42,000 lots traded,
and closed 15 basis points up at 94.05. At one stage it reached 94.14.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said the rally had started in
the gilt market and spread over into short sterling. He attributed this to
covering of short positions, and also to a 'change in psychology and
sentiment in the market. It is a good news market now. People are feeling
more confident about taking longer term positions.'
This rally received further impetus from the six economists who advise the
chancellor. In their quarterly report, they said they saw no need for a
further increase in rates now.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of
about Pounds 385m. Earlier the Bank put Pounds 130m liquidity into the
system, against a forecast shortage of Pounds 500m. Overnight rates moved
between 4 and 6 per cent.
German interest rate futures had a less happy day, with the December
Euromark contract closing nine basis points weaker at 95.12. Sentiment was
undermined by a comment from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president.
According to the text of a speech for delivery at the University of Halle,
he said 'it is important . . . that as far as central bank interest rates
are concerned, the horizon has now been cleared for a fairly long time'. The
market took this to mean that the pace of German monetary easing was now
likely to slow. German call money eased to 5.20/30 per cent, from 5.30/40
per cent.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Helping 'green' farming to a
fertile future - Britain's organic growers want more government support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eating organic food can improve your fertility: that is the conclusion of a
recent study in Denmark in which 30 men living on a diet of organic produce
were found to have a sperm count double that of their counterparts.
Mr Patrick Holden, policy director of the Soil Association, says the study
provides evidence that there may be a link between declining male sperm
counts and the increase in the use of agrochemicals in the past 50 years.
He hopes that statistics like these will boost British sales of organic
food, which increased dramatically in the 1980s to Pounds 200m but levelled
off during the recession. Demand for organic food is now rising again, but
it can cost up to 20 per cent more than food produced by conventional
methods, which limits its appeal.
Part of the problem for British consumers is that a lot of organic food must
be imported because the UK does not grow enough for its own needs. Countries
such as Denmark and Germany have thriving organic sectors that have been
stimulated by government support.
In Germany 10,000 farmers have converted to organic methods and 2.4 per cent
of the country's agricultural land is cultivated without the use of
artificial fertilisers and pesticides. However, the German government pays
the equivalent of Pounds 200 a hectare for farmers to produce in this way,
which costs up to 30 per cent more than conventional methods.
Ireland recently became the latest member of the European Union to announce
substantial support for organic farmers, offering to pay them IPounds 150 a
hectare to make up for the higher cost of producing without chemicals.
The organic industry in the UK is calling on the British government to offer
similar levels of support, but Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister,
has been reluctant to extend financial aid to Britain's existing 800 organic
farmers. Last year, the government allocated Pounds 1m to help farmers
convert to organic production - offering a payment of Pounds 70 a hectare.
The scheme has not been implemented yet, however, and existing farmers say
it penalises them since they have borne the full costs of converting their
farms and will receive no government help for it.
Mr Holden says this has given many farmers the message that the government
is not serious about supporting the organic sector.
'We're committed to farming organically, but we're just hoping someone will
see sense and realise how hard they are squeezing us,' says Ms Daphne
Saunders who produces organically on 570 hectares on the banks of the Thames
in Oxfordshire.
The costs of converting a conventional farm to organic methods are
substantial as land must be taken out of production for at least a year. Ms
Helen Browning, chairman of the British Organic Farmers, says it is taking
her up to 10 years to convert her 550-hectare holding into a fully organic
farm.
'Soils which have been dependent on artificial fertilisers for 30 to 40
years can go through a withdrawal process and be almost dead for several
years,' she stresses. The way to improve the soil in an organic scheme is to
grow a fertility-building crop such as clover, but this means that some land
is always growing a non-profit crop.
'It is a lifetime's commitment to convert a farm and many farmers won't take
that financial risk until they see some government support for it,' says Ms
Browning.
Another problem for farmers is finding a market for their organic food and
particularly one that will pay them a premium to cover the higher costs of
production. Ms Browning does a lot of direct marketing of her organic meat
and produce and says she is 'snowed under' with demand. But this is not an
approach that most farmers would be willing to take.
There is no established infrastructure for marketing organic produce. Ms
Saunders points out that some British supermarkets were keen to take organic
food in the 1980s when it became fashionable, but are now finding they do
not get sufficient through-put to make it worthwhile.
Mr Mike Calvert who runs CWS Agriculture, Britain's biggest farm group, does
not believe that organic farming can be viable over the long-term.
'Our experience has shown that organic farming maybe has a place in a small
family farm with access to niche markets, but could never play a part in
broader-scale agriculture,' he says.
Five years ago, Mr Calvert converted 105 hectares of some of his best land
in Leicestershire to organic production, but says it is much more labour
intensive than his conventional production. Much of the produce is sold in a
farm shop, but it does not command much of a premium over
conventionally-produced food.
But organic farmers are receiving little subsidy and having to compete
against conventional producers who are heavily subsidised by Brussels, Mr
Holden stresses. Investment in organic production methods would be a potent
way of reforming the CAP, he contends, as it reduces food surpluses in a
more cost-effective way than setting aside land.
'We believe there is a case for supporting agriculture, but organic
producers deserve the biggest share of that: if they were supported they
could fulfil the public demand without charging more for their food,' he
says.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poultry research cuts attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government funding of research into poultry disease has been cut so
sharply that the industry would be unable to cope with unexpected outbreaks,
according to a report by the House of Commons agriculture committee.
The report on the UK poultry industry, published yesterday, cited evidence
from the Institute of Animal Health that its poultry research funding from
the agriculture ministry had dropped from Pounds 1.2m in 1988 to Pounds
600,000.
'The UK's poultry disease research base now lacks the strategic
comprehensiveness to respond to unforeseen disease problems affecting the
industry,' said the report.
'We find this a deplorable state of affairs and recommend that the
government take steps to restore funding to a level adequate to finance such
a strategic capability.'
In its first report since inquiring into the fallout of controversy over
salmonella in eggs in 1989, the committee said it was concerned that
evidence on suspected causes of salmonella food poisoning remained 'patchy
and incomplete'.
'We recommend that urgent attention be given to ways of co-ordinating and
improving the reporting system so that causes of infection can be identified
in a higher proportion of cases.' The source is established in less than 50
per cent of reported outbreaks, it said.
The committee also said poultry producers had suffered substantial losses
from disease in the past few years because vaccines being used in other
European Union countries were not available in the UK because of to
licensing delays and costs. It recommended that the government cut the cost
to pharmaceutical companies of licensing vaccines to levels prevailing
elsewhere in the EU, where governments subsidise the licensing process.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: LME copper pulls back from
17-month high - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange COPPER market proved vulnerable yesterday
afternoon, settling about Dollars 30 below an early 17-month high and
pulling other metals back with it.
The three months delivery price closed at Dollars 2,252 a tonne, up Dollars
51.50 from Wednesday's official close, but close to levels reached later
that evening. However, with a further big decline in LME stocks expected to
be announced today, the three months delivery price should be able to resume
an advance towards its immediate target of Dollars 2,300 a tonne objective,
traders suggested.
At the London bullion market the SILVER price suddenly leapt 6 cents a troy
announce, pulling GOLD into another challenge of its Dollars 383-an-ounce
resistance just minutes before the afternoon fixing. The yellow metal closed
at Dollars 383.70, up Dollars 1, while silver ended at Dollars 5.62 1/2 , up
7 cents.
Dealers said the markets were turning 'less bearish, if not more bullish',
and were looking to the Commodity Research Bureau index, now at a 3 1/2
 year high, for guidance.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee continues to defy
gravity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices continued to defy gravity yesterday with nearby futures at the
London Commodity Exchange posting the biggest daily gains since the present
bull run began less than one month and more than Dollars 800 ago.
The July position, which on Wednesday morning dipped to Dollars 2,030 a
tonne in what most dealers thought was the beginning of a long-awaited
sell-off, closed last night at a fresh 5-year high of Dollars 2,247 a tonne,
up Dollars 128 on the day.
The market had opened modestly firmer, recouping what remained of the
previous day's fall, and it did not begin to levitate until after a
surprisingly strong opening in New York. That sucked in fresh trade and
investment fund buying, which met negligible selling resistance.
In New York the July price was 6.1 cents up in late trading at 131.1 cents a
pound. Some traders said a close above 130 cents could herald a further
10-cent rise, but others were doubtful. 'You can't keep rising in more or
less a straight line day after day,' one told the Reuter news agency.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambian group's survival plan
agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the world's fourth-largest copper
producer, yesterday won union agreement to its short-term survival plan
designed in the next three years to lift output from under 400,000 tonnes of
copper to 450,000 tonnes and to reduce operating costs from 80 US cents a
pound to 64 cents.
It also calls for an 8,000 or 16 per cent reduction in the workforce from
the present 50,000, including 5,800 redundancies this year. Some 850 senior
staff, out of 2,500, have already left the company.
Mr Edward Shamutete, chief executive, revealed in London that ZCCM is to
sell its Chambishi and Kansanshi copper mines, which have resources of
3.25bn tonnes and 750,000 tonnes respectively. He said the group might also
sell its recently-closed Kabwe lead-zinc mine and the Luanshaya copper
smelter.
ZCCM's debt of Dollars 600m at the end of March would be reduced below
Dollars 400m by the end of the 1996 financial year, Mr Shamutete said.
Production difficulties caused a loss for the year to end-March but ZCCM
expected to break-even in the current financial year and be profitable in
1995-96.
Annual output of cobalt, about 3,300 tonnes in 1993, would rise to at least
5,000 tonnes in the three-year period. ZCCM had 1,600 tonnes of cobalt in
stocks.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger world sugar deficit
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C. Czarnikow, the London Trade house, has increased its forecast of the
1993-94 world sugar production deficit to 4.39m tonnes from the 3.08m tonnes
it was predicting three months ago.
In the latest issue of its Sugar Review Cazarnikow says that the estimate
for production has fallen by 1.5m tonnes from its February figure to
110.13m, while the consumption figure has been reduced by only 190,000
tonnes to 113.92m tonnes. To the resulting deficit of 3.79m tonnes is added
a further 600,000 tonnes to allow for 'unrecorded disappearance'.
Most of the latest cut in the production estimate is attributed to the
'continuing deterioration in the Indian crop'.
Czarnikow notes that a feature of this year's market has been a tightening
white sugar supply, contrasting with an ample availability of raws. This has
been reflected at the London Commodity Exchange, where whites futures have
risen by 13.7 per cent so far this year, while raws are up by only 10.5 per
cent.
The review says trends are beginning to emerge for the 1994-95 season and
that although it is too early for detailed predictions, 'there are signs of
quite strong recovery for new crops'.

FT  20 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool at auctions held towards the end of the main selling season, has sold
at prices mostly firm and unchanged. Some of the main market indicators are
up again, with Australia's at 614 cents a kg. compared with 603 a week ago,
but this does exaggerate the rise on a strictly comparable basis. Whatever
the exact market measurement, wool sold very well and clearances in all
primary markets remained good. The problem for those buying it is their own
customers are still showing reluctance in paying the quite substantial
increases from recession low points. Retailers in particular are unhappy at
the prospect of having to raise their own selling prices, or of cutting
present margins. The battle is unresolved but with ho;idays in consumer
markets and recess in wool sales acting as incentives, background buying
interest remains.

FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Decision delayed on new bid for
Chilean copper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, Chile's state copper company, has postponed for one week a decision
on the troubled El Abra copper project pending fresh information from
Cyprus-Amax, the US company whose recalculated bid it is considering.
A consortium of Cyprus and Lac Minerals of Canada had last year offered
Dollars 555m for 51 per cent of El Abra, one of the world's biggest
undeveloped copper deposits.
Last month, however, Lac pulled out after preliminary tests showed that El
Abra, which the consortium had estimated at an annual capacity of 225,000
tonnes, might be smaller than originally believed.
Mr Juan Villarzu, president of Codelco, denied a newspaper report that
Cyprus had resubmitted a bid of Dollars 350m, compared with the Dollars 240m
offered by the underbidder, a consortium of Magma Copper of the US and
Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary.
A Cyprus official refused to deny or confirm the Dollars 350m figure.

US Treasury bonds were firmer yesterday, with a stronger dollar offsetting a
tangle of mixed economic news and a moderate rise in commodity prices.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/16 higher
at 88, with the yield rising to 7.236 per cent. At the short end the
two-year note was  1/8 better at 99 19/32 , to yield 5.705 per cent.
Activity continued to taper off from the heated pace set earlier in the
week, when the latest boost in short-term interest rates by the Federal
Reserve touched off a powerful rally in bond prices.
A restrained tone early yesterday was partially explained by the confusing
array of data and market trends.
On the negative side, the Commerce Department reported that the trade
deficit narrowed to Dollars 10.12bn in March from a revised Dollars 11.99bn
in February, as exports rose faster than imports. The trend suggested the
economy was accelerating, an unfavourable development for
inflation-sensitive fixed-rate investments.
For the same reason, traders were discouraged by a slight decline in claims
for unemployment benefit last week. A solid increase in the Commodity
Research Bureau's daily index of price movements also set off a warning bell
on inflation.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's monthly report on regional business
activity was a mixed bag. The overall May index showed a solid gain and the
current prices-received reading nearly doubled from the previous month,
suggesting manufacturers were passing higher prices on to customers. On the
other hand, the prices-paid component and the employment index were lower.
Also on the positive side of the ledger, the dollar rebounded strongly
against the yen after weakening in overnight trading on the foreign exchange
markets. The improvement came on the heels of optimistic remarks by US
officials regarding informal trade talks with Japan.
Soon afterwards, the long end of the yield curve retraced its early losses
and pushed into positive ground.
UK government bonds climbed yesterday, boosted by recent strength in the US
market and by comments from Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of
England and from the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters.
Gilts dipped in early trading on news that the volume of UK retail sales had
grown by 4.4 per cent in the year to April, but recovered later. The long
gilt future was up 1 1/16 points at 106 13/16 in late trading.
The Treasury's 'wise men' said that they saw no need for a rise in interest
rates, giving heart to the short end of the market. The December three-month
eurosterling contract rose 0.20 points, implying short-term rates around 5.9
per cent by December.
Mr George's warning against loosening monetary policy was seen as indicating
the authorities were not prepared to jeopardise the long-term inflation
outlook and this supported the long end of the market.
Analysts reported renewed buying by investors in continental Europe and
Japan. The 10-year gilt yield spread over bunds has narrowed in recent days
from 160 basis points on Monday to 144 yesterday - a sign that investors are
beginning to buy British stock.
'The market firmed, reflecting the better tone of markets around the world,
which have taken heart from the US,' said Mr John Shepperd of Yamaichi.
'There is now a degree of confidence, especially in the UK, which was
particularly oversold.'
German bunds closed little changed in moderate turnover. Expectations of
April M3 money supply data, due on Tuesday or Wednesday, kept activity muted
amid rumours that it might be higher than the annualised 15.4 per cent rate
of March.
Sentiment was further dampened by comments from Bundesbank President Hans
Tietmeyer, who said that 'as far as central bank interest rates are
concerned, the horizon has now been cleared for a fairly long time'. While
he did not rule out a further interest rate cut, many observers took this to
indicate that Germany is close to reaching the bottom of the current
interest rate cycle.
Close on the heels of Tuesday's repo rate cut in Germany, the Bank of France
lowered its intervention rate by 10 basis points to 5.40 per cent and its
five to 10-day window to 6.40 from 6.75 per cent. The widely expected move
had little impact on prices.
Denmark also cut its repo rate by 10 basis points, highlighting that,
despite forecasts of 4 per cent GDP growth this year, inflation pressures
are subdued. March year-on-year inflation was 1.7 per cent.
