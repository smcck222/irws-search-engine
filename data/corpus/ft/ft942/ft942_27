FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of World Forest Products (1): Back on course after a
gruelling ordeal - The industry has been frog-marched into unfamiliar
territory, where it has had to re-examine the entire spectrum of its
business practices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A cartoon passed around the offices of the Swedish Pulp and Paper
Association aptly captures the mood of the world's forest-products industry:
'We're depressed, frustrated, alienated, disillusioned,' the caption reads,
'but we've adapted to the market.'
This sense of discomfort mingled with accomplishment is the culmination of
the gruelling ordeal which timber, pulp and paper producers have endured for
the past five years.
Already reeling from weak markets and heavy losses, the industry has been
frog-marched into unfamiliar surroundings, where it has had to re-examine
the entire spectrum of its business, from the way trees are cut to the
future of paper in the electronic age.
The challenge has been compounded by the fact that the industry, long a
bastion of conservatism, has had little control over the pace of change. The
marching orders have come largely from outsiders, including customers,
politicians, bankers and - not least - environmentalists.
An unexpectedly strong rebound in pulp and paper prices since late 1993 has
raised hopes that the worst is over. Most companies around the world, with
the notable exception of Japan, are likely to return to profit this year.
The prospect of better times ahead has also enabled debt-burdened producers
to repair their balance sheets, either by selling assets or raising new
equity. Canadian forest-products companies have floated four of the 10
biggest initial public offerings on the Toronto stock exchange in the past
18 months. The Swedish government launched its biggest-ever privatisation
earlier this year by selling 49 per cent of its stake in AssiDoman.
It would be wrong to conclude, however, that the road ahead is all downhill.
Welcome as the recovery in prices may be, it will not deflect powerful,
longer-term forces which are shifting the industry's centre of gravity away
from traditional products, operating methods, investment patterns and
corporate structures.
At one end of the production chain, forests have become the industry's main
environmental battleground. 'I have a feeling it's the thing we'll be
dealing with for the next five to 10 years,' says Pertti Laine, director of
industrial and environmental policy at the Finnish Forest Industries
Federation in Helsinki.
Calls for the preservation of old trees in British Columbia, spotted owls in
Oregon, and tropical rain-forests in Brazil and Indonesia have shrunk the
area available for logging, especially in North America. Environmentalists
have also pressed for more ecologically-sensitive forestry practices,
backing up their demands with threats of consumer boycotts and civil
disobedience campaigns.
The forestry companies have adjusted their logging practices by shrinking
the size of unsightly clear-cuts and leaving trees standing along lakes and
rivers. United Paper Mills of Finland two years ago stopped buying
old-growth timber for its pulp mills. It has gone so far as to replace the
mineral oil in its tree-felling machines with biodegradable vegetable oils.
Such changes have pushed up costs, forcing companies to examine the
efficiency of their entire forestry operations. But far-sighted members of
the industry have come to appreciate that environmental pressures also
create opportunities.
One example is a joint venture in Indonesia involving Enso-Gutzeit, the
Finnish group. Enso has insisted that all wood supplies for a proposed new
pulp mill in East Kalimantan must come from plantations, and not from the
rain forest. As a result, Enso's contribution to the project will include
reafforestation of vast tracts of grassland.
Pulp and paper mills have also undergone radical changes. Toxic emissions
have dwindled as chlorine gas has been steadily replaced by other, less
harmful bleaching agents such as chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide and
enzymes.
Mill owners boast that fish are starting to return to once-polluted rivers.
Effluent from mills in some Scandinavian towns is now diverted to heat
nearby offices, and waste material is used to generate electricity.
Perhaps the industry's biggest upheaval has come from the drive to recycle
an ever-growing proportion of waste paper. Recycled materials now make up
more than 40 per cent of the raw material consumed by paper mills worldwide.
While global paper production has edged up by only about 1 per cent a year
in the early 1990s, consumption of recycled paper has grown by 5 per cent.
A law due to take effect in Germany in mid-1995 will break new ground by
requiring at least 80 per cent of used packaging paper and board to be
collected, and 80 per cent of that to be recycled.
The pressures on the forestry industry have reverberated all the way to
retail stores and construction sites. Cut-price warehouse outlets, mainly in
North America, are demanding that wood suppliers make their do-it-yourself
products more 'consumer friendly', for instance, by packaging components in
kits.
Efforts to broaden the use of wood as a building material have led to the
growth of engineered wood products, with a strength and consistency which
matches steel, concrete and aluminium.
This top-to-toe shake-up in the way forestry companies do business has
accompanied a structural transformation comparable to the upheavals in the
global steel, textile and shipbuilding industries in the 1960s and 1970s.
Production of commodity-grade items, such as market pulp and newsprint, is
gradually migrating to parts of the world - such as Brazil, Indonesia and
Chile - where trees grow fastest, costs are still relatively low, and
environmental standards are less exacting.
At the same time, growing demand for recyclable waste paper is shifting
production capacity from thinly-populated Canada, Sweden and Finland to the
'urban forests' of the US and central Europe.
The biggest investments currently under way by Swedish and Finnish companies
are recycled newsprint mills being built, respectively, by SCA at Aylesford,
UK, and by Enso-Gutzeit near Leipzig, Germany. Among Canadian producers,
MacMillan Bloedel and Fletcher Challenge Canada have drawn up plans for
similar mills in California and Arizona.
The three northern countries are moving towards more specialised products
which still require a relatively high proportion of virgin fibre. Trees take
from 80 to 110 years to grow in Canada, Sweden and Finland, but they produce
wood of unusually high quality.
Finland has become a leader in fine writing and printing papers, while
Sweden's emerging strength is in high-grade packaging materials. Many
Canadian west coast lumber mills have shifted from churning out basic planks
to more sophisticated building materials, such as decorative panels.
Weak prices and heavy debt burdens have also forced individual companies to
narrow their sights, mainly by selling assets. Abitibi-Price, of Toronto,
has decided to stick to newsprint and uncoated groundwood papers.
Conversely, Georgia-Pacific, the second-biggest North American group, has
withdrawn entirely from newsprint.
'We recognised that in our present size, we can't be all things to all
people,' says Harri Piehl, chief executive of Finland's Kymmene, which is
focusing on fine papers, lightweight coated papers and panels.
Only a handful of broad-based multinationals remain. They include
International Paper, the world's biggest - and still one of the most
aggressive - companies, and New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge, whose
operations stretch from Australasia to North and South America and the UK.
Perhaps the most telling sign that the worst is over is that long-suffering
forestry executives are gradually moving from defence to attack on
environmental issues.
A blizzard of publicity material from all the main pulp and paper-producing
countries argues that few other industries can match forestry's 'sustainable
cycle' of a renewable raw material, recyclable products, and energy from its
waste.
'This industry can be totally clean,' says Henrik Ehrnroodt, chief executive
of Jaakoo Poyry, the Finnish forest-products consultancy. But the industry
is still pleading for patience. To complete the job that has been started
will require more time and a lot more money.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (1): Centre of gravity
moves to the east - Embattled western suppliers risk more restructuring if
they fail to win the new business generated by Asia's expanding economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER

<TEXT>
As growth in demand in the world market for electricity generating equipment
shifts inexorably eastwards, western suppliers are warily eyeing each
others' efforts to benefit from growth opportunities.
Declining demand in western markets has left the industry with surplus
capacity. In the new markets of Asia, they are faced with increasing demands
to share contracts and technology with local partners. The top suppliers,
whose wares are on show at this week's Power-Gen '94 exhibition in Cologne,
have yet to demonstrate whether they can meet this challenge.
A review just of April's events in the industry shows where the big new
deals are being struck. On the same day, Zurich-based Asea Brown Boveri
announced a contract worth about Dollars 1bn to build a turnkey 1,300MW
gas-fired combined cycle plant in Malaysia, while Siemens said its KWU power
generation business had clinched an order worth nearly DM1bn to equip a
2,364MW combined cycle station in Taiwan.
Also in April, GE of the US announced a Dollars 170m order to supply a
turnkey power plant for a 440MW independent power project in Malaysia, one
of the first such stations planned by the south-east Asian country. And
Westinghouse Electric, also of the US, picked up an order worth more than
Dollars 100m from Korea Electric Power for the supply of turbines,
generators and related equipment.
Much of the demand is being met through joint ventures and similar
arrangements. Two deals are particularly striking. ABB is forming a
majority-owned joint venture in Vietnam with CTBT, a local transformer
manufacturer. The European company said the venture was the biggest in the
electrotechnical industry to be undertaken in Vietnam by a foreign company.
In the UK, meanwhile, Babcock International has announced a partnership
agreement with Wuhan Boiler Works, China's fourth biggest boiler maker,
which is designed to help Babcock expand its presence in the Asian market.
Significantly, the first order following the agreement will see Babcock
supplying design expertise while Wuhan will be doing the manufacturing. The
UK company is recognising that to win orders in Asia, western suppliers
cannot expect to produce everything themselves.
As ABB's figures show, (see chart), there is enormous variation between
different regions, which explains why suppliers are having to turn
themselves into global players. And the upward line in the forecast is due
mainly to growth in China and Asian countries.
'Suppliers have historically been in markets that last year were shrinking -
Europe, the US and Japan,' says Mr Goran Lundberg, an ABB executive
vice-president and head of its power plants business. 'Global growth is
coming out of the internal growth of China. So everyone is tense and
nervous, as competition is hardening.' Mr Lundberg believes that the power
equipment industry is facing some 'quite dramatic' changes, as it continues
over the next five to 10 years to become more global. The ambitions of
equipment suppliers in China and Korea will make it important for western
suppliers to recognise the need for new alliances and combinations, he says.
Also, he says, large equipment suppliers will have to continue investing
heavily to ensure they have a broad range of products for customers with
widely differing financial and technical priorities, and will have to raise
ing productivity in their traditional manufacturing plants. Suppliers should
only manufacture in high-cost countries when it is competitive to do so, he
says.
ABB's assessment of future growth for the industry broadly coincides with
those of its rivals. Westinghouse, for example, says that the global market
for new capacity additions is about 60,000MW a year, and says demand is
expected to grow to about 100,000MW annually in the next 10 years.
Even so, the total market will only then have recovered to levels reached in
the late 1970s, and its geographic and competitive profile will have been
transformed. Mr Lundberg believes, therefore, that the industry will see
further restructuring, and that small and medium-sized European players will
find it difficult to cope with the challenges ahead. 'They may need to get
into a larger structure so they can draw on the resources of the larger
company with its volume,' he says.
In spite of the heavy restructuring that has already taken place in the
industry, Mr Lundberg says it has not gone as far as in other 'oligopolic'
industries, through exchanges of products, for example.
Meanwhile, although Asia is clearly at centre stage, there is still activity
in the wings. In spite of the gloom of recession in many European countries,
the power equipment market there looks to be very promising, says Mr Ronald
Pressman, chief executive of GE Power Systems  - Europe.
He foresees annual growth in the installed power capacity base of 2 per
cent, which may not sound too exciting, but equates to an overall 172,000MW
growth in the market between 1994 and 2002 (including Russia and Central
Europe). There are a variety of dynamics driving the market, he says,
including economics and the environment.
'There is an awful lot of the installed base that is old, relatively
inefficient, and is not burning the cleanest of fuels,' he says. No country
can afford to let its industrial sector pay more than the world rate for
power, so this creates a powerful argument for installing replacement
equipment.
Privatisation and the development of independent power projects is seen by
Mr Pressman as the third big issue in Europe.
The UK, where both GE and its business associates have supplied independent
power producers, still provides the best model, but Mr Pressman is not alone
among power equipment executives in predicting the continued spread of
privatisation on the continent.
Signs of recovery in Germany, which could have a knock-on effect across the
continent, also point to increased demand for power. But Mr Pressman is also
optimistic about developments in central Europe and particularly Hungary,
the Czech Republic and Poland which, he says, are 'leading the pack'.
Last month, GE scored a notable coup by clinching a 10-year co-operation
agreement with the much-wooed Skoda of the Czech Republic. This was the US
company's first power equipment-related joint venture in eastern Europe and
was negotiated under the nose of Siemens, which has been talking
intermittently to Skoda for more than two years.
Russia has also received considerable attention from suppliers in recent
months, as much in words as in deeds.
Mr Percy Barnevik, ABB's president, was one of the first western businessmen
to criticise the low level of funds being made available to the countries of
the former Soviet Union to upgrade their power stations and bring the more
modern nuclear stations up to western safety standards - and close the rest.
Earlier this year, Mr Barnevik said the west had missed an opportunity to
help Russia and his comments were echoed last month by Mr Heinrich von
Pierer, chairman of Siemens, who said Western companies and countries should
work together to help Russia improve safety standards at its nuclear power
stations.
On the technical side, the major suppliers continue their quest for ever
higher thermal efficiency from combined cycle power. Developments in the
past year included the announcement by ABB of a new range of gas turbines
for which it is claiming efficiencies of 58-58.5 per cent in combined cycle.
Thermal efficiency remains one of the key advantages of gas-fired combined
cycle, and Dr Hans Bohm, a member of the executive management group at
Siemens KWU, says the next step is to reach 60 per cent thermal efficiency
in combined cycle. 'It will not need more than two or three years before
such a machine is sold,' he says.
This month, he says, Siemens is due to begin testing in Berlin of a new gas
turbine which will achieve 60 per cent thermal efficiency in combined cycle.
Dr Bohm thinks the natural limit will occur somewhere between 60 and 62 per
cent, because of the high research and development costs required even to
raise temperatures by a small amount.

FT  17 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue steps in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Market speculation turned to fact as De La Rue confirmed that it was the
mystery predator which had approached paper manufacturer Portals, the
announcement speeding the two companies' shares in opposite directions.
Portals continued its upward momentum, first seen a week ago, with the
shares ending another busy session 40 ahead at 805p, making a net gain of 28
per cent over the past week.
In contrast, De La Rue dropped 21 to 857p on fears that the bank note
printer may have to pay too high a premium to secure Portals, and worries
over how it would be financed. A mixture of cash - the company has around
Pounds 250m - and paper was thought the most likely avenue.
With Portals having a solid reputation in the City as a well run profitable
company, many analysts felt that the premium that an agreed merger would
require would be too high a price to pay, while a hostile bid was deemed a
non-starter. A bid price of Pounds 9 a share was being mooted late
yesterday, a figure which would put Portals on a price/earnings ratio of 21
on 1995 earnings forecasts, a hefty 70 per cent premium to the market.
Others also questioned De La Rue's timing, with the paper and printing
market well off the bottom of a year ago.
Full-year figures from brewing and retailing group Whitbread met market
forecasts, although the shares ran into profit-takers and slid 9 to 563p.
Drinks specialists blamed the fall, as well as weakness in some of the other
stocks yesterday, on the good run in the sector recently, as well as on the
lack of scintillating news needed to maintain the momentum. Bass, which
reports tomorrow, was one such casualty, retreating 17 to 550p. Greenalls
suffered a similar fate, losing 9 at 440p.
Speculation continued to surround the Guinness share price, with suggestions
that LVMH, its French partner, may use the options market to offload some of
its Guinness shares ahead of the agm on Thursday. The French group has
agreed to reduce its holding in Guinness from 24 to 20 per cent by June next
year. Guinness receded 6 to 490p.
The overall weakness in the market took its toll of the banks sector, where
most of the business involved heavy switching from National Westminster into
Barclays. The latter ended a net 3 off at 537p on hefty turnover of 4.5m,
while the former fell 14 to 449p on 3.9m traded. The switching operation was
said to have triggered additional straight selling of NatWest.
Abbey National was recommended by one of the big integrated houses and
initially edged up to 407p before slipping back to close marginally easier
at 402p.
General Accident was the outstanding performer in composite insurances, the
shares adding 9 at 568p. A switching operation out of Prudential, 2 off at
305p, and into Legal &amp; General left the latter 5 stronger at 455p.
National Power was the star performer in the utilities sector, responding to
recommendations both new and in the recent past from various broking firms.
SG Warburg Securities issued a strong buy note on NatPower and PowerGen late
last week, while Lehman Brothers, the US brokerage house, and James Capel,
the leading UK agency broker, were said to have given the stock a big push
yesterday. At the close NatPower shares were 15 higher at 443p after good
turnover of 2.6m. PowerGen appreciated 10 to 475p.
The Scottish generators, on the other hand, were hit by profit-taking,
Scottish Power retreating 10 to 368p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel remained under a cloud in spite of a
company denial that it faced a deadline at midnight yesterday to secure
further bank loans from Japanese bank creditors.
The shares relinquished 12 to 420p on these financial concerns, and with
sentiment further weakened by reports that the well-flagged rights issue
would be announced today. But several analysts discounted such a likelihood
today.
The company yesterday announced that the first fare-paying freight service
through the tunnel will begin on Thursday, and forecast it will have 50 per
cent of cross-channel car and coach service by 1996.
News of the start of operations at Eurotunnel and optimism on traffic levels
damaged sentiment in P&amp;O, the ferry operator. The shares gave up 10 to 690p
in trade of 1.9m.
Rolls-Royce rose 6 to 188p in hefty trading of 7.7m, with US investment bank
Lehman Brothers said to have been among the day's big buyers.
Profit-taking left British Aerospace 10 lighter at 493p. The company said
the total of overseas owners of its shares had exceeded 29.5 per cent, the
permitted limit under its articles of association. Foreign owners that last
acquired the stock will now be forced to sell the shares to reduce the total
to the permitted figure.
Buoyant metal prices continued to boost international mining group RTZ and
the shares gained a further 7 at 865p.
Press speculation on the National Lottery helped Rank Organisation, which is
in a consortium believed to be one of the front runners. The shares added 5
at 408p.
NatWest Securities reiterated its positive stance on Boots, up 5 at 549p,
and Storehouse, ahead 2 at 219p.

FT  17 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market rejects Gas tale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market was alarmed yesterday at a story in the weekend press that
British Gas may be forced into cutting its dividend by the end of the year,
because of the impact of regulatory pressures on its profits. Gas is
scheduled to report first-quarter results on Thursday.
The shares were by far the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 Index, falling 9
1/2 to 284 1/2 p ex-dividend, and were the most heavily traded with more
than 18m changing hands.
Gas shares have moved erratically in recent weeks, plunging to 280p on April
28 following a profits warning, and racing up to more than 300p last week as
the market gave a positive reaction to the Department of Trade/Ofgas report
on competition and pricing in UK domestic gas supply.
Many analysts were sceptical of the dividend threat story. 'Gas declined to
discuss the dividend when it made its profits warning in April, and a
dividend cut seems most unlikely this year,' said one. Another said that Gas
will pay maintained dividends in the near term, although its ability to do
so post-1996 depends on progress on cost-cutting. 'There is a long term risk
to Gas's dividend but not so in the short term,' he added.

FT  17 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading

<TEXT>
Early gains in stock index futures were reversed in technical trading as
dealers awaited the outcome of today's US Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo.
The firm start to trading after the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at
3,126, encouraged further buying led by independent traders. The 9.30am
release of UK producer output prices data, showed the figures to be in line
with expectations and a further bout of buying shortly after the figure's
release sent the contract to the day's peak of 3,141.
Technical trading, as dealers focused on today's FOMC meeting expected to
result in an increase in US interest rates, reversed earlier gains leaving
the contract to drift lower and to ignore a firm start to trading in New
York in the afternoon.
June fell to a low of 3,104 before steadying to close at 3,106, at a 7 point
discount to the underlying cash market. However, dealers reported an
improvement in June in after hours trading. Volume was 13,570 contracts.
An active session in the traded options brought turnover of 31,767 lots, The
FT-SE 100 option traded 11,280 lots though the Euro FT-SE option had a poor
day with a mere 1,040 lots dealt. British Gas was the busiest stock option
with a total of 3,907 contracts transacted.

FT  17 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Traders stand by for news on US
interest rates - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market joined with other European bourses in holding its
breath yesterday as it waited for the US Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee to meet today. UK analysts appeared to be expecting, indeed hoping
for, the Fed to announce a decisive increase in its key interest rates,
perhaps as much as 50 basis points in both the Federal discount rate and
Federal Funds rate. Such a move, while perhaps discomforting for markets in
the short run, would be regarded as the best way to restore stability to
global bond markets, and thus set the background for a genuine advance in
share prices.
With little else but the FOMC meeting to focus on, UK equities lacked
direction as they made a start to the new trading account with a relatively
lightly traded session. An attempt to move forward was thwarted when UK
government bonds proved unable to develop a lasting trend, and the FT-SE 100
Index moved in a narrow range around its previous close.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,115.6 for a net loss of 3.6.
Earlier, the index had been 14.4 ahead, helped by the latest domestic
producer price data, which was in line with expectations and regarded as
neutral on inflation pressures.
Other hurdles on the domestic economy lie ahead this week, notably tomorrow,
when the market faces the latest retail price index, and data on
unemployment, average earnings and public sector borrowing. The concensus is
for a monthly rise of 1.3 per cent in the retail price index.
But these are overshadowed by the meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open
Market Committee today, which was reflected by firmness in the US currency
towards the close of trading in London yesterday. Statistics on US
industrial output and capacity utilisation appeared to leave unchanged the
likelihood of a tightening in US credit policy.
The UK market slightly underperformed other European markets, reinforcing
perceptions that the UK is seen as closer to the US in terms of the economic
cycle, and therefore more likely to see domestic interest rates rise while
France and Germany look for further reductions.
Trading volume, as recorded by the Seaq electronic trading system, was about
18 per cent down from Friday's level, at 548.4m shares. Friday afternoon saw
increased activity when securities houses unwound positions as the trading
account came to its end; 671.7m shares were traded in that session for a
retail worth of Pounds 1.43bn.
Second line issues played a subdued role, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell
14.9 to 3,706.9 yesterday. The FT-SE 100 stocks found some impetus from the
stock index futures market, a factor of no effect on the second-liners.
Market analysts were taking a cautious view at the beginning of a week in
which so much will depend on developments across the Atlantic. Although
nervous regarding US rate policy, most UK analysts believe that Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the British chancellor of the exchequer, will be unwilling to raise
domestic interest rates in the near term in what Kleinwort Benson describes
as 'an environment of economic slowdown'.
Nikko commented that UK consumers do not appear to have reacted sharply to
the tax increases introduced this month, although it adds that consumer
related companies are 'still finding things difficult'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Markets in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With Europe's political map being redrawn, some strategists have been trying
to assess the implications for equity markets. Merrill Lynch, for example,
notes that in the longer term, 'governments, partly through choice and
partly as a result of the increasing internationalism of economies in the
1980s, have left themselves little freedom of manoeuvre on economic policy'.
Short term, however, says Merrill, Spain, the UK and Sweden are likely to be
negatively affected by political developments.

FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges up but investors
stay cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Although US blue chip issues tended to edge higher yesterday in the wake of
firmer bonds, trading was subdued as the market awaited a likely interest
rate increase from the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 11.82 ahead at 3,671.50.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a slight 0.35 up at 444.49,
but the American Stock Exchange composite finished 0.89 easier at 431.68 and
the Nasdaq composite down 5.01 at 711.91.
Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 235m shares and overall
declines narrowly outpaced rises by 1,185 to 961.
From the opening bell, the mood of the market was cautious, with traders and
investors reluctant to commit themselves ahead of today's meeting of the
Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee. Wall Street analysts expect the
FOMC to sanction a rate increase, possibly one as large as a 50 basis-point
rise in the federal funds rate and a similar increase in the discount rate.
If the Fed puts up rates, it will be the fourth monetary policy tightening
in as many months, and like the previous three, it will be designed to slow
the pace of economic growth and stave off any return of inflation.
Trading was subdued yesterday, not just because of the expectation of a rate
rise, but also because participants were unsure how the market will react if
the Fed does act. Normally, rate increases are bad for stocks, but because
the move is already priced into the bond and equity markets, investors may
be disappointed if the Fed decides not to act this week. Conversely, a rate
increase could be greeted by a jump in share prices, primarily because it
would please the bond market and end any uncertainty about Fed policy.
Yesterday, what little strength there was in equities came courtesy of a
firmer bond market, where the benchmark 30-year bond improved  1/2 point,
and the yield edged lower to 7.446 per cent. Analysts said bonds advanced
because the April industrial production figures - which showed a rise of 0.3
per cent - contained no nasty surprises.
Among individual stocks, EDS Systems climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 34 1/2
in busy trading on news that General Motors, the company's parent, plans to
spin off GME in a tax-free reorganisation. The news left GM shares down
Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 53.
Another stock higher on news of a divestiture was Mead Corp, which put on
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 44 1/2 after the company said it would sell its
Mead Data Central unit so that it could focus in future on its core forest
products business.
Philip Morris, which benefited last week from speculation about a possible
split of its food and tobacco businesses, ran into profit-taking yesterday
and slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 5/8 .
UAL receded Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 117 3/4 on reports that the pilots
union wants to renegotiate the proposed terms of the carrier's buyout.
On the Nasdaq market, Weitek plunged Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 3 3/4 after
the company warned that it would report a loss in the second quarter.
Canada
Toronto closed with a solid gain, buoyed by sharp gains in base metals
shares and strength in the precious metals, transportation and pipelines
sectors.
An analyst said this could mark the kick-off of a short rally, but the
market has not yet shaken off its bearish trend.
The TSE-300 composite index moved ahead 32.9 to 4,208.3 in moderate turnover
of 50.2m shares valued at CDollars 521m.
Copper reached a 14-month high of USDollars 2,195 per tonne on the London
Metals Exchange before retracing, while aluminum hit a 22-month high of
USDollars 1,360 before profit-taking left it at USDollars 1,354, against
Friday's USDollars 1,346 close.

FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil declines 1.4 per cent in slack
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities in Sao Paulo ended 1.4 per cent down after listless trade,
investors having spent most of the day on the sidelines awaiting news on the
Brazilian presidential race and today's meeting of the US Federal Open
Market Committee, Reuter reports.
The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares dipped 233 to 15,626.
Turnover was Cr584bn (Dollars 374m), but brokers said 49 per cent of the
volume was due to the settlement of a special May options series.
On the presidential race, market participants were jittery over the rise of
leftist candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in a recent opinion poll, which
gave him 41 per cent, against 17 per cent for former economy minister
Fernando Henrique Cardoso.

Gold shares finished generally lower as they succumbed late in the day to a
bullion price dip, and other shares tended to soften as an expected pick-up
in foreign demand failed to materialise. The overall index ended 36 down at
5,497, industrials slipped 3 to 6,707 and golds were 39 lower at 1,856.
De Beers dipped R1.50 to R109.25, Anglos shed R2.25 to R232.75 and JCI lost
R2.50 at R92.50. Financial shares reflected slower interest after recent
gains, Firstbank receding R1 to R113.

FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses ground for
first time in five sessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 average lost ground for the first time in five trading days,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was down 82.31 at 20,188.44 after a day's high of 20,397.98 and
low of 20,174.43. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 4.19 at
1,639.01.
Overseas investors placed active buy orders as the yen fell against the
dollar. Expectations of higher interest rates supported the US currency, and
it rose above the Y105 level for the first time since April 11. Arbitrage
buying also helped shares in the morning.
The Nikkei 300 shed 1.08 to 299.67 and losers led gainers by 485 to 489,
with 200 issues unchanged. Volume fell to 280m shares from 414m. Some short
term investors were attracted to small companies. The second section rose
5.15 to a year-to-date high of 2,330.06, while the over-the-counter market
gained 6.92 at 1,853.22.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 3.34 at 1,338.05.
Banks faced profit-taking. Bank of Tokyo retreated Y30 to Y1,620 and
Mitsubishi Bank declined Y40 to Y2,750.
High-technology stocks were mixed, with Hitachi, the day's most active
issue, unchanged at Y995 and Toshiba rising Y4 to Y795. NEC, however, lost
Y10 to Y1,170 and Fujitsu also declined Y10, to Y1,040.
Kureha Chemical Industry moved ahead Y18 to Y593 on reports of the high
effectiveness of its cancer drug. Other drugs companies were also firmer,
with Takeda Chemical up Y10 to Y1,260 and Daiichi Pharmaceutical
appreciating Y20 to Y1,570.
Real estate companies, which were higher last week, relinquished some
ground. Mitsui Fudosan receded Y20 to Y1,280 and Mitsubishi Estate dipped
Y20 to Y1,240.
Individual investors continued to dabble in speculative favourites, with
Brother Industries climbing Y25 to Y719.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 22.26 to 22,424.48 as profit-taking by
institutions eroded earlier gains. Volume was 21.9m shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets were mixed, with many investors awaiting the outcome of
today's meeting of the US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.
HONG KONG continued to find favour with foreign investors and the Hang Seng
index finished 118.69, or 1.3 per cent, higher at 9,253.41, with Japanese
funds leading the advance. Turnover, however, slipped to HKDollars 4bn from
last Friday's total of HKDollars 5bn.
Property issues led the rise as newspaper reports of strong buyer interest
in local housing developments eased concerns over government plans to cool
property prices. Cheung Kong gained HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 39.25, SHK
Properties added 75 cents at HKDollars 49.75 and Henderson was up HKDollars
1.75 at HKDollars 42.25.
SYDNEY was led higher by strength in the resource sector, and the market
closed at its highest level for more than a month.
The All Ordinaries index rose 40.9, or 2 per cent, to 2,110.9 in ADollars
543.5m turnover.
A strong banking sector also assisted sentiment ahead of results from NAB
and Westpac later in the week.
Among resource stocks, BHP leapt 68 cents to ADollars 18.26, CRA jumped 56
cents to ADollars 18.36, Western Mining climbed 38 cents to ADollars 8.08
and MIM rose 8 cents to ADollars 3.31.
SEOUL edged to a lower close as consolidation in blue chips outweighed
renewed interest in companies that are forecast to produce improved business
performances. The composite stock index eased 0.71 to 941.67 in volume that
dipped to 31.1m shares after last week's daily average of 40m.
KUALA LUMPUR ended its quietest session this year broadly lower as investors
adopted a wait-and-see attitude amid lack of fresh local factors.
The composite index closed 6.71 down at 997.84 in volume of 68.9m shares,
against 99.6m on Friday.
SINGAPORE was mixed in sluggish business, with trading volume down at one of
the year's lowest levels, 74.49m shares, as investors ignored a robust
first-quarter gross domestic product growth of 11 per cent.
The Straits Times Industrial index put on 4.29 at 2,290.41.
TAIPEI closed off the day's highs after active trade as food and
construction stocks, which had lagged behind the market's recent rally,
performed well. The weighted index was ahead 22.76 at 6,114.78, after
touch-ing 6,153.24, in turnover of TDollars 71.8bn.
Financials were the only losers, with Business Bank of Taitung down TDollars
3.50 to TDollars 86.50.
MANILA fell for the third consecutive session, although there was an
improvement in the mining index, helped by strength in world copper prices.
WELLINGTON was supported by neighbouring markets and the NZSE-40 capital
index added 20.56 at 2,126.25 in turnover of NZDollars 43m.
Strength in both Fletcher Challenge and Telecom were the features of the
day: Telecom closed 8 cents higher at NZDollars 4.99 and FCL 12 cents ahead
at Dollars 3.92.

FT  17 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses tread warily ahead of
FOMC meeting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe saw some nervousness ahead of today's US meeting of the FOMC, which
is expected to signal a further increase in US interest rates.
Meanwhile, Lehman Brothers yesterday switched to an underweight position in
Italy - previously overweight - in favour of the Netherlands.
In explanation, Lehman's strategist Mr Joe Rooney, said the Italian market
had discounted most of the economic and political changes. 'Italian equities
have only traded at higher levels of valuation once in the past 36 years,
and that was in 1986,' he wrote. 'The market is also vulnerable to a
deterioration in the liquidity situation that has been so supportive over
the past half year.'
He said that the Netherlands, showed good value among European bourses,
supported by forecasts of good earnings and dividend growth.
FRANKFURT's rise to record levels - the DAX index closing at a new record
high during the official session - was masked by low turnover.
The index finished up 12.36 at 2,271.11. Turnover was a slim DM7.3bn.
One of the exceptions to the day's positive tone was Lufthansa, which
weakened DM5.50 to DM201.50, as the airline disappointed investors with news
that shares issued in its rights issue would be priced at a 20 per cent
discount to current prices. The group also forecast a return to profits in
1994.
PARIS could find little to get excited about and the CAC-40 index moved
ahead just 0.70 to 2,187.70 in thin turnover of FFr2bn.
Baring Securities, noting that the CAC-40 has lost some 10 per cent since
the start of the year, suggested that in the short-term further weakness
could be expected.
'However, we take a more optimistic view for the medium term, on the basis
of a stronger than expected economic recovery ..As a result, a fall to the
2,050-2,100 range will be a buy opportunity'.
MILAN was under pressure from a combination of profit-taking after last
week's firm performance, technical end of month trading and political
worries ahead of tomorrow's vote of confidence in the Senate in which Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's administration does not have an overall majority. The
Comit index fell 19.12 or 2.4 per cent to 789.73.
Blue chips, the best performers recently, lost some of their shine.
Ferruzzi, launching a L1,340bn capital increase today fell L124 to L2,135,
and Cir, raising L1,060bn, was L100 lower at L2,888.
Montedison dropped L39 or 2.6 per cent to L1,487: early in the day, the
European Commission expressed serious doubts about whether the plastics
joint venture with Royal Dutch/Shell should go ahead.
Fiat, the market bellwether, lost L188 to L7,039, with strong support seen
at the L7,000 level.
Italcementi lost L556 to L15,854 following the weekend announcement of a net
loss of L126bn in 1993.
Alitalia was L40, or 3.5 per cent, lower at L1,100 after the Transport
Ministry's announcement that the airline must find some L1,500bn that it
needs through a bond issue or an injection of private funds.
ZURICH decided that recent losses had been overdone and the SMI index picked
up 30.3 or 1.1 per cent to 2,709.0.
The recently weak Roche certificates rebounded SFr185 to SFr6,650, while
Nestle was marked SFr10 ahead at SFr1,115. UBS featured among a strong
financial sector rising SFr21 to SFr1,135.
Sandoz's bearer share gained SFr10 to SFr730 following the 5-for-1 stock
split, as the company announced that it had reached agreement with the
Scripps Research Institute of the US to exchange funding for research in
return for the right to develop and market some of the institute's generally
funded medical discoveries.
BRUSSELS traded higher in moderate trade, benefiting from stronger bonds and
hopes of further interest rate cuts. The Bel-20 index rose 4.35 to 1,537.80.
Bekaert, the steel cord and wire maker, picked up BFr825 or 3 per cent to
BFr28,475 on news that it had won a large contract to armour an offshore gas
pipeline in Thailand.
Union Miniere rose BFr65 or 2.5 per cent to BFr2,665 following the surge in
zinc prices at the end of last week.
STOCKHOLM continued higher amid further strong foreign demand for Ericsson
and declining domestic interest rates.
The Affarsvarlden index rose 9.6 to 1,544.8 in healthy turnover of
SKr2.95bn.
Ericsson continued the rally which began in the middle of last week, sparked
by analysts' upgrades of company profit forecasts and recommendations
following the group's first-quarter earnings report. The B shares closed
SKr13 higher at SKr378.
MADRID was lifted by some good first quarter results and the General index
rose 5.17 to 334.20 in the most active trading seen in recent weeks, with
volume of Pta42.5bn.
Sevillana put on Pta17 to Pta704 after its announcement of a 17 per cent
rise in first quarter profit while Telefonica added Pta25 to Pta1,845 in
response to its first quarter figures.
Union Y Fenix fell Pta215 or 11.3 per cent to Pta1,690 as it resumed trading
after Friday's suspension pending publication of the latest valuation of the
insurer which is merging with AGF Seguros.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges wait for Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar traded steadily yesterday ahead of the important meeting today of
the Federal Open Market Committee, which is expected to announce a further
tightening of US monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith.
An aggressive tightening, of 50 basis points in the discount and federal
funds rates, plus a statement that neutrality has been reached, is expected
to support the dollar. Anything less, and there is a danger that the US
currency will weaken again.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6740 from DM1.6671, and Y104.580 against
the yen from Y104.755. In New York it ended at DM1.6732 and Y104.75.
Trading was generally very quiet, with most of the market preferring to
direct its focus towards today's events.
Elsewhere, the Greek drachma was the focus of attention as the Bank of
Greece lifted interest rates to protect the currency from speculative
pressures.
The Bank of England's exchange rate index finished at 80.5, from 80.1 last
Friday.
US economic data released were in line with expectations and had little
impact on the currency. April industrial production rose by 0.3 per cent, as
expected, while capacity utilisation was 83.6 per cent, unchanged from
March.
Analysts are fairly evenly divided about whether the Fed will raise the
federal funds rate, currently 3.7 per cent, by 25 or 50 basis points. The
three tightenings so far this year, commencing on February 4, were all by 25
basis points.
Many analysts contend that recent weakness in currency and bond markets,
which have fed off each other, results from this gradual tightening process.
This, it is argued, unsettles markets because the continual spectre of a
further monetary tightening acts as a disincentive for new investors to
enter the market.
But the argument for a short, sharp shock, convincing the market that policy
neutrality had been achieved, lost some of its force with the release of
good inflation data. Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global
Markets, said that with this backdrop 'there would probably be little
surprise if the Fed continued its gradualist approach and raised the funds
target by only 25 basis points to 4 per cent'.
In a note to customers yesterday, JP Morgan, the US investment bank, pointed
out that there were also political and tactical reasons to follow this
course. 'An aggressive rate hike on the heels of a report suggesting stable
to slightly declining consumer price inflation will surely draw attacks from
Fed critics in congress,' the report noted.
Whatever the Fed chooses to do, it is not yet clear that the worst is over
for the dollar. Although the spectre of intervention remains, Mr Austin
noted: 'The reduction in speculative capital committed to markets following
the collapse in bonds earlier this year has reduced one area of support for
the dollar, and the longer term capital and current account flows are still
negative.'
The support for sterling is related to the death last week of Mr John Smith,
the UK Labour party leader. By drawing attention away from the troubles of
the Conservative party and the prime minister, his death is seen as having
contributed to greater political stability in the short term.
This change in the political landscape has been supplemented by the view
that, compared to Germany, interest rate differentials appear increasingly
to be moving in the UK's favour.
The pound ended in London at DM2.5174, more than 1 1/2 pfennigs above
Friday's close of DM2.5012. It was also higher against the US dollar,
finishing at Dollars 1.5039 from Dollars 1.5004.
In Europe, attention focused on Greece, where banks lifted interest rates
sharply to protect the drachma. The National Bank of Greece - the largest
state bank - raised short-term deposit rates to 35-45 per cent, from 23 per
cent last Friday. Other short-term rates were also lifted.
The currency came under speculative attack last week when the announcement
that the country was lifting remaining capital controls on July 1 prompted a
sell-off of the currency, in anticipation of a likely devaluation as capital
left the country.
The central bank's measures appeared to have achieved some success, with
traders reporting quiet conditions and little pressure on the currency.
Yesterday afternoon the drachma was being quoted at 148.10/20 after being
fixed at Dr148, compared to the previous fix of Dr147.70.
Elsewhere, the D-Mark's performance was mixed. It was unchanged at FFr3.429
against the French franc, but stronger, at L961.5 from L957.2, against the
Italian lira.
The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 615m of
assistance after forecasting a Pounds 600m shortage. The overnight rate
moved in the 3 to 5 per cent range.
In Germany, call money eased to 5.40/50 per cent, from 5.45/55 per cent on
Friday, ahead of this week's repo. The futures markets were 'listless', in
the words of one participant.

There was good general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Bright
liquoring and brighter medium east Africans met strong competition and often
gained several pence. Plainer mediums and poorest Africans were generally
easier. Selected brighter Ceylons were firm, but thinner; plainer sorts were
lower. Strong demand for the larger quantity on offer. Brighter Ceylons and
Zimbabwes were generally dearer but plain Ceylons were irregular and
sometimes easier. Malawis found little support. Prices: best220p/kg, good

FT  17 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investment drought threatens
platinum metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lack of capital for investment and even for maintenance is threatening to
hit production of platinum group metals - essential in many industrial
catalysts - in the two biggest producing countries, South Africa and Russia.
According to Johnson Matthey, the biggest marketing group in the business,
as far as South African producers are concerned platinum prices are not so
much of a cause for concern as the collapse in the price of rhodium, mainly
used in automotive anti-pollution catalysts.
Car makers became very wary about being too dependent of supplies of rhodium
after the price of the metal jumped to an unprecedented Dollars 7,000 a troy
ounce in 1990, when the market was squeezed by a combination of teething
troubles at a new Rustenburg refinery in South Africa and a sharp increase
in demand from the automotive industry because of tightening international
anti-pollution legislation.
By making changes in their use of rhodium and running down stocks, car
makers, particularly the Japanese, have been instrumental in pushing the
rhodium price below Dollars 600 an ounce.
In its latest annual market survey, Johnson Matthey suggests: 'We do not
foresee any significant deterioration in the (rhodium) price but neither are
we confident that it will exceed Dollars 1,000 before the end of 1994.'
JM points out that operating margins at the two biggest South African
producers, Impala and Rustenburg, fell from 94 per cent in 1989 to 26 per
cent in the financial year to June, 1993, because of falling revenues and
increasing costs.
'All the (South African) mining companies have been forced to re-evaluate
their spending plans; between 1990 and 1993 several mining operations were
mothballed or closed, while a number of planned expansion projects have been
shelved. The focus is now on containing costs and improving efficiencies.
'Continued cuts in capital expenditure could eventually threaten output if
investment drops below the threshold necessary to maintain the mining
infrastructure,' the survey points out.
There also remains the possibility that the Dollars 494m Northam mine,
controlled by Gold Fields of South Africa, will be forced into closure,
Johnson Matthey suggests. Not only has Northam, the world's deepest platinum
mine, been battling low prices but serious mining difficulties cut predicted
output by half last year and it incurred substantial operating losses.
Meanwhile, in Russia most platinum comes from Norilsk, one of the
federation's new joint stock companies. Mr Michael Steel, JM's market
research director, says that Norilsk's nickel production was reported to
have dropped by 45 per cent last year and he believes the fall in platinum
metals output was even greater.
Norilsk's plant, built in the 1940s, has suffered years of neglect and this
resulted in at least one major accident - in in October 1993 one of the
furnaces in the original nickel smelter split and molten metal was spilled,
causing a fire that burned for more than eight hours.
There were also reports that there had been a separate incident in which a
roof at the plant collapsed.
More evidence of the plant's decay came early this year when a strong wind
destroyed an emissions stack and the debris fell on top of a pedestrian
gallery through which supply lines ran.
'The funds for essential maintenance, let alone for further development of
the mining and processing facilities at Norilsk, are unlikely to come from
the hard-pressed Russian government. Future investment is therefore largely
dependent on the success of the limited privatisation scheme currently under
way,' says Johnson Matthey. There is little short-term prospect of
substantial western investment in the plant.
Despite the clouds over the medium-term production outlook, South Africa's
previous expansion programmes, mainly to cope with expected increased use by
the car industry, created a substantial platinum supply surplus last year:
one of 340,000 ounces compared with a surplus of 20,000 ounces in 1992.
Johnson Matthey says that demand for platinum rose by 6.3 per cent to 4.04m
ounces, matching the record set in 1991, while supply jumped by 15 per cent
to a record 4.38m ounces.
Mr Steel said that the surplus was likely to be eliminated this year because
the surge in South African supplies was over.
Consequently, Johnson Matthey expects the average platinum price this year
to be above Dollars 400 a troy ounce, up from a 1993 average of Dollars
374.06, itself 6 per cent higher than in 1992, 'with a maximum of Dollars
430 if no serious (political) unrest occurs in South Africa.' Advancing
demand and continued speculative activity 'should give solid support at
about Dollars 380'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese state gold purchases
still lagging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's official gold purchase continued to falter in the first quarter in
spite of increased output, according to the Gold Bureau of the Ministry of
Metallurgical Industry.
The bureau reported that output in the three months to March grew by 17 per
cent compared with last year, but state acquisitions remained at last year's
depressed levels, which were down 35 per cent on 1992.
Gold producers are obliged to sell to the state, but in the past year or so
have been funnelling gold into the black market at prices well above the
state purchase price. The state increased its acquisition price last
September to Yn2,986 (USDollars 343) a troy ounce, about 10 per cent below
the world price.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures break through
Dollars 2,000 barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures prices in London and New York continued their exponential
rise yesterday, helped by signs there might be fresh interest from
investment funds and speculative buyers.
The July robusta futures contract surged through Dollars 2,000 a tonne to a
new five-year high. It closed at Dollars 2,052, up Dollars 95 on the day,
although profit-taking had trimmed it back from the peak of Dollars 2,065
reached after a strong opening in New York.
The second position arabica contract in New York was up 11.1 cents at 126.8
cents a pound in afternoon trading.
Bullish sentiment was fuelled by the fortnightly US report on traders'
commitments, published on Friday, which showed speculators and funds had
bought less in the last two weeks than believed. 'It indicated there was
more potential for the funds and specs to come in,' said one trader.
'We're looking at an old-fashioned physical squeeze,' said Mr Lawrence
Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London broker. 'Roasters and traders haven't
needed to hold security stocks until now and suddenly they've found there
isn't enough coffee around.'
He said some 3m bags of coffee were available in New York warehouses but
those holding on to the stocks were waiting for prices to go further. But he
warned that the market had reached 'ridiculous' levels, 'considering that
the outcome of the 1994-95 season is still uncertain'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Corrections trim base metals gains
 -Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bull-run in base metals prices continued at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday, although some necessary downward reactions were taking place,
dealers said.
COPPER faltered near the Dollars 2,200-a-tonne level for three months
delivery, which has assumed psychological importance, and, after peaking at
a fresh 14-month high of Dollars 2,195, settled back below Dollars 2,180.
NICKEL trading was again hectic and volatile, with the three months price
coming within a whisker of Dollars 6,600 a tonne in the morning, before an
overdue technical correction set in. From a high of Dollars 6,590, the price
plunged to Dollars 6,350 before ending at Dollars 6,450, up Dollars 50 on
balance.
Although the threat of disruption to Falconbridge supplies from Norway had
been removed by the calling off of the dock workers' strike, the nickel
market was still nervous about a strike at Inco's Sudbury facilities,
traders said.
TIN prices broke higher in after hours 'kerb' trading following the
confirmation of bullish chart signals above Dollars 5,600 a tonne. With the
market emerging as the latest beneficiary of speculative interest, the three
months price ended at Dollars 5,725, up Dollars 145.
ZINC extended its gains on the kerb, with the triggering of stop-loss buying
orders stops running three months metal up to a new high of Dollars 1,011 a
tonne, despite the absence constructive fundamentals. Although mine output
of zinc fell steeply in the first quarter of the year, according to latest
International Lead and Zinc Study Group data, refined production is rising,
and stocks are increasing.
Three months ALUMINIUM hit a 22-month high of Dollars 1,360 a tonne, but
proved unable to push up towards the Dollars 1,373 chart objective, and
closed at Dollars 1,352, an Dollars 8 gain.
London's precious metals continued quiet in the afternoon after the US
markets opened with little direction being offered except in SILVER, which
came under pressure and closed 7 cents down at Dollars 5.35 1/2 a troy
ounce.
The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market remained dull throughout the day.
Buying in New York arrested the slide in the afternoon but trading remained
technically-dominated.
The July futures position opened Pounds 4 down at Pounds 953 a tonne before
sinking to Pounds 941. But the steadier-than-expected New York opening lent
support and some of the losses were recouped by late afternoon. July closed
at Pounds 951.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nutmeg exporters in fresh
effort to stabilise market
</HEADLINE>

Nutmeg exporters in the two main producing countries have agreed on a plan
to stabilise and then to increase world market prices for the spice, but
have steered clear of recreating the cartel that collapsed six years ago.
The agreement follows discussions between the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg
Association and 35 of the leading exporters in Indonesia, according to
Grenadian officials. Indonesia produces about 75 per cent of the world's
nutmeg, with the eastern Caribbean island having a 23 per cent share.
'We must have some type of continuing dialogue with Indonesia because we
feel that Grenada can compete successfully on the international market once
we do not have Indonesia dumping their nutmeg on the market at very low
prices,' said Mr Cliff Robertson, chairman of the Grenadian association. The
recreation of the cartel, he said, would 'not be in Grenada's interest'.
Industry officials said that, while not setting prices, the two producer
groups would co-operate in monitoring the volume of nutmeg that was offered
for sale on the world market.
They were not expected to take the more radical step of destroying stocks
and the anticipated improvement in prices would be gradual, the officials
added.
The new agreement has come after two years of discussions following a slump
in prices. The fall has affected Grenada more as the island's economy is
more heavily dependent on the spice than Indonesia's.
Producers in the two countries would try to keep supplies to the world
market at about 9,500 tonnes a year, marginally less than current world
demand and 2,500 tonnes less than their current combined production, the
industry sources said.
When the cartel was established the Grenadian association and Aspin, the
Indonesian producers' group, agreed minimum prices for premium and lower
grade nutmeg that were about four times higher than the going price of
Dollars 1,000.
The cartel collapsed following changes in the Indonesian government's
economic policy, which saw extensive deregulation. Aspin was deprived of the
power to set prices and control supplies to the market and, much to the
dismay of the Grenadians, increased Indonesian shipments pushed prices back
to pre-cartel levels.
Indonesian producers had now agreed with the Grenadians that an increase in
the price of nutmeg was needed, said Mr Robertson. 'We agreed that the
dialogue should be ongoing and we will meet again at the end of the year to
discuss the progress of the market and see how best we can stabilise
prices.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries start the week with solid
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US government securities opened a week in which the Federal Reserve is
expected to raise interest rates again with solid gains yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 85,
yielding 7.452 per cent. Prices were only slightly firmer at the short end
of the market, where the two-year bond was up  1/16 at 99 3/32 , to yield
5.980 per cent.
Prices firmed gradually after the start of trading in New York, but dealers
struggled to explain why the market opened in such an upbeat mood. The
morning's economic statistics, showing a 0.3 per cent rise in April
industrial production, were in line with expectations, and some analysts
suggested prices climbed after the figures were released because the market
was relieved that there were no nasty surprises in the data.
Otherwise, trading was described as very light, with many participants
choosing to remain on the sidelines until after today's meeting of the Fed's
open market committee. Expectations are high that the FOMC will sanction an
interest rate increase at the meeting.
Supported by firmer US bonds, most European markets posted moderate gains in
quiet trading as dealers awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting.
German government bonds led the advance, with the 10-year sector gaining
about  1/2 point on shifts to the longer end of the yield curve.
The German yield curve has steepened sharply in recent weeks, with the
spread between two-year and 10-year yields widening to around 125 basis
points, from 80 basis points about a month ago.
However, after the Bundesbank's  1/2 point cut in its discount and Lombard
rates last week, many analysts are re-commending curve-flattening trades,
suggesting that investors sell short-dated paper and move into long-dated
bonds.
Last week's rate cut 'is likely to be the last official move until after the
summer recess', said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist with market
analysts IDEA.
Although the weekly repo rate can edge some 50 basis points lower over that
period, he feels this is largely discounted in forward rates. At the long
end, he said, bunds are resisting further selling pressure and with US
Treasuries also showing signs of resilience, 'a decisive (tightening) move
by the Fed this week could spark a substantial corrective rally through
European bond markets'.
'Since shortening trades are quite widely owned now and the inflation
outlook is going to be very positive, I think moving longer in Germany and
other continental European markets could be rewarding over the next three
months or so,' agreed Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at S.
G. Warburg Securities.
The June Bund futures contract stood at 95.93 in late trading, up 0.66
points on the day and near its 95.95 high.
French government bonds followed German bunds higher, with the June notional
bond future on Matif rising 0.57 points to 94.58.
Trade in UK government bonds was subdued as participants turned their
attention to the implications of Friday's announcement of a short-dated
convertible gilt issue and the FOMC meeting.
'Attention all day has been directed towards working out what the
convertible announcement means and as a result performance has not been
dramatic,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities.
Details of the size and maturity of the issue, which will be auctioned on
May 25, are due to be published by the Bank of England at 3.30pm.
But Mr Briscoe said that yesterday's data showing low UK producer price
inflation helped the market hold on to the gains it made on Friday after the
announcement of the issue. Producer output prices in April registered their
lowest annual increase since December 1986.
'This is very good news,' said Mr Briscoe. 'There are clearly few signs of
inflationary pressures in the economy.'
He said that other UK data due this week, including retail price inflation
and retail sales, will be important for evidence of a strengthening recovery
and of inflationary pressures.
The June long gilt futures contract on Liffe traded at 105 1/32 by late
afternoon, down  3/32 points from Friday's close.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the Indian energy group, plans a public
issue of equity to raise Rs15bn (Dollars 478m). The issue will be launched
in the next two months, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Mr S. K. Manglik, ONGC's chairman, said the flotation was part of a
government plan to dilute its holding in the corporation through selling
equity to the Indian public. He said the issue would be followed within four
to five months by a Euro-issue.
Mr Satish Sharma, India's oil minister, said the corporation had an offer
for a joint venture with the Economic Development Board of Singapore. He
said discussions with the EDB were in their early stages.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: IFC puts Dollars 15m into
Latin America fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the
World Bank, has invested Dollars 15m in a new Latin American corporate bond
fund which it helped to set up.
A number of US pension funds and European institutions have also put money
into the Dublin-listed fund, bringing total investment to Dollars 80m, said
Mr Marc Wenhammar, head of fixed-income at Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging
Markets, the advisers to the closed-end fund.
Mr Wenhammar said that the fund's first gains would come from the higher
income which the dollar-denominated bonds would provide but that its
medium-term aim was to make capital gains from a reduction in yield spreads
on the bonds. He said that it also wanted to take advantage of secondary
market disparities.
The fund was launched in April in the aftermath of a sell-off in emerging
market bonds triggered by a tightening in US interest rates in February. Mr
Wenhammar noted that yield spreads on Mexican corporate bonds had come close
to 400 basis points over US Treasuries but that they had since narrowed to
around 270 basis points.
About 70 per cent of the fund has already been invested, with just under
half going into Mexican corporate paper while Argentine and Brazilian debt
account for 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.
Mr Wenhammar said the fund's initial investments have been in liquid
corporate issues but that at a later stage it hoped to buy convertible
bonds.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Finland opts for French franc sector
with 10-year offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Finland's FFr6bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds dominated an
enlivened session in the Eurobond primary market yesterday.
The issue was priced to yield 32 basis points above the 5.5 per cent French
government bond which expires in 2004. Some dealers said the pricing was too
tight, and when trading began the spread widened to around 36 basis points.
They argued that Finland had paid 11 to 15 basis points over Libor for the
funds, which are being kept in French francs, and the borrower could have
achieved better terms by issuing in another currency, such as yen or
dollars, and swapping into French francs.
However, lead manager Paribas said that swap spreads are very tight and such
arbitrage opportunities are virtually non-existent.
Mr Veikko Kantola, Finland's director of finance, said he had considered
various European currencies but opted for the Euro-French franc sector as it
looked the most attractive after last week's flurry of European interest
rate cuts.
He added that the pricing of yesterday's issue showed that Finland's
standing in the market was continuing to improve. 'The last (French) franc
deal nearly two years ago carried a 41-point spread,' he said.
According to Mr Kantola, Finland is expected to raise the equivalent of
Dollars 7bn this year because of the recovery in the country's economy. This
compares with Dollars 11.5bn in 1992 and Dollars 8.5bn last year.
Demand for the bonds came mainly from French insurers and European central
banks, Paribas said. SNCF, the French state railway company, is expected to
launch an offering of FFr2bn to FFr3bn later this week.
The dollar was in vogue as GECC, the financing arm of General Electric,
issued a Dollars 250m three-year bond priced to yield 10 basis points over
US Treasuries. The deal was closely followed by a similar self-led offering
from Swiss Bank Corporation. The two issues continued a trend established a
month ago by AT&amp;T, the US telecoms giant, and further deals are expected
this week.
Dealers said yesterday's offerings reflected growing demand for short-dated
Eurodollar paper from European retail investors who believe that a further
half-point rise in the Federal funds rate has been discounted.
SEK, the Swedish export agency, raised a total of Y45bn through two
three-year offerings. It is believed to have swapped the proceeds of a Y35bn
issue into dollars, achieving a deep sub-Libor funding cost in the process.
Joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said Japanese and European investors
continued to have a big appetite for yen assets, attracted by the stability
in the Japanese bond market and hopes of an appreciation in the yen. More
issuers are expected to tap the Euroyen sector this week.
Eurofima, the Swiss-based rolling-stock financing organisation, provided a
new variation in the recent spate of callable Eurolira bonds. It raised
L300bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds callable at par after seven
years. Joint lead manager Banca Nazionale del Lavoro said that in contrast
to recent issues, which were mainly sold to Italian investors, 40 per cent
of Eurofima's bonds were placed outside Italy.

The ADRs, each of which represents one share, will trade on the US
over-the-counter market. Citibank NA will act as the depositary and market
maker.
Repola's activities range from pulp and paper to engineering.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan to take Dollars 200m
profit on sale
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. Morgan is to take a profit of more than Dollars 200m from the sale of
part of its stake in Columbia/HCA, the US's biggest private hospital group.
Morgan said it intended to sell 6m shares in the group, out of a total of
21.1m that it owns. At yesterday's closing price of Dollars 36 1/2 - down
Dollars 1 1/2 - the sale would raise Dollars 220m, a pre-tax profit of about
Dollars 205m.
The 1989 buy-out of Nashville-based HCA, then an independent company, is the
most successful merchant banking deal undertaken by the US bank. Morgan paid
about Dollars 50m for a stake which at yesterday's price was worth Dollars
770m.
HCA was taken public again in 1992 at Dollars 21.50 a share and last year
agreed to an all-stock takeover by Kentucky-based Columbia, which valued it
at about Dollars 32 a share.
The sale seems likely to be followed by a rapid disposal of Morgan's
remaining stake in the hospital group.
The bank declined to say whether sales were planned, but added: 'Like any
investment in that (venture capital) portfolio, it has a life cycle.'
Most buy-out investors hope to liquidate their holdings and realise profits
within five years or so of making an investment.
The HCA stake accounted for about two thirds of the Dollars 1bn of
unrealised investment gains reported by Morgan at the end of last year.
During 1993, it realised profits of Dollars 246m from selling equity
holdings, Dollars 86m of it related to HCA.

European economic and finance ministers yesterday agreed to simplify listing
requirements for the shares of European Union companies that wish to be
listed on the stock exchanges of other member states.
The directive will significantly lower the cost to companies of cross-border
listing by allowing some of the information previously required for listing,
to be partially or fully waived by the relevant authorities in the host
country.
In future certain companies will be able to be listed in other member states
without publishing a new listing prospectus.
The move applies mainly to companies of 'high quality, large size and
international standing, listed in the Community for at least three years and
showing a good record of compliance with European Union listing directives',
according to the European Commission.
The move fell short of complete mutual recognition by the stock exchanges of
the 12 member states but was, according to the London Stock Exchange, a
'significant step towards mutual recognition and very useful for smaller
companies wishing to move to full listing'.
The Commission said the directive was expected to bring about a more
efficient simple market in securities. In particular, it would assist
efforts by the Federation of European Stock Exchanges to launch the
so-called Eurolist project.
This aims to provide deeper and more liquid markets for well established
European Union companies with international standing by listing their shares
simultaneously in at least six member states.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sandoz scales back research pact
</HEADLINE>

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sandoz and The Scripps Research Institute of California have scaled back an
ambitious joint research pact following complaints that the Swiss
pharmaceuticals group would corner the output of a large publicly-financed
US institute.
The original agreement, announced in December 1992, gave Sandoz first rights
to all Scripps medical discoveries in return for Dollars 300m in
contributions to the institute over a 10-year period.
The revised agreement, announced yesterday, gives Sandoz first rights to
only 47 per cent of Scripps's discoveries in return for Dollars 100m in
contributions over five years starting in 1997, with an option for a further
five years.
Sandoz has also agreed to give up its casting vote on a Scripps committee
that selects research projects and reduced its planned representation on the
Scripps board from two to one.
The original deal drew strong criticism from the US National Institutes of
Health (NIH), which provides Dollars 70m of Scripps's Dollars 120m annual
research budget.
Ms Bernadine Healy, NIH director, told a congressional subcommittee on
regulation, business opportunities and technology last June that the
agreement 'would give Sandoz excessive control over Scripps.'
It was, she said, 'an aberration, and in my view, a dangerous exception to
an otherwise successful record of co-operation between industry and
NIH-funded institutions.'
Mr Ron Wyden, the subcommittee chairman, said the deal amounted to 'a
corporate takeover of one of our biomedical research crown jewels'.
The revised agreement explicitly acknowledges Scripps's independence. Mr Urs
Barlocher, chief executive of Sandoz Pharma, said yesterday the group's
lawyers had perhaps been too rigorous in drafting the original agreement.
'It is in our interest that Scripps be independent,' he added.
Mr Barlocher noted that publicly-funded research bodies were supposed to
help small businesses get access to new technologies, but it looked in this
case as if the small businesses were being squeezed out.
He said Sandoz would still have the right to look at all of Scripps's
discoveries and could select any 47 per cent it wanted. As originally
planned, Sandoz would send several researchers to work at Scripps. 'There
have never been bad feelings on either side, and we have been able to
maintain the spirit of the agreement,' he said.
He was pleased the US authorities had accepted the principle that technology
developed at a publicly-financed research institute could be transferred to
any interested company, including one that was foreign controlled.

<TEXT>
Toys R Us, the US toy store chain, reported a modest 6 per cent rise in
profits in the first quarter to April. The group said it had been held back
by poor demand in overseas markets and the cost of international expansion.
Group sales increased by 14 per cent to Dollars 1.46bn, helped by the
company's rapid expansion in the US and overseas.
However, with costs sharply higher because of the expenditure of opening
stores, net income rose by just Dollars 2.1m to Dollars 37.6.
Earnings per share, helped by the Dollars 1bn share repurchase programme
announced in January, rose to 13 cents from 12 cents.
Toys R Us said its international operations had lost money in the first
quarter, but it expected them to produce operating income of Dollars 150m
for the full year, compared with Dollars 103m last year.
One factor hitting overseas sales was continuing weakness in the European
and Japanese economies.
The company also suffered from poor demand for video games. It said this was
because there were no 'hot' titles around and because many people were
waiting for the next generation of 32-bit machines to appear.
Overall, international stores that had been open a year or more suffered a
downturn in sales.
However, comparable store sales in the US rose by 6.6 per cent, with some
strong increases in sales of basic toy merchandise.

Seven-Eleven Japan, the leading Japanese convenience store chain, will join
forces with Philip Morris, the US foods and tobacco group, to develop
processed foods and canned beer for the Japanese and American markets.
The move will provide the retailing group with low-priced beer and food
products and give Philip Morris increased access to the Japanese market and
US convenience stores.
Japanese retailers are trying to lower product costs by tying up with
manufacturers and by-passing wholesalers.
Seven-Eleven and Miller Brewing, Philip Morris's brewing subsidiary, will
launch a low-priced beer in Japan in June. The product will be sold later in
the US. The price of the beer will be 20 per cent lower than the retail
price of the canned beers produced by the four leading Japanese breweries.
The retailer, which owns Southland, the Seven-Eleven operator in the US, is
also teaming with Kraft General Foods, a Philip Morris foods subsidiary. The
two companies have been test marketing chilled sandwiches in Texas, and
Seven-Eleven plans to sell Kraft products, such as cheese and coffee, in
Japan.

Philips Consumer Electronics, a division of the Dutch electronics group,
Zenith Electronics, the US television and electronics manufacturer and
Compression Labs, a specialist in video conferencing technology, are
combining their efforts to develop and market technology for interactive
television services.
Under the agreement, they will jointly develop and market TV set-top-boxes
for both digital and analogue networks.
These devices will enable cable television and telecommunications network
operators to deliver a wide range of programming options, such as
video-on-demand, video games, home shopping and other video services with
two-way interactive communications.
The companies plan to combine digital and analogue television standards to
create set-top-boxes capable of receiving today's analogue signals as well
as future digital transmissions.
The agreement comes as several network providers are selecting the equipment
they will use to provide interactive entertainment and information services
to the home.
The company said its global engineering, marketing, manufacturing and
support infrastructures, with those of Zenith and Compression Labs, made a
group that understood what consumers needed.

Mexican broadcast group

   LONDON, MEXICO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NBC, the US network broad-caster, has agreed a partnership with Television
Azteca, the recently privatised Mexican broadcaster.
The US group also has an option to take a stake of between 10 per cent and
20 per cent in the Mexican company.
The deal is the latest example of NBC's globalisation strategy - taking
stakes or forming alliances around the world rather than simply selling
individual programmes.
Last year, NBC acquired Super Channel, the European satellite channel, and
last month announced it would be transmitting by satellite into Asia.
Initially, the deal with Television Azteca will involve NBC helping with
everything from on-air promotions, programme scheduling and technology, to
advertising sales and station management.
Television Azteca, with its two channels, is challenging the four-channel
dominance of Televisa, South America's leading broadcasting group.
Mr Tom Rogers, head of NBC Cable and an executive vice-president of NBC,
said yesterday that the deal fitted NBC's globalisation strategy, and he saw
potential for growth in the Mexican market.
Mr Richard Salinas, whose family owns the Elektra Group, a consumer
electronics consortium, bought the two networks last July. Channel 7,
available in Mexico City, is largely made up of US programmes and aimed at
the young. Channel 13, a national channel, specialises in comedy, soap
operas, news and sport.
The value of Azteca, partly influenced by the NBC deal, is estimated to have
risen from about Dollars 650m last year to closer to Dollars 1.2bn.
Azteca will be able to offer programmes from NBC and Canal de Noticias, the
company's 24-hour-a-day Spanish-language news service, and CNBC, the US
company's specialty cable service, as well as locally produced programmes.
NBC is making more effort to expand internationally than the main three
established US networks - partly because it sees the network business in the
US as an increasingly mature business.
Mr Salinas said yesterday: 'NBC's name, image, management expertise and
relationships will provide a unique opportunity to enhance the value of
Television Azteca.'

Under the new structure, Mr Leo Thomas will remain president of Kodak
Imaging Group with Mr Richard Bourns joining him in the general management
of Imaging as executive vice president of the group.
Mr Bourns is now a senior vice president with responsibility for Kodak
manufacturing operations.
Both will have full responsibility across the group, Kodak said.
Mr Wilbur J. Prezzano, who remains president of Kodak's Health Group, is
spearheading the company's effort to divest its non-imaging health

<TEXT>
Sony Music Entertainment, the 71 per cent-owned entertainment subsidiary of
the Sony electronics group, yesterday unveiled a fall in profits and its
first annual sales decline for nine years.
Pre-tax profits fell 11.7 per cent to Y19.84bn (Dollars 189.4m) on sales
down 1.2 per cent to Y99.6bn. This was a result of lack of hits by Japanese
musicians, said Mr Kazutoshi Shiraishi, Sony Music Entertainment's managing
director.
The poor performance of domestic music was only partially offset by
increased sales of discs by Billy Joel, experiencing a revival in Japan, and
other foreign stars.
Net profits rose 0.6 per cent to Y12.01bn, due to a temporary drop in
corporate tax payments, but will shrink again to an expected Y9.7bn this
year as the tax bill rises, said Mr Shiraishi. He expects a revival in sales
of Japanese music discs, but not in foreign discs or video-cassettes. On
these grounds, he forecast pre-tax profits to fall this year to Y18.5bn, on
sales of Y99.3bn.
The annual divided has been increased to Y25 per share from Y22.5. Earnings
per share fell from Y133.36 to Y116.62 last year, due to dilution caused by
a share issue.

United Communication Industry (Ucom), the diversified Thai
telecommunications group whose parent company is 25 per cent owned by
Motorola of the US, yesterday announced almost doubled net profits for the
first quarter of this year to Bt416.6m (Dollars 16.5m) from Bt209.4m
previously.
Ucom, one of several Thai companies profiting from a rapid expansion of
telecommunications business in south-east Asia, was listed on the Stock
Exchange of Thailand five months ago. Earnings per share were Bt3.56,
against Bt10.47 because of the issue of new stock.
The quarterly profit 6m compares with the Bt713m made in 1993. Further
financial details were not immediately available.
Samart, a smaller communications company, reported a near quadrupling of net
profit in the first quarter to Bt46.62m from Bt11.92m. Earnings per share
rose to Bt1.04 from Bt0.75.
Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, reported weaker profits in the first
quarter, with net earnings slipping 4.3 per cent to Bt3.55bn. The bank
explained that the comparable quarter of 1993 included an exceptional gain
of Bt1.5bn.
Other big banks reported increased profits. Thai Farmers Bank said net
profit rose 34.7 per cent to Bt2.11bn, while Krung Thai Bank announced a 25
per cent rise to Bt1.71bn.

not be underwritten.
Of the funds raised, Dollars 146m will be earmarked for Mantos Blancos'
Santa Barbara/SX-EW project, which will expand the company's total copper
reserves to 116m tonnes from 53m tonnes and extend the life of mine to the

The remainder will go to the Mantoverde copper project.

cent stake in Minera Autlan, a Mexican manganese ore miner and ferro alloy
smelter.
Autlan is based in Mexico City, and its local operations have the capacity
to produce more than 500,000 tonnes of ore and up to 200,000 tonnes of ferro
alloys per year.
No purchase price was given for the GFM stake, but BHP described the deal as
a 'strategic alliance' which would back up a five-year ore sales contract to
Autlan. During this period, BHP Manganese will supply all of Autlan's
imported manganese ore needs.
BHP said this could be up to 80,000 tonnes a year.

Interest both from foreign direct and portfolio investors in Peruvian assets
continues to be significant in spite of recent setbacks.
Lima's stock market has held up well, in spite of rises in US interest rates
which have dented the enthusiasm of stock and bond investors for Latin
American markets.
However, after a successful telephone company privatisation in February, the
government failed in its attempt last week to sell the mining and refining
giant, Centromin.
The sale in February of Peru's two state-controlled telecommunications
companies, CPT and Entel, to Telefonica of Spain yielded more than USDollars
2bn - well above most expectations and setting a pace which may have been
impossible to match.
However, the inability to sell Centromin at the first attempt is not being
seen by foreign bankers as a body-blow to Peru's privatisation plans.
Interest in the country's mining sector remains high - some 800 people are
attending a three-day gold mining conference in Lima. The auction's failure
was, it is said, more a reflection of the mining company's specific
problems, in particular its possible future environmental liabilities.
Still to be sold in the next few months are a series of fishmeal plants
owned by Pescaperu; the distribution and generation systems of Electrolima
and Electroperu; and Interbanc, the first of two state-owned banks to come
to market. The privatisation list also includes cement producers Lima and
Norte Pacasmayo, and the Cajarmaquilla zinc smelter and refinery
Mr Efrain Goldenberg, the Peruvian prime minister, said the government
expected to raise more than Dollars 3bn this year from its privatisation
programme - and noted some private estimates are even higher.
The sale of the telephone companies was an indication of the distance Peru
has come since President Alberto Fujimori came to power in 1990, Mr
Goldenberg said in an interview in London. 'Ten years ago you couldn't have
given these companies away.'
Part of the success was due, he said, to expectations of growth. 'Our
economy grew last year by 7 per cent. The official forecast for this year is
5 per cent, but we are pretty sure it will be more than that.' GDP in the
first quarter is reported to have been 8 1/2 per cent higher than a year
earlier.
Investors in general may have been further heartened by rises in the prices
of some raw materials.
'With the world economic cycle becoming more favourably disposed towards the
providers of raw materials, and with corporate profits rising at 30 per cent
per annum, the expectation has to be that the stock market in Lima will
continue to do better than most,' said investment strategist Mr Roger
Nightingale of London-based LatInvest Securities.
This year has also seen Peruvian companies raise foreign finance for the
first time in decades - although the environment has become more difficult
in recent months. In mid-March, Peru's Gloria group, in association with
VestcorPartners, a Miami investment bank, launched a Dollars 40m Eurobond
issue - the first from Peru in more than 20 years.
A privately-owned telecommunications company, Tele 2000, notched up another
first - a Dollars 40m issue of convertible three-year Euronotes through
Barings Securities and Bankers Trust - even though it paid a higher interest
rate than originally expected.
Bankers Trust, in a joint venture with stockbrokers Peruval, is also
co-ordinating the first fully-fledged American depositary receipt placement
of shares in a Peruvian company. The state has agreed to offer its 38 per
cent holding in Cementos Lima simultaneously on the stock exchanges of Lima
and New York. No date for the issue has yet been set.
At the same time, Peruvian companies are seeing growing opportunities for
financing themselves domestically - through the growth of private pension
funds, or AFPs.
Launched in June last year, the AFPs have signed up more than 800,000
salaried workers out of an initial target group of 1.2m who are expected to
switch from the moribund pension scheme provided by Peru's social security
institute (IPSS).
Eight companies are vying for the pension funds market - almost all have
international backers, including Aetna, Citibank, ING Bank of the
Netherlands as well as Chilean counterpart funds like Provida, Habitat and
Cruz Blanca.
The total fund size is small, around an estimated Dollars 95m. But once the
state starts meeting its contributions for public sector workers, around
Dollars 25m a month, money will be flowing into the AFP coffers, amounting
to some Dollars 300m by the end of the year and a possible total fund of
Dollars 4bn within five years.
'Peru has had the advantage of not being the first-comer,' says Mr Carlos
Bolona, economy minister from 1991 to 1993 and architect of the structural
reform programme. 'We did in two years what took six in Chile, and we've
gone further in many reforms than Chile or Bolivia.'

<TEXT>
Sandvik, the Swedish cemented carbide and speciality steel group, said
yesterday it expected a 'significant' improvement in its 1994 result after
lifting first-quarter profits by 29 per cent.
Like other Swedish exporters, the group is benefiting from a weak currency
and cost-cutting, assisted by recovering demand in many important markets
and the improved business climate in Europe.
Profits after financial items for the quarter rose to SKr626m (Dollars
80.8m) from SKr486m as sales expanded to SKr5.79bn from SKr5.3bn. The group
said six percentage points of the 10 per cent sales rise was due to price
and volume increases, and the rest to currency and structural changes.
Operating profit was 46 per cent higher at SKr566m.
Improved demand was shown in a 19 per cent rise in orders to SKr6.73bn. Mr
Per-Olof Eriksson, presenting his last report as group president, said:
'Order intake is increasing in most European countries. The already strong
demand in the US and Canada continues unabated, as well as in South America
and southeast Asia.' The two weak markets were Japan and Germany.

Telefonica, the partly-privatised telecommunications group which is the most
frequently traded stock on Spanish markets, showed a 15 per cent increase in
consolidated net profit in the first quarter to Pta17.34bn (Dollars 125.8m),
compared with Pta15.06bn in the same period last year.
Parent company earnings before tax were 7 per cent up at Pta19.58bn, with
the net figure rising 9.8 per cent to Pta15.47bn, as turnover increased by
6.8 per cent to Pta312.84bn. The company said the results reflected a
recovery in demand for telephone services as the Spanish economy began to
pick up.
Financial costs in the quarter held steady at Pta54.5bn, and the company
forecast a downward trend, reflecting declining interest rates.
Iberdrola, the leading private-sector electrical utility, ranking number two
in recent stock market activity, reported a 35 per cent rise in pre-tax
profit for the quarter to Pta34.25bn. The result reflected a 12 per cent
increase in the company's operating margin together with a reduction of
almost 19 per cent in financial charges.
Another of Spain's top electrical companies, Sevillana de Electricidad,
reported a 17 per cent increase in first-quarter after-tax profit to Pta
3.94bn, on sales 3.5 per cent higher at Pta64.54bn.
The company faces an increasing challenge through deregulation of the mobile
telephone market, which is expected to be opened up to foreign operators
later this year, and also through the liberalisation of cable television. It
currently has a monopoly in both sectors.

Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz aerospace subsidiary, and the Siemens
electrical and electronics group confirmed yesterday that they are holding
talks about co-operating in the defence technology business.
The two German companies said the discussions were at an extremely early
stage and that further details were unlikely to emerge before the summer.
However, they said that the discussions would cover a range of structures
for strategic and operational co-operation, including the possibility of
setting up a joint venture in the area.
The talks take place against a backdrop of declining sales and orders for
the German defence industry as the government cuts expenditure. However, the
government is keen to ensure that Germany maintains its manufacturing
expertise in core defence sectors.
The companies have been forced to cut jobs in their defence technology
businesses and co-operation may lead to more efficient use of existing
capacity, the two groups said yesterday.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Wal-Mart boosts income at
expense of Kmart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply contrasting results from Wal-Mart and Kmart, the two biggest
discount store groups in the US, yesterday highlighted how Wal-Mart is
continuing to grow at Kmart's expense.
Wal-Mart, now the world's biggest retailer, reported an 11 per cent growth
in net income to Dollars 498.5m for the first quarter to April, while the
ailing Kmart barely scraped into profit with net income of Dollars 18m for
the same period.
Kmart's result marked a further deterioration from last year's first quarter
when it turned in net income of Dollars 58m before extraordinary items.
Sales rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 7.8bn but earnings per share fell from
12 cents before extraordinary items to 4 cents.
Kmart has suffered five years of stagnant earnings because of its failure to
compete effectively with Wal-Mart. One of its weaknesses has been poor
inventory control, leading to stocks of goods that customers do not want to
buy.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said the group's niche
retailing offshoots had performed well, but sales in the main discount store
division had been below expectations, and the company had had to make big
inventory reductions.
In contrast, Wal-Mart saw a 27 per cent surge in sales to Dollars 17.7bn - a
figure boosted by the company's recent purchase of the Pace membership
warehouse stores from Kmart and Woolworth's 122 Woolco superstores in
Canada.
However, the cost of making the acquisitions and converting the stores had
its penalty at the bottom line. Earnings per share grew by 10 per cent to 22
cents from 20 cents, marking a sharp downturn from the rate of 25 per cent a
year seen over the past five years.
Wal-Mart's shares suffered a downward re-rating last year amid fears that it
had become too big to sustain the same high rates of earnings growth. It
countered that its acquisitions would provide a platform for continued rapid
growth.
Yesterday Mr David Glass, president and chief executive, said the conversion
of the former Pace clubs into Sam's Clubs - Wal-Mart's membership warehouse
operation - was substantially complete, and the conversion of the Woolco
stores into Wal-Mart stores should be achieved by the year end.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Profits advance of 10.3% for
Generale des Eaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French industrial group, yesterday said it
was on course for continued profits growth this year after achieving a 10.3
per cent increase in net profits to FFr3.2bn (Dollars 550m) last year from
FFr2.9bn in the previous year.
This was in spite of continued losses from its cable television and property
interests.
The group, which has significant media interests as well as its core
construction and utility activities, surpassed analysts' expectations.
Generale des Eaux yesterday said it was 'certain' to raise its profits again
this year, but added that it could not give precise indications as to the
likely figure.
However, the group did specify that it expected to see its turnover rise
modestly to between FFr150bn and FFr155bn in 1994, from FFr147.6bn in 1993.
Such an increase would repeat last year's rate of 2.9 per cent sales growth
from FFr143.3bn in 1992.
The group said it expected a 'slight reduction' in the level of activity of
its construction interests, but stressed that the overall outlook for these
businesses was showing signs of improvement. It also forecast an improvement
from its property management activities.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: KPN sticks to the letter on
sell-off - Dutch take a novel approach to their telecoms privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications privatisations are now commonplace. The sale of KPN of
the Netherlands, launched yesterday, is the fifth European offering in the
past year alone, with up to a dozen more in the pipeline. Asia-Pacific
telecoms is at a similar stage, with a few sales done and plenty to come.
However, KPN is the first large telecoms privatisation to include a state
postal service. Elsewhere, posts and telecommunications have been split in
the run-up to privatisation, with posts remaining in the public sector.
The inclusion of PTT Post in the KPN sale should cause would-be investors no
undue concern. The Dutch post office is one of the few postal organisations
in the world that can afford to feel relatively sanguine about the shift
away from letters in favour of facsimile transmissions and the new world of
mobile communications.
PTT Post is one of Europe's few profitable postal operations, contributing
nearly a third of KPN's turnover and 15 per cent of its operating profit. It
is marketing itself aggressively abroad, and is a pioneer in advanced postal
technologies. Its prime aims are to attract greater flows of international
business post through the Netherlands and to expand in providing
direct-marketing and mailing services to corporate clients.
Analysts in the Netherlands recognise the profitability of the country's
postal operations and are positive about their inclusion in the
privatisation. 'Postal activities produce stability in KPN's earnings
performance in a telecoms environment which certainly has potential but
could on the other hand be regarded as 'hostile',' stockbrokers CLN Oyens &amp;
Van Eeghen said recently.
Postal services apart, the KPN privatisation follows a well-trodden path. An
initial 30 per cent stake will be floated early next month. The government
announced yesterday that up to 138.15m shares will be sold at a price
between Fl 46 and Fl 52 each, raising a minimum of Fl 6.35bn (Dollars
3.39bn) for the state and valuing KPN as a whole at more than Fl 18bn.
A further sale, taking the government's stake to under 50 per cent, is
likely within three years, but at least 30 per cent will remain in state
hands for at least 10 years.
The Dutch flotation is taking place for broadly the same reasons as those
applying across the European Union. The government wants the money, and the
state telecoms company wants greater commercial freedom. Competition is
intensifying, particularly in the corporate sector, and privately-owned
companies are considered to be better placed to endure the onslaught.
Although small in international terms, KPN's telecommunications division is
well-placed to succeed in the EU's rapidly liberalising telecoms market.
With fewer than 50 employees per 10,000 lines, KPN is among the EU's most
productive state telecoms companies. Its network is towards the top of the
EU league on all measures except the penetration of cellular mobile
services.
On the international scene, it is already geared up to attack the corporate
market through its joint venture Unisource - a partnership of KPN and the
state operators of Sweden and Switzerland, with the strong prospect of
Telefonica, the Spanish operator, joining soon.
Earlier this year Unisource scored a coup when, in alliance with the US
giant AT&amp;T, it won a contract to provide a private telecoms network for 30
leading European multinationals - the largest 'outsourcing' contract of its
kind in the EU. Its future relationship with AT&amp;T is uncertain, but there is
the possibility of a more stable alliance.
Given such strengths, most analysts believe KPN will prove a fairly easy
sell at the offer price. However, the days are passing when telecoms stocks
could be guaranteed to float high above their respective stock exchanges. A
glance at BT is a cautionary tale.
For the past six months, BT's shares have fallen steadily against the FT-SE
All-Share average, and are down by nearly 20 per cent on their relative
value a year ago. A contributory factor has been the rapid growth of
competition in the UK market. BT commands nearly 90 per cent, but the
perception that it will have to relinquish a larger slice of it has spread
gloom across the investing community.
KPN could find itself in the same boat. The Dutch government has indicated
its willingness to license a second national operator with its own
infrastructure - likely to be formed from the country's cable industry and
its state electricity and rail operators.
The new company will not be able to engage in competition with KPN for
public voice traffic until 1998 - the EU liberalisation deadline. But if it
establishes itself rapidly, it could make inroads into KPN's data and
private corporate network business.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: La Redoute holders lose appeal
over Pinault bid
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Minority shareholders in La Redoute, the French mail order group, yesterday
suffered a setback when an appeal court ruled against them in their attempt
to oppose the company's takeover by the Pinault-Printemps, retail group.
The shareholders, represented by ADAM, a French minority investors' pressure
group, have been lobbying against the bid, unveiled this year by
Pinault-Printemps.
Pinault, which is one of France's largest retail concerns, has owned a
controlling holding in La Redoute with 54 per cent of the equity and 68 per
cent of the voting rights, since its acquisition two years ago of the Au
Printemps department store chain.
However, Pinault, which came under fire from minority investors over the
terms of the Au Printemps deal, recently revealed plans to buy the remaining
shares. Last month it received a 'warning' from the stock market authorities
over the valuation of its offer, which was otherwise considered to be fair.
La Redoute's minority investors pressed ahead with their lobby against the
bid, claiming that the terms were unfair only to be told yesterday by the
appeal court judge that there were no grounds on which to pursue a case.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Electronics behind jump at Diploma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge from its electronics division was behind a 42 per cent advance in
interim profits at Diploma, the electronics, building components and special
steels group.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-March were Pounds 11.5m, up from
last time's Pounds 8.1m which was struck after a Pounds 1.1m provision for
reorganisation of a subsidiary. Operating profits were ahead 27 per cent at
Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 8.5m).
The electronics division, which accounted for 70 per cent of group turnover,
increased operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 5.5m).
Total turnover increased by 22 per cent, from Pounds 74m to Pounds 90.1m.
Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, said that trading conditions for most of
the group's divisions were more favourable than they had been for several
years. He described the increase in the personal computer market as 'the
significant engine of growth' for Macro and Nortronic, the electronic
components distribution subsidiaries.
The semi-conductor market was now at a good stage in its cycle, he said,
with further growth likely to emerge from the increasing use of electronic
gadgetry in cars.
He stressed the group's commitment to providing top quality service, and
said it had won market share by continuing to invest through the recession.
It now employed more than 20 electronics service engineers, compared with
six at the start of the recession.
The building components division increased operating profits by 22 per cent,
from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 3.3m, on turnover of Pounds 23m (19m).
IG, the steel lintel maker, benefited from an increase in housing starts,
recording a 20 per cent rise in both volume and profit.
Mr Thomas said he was optimistic that 'goodish conditions' would continue.
The specialist steel division saw further decline in demand from the oil
industry, but this was offset by general engineering demand and profits were
ahead 20 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 10.7p to 13p; the interim dividend is increased
from 3.5p to 4p.
COMMENT
Good conditions in the semi-conductor market helped Diploma to come in
slightly ahead of expectations. There are firm indications that conditions
in the building components market are also improving. The common factor
linking the businesses is strong cash flow, and the strategy seems to have
worked well so far. However, turnover from electronics distribution is
smaller than that of other groups which concentrate on the sector, so the
group could face difficult questions as vendors look for fewer distributors
and manufacturers seek to increase market share by squeezing smaller
companies. Full-year profits are likely to be above Pounds 25m, giving a
prospective multiple of about 18, which looks attractive.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Getting hooked on fish and chips in Japan /
A look at Harry Ramsden's global expansion plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tucked between the virtual reality games, roller hockey and super body
clinic at Live UFO, a 12 day outdoor extravaganza in Tokyo's Yoyogi Park
recently, was a British fish and chips shop.
The incongruous temporary counter was the latest element in a strategy by
Harry Ramsden's, the Guiseley, West Yorkshire, quoted fish and chips
company, to bring this traditional British dish to Asia.
The shop, serving daily more than 500 portions of haddock and chips covered
in traditional salt and vinegar, was an experiment to see whether the
Japanese would take to the product.
A similar stall in Hong Kong had led to a joint-venture there, and the
opening two years ago of a highly successful restaurant.
Mr Richard Taylor, Harry Ramsden's finance director who spent much of last
week in Tokyo scrubbing floors, interviewing Japanese customers and chopping
fish - rather slowly according to his Yorkshire-based staff - said he was
pleased by the initial results.
The haddock portions had to be reduced in size because demand had been
higher than expected and there was a risk of running out of fish.
'The question is whether once they had tried it they would come back again,'
says Mr Taylor.
The reaction was mixed. Mr Katsumi Hidaka, a 29 year old television
director, said, with studious understatement, that his portion was 'not
terrible'. His wife said the fish was 'greasy' but she might have it again.
Ryu, their one year old son, spat his chips out.
Nevertheless, the product had generally gone down well, according to Ms
Katie Garritt, who cooked the fish and chips over the 12 days and normally
works at Harry Ramsden's Guiseley headquarters. 'Sometimes one member of the
family would try it, and then all the others would buy portions,' she said.
Mr Taylor said demand had been brisk enough to start looking for partners to
set up a restaurant in Tokyo. The group was looking for someone who already
has experience in the Japanese fast-food market, he explained.
Harry Ramsden's hopes to repeat the success of the Hong Kong branch which
generates annual sales of Pounds 1.5m - the same turnover as the outlet in
Blackpool.
'We market the product as Britain's fast-food, and it's proved extremely
successful,' says Mr Taylor.
Initially, about half of the clientele in Hong Kong were expatriates, but
now more than 80 per cent are Chinese. Additional branches are being opened
in Singapore this September and in Melbourne next year.
'Following the success of Hong Kong, we've had approaches from a number of
countries across Asia and it's easy to waste a lot of time following them
up. It's a question of management resources. But Japan is our priority
because of the potential size of the market,' he says.
Harry Ramsden's believes it has a recipe for success in Asia.
Mr Taylor insists the product is of high quality. 'We don't compromise on
fish. We use the best Norwegian haddock cooked at constant temperatures in
oil that is constantly changed. Finally, we have Harry Ramsden's unique
Yorkshire batter,' he explains.
'We want Harry Ramsden's to become a global brand. In the short-term the
greatest returns will be in the UK. But it would be a mistake to saturate
the UK and then turn to the rest of the world. We'd probably come a cropper
when we internationalised. We need experience now,' says Mr Taylor.
The company has eight branches in the UK, with four more scheduled for
opening this year, as well as one in Dublin.
In Japan, the company is looking for a joint-venture partner, its preferred
route for expansion. Harry Ramsden's keeps between 25 per cent and 49 per
cent of the joint-venture, with the remainder held by the local partner.
'We could be greedy and keep a higher share, but you have to provide
sufficient incentive to make the venture thrive. The partner is key. He, or
she, provides knowledge of local tastes, areas and, most importantly,
sites,' explains Mr Taylor.
By adopting the joint-venture route, Harry Ramsden's would be following the
example of Grand Metropolitan's Burger King, which has teamed up with the
Seibu Railway's group, and Subway, the US sandwich makers, which forged
links with Suntory's First Kitchen.
Each Harry Ramsden's restaurant serves one dish to cater for local tastes.
In Glasgow, the dish is haggis; in Hong Kong, it is salad; and in Bristol,
for some reason, they serve faggots and peas.
Mr Taylor says he has not decided what would be appropriate for Japanese
palates. Some less greasy fish would probably help.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Life Style Care to join market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life Style Care, the nursing home group which specialises in caring for
elderly mentally infirm patients, is seeking funds for expansion through a
June flotation expected to value the group at between Pounds 20m and Pounds
25m.
The company is coming to market next month through a placing which is
expected to raise about Pounds 10m. Proceeds will be used to pay down
estimated net debt of Pounds 6m.
Life Style was formed in 1987 by Mr Ramesh Sachdev, the accountant and
property dealer who is now chief executive, and his wife, Pratibha.
Mr Sachdev's family is expected to sell only a small part of its 85 per cent
holding to raise some Pounds 2m. The two remaining shareholders - Eagle Star
and Gresham Trust - are also expected to retain the bulk of their holdings.
The company operates in the north and north-west of England and the
Midlands, but is thought to be keen to take advantage of lower property
prices in London.
It has 14 homes, all of which are freehold, with 564 beds. Occupancy rates
over the past two years have been 96 per cent.
In the year to June 30, Life Style reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m
on sales of Pounds 5.3m. Pre-tax profits for 1994, which will be forecast in
the flotation prospectus, are expected to show a significant increase, the
company said.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Burford may acquire Trocadero centre -
Price thought to be slightly less than Pounds 100m sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burford Holdings, the property company which purchased the Ladbroke property
portfolio for Pounds 103m earlier this year, is understood to have signed an
exclusivity agreement for the potential purchase of the Trocadero, off
London's Piccadilly Circus.
Mr Nick Leslau, Burford's chief executive, said he was unable to confirm the
agreement. He added, however: 'For some time, we've been interested in the
Trocadero at the right price and under the right conditions.'
Mr Philip Wallace, the receiver at KPMG Peat Marwick, said an exclusivity
contract had been signed with an unnamed party at a value which was slightly
less than the initial Pounds 100m asking price.
The Trocadero, which at the peak of the market was valued at more than
Pounds 200m, helped drag former owners Brent Walker and Power Corporation
towards the brink of collapse.
The holding company for the property went into receivership in January 1993,
and was put up for sale last October.
At a price of Pounds 100m, the 350,000 sq ft entertainment and retail centre
would offer a current yield of close to 9 per cent.
The building has considerable potential, having 100,000 sq ft of empty
office space, and bringing in almost 14m shoppers per year. However, it has
been affected by the tawdry image of its neighbouring streets.
Burford has a reputation for buying lower grade properties where the
management can add significant value. Mr Leslau said one option would be to
switch the office property back into retail or entertainment.
Burford paid for the Ladbroke portfolio through a share issue, which brought
its gearing back down to about 35 per cent, compared with its self-imposed
ceiling of 100 per cent. It would therefore be comfortable funding up to
Pounds 150m in property purchases through debt.
Mr Wallace claimed there had been considerable interest in the Trocadero
from prospective buyers in the US, east Asia and UK although Pounds 100m
appeared unachievable. 'We have spoken to 30 or 40 different interested
parties', he said.
It appears that Burford has several weeks in which to tie up the deal.

FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Seafield terminates Imari merger
talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seafield, the Dublin-based transport and distribution company, yesterday
announced that talks with Imari concerning a possible merger had been broken
off.
The board of Seafield came under fire last month when a group of
shareholders called for an extraordinary meeting to consider a change of
leadership at the company.
The dissident shareholders last week wrote to other shareholders outlining
their reasons for seeking to replace Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, and Mr
Richard Hayes, a director.
They have nominated Mr Robert Cosby for chairman, and Mr Tony Wilson, a
former executive chairman of the group.
The dissidents, who speak for 25.4 per cent of the share capital, catalogue
the 'dismal trading and acquisition record' under the present management.
However, Seafield said that the company's problems had been caused by the
purchase of Charterhall Properties when Mr Wilson was chairman. Charterhall
was sold last October.
Mr Chilver said the group would be writing to shareholders this week.
The extraordinary meeting has been convened for June 10.
Last summer Waterglade International, the property group, withdrew an
attempt to replace Seafield's board.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Discount for US patients on SB ulcer drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham is to offer Dollars 20 (Pounds 13.60) rebates to some US
patients buying Tagamet, its once best-selling ulcer drug which loses patent
protection in the US today.
The move is the latest in a series of measures SB has taken in the past 10
days to defend Tagamet from the onslaught of generic competition.
The rebate is available to patients without health insurance, notably those
on the US government run Medicare which provides health cover for the
elderly.
The full price of a one-month course of Tagamet is Dollars 83. That compares
with Dollars 93 for a month's supply of Zantac, made by the UK's Glaxo, and
Dollars 86 for US company Merck's Pepcid, said SB.
SB's discounted price is likely to be heavily undercut from tomorrow. Three
companies have signalled their intention to sell the generic drug,
cimetidine, as soon as the patent expires. They are Novopharm, the Canadian
company, Mylan of the US, and Endo Laboratories, a partnership between Du
Pont, the US chemicals giant, and Merck.
SB has said that up to 10 generics companies may eventually join the fray.
Novopharm has said it expects the generic price to be 30 to 50 per cent
below that of the branded drug.
Recent cases of other big selling drugs running out of patent protection
suggest that an 80 per cent discount within 12 months is likely.
As well as patient discounts, SB intends to maintain tight control of
remaining intellectual property rights over Tagamet.
Novopharm and Mylan were last week the subject of law suits alleging
infringement of patent and trademark laws. The cases revolved around the
similar appearance of the generic versions and branded Tagamet.
Novopharm quickly settled out of court to make its cimetidine tablets in a
darker green than Tagamet tablets.
SB also decided last week to launch its own generic version of Tagamet in
competition with the three other suppliers. It will sell them to hospital
chains and managed healthcare organisations that look after the healthcare
obligations of large employers.
It also engaged Lederle, part of American Cyanamid, to sell the generic to
pharmacies. SB plans eventually to sell Tagamet without a prescription
over-the-counter. The OTC version has already been launched in the UK and
the company said that it remained 'in active discussions' with Washington's
Food and Drug Administration.
'There will be more of these measures as SB engages in this damage
limitation exercise,' said Mr Nigel Barnes, analyst at Hoare Govett.
'SmithKline knows that it is facing a tide of generics.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon chief executive resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bennie Wooley is resigning as chief executive of Huntingdon International
Holdings, the life sciences and engineering services group that has seen its
share price fall by two thirds over the past year.
The move follows a strategic review which concluded that the group should
focus on its original life sciences business.
Mr Wooley has headed the company for 14 years during which it diversified
into engineering and environmental consultancy in the US and bought
consultants Travers Morgan in the UK.
The review concluded that neither of these divisions had the earnings
prospects originally envisaged.
The group yesterday announced a sharp fall in operating income from Pounds
5.8m to Pounds 2.57m for the six months to March 31. At the pre-tax level
profits were slightly ahead at Pounds 989,000 (Pounds 984,000) reflecting
Pounds 3m of restructuring costs in the first half of last year.
The company, which has issued two profit warnings since March last year,
said income from operations had been 'significantly' below expectations but
that it was continuing to generate cash surplus to operations. This was
reflected in an unchanged interim dividend of 0.875p.
The US arm incurred an operating loss of Pounds 388,000, compared with a
profit of Pounds 942,000 last time, while profits from Travers Morgan fell
to Pounds 343,000 (Pounds 1.23m).
Operating income from life sciences slipped to Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 4.37m)
on turnover of Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 19.7m).
The group has appointed Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, to help it
identify strategies for the engineering businesses. Mr Christopher Cliffe,
finance director, said this would cover options other than disposal.
Mr David Anslow, currently chief operating officer international, is to take
over as chief executive with Mr Cliffe taking on the additional role as
deputy chief executive with responsibility for strategic development.
Although profits from life sciences are expected to pick up in the second
half, the company warned that the shortfall for the group as a whole was
unlikely to be made up.
The shares closed 3p lower at 86p.

Chelsfield, the property company headed by Mr Elliott Bernerd, has increased
its holding in the Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands from 30

The company, which bought the scheme in partnership with Saudi Arabian

increase its stake.
The centre, which was purchased for Pounds 128m last September, has been
revalued at Pounds 185m, reflecting increased rental income from the project
and the uplift in the property investment market.
Situated in Dudley, it is one of the four largest shopping centres in the
UK, comprising some 1.4m sq ft of covered shopping mall space and
approximately 400,000 sq ft of retail warehousing.
The centre's annual rent roll is expected to reach Pounds 16m by the end of
this year.
Senior lenders to the project, which originally made a Pounds 90m 10 year
senior loan, have agreed to extend additional facilities which will replace
a Pounds 19m mezzanine loan, which was formerly guaranteed by the Saudi
Arabian investors.
Chelsfield also announced yesterday the acquisition of a 50 per cent
interest in St Catherine's House in central London.
The company has bought its 50 per stake in the building through a joint
venture company, formed with a private German investor, for Pounds 35m.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue confirms talks with Portals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Portals, the security and specialist paper maker, jumped another
40p to 805p yesterday after De La Rue, the banknote printer, confirmed that
the companies were in talks which might lead to an offer for Portals.
Neither company would elaborate on the one-line statement, which came after
mounting speculation about the identity of a potential bidder.
Portals' shares gained 99p on Friday after the group, which also includes
environmental protection and control products operations, disclosed that it
had received an approach.
Market speculation quickly focused on De La Rue, one of Portals' main
customers. It has a Pounds 200m cash pile and has made no secret of its
intention to make acquisitions.
Yesterday its shares closed down 21p at 857p amid market concerns that it
might be tempted to pay too much in order to secure the approval of Portals'
board, which analysts believe might have to be up to Pounds 10 a share,
valuing Portals at about Pounds 650m.
The two companies have regular discussions about commercial matters;
however, the latest move by De La Rue has taken analysts by surprise.
The acquisition of Portals, which controls 50 per cent of the world market
for bank note paper, would transform De La Rue into an integrated security
paper maker and printer.
However, some analysts believe that there are strong commercial reasons
against a merger. In particular they fear that Portals' other customers
would balk at purchasing paper supplies from a rival.
Since Mr Jeremy Marshall, the ex-Hanson man, became chief executive of De La
Rue in 1989 profits have quadrupled following a tough programme of
disposals, closures and efficiency improvements.
Its biggest purchase to date was the Pounds 94.7m acquisition of Inter
Innovation, in 1991.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Quality streets find ready buyers - The
advantages of acquiring good mortgage books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Potential home buyers complaining that many properties on the market are
poor quality and that the good ones are snapped up quickly at rising prices
as buyers compete, may find it comforting to know that mortgage lenders
themselves are in the same position.
The properties in question are mortgage books rather than houses, but the
market conditions are not dissimilar.
For the last few years, interest among lenders in this low-profile form of
acquisition has been increasing, and competition has become intense.
'A couple of years ago, it might be that two lenders looked at a book that
was for sale,' one senior executive said, 'now, 15 might see it'.
Even among centralised lenders, who are usually cast as those seeking to
leave the market, there is some interest in acquiring mortgage books.
National Home Loans, for example, is looking to buy.
None of the purchases has so far matched in size the Pounds 1.8bn offered by
Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.
However, the sums involved can still be substantial and are rarely
insignificant. Few lenders would look at a book worth less than Pounds 10m,
and for the larger organisations Pounds 20m may be the lower limit, which
makes the process of carrying out due diligence worthwhile.
Halifax Building Society has built up mortgage book acquisitions totalling
about Pounds 1bn over the past three to four years. In February this year
Abbey National bought the Pounds 900m UK residential mortgage book of the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Birmingham Midshires, one of the smaller building societies active in this
area, made acquisitions amounting to almost Pounds 250m in 1993.
Such activity highlights the contrast with the books that have failed to
find a buyer. 'There are a lot of poor quality loan portfolios out there,'
commented one lender.
Nothing came, for example, of giving potential purchasers the opportunity to
show interest in the Pounds 2bn mortgage book of Mortgage Express, the
centralised lender owned by the TSB. Some potential buyers were deterred by
the quality of the loans. TSB says now that it is committed to keeping the
operation and managing down the loan book.
Similarly some of the mortgage books available from foreign banks have not
proved attractive. These banks entered the UK housing market in the mid- to
late-1980s, stopped lending in the recession and now want to leave an area
of non-core business.
Much more attractive have been the the staff mortgage books of some large
financial institutions. Even the Bank of England has sold its staff mortgage
book to the Halifax, which has specialised in this type of purchase.
Mr Peter Walsh, finance director of Chelsea Building Society, said that in
buying a mortgage book a lender was taking on business where there was a
track record of payments giving more information than may be obtained from
vetting a new borrower.
While it is hard to imagine what could be safer than taking on the Bank of
England staff mortgage book, this lack of risk highlights only some of the
advantages that a purchaser can gain from buying a book of the right
quality.
Mr John Fry, group services director at Abbey National, said that buying the
CIBC book was 'a way of increasing our assets without putting margins under
pressure'.
The purchase also gave Abbey an additional 17,500 mortgage customers who
were 'pleased to come to a household name', as well as a facility that will
enable them to securitise future mortgages.
Abbey gave former CIBC borrowers a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut,
but they are still paying about 0.5 percentage points more than Abbey
customers generally.
Mr Stuart Bernau, a senior executive at Nationwide Building Society,
commented that even when different interest rates paid were harmonised,
there was still a benefit in acquiring such loans.
Against the background of the recent emphasis on fixed-rate mortgage
lending, where margins are generally narrower, the opportunity to buy a
significant amount of variable rate lending is particularly attractive.
Compared with merger or the purchase of another organisation, buying a
mortgage book can also offer growth without tears.
The transaction does not require, for example, the consent of a society's
members, and the legal status of the process is not in doubt.
It is also much less likely to lead to large scale job losses or
redundancies than having to reconcile two branch networks into a single
organisation.
Though lenders believe the intensified competition for mortgage books will
continue for some time, despite the impact it has already had in raising
prices, they know that whatever its benefits, buying mortgage books can only
be a sideline compared with selling mortgages.
'It's a useful addition, but it's not going to change the way we do
business,' concluded Mr Dick Spelman, marketing general manager at the
Halifax.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Fenner surges to Pounds 2.9m as recovery
gets under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The management of Fenner said yesterday that it was seeing the first signs
of the promised turnround at the Hull-based industrial products group.
For the half year to February 28 pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 105,000 to
Pounds 2.91m, including a gain of Pounds 795,000 from the sale of two
operations in South Africa.
Performance had improved in all divisions and the return to positive
earnings per share had allowed it to resume interim dividends via a 0.5p
distribution.
The figure took account of an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.06m (Pounds
1.4m), most of which related to the group's reorganisation of its power
transmission division, which involved the closure of a plant in China. Last
year Fenner was approached by a possible buyer of its power transmission
business, but talks broke down in December.
Mr Mark Abrahams, finance director, said it seemed prospective buyers were
unlikely to offer an acceptable price, so the group would concentrate on
improving the division's performance. Power transmission incurred a small
operating loss of Pounds 300,000 on sales of Pounds 33m, but was now trading
profitably.
The fluid power division increased sales from Pounds 11m to Pounds 14m and
new products increased its market share, particularly in the US. Operating
profits rose to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 800,000). Significant growth in both the
US and UK helped the group's niche polymer businesses raise sales from
Pounds 17m to Pounds 19m and operating profits from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds
2.3m.
Conveyor belting's sales were flat at Pounds 13m, with a drop in orders from
British Coal being offset by stronger overseas sales in the US and
Australia. Operating profits rose from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 1m.
The group said its South African businesses had again performed well in
recessionary conditions. with the political uncertainties not having had any
significant effect.
Earnings of 0.65p compared with losses of 4.65p last time.
COMMENT
Fenner has clearly turned the corner. Polymers and fluid power are going
well, particularly in the US, and conveyor belting has performed creditably
overseas. Power transmission is being held on to unless or until someone is
prepared to pay a decent price. Profits should rebound sharply, thanks to
the elimination of restructuring charges and lower interest payments. The
return to profitability in the UK after three years will also lower the very
high tax charge. These positives are partly offset by the group's exposure
to South Africa, with the allied political and foreign exchange risks.
Profits are forecast to recover to about Pounds 7.5m in the current year to
August, but an expected Pounds 11m the following year puts the shares on an
undemanding multiple of about 14.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise renews onslaught on Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil yesterday sought to step up the tempo of its hostile Pounds
1.5bn bid for rival explorer Lasmo by casting doubt on the credibility of
the target's management.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and chief executive, called on Lasmo
shareholders to ask whether the group would ever pay 'a meaningful
dividend'. He quoted management statements since 1991 committing the group
to at least a stable dividend when, in fact, the pay-out has fallen from
8.5p to 1.3p.
Mr Hearne also urged shareholders to question Lasmo's financial position,
and sought to imply gearing could reach unacceptable levels as a result of
the Pounds 800m investment programme.
Mr Rudolf Agnew, Lasmo's chairman, rejected Mr Hearne's claims - in
particular, the references to gearing. 'Enterprise takes no account of
Lasmo's operating cashflow over the next three years,' Mr Agnew said.
Mr Hearne's letter also said Lasmo's defence document misled shareholders.
He denied the company's claim that the offer's unusual equity structure
would make second class citizens of shareholders and, in effect, force them
to inject cash into the enlarged group. Enterprise is offering 27 A shares,
with limited dividend rights, and 12 warrants exercisable at 470p for every
80 Lasmo shares.
'The two elements of the package are separately tradeable and shareholders
will not need to subscribe cash to realise the warrants' value,' he said.

FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BIL reviews plans for Mount Charlotte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brierley Investments of New Zealand is rethinking plans to float Mount
Charlotte Thistle Hotels, its UK subsidiary, after a recent upturn in
business, particularly in London.
BIL, which acquired Mount Charlotte in 1990, has said repeatedly that its
eventual aim was to float the chain. However, with trading improving after a
difficult few years, some in the New Zealand group believe it might be
preferable to hold on to the chain and benefit from the upturn.
While a flotation has not entirely been ruled out, BIL is also considering
selling a slice of Mount Charlotte equity to a small group of investors. In
1991 BIL sold a 30 per cent stake in Mount Charlotte to two Singaporean
government agencies.
Mount Charlotte made a profit of Pounds 2.1m after tax in 1992, compared
with Pounds 1.5m in 1991. While the chain has, along with the rest of the UK
industry, suffered a fall in occupancy and rates during the recession, its
London hotels are currently thought to be well over 90 per cent full.
The hotel chain, the second biggest in the UK after Forte, is expected to
phase out the Mount Charlotte hotel name in favour of its Thistle brand.
The company, which operates 112 hotels in the UK, has said it wants over 60
per cent of its establishments to be marketed under the Thistle brand by the
end of next year. It said it intends to turn Thistle into the UK's leading
four-star hotel chain.
Over the past two years, the company has upgraded eight Mount Charlotte
properties to Thistles and will upgrade a further 10 over the next few
months. The chain, which has no hotels outside the UK, is believed to be in
no rush to acquire properties or management contracts in continental Europe.
It believes that London will remain one of the world's most important hotel
markets. The company has 24 hotels with nearly 7,000 rooms in London, making
it the biggest operator in the capital.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Compatible partners at the multimedia ball: The courtship
ritual of EDS and Sprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revolution in the world's information and communications industries is
like a dance of giants, with corporate heavyweights trying a range of
partners in the hope of finding the perfect match. Yesterday, two of the
most important US participants confirmed that their nuptial preparations
were well advanced.
Electronic Data Systems, the Dallas-based computing services group, has
become engaged to Sprint, the telecoms group which is America's third
largest long-distance carrier.
Plenty of hurdles stand in the way of marriage - not least that EDS is a
subsidiary of General Motors, which plans to pave the way by divesting EDS
in a tax-free spin-off to stockholders.
But if the merger goes through, it will create an important new contender in
the battle for global business as the industries of computing,
communications and entertainment merge - unified by technology which allows
all types of information to be transmitted in the same digital form.
This will be the biggest tie-up yet between a computing services company and
a telecoms provider. It will also go a long way to solving big strategic
questions looming for both Sprint and EDS.
Sprint - based in Kansas City, Missouri with 1993 operating income of
Dollars 481m (Pounds 321m) on revenues of Dollars 11.4bn - is unique among
US telecoms groups: its business strategy and regulatory controls on rivals
mean that it is the only company with big interests in all three sectors of
the industry: long distance, wireless and local phone services.
Some analysts think this type of nationally branded, integrated
communications company is likely to emerge as one of the winners from the US
multimedia revolution - provided it is sufficiently large and has a strong
array of partners.
Until now, Sprint has stood largely aloof from the rush to find multimedia
partners, while its 9-10 per cent share of the long-distance market has put
it far behind sector leaders AT&amp;T (60 per cent) and MCI Communications (20
per cent).
Still, after a period of declining market share in long-distance, it is
growing strongly; its cellular operations are booming and its local
operations are among the most efficient in the nation.
EDS was founded in the early 1960s by 1992 presidential candidate Mr Ross
Perot, who sold it to GM in 1984. Capitalising on the increasing complexity
of information technology, it has specialised in 'outsourcing' (running
other companies' computer and communications services) and systems
integration, the design and construction of information networks. It has
become the world's largest computing software and services company, with
1993 earnings of Dollars 724m on revenues of Dollars 8.56bn, and has landed
a series of prestigious contracts, including one of Pounds 1bn for the UK
income tax authority.
GM still accounts for 39 per cent of its revenues, but that is down from 75
per cent in the mid-1980s. Under the proposed spin-off, EDS would continue
to provide the same services to GM under a new 10-year agreement.
EDS, however, is also keen to play a role in the nascent world of
multimedia. Late last year, for example, it announced a joint venture with
France Telecom and US West, the regional Bell operator, to provide
interactive financial transaction services to the home and business markets.
But to compete effectively it requires a partner or partners: 'The scale of
the investment required for these areas is mind-boggling,' one industry
analyst said yesterday. Furthermore, to reach the individual consumer it
helps to have an ally with a strong brand image and close commercial links
to the home, which can be provided by Sprint.
At the same time, EDS can give Sprint greater access to its customer base,
which is concentrated in Fortune 500 international companies, whereas
Sprint's long-distance strength has been in targeting small to medium-sized
US companies.
EDS expertise should also help Sprint provide both large and small customers
with more sophisticated services, and could play an important integrating
role if Sprint were to set up a national wireless network.
A merger should also save costs. EDS, which runs one of the world's largest
private communications networks, could cut its line leasing costs by using
Sprint's network, the first all-digital fibre optic system in the US.
Sprint, in turn, could reduce information technology costs.
But further waltzes around the telecoms dance-floor may have to await the
consummation of this marriage, which still seems months away, given the
complexity of EDS's relationship with GM and the need to clear numerous
regulatory hurdles. In that time, the partners could cool on each other, as
has happened several times ahead of much vaunted multimedia weddings.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Dutch telecoms valued at about Pounds 8bn

Shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch postal and
telecommunications company, are to be offered early next month at a price of
Fl 46-Fl 52, valuing the company at between Fl 21bn and Fl 24bn (Pounds
7.5bn-Pounds 8.5bn).
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the UK Post Office, said the Dutch
flotation underlined the need for the British government to come to an early
decision in its 22-month review of the corporation's future.
'The Dutch privatisation points the way the rest of the leading European
post offices are going, with German and Sweden post office flotations
following shortly. If ministers decide we should be sold off, they should
get on with it or we will lose our position in the first division.'
The Dutch government, which yesterday released details of the long-awaited
transaction, said it would float up to 138.15m shares, representing 30 per
cent of the total. The banking syndicate, led by ABN Amro, will be allowed
to sell an additional 20.72m shares if demand is heavy.
The flotation could raise more than Fl 8bn for the Dutch state. At the lower
end of the range, the shares would still be worth more than Fl 6bn, making
the flotation the biggest ever on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
The exact price will be announced on June 6 following a book-building period
among institutions. The subscription period opens on the same day and runs
until June 9.
Trading in KPN shares is expected to begin on June 13.
The price range of Fl 46-Fl 52 is roughly in line with predictions by
analysts, whose forecasts varied from Fl 45 to Fl 55.
About half the shares are expected to be sold in the Netherlands, with the
rest divided among the UK, the US and the rest of the world.
Late last month, the banking syndicate said private investors would receive
a price discount of about 5 per cent on allotments up to 75 shares. They
will also be given preferential treatment in the allocation of shares.
Government officials said about 200,000 potential private shareholders had
responded to advertisements and requested detailed information about the
flotation.
The shares are to be listed in Amsterdam and London. KPN is expected to
apply for a listing in New York by the time the government sells a second
tranche of shares in two or three years. The Dutch state's eventual aim is
to reduce its shareholding to about 30 per cent.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Whitbread rises 32% despite lower beer sales: Restaurants
and leisure help brewing UK group towards a 'respectable outcome'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance by its pub food, restaurant and leisure operations
helped Whitbread offset lower beer sales and a reduced contribution from its
leased estate to report higher full-year profits yesterday.
The brewing, retailing and leisure group reported a 32 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 234m in the year to February 26 from Pounds 177m,
a figure depressed by non-operating losses. Turnover from continuing
operations edged ahead to Pounds 2.36bn (Pounds 2.32bn).
Sir Michael Angus, chairman, described the results as 'a respectable
outcome' against the backdrop of a subdued economy and fierce competition.
Profit before tax and non-operating items increased 5.8 per cent to Pounds
231.7m despite an additional Pounds 15m charge for pensions. Interest costs
fell from Pounds 42.2m to Pounds 25.1m. Earnings per share improved to
34.88p (22.73p) and a final dividend of 13.8p makes a total of 18.8p
(17.75p). The shares slipped 9p to 563p.
Whitbread Inns, the group's managed pubs, raised profits 6 per cent to
Pounds 91.7m, on turnover 5.7 per cent higher at Pounds 538.3m. Average food
sales per pub increased by 15 per cent, drinks were up 5 per cent and
machine income rose by 7 per cent. The growth in food sales reflected good
performances from the 200 Brewers Fayre outlets and the cask ale houses.
Profits from Pub Partnerships, the leased estate, declined 13 per cent to
Pounds 49.7m, from Pounds 57.1m, as the average number of pubs fell by about
400, with the year-end total amounting to 3,100.
The restaurants and leisure division increased profits by 12 per cent to
Pounds 55m (Pounds 48.9m) on turnover of Pounds 1.09bn.
Wider margins and lower overheads helped Beefeater raise its profits 19 per
cent, while Pizza Hut increased market share with a 7 per cent growth in
turnover. However, Thresher's profits declined, reflecting tough competition
and the impact of cross-channel shopping.
Hotel operations benefited from a substantial improvement at the renamed
Country Club Hotels Group. During the year 27 Lansbury hotels were sold and
15 budget Travel Inns opened.
Profits from beer and other drinks fell by 5 per cent from Pounds 70.4m to
Pounds 66.9m. Overall Whitbread's beer volumes declined 4 per cent against a
beer market drop of 2.5 per cent. Boddingtons was the best performer with
total volume up 16 per cent and draftflow cans up more than 25 per cent
making it the market leader in take-home trade. Meanwhile Stella Artois
further consolidated its leadership of the premium lager sector.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Barclays hedges its property portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays is to hedge itself partially against further losses on its Pounds
4.2bn UK property loan portfolio by issuing Pounds 150m of derivative debt
securities to offset the risk.
The issue - the first attempt by a British bank to balance risks in this way
 -is intended to protect Barclays while it reduces its exposure to property.
A further Pounds 100m securities may be issued.
Barclays, which made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m in 1992 after allowing
property loans to grow to 9 per cent of the total, decided to hedge because
it did not want to sell property loans rapidly at a heavy discount. The
capital sum from the Property Index Certificates, which will be sold to
institutional investors in minimum tranches of Pounds 250,000, will only be
partially repaid if property values fall, allowing it to offset losses on
its own book.
Mr Alan Brown, Barclays' director of group credit policy, said it was 'not
trying to call the market' by betting on which way property prices would
move, but wanted to reduce potential losses if prices fell. This would allow
the bank to reduce property loans further from the current 6.5 per cent of
total lending over the next two to five years. Without a hedge, it would
face pressure to refuse new property loans, or sell old ones.
Barclays is marketing the certificates, indexed to the Pounds 40bn
Investment Property Databank (IPD), as a chance for investors to gain
exposure to recovery in the UK property market without having to buy and
manage properties. If the IPD index rises, a premium will be paid along with
the capital on the redemption date. The quarterly income from the
certificates is fixed at 7.3 per cent this year, but will then vary with the
yield of the index.
Although many investors want to increase their holdings of commercial
property, they have until now had to buy and manage properties, or invest in
unit trusts. This makes it hard to invest quickly, and can involve high
costs and charges.
Mr James Woodlock, managing director of BZW Investment Management, which
devised the certificates, said the size and diversity of Barclays' portfolio
offered an unusual chance to devise a security which tracked the property
market.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Lufthansa set to move back into the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa is heading back towards profitability after three years of losses,
according to the German airline's chief executive.
Mr Jurgen Weber said yesterday he hoped that the airline would make a profit
for the current year which would enable it to pay its first dividend to
ordinary shareholders since 1989.
He was speaking as the airline reported a sharp fall in losses for 1993 and
further improvements in the first quarter of the current year.
Reflecting the impact of extensive rationalisation, pre-tax losses for the
group fell from DM310.1m (Pounds 124m) to DM8.33m last year on sales of
DM19.27bn, up from DM18.6bn.
In the first three months of this year, the Lufthansa parent company cut its
losses from DM245m to DM82m.
Mr Weber said he could make no forecast about the size of the 1994 payout -
to be paid in 1995 - until the second half of this year. More details are
likely at the airline's annual meeting on July 7 when the company will ask
shareholders' permission to raise its nominal share capital as a first step
towards a rights issue.
Mr Klaus Schlede, Lufthansa's finance director, said the issue would raise
at least DM1.7bn, assuming a 20 per cent discount from the current share
price. The funds were urgently required to replenish the group's equity
capital, depleted after years of losses. The German government will not take
up its entitlement to new shares, thereby reducing its holding from 51.4 per
cent to about 40 per cent.
Lufthansa achieved its earnings turnround last year against a backdrop of
excess capacity, a sluggish world economy and continuing price pressure in
the global airline industry. It said it had managed to decouple itself from
the general trend by implementing a major restructuring programme, which led
to a substantial reduction in staffing and costs.
The airline has reduced costs by DM1.5bn in the past two years and aims to
trim a further DM500m costs by 1997.
Stripping out the impact of one-off items, operating profits for 1993
amounted to DM409m, swinging back from a loss of DM357m.
In the first quarter of 1994, gross traffic revenues rose by 11.5 per cent
to DM3.6bn for the parent company.

FT  17 MAY 94 / BAT pays Dollars 200m for majority stake in Uzbeki tobacco
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TASHKENT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK cigarette and insurance giant, is to take a majority
stake in the state-owned tobacco industry of the former Soviet republic of
Uzbekistan.
The agreement, under which BAT will invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) during
the next five years, represents the first large foreign investment in the
central Asian republic since the government announced its economic reform
programme in January.
The deal mirrors that struck by BAT's US rival Philip Morris in neighbouring
Kazakhstan last year. Both cover support for local tobacco farmers as well
as investment in processing and manufacturing plants. 'We won't actually own
the land on which the tobacco is grown but we will provide advisory services
to farmers,' said BAT.
It believes that Uzbekistan is the more attractive of the two republics with
a slightly bigger market, about 25bn cigarettes a year, and much higher
tobacco production.
The state factories are currently supplying less than 4bn cigarettes a year
with the balance met largely by imports from other former Soviet republics.
BAT said the priority was to increase the quantity and quality of Uzbek-made
cigarettes rather than build brands. It hopes eventually to introduce its
own international brands at the top of the market.
BAT also saw an export opportunity for Uzbeki tobacco leaf. 'We believe we
could get it to a grade that is acceptable on the international tobacco
market,' it said. The 'oriental' tobacco grown in central Asia is used in
blended American cigarettes such as BAT's Lucky Strike.
Uzbekistan has lagged behind Kazakhstan in economic liberalisation, and
western investors remain slightly sceptical about its economic reform
programme.
The government has recently sought a support agreement with the
International Monetary Fund for its currency, the som, which it hopes will
reassure international investors and bankers that it is serious about
reform.
BAT expects to start generating profits from Uzbekistan within two to three
years, although it would not start taking out dividends for about five
years. It plans to invest Dollars 50m over the next two years to refurbish
the existing tobacco factory in Tashkent and Dollars 140m to build a new
factory in Samarkand.
The Uzbeki investment is by far the largest in the former eastern bloc by
BAT, which has joint ventures in Hungary and Ukraine.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Part-time move for AA insurance staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AA Insurance Services, one of the UK's biggest motor and home insurance
retailers, is to switch many of its 5,100 staff to more flexible labour
contracts in response to the growth of telephone insurance companies such as
Direct Line.
This will mean further part-time working for the mainly female labour force
as the company seeks to reduce costs and increase the efficiency and
flexibility of its network of 250 shops.
More details will come next month when the company, which is in talks with
unions about the changes, announces an overhaul of its operations.
Like other chains of insurance shops, the AA has lost business over the past
three years to Direct Line and other 'direct writers', insurers which sell
by telephone directly to the public, bypassing the industry's traditional
middlemen.
Recent price competition in motor insurance has also put extra pressure on
margins. Shops which typically obtain a commission from insurers of between
10 and 15 per cent on business sold have seen their income squeezed by
recent falls in premium rates.
'There is a fundamental change in the amount of margin available as a reward
for distributing insurance products,' said Mr Mark Wood, who became AA
Insurance Services managing director earlier this year.
The AA expects the amount of commissions on motor insurance available to the
country's brokers and intermediaries to fall from Pounds 700m in 1992 to
Pounds 435m in 1995.
Mr Wood said the competitive pressures faced by chains of insurance shops
from the 'direct writers' were similar to those faced by supermarkets from
discount warehouses.
The number of AA Insurance part-time staff has increased from 420 in 1988 to
more than 1,400 and seems likely to rise further as greater flexibility is
introduced to shop opening hours, with evening and Saturday afternoon
opening.
'Frequently insurance brokers tend to say: 'Let's open our offices when
everyone is at work'. We need to turn that on its head,' said Mr Wood.
'The industry is very confused about the retailing proposition. There is a
traditional view of us being a service like an accountant or a solicitor.'
The AA recognised that more consumers were prepared to buy insurance over
the telephone, but Mr Wood insisted that the group's network of shops made
it ideally placed to offer follow-up on claims and alterations to policies
which customers frequently preferred to handle on a face-to-face basis.
Recent moves by companies such as Burton and Sock Shop indicate a growing
trend towards part-time employment in retailing.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Brown's support ebbs as Blair seeks backing from Labour left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Support for Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, was ebbing rapidly among
Labour MPs yesterday as Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, put out
feelers to the left in his attempt to succeed Mr John Smith as party leader.
Mr Blair was believed to be seeking the endorsement of Mr Robin Cook, shadow
trade and industry secretary, who is one of two potential leftwing
candidates for the leadership.
Mr Cook is picking up support from the small group of hard-left Labour MPs,
but his backers among soft-left and Scottish MPs believe he would be well
advised to reach an agreement with Mr Blair because he cannot win the
leadership.
If support for Mr Brown continues to fade, such a deal would open the way
for a straight fight between Mr Blair and Mr John Prescott, the centre-left
employment secretary.
Friends of Mr Prescott said Mr Blair would 'definitely' face a contest for
the leadership, even if all the other candidates withdrew. 'The party will
demand an election,' one said.
Some MPs said the leadership race would be simplified if Mrs Margaret
Beckett, deputy leader, entered the contest. Mrs Beckett is not expected to
run, but her candidacy - which would also create a deputy leadership vacancy
 -would open the way for a virtually unstoppable right-left ticket teaming
Mr Blair with Mr Cook.
The rapid growth of support for Mr Blair may reduce the contest to two
candidates shortly after campaigning begins following the funeral of Mr
Smith in Edinburgh on Friday.
Candidates for the leadership are avoiding public campaigning until after
the funeral, in deference to the wishes of Mr Smith's family and the shadow
cabinet. Mr Blair withdrew from a scheduled speech to a police audience, and
Mr Brown cancelled a planned visit to south Wales.
However, Mr David Blunkett, party chairman, said the party was already
suffering from election 'hype' in spite of requests for 'the dignity that
John Smith deserves'.
He said Labour's national executive committee would probably decide next
week to complete the election by the end of the third week in June.
Mr Blunkett dismissed a call from Mr John Evans, the MP for St Helens and a
member of Labour's organisation committee, for the election to be held at
the party conference in September.
'For this to go on through August and September is not a happy prospect for
the Labour party and ugly for Britain as a whole,' he said.
Friends of Mr Brown said he believed many MPs would rally to his cause next
week, but only one MP gave his public support yesterday and prominent
members of his Scottish powerbase said they would back him with 'reluctance'
if he insisted on entering the final stages.
Mr Brown's camp also believes that he has greater backing among constituency
and trade union activists than Mr Blair, but said he would not risk a battle
for the centre-right vote if support for Mr Blair continued to harden.

FT  17 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Barclays Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having ploughed headlong into the commercial property slump, Barclays is
trying to manage its way out. By issuing property-linked bonds to investors,
the bank has created a useful hedge against its outstanding loans to
property companies. If Barclays has done its sums right, pain caused by any
worsening of the commercial property market will be offset by the pleasure
of repaying the bonds at less than face value.
But the Pounds 150m Barclays hopes to raise is only a drop in the ocean when
set against its Pounds 4bn outstanding property loans. Nor does yesterday's
issue transfer credit risk off the bank's balance sheet, so no additional
capital is released. Were that its aim, Barclays might securitise some of
its property assets or sell troubled loans in the secondary market. Both
techniques have been used extensively by US banks. But securitisation is
more expensive to arrange than yesterday's index-linked bond, while the
secondary market price for troubled debt is unattractive.
With property loans down to around 7 per cent of UK assets from 9 per cent
at the peak, Barclays' over-exposure to property certainly looks less acute.
Commercial property bulls might even question the decision to reduce
exposure going into the upturn. Still, fund managers of that persuasion
could always back their judgment by selling Barclays shares and buying its
new bonds instead.

FT  17 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: De La Rue/Portals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before the recent run-up in Portals' shares, De La Rue stood little
chance of winning the paper maker on the cheap. Portals enjoys a strong
market position in bank note paper, backed up by anti-fraud technology. With
a good record of cash generation, an ungeared balance sheet and dividend
cover of two times, there is no question of financial distress. While
efforts at diversification have been at times puzzling, Portals' management
has made a decent fist of steering the group through recession.
The question is whether De La Rue's industrial logic is compelling enough to
justify the full price Portals' shareholders would rightly demand.
Integrating printing and papermaking would give De La Rue access to Portals'
technology and a list of customers broader than its own. That could open
opportunities for selling machinery or other services. But such vertical
integration carries risks. If De La Rue took all of Portals' paper
production it would lose the flexibility to pick and choose its suppliers.
If Portals was still selling to all-comers, customers might resent it being
swallowed up.
If De La Rue makes a full bid, these arguments will doubtless get a full
airing. If the logic is so persuasive, though, De La Rue will have to
explain why it overlooked the synergies until now. The group has been
looking for acquisitions and holding net cash since its rights issue in
1991. This time last year Portals was trading at little more than half
yesterday's closing price.

FT  17 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Whitbread
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having restructured its capital in a way that would permit it to raise
equity on the market, Whitbread has ironically ended up with virtually no
gearing. Though yesterday's results were in line with expectations, the 2
per cent fall in its share price may reflect the company's reticence about
how it intends to use this balance sheet strength. Capital spending will
increase by around Pounds 100m a year, allowing the group to capture
continuing growth from its hotels and pub retailing businesses. But the
extra outlay will simply prevent Whitbread from piling up cash; it will not
absorb its considerable borrowing capacity.
The questions are thus whether and when the market will start to show
sustained signs of impatience. There are grounds for suggesting Whitbread
can afford to wait. The cash inflow from the sale of its regional brewing
stakes will not dilute earnings this year. Growth elsewhere will continue to
offset weakness in brewing. The decision not to buy Chef &amp; Brewer shows an
aversion to over-paying for acquisitions. With Sir Michael Angus and Mr
Peter Jarvis at the helm, Whitbread promises sensible and well-articulated
strategic decisions.
Just the same there is a worrisome hint of drift. Whitbread says it wants to
remain in brewing, which generates a lot of cash. But transfer pricing
changes will reduce the stated return on brewing and may make other parts of
the business more attractive targets for investment. Strategic dithering
will make the comparison with Scottish &amp; Newcastle doubly unflattering if
the latter's acquisition of Chef &amp; Brewer turns out to be an unqualified
success.

FT  17 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Dutch auction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Does it make sense to privatise a telecoms operator in tandem with a post
office? The Netherlands thinks so. KPN, whose preliminary prospectus was
published yesterday, combines both telephone and postal services. Part of
the thinking is that steady profits from PTT Post will help PTT Telecom in
its more volatile market.
PTT Post is in better shape than most European post offices. It is not only
profitable but has been making inroads into foreign markets by offering bulk
remailing services - to the chagrin of Britain's Post Office. Even so, the
combination with PTT Telecom is unfortunate. Telecommunications is viewed by
most international investors as the more exciting industry, so the
association with PTT Post may drag down KPN's share price. Equally, the
uniqueness of a quoted postal company would have been enhanced if it had
been floated separately.
That apart, the KPN flotation looks like being a success. The indicative
price range of Fl 46 to Fl 52 seems conservative on most of the yardsticks
used to value international telecoms stocks. KPN's prospective
price-earnings ratio of 12 compares with 17 at recently privatised Tele
Danmark and 13 at BT. Equally, the prospective yield of 4.5 is higher than
Tele Danmark's 3.6, though lower than BT's 5.7.
Moreover, KPN's regulatory climate is fairly benign. Plans to license a
second Dutch telecoms operator are making only slow progress. Meanwhile, PTT
Telecom's tariffs are allowed to rise in line with inflation. BT, by
contrast, not only faces an army of competitors but is required to cut its
prices by the inflation rate minus 7.5 percentage points.

FT  17 MAY 94 / The best lines of defence: The political and commercial
challenges facing Europe's arms industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the cold logic of commerce were the only factor, then the French foreign
legion would be using bullets from Lancashire, and French shells would be
whizzing across the British army's training ground on Salisbury plain.
Such a pooling of resources between munitions makers makes business sense.
As tensions have eased after the cold war, almost every western country has
been quick to claim the peace dividend, and governments have trimmed defence
budgets as a proportion of gross national product.
At least on paper, European countries are committed to the principle of
pooling arms procurement efforts as companies grapple with declines in both
domestic and foreign sales. Mr John Weston, chairman of British Aerospace
defence, is confident that talks on collaboration between Royal Ordnance,
the BAe subsidiary which makes bullets, and Giat of France will bear fruit.
But before this happens, both companies will have to satisfy a small caveat
from the UK Ministry of Defence. If the UK has to use French bullets, then
France has to use British ones. As a ministry official put it: 'Any
dependence must be mutual.'
This lingering wariness between Europe's ancient nations means the
continent's defence industry is not streamlining as fast as its counterpart
in the US. As American groups rationalise and regroup, Europe's politicians
and industrialists are still searching for ways to follow suit without
sacrificing all their secrets and sovereignty.
The commercial rationale for consolidation is equally powerful on both sides
of the Atlantic. Throughout the western world export sales are in decline.
At constant 1991 prices, Britain, France and the US saw total arms exports
fall from Dollars 25.7bn in 1987 to Dollars 14.4bn in 1991.
In the US, the response to this challenge has been rapid. The plunge in
government arms purchases - to about Dollars 40bn next year from Dollars
120bn a decade earlier at constant 1993 prices - has already prompted an
extensive restructuring in the industry. General Dynamics has sold its
tactical aircraft business to Lockheed, its missiles operations to Hughes
and its electronic systems to Carlyle. Most recently, Grumman was the target
of a Dollars 2.2bn tug-of-love bid between Northrop and Martin Marietta,
which Northrop won.
Compared with this hectic activity, rationalisation in Europe has been
sluggish. Europe still produces three types of main battle tank, against one
in the US. It is also designing three advanced fighters - the Eurofighter,
the French Rafale and the Swedish Grippen, while the US is concentrating on
one - the Lockheed/Boeing F-22.
The contrast has not gone unnoticed in Europe. Mr Louis Gallois, chairman of
Aerospatiale, the state-owned French group, said in London recently: 'Not
without government intention and support, the American aerospace industry is
completely restructuring. Ignoring merger control and anti-trust
legislation, very profitable mammoth companies are being formed in almost
all product categories.'
Behind these comments lies a gnawing fear that economies of scale will
enable US companies to launch a price war long before Europe has had time to
get its own corporate act together.
There are a few signs that Europe is starting to react. Dasa, the German
aerospace company, announced a plan to cut 16,000 jobs last year; British
Aerospace has been in negotiations for the past 18 months to merge its
missile business with Matra of France; Aerospatiale is in similar talks with
Dasa; the UK defence and automotive group GKN has bought the
helicopter-maker, Westland.
Yet progress has been painfully slow, and there is little consensus on how
European industry should rationalise.
Some, including Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, believe defence is
essentially the business of individual countries, and that larger groupings
will be formed within states rather than between them. For instance, Lord
Weinstock says that GEC and BAe may eventually work together as joint prime
contractors on projects or conceivably pool some defence interests.
Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of the UK tank maker, Vickers, takes a
different view. He sees cross-border co-operation in weapons production as
the most likely way forward: keeping separate the companies making
particular products, but allowing for joint ventures and joint weapons
development.
The vision of cross-border collaboration is shared by Sir David Lees,
chairman of GKN, who says: 'There is no other way forward. The pressures on
stretched budgets are driving towards more collaborative programmes.'
The most spectacular multinational project to date is Eurofighter. This
Pounds 32bn bid by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain to be in the vanguard
of military aircraft technology has divided German opinion. Also in the
pipeline are a Dollars 7bn project to build a new military transporter, the
Future Large Aircraft (see chart); a Franco-German armoured car; and a
frigate involving Britain, France and Italy.
As technology becomes more expensive, it may no longer be feasible for any
European country to build a cutting-edge weapons platform alone.
Co-operation therefore sounds appealing and politically prestigious. But
grandiose plans for the future will not remove the need for painful
decisions about current production. Building weapons in more than one
country may make it easier to raise development capital, but it does not
necessarily save money. Overheads and production facilities may be
duplicated unless some countries are prepared to relinquish manufacturing.
Matra, for instance, has decided that collaboration on specific projects is
not a sufficiently radical solution to Europe's cost-cutting problem. It
argues that it needs to pool equity as well as expertise with its European
counterparts to compete with rivals in the US.
But does Europe have to choose between national giants, cross-border project
collaboration, or multinational mergers? Mr Weston of BAe thinks not. He
foresees 'a mixture of national and international mergers to rationalise the
industry'. Nor is he persuaded that Europe is falling behind the US. 'Europe
does have some barriers to overcome which the Americans do not. But then the
European industry probably started to sort itself out long before the US.'
However, as Lord Weinstock points out, European companies cannot be expected
to make strategic decisions until governments have defined their foreign
policy priorities more clearly. 'The defence industry needs direction from
governments, but the situation is far more complex now that the cold war is
over,' he says.
European governments are drawing up a defence shopping list in the light of
a partial, and possibly total, US withdrawal from the continent. This should
be concentrating minds in foreign ministries and boardrooms, but so far
there has been only a stumbling convergence between leading members of the
Western European Union, the embryonic security organisation.
Britain, the standard-bearer of links with the US, now accepts that the
WEU's importance will increase and that in certain conflicts, Europe may act
alone. France, long suspicious of Washington's intentions toward Europe, now
worries about too little US presence in Europe rather than too much.
But key questions about the size and function of Nato remain wide open, and
all discussion of Germany's role will be hypothetical until this summer's
verdict by the constitutional court on whether the Bundeswehr can serve
overseas.
European governments broadly agree on what they need for home defence or to
fight a small version of the Gulf war without US help: mobile armour, a
strategic airlift capacity, satellite intelligence, and early warning
systems to detect and intercept long-range missiles.
Where they do not agree is on what all this implies for the arms industry.
For France, it is axiomatic that European self-sufficiency in arms can only
be attained through self-sufficiency in arms production. With its own budget
under strain, it feels more strongly than ever the need for cross-border
collaboration.
Next week, France and Germany will reaffirm their commitment to establish a
joint arms agency, initially to manage existing projects but with the
possibility of becoming a powerful procurement executive.
There is some scope for mutual advantage between France and Germany in
export markets. France needs German capital and engineering skills, while
Germany sometimes benefits from France's global connections, and its
relative freedom from export restrictions.
German companies are barred by law from exporting arms to areas of actual or
potential tension. Last year's Dollars 3.5bn sale of French tanks with
German engines to the United Arab Emirates looked like a neat way round that
problem - although even that deal required a special permit by the Bonn
government.
The UK, for its part, does not accept that defending Europe necessarily
implies buying European. For its forthcoming purchase of helicopters, the
British army is thought to favour the US-designed Apache rather than the
Franco-German Tiger. To meet its strategic airlift requirement, it is
keeping open the options of buying more US Hercules aircraft or coming back
to the European Future Large Aircraft, from which it withdrew in 1989.
Even France is conscious of the high price of investing in European
capabilities. Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, has
acknowledged that in pure budgetary terms, it might be better for France to
buy Hercules aircraft. He has even suggested that both FLA and the
four-nation NH-90 helicopter may have to be axed unless production costs can
be trimmed by 20 per cent. However, he remains committed to both projects
because of their importance for European industry.
Other items on the European wish-list will be even more expensive. France
has virtually completed one military satellite programme, the Helios, with
help from Spain and Italy, but it cannot drum up much enthusiasm for further
space extravaganzas.
While seeking financial help from its European partners, France is
traditionally reluctant to share sensitive technology. Recent defence
ministry documents state clearly that the country no longer has the money to
be self-sufficient in defence electronics or weapon-building material. But
its insistence on independence in nuclear matters is undiminished.
Nuclear technology is proving increasingly costly, but among European states
which do not trust each other enough to make bullets, such strategic
collaboration is even harder. Besides, while France is protective of its own
nuclear secrets, Britain's relationship with the US prevents it from passing
on American technology to other countries.
The most ambitious European dream of all would be the construction of a
strategic anti-missile defence system to rival America's now-defunct Star
Wars plan. The military case may be growing, as rocket technology becomes
available to increasing numbers of uncomfortably close and potentially
unstable countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
However, even the US has been forced to curtail its aspirations in the field
of anti-missile defences. So it seems unlikely that Europe will be able to
raise the enormous sums necessary to implement such flights of fancy. At a
more practical level, even a streamlined European defence industry may not
be able to afford to design a shield against low-technology Scud missiles of
the kind used in Yemen over the past few days.
Such large-scale projects would require clarity of military purpose,
political will and industrial cohesion - all of which are lacking at the
moment. Ironically, the end of the cold war, which has brought such savings
for the US, may increase the burden on the European taxpayer. Politicians
may be called upon to explain to voters that they face a peace levy and not
a peace dividend, if the continent is to defend itself without US help. To
make matters worse, the political challenge coincides with intensifying
competition from American defence contractors which can merge and co-operate
without hand-wringing over technology transfers and issues of sovereignty.
As one European expert put it: 'The US is rationalising over three to five
years. Europe is moving over 10 to 15 years. That is the kind of gap you
just don't close.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Revisionism on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The conventional wisdom among pensions experts in the UK has long favoured
final salary related occupational pensions over schemes that peg benefits to
average salary, or to the returns on the investment of fixed contributions
to a fund. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) can thus expect a
sceptical response from the pensions establishment to its latest report on
pensions policy, which argues that the risk in defined contribution schemes
has been overstated, and that the defined benefit system may be delivering a
worse deal to a majority of people. Others will welcome the IFS's pioneering
attempt to quantify the different returns to pensioners under defined
benefit and defined contribution arrangements respectively. This, together
with a readiness to question longstanding assumptions, is overdue.
The prejudice in favour of defined benefits has its roots in the experience
of rising inflation in the 1960s and 1970s, when the link to final salary
provided a measure of badly needed protection against rising prices, and
employment patterns were relatively stable. Antipathy towards defined
contribution pensions, meantime, was strengthened by the experience of stock
market crashes in 1974 and 1987.
Renewed inflation
Today circumstances are very different. No one, admittedly, could afford to
ignore the threat of renewed inflation for the purposes of long-term pension
planning. But the pattern of employment in the UK is no longer so heavily
geared to large companies providing long-term stable employment. The
financial markets are able to provide a wider array of instruments with
which to hedge against market volatility. And the political climate is more
hostile to the paternalism that has been the driving force behind an
entirely desirable build-up in private-sector occupational pensions.
In essence pensions are a form of insurance. The IFS authors make the
important point that the two main forms of private pension provision insure
against different things. Defined benefit plans, which take the form of a
promise related to final pay, insure against uncertainty about capital
market returns. Defined contribution schemes, in contrast, insure against
the risk of fluctuating earnings and the loss of jobs.
Using data from the 1988-89 UK retirement survey, and on a plausible set of
assumptions, the authors conclude that three-fifths of the people in a
sample of 3,500 would have enjoyed higher benefits in a defined contribution
plan. A privileged minority of mainly better off, male, long-staying
employees, they find, have been feather-bedded by the majority.
Wider concerns
This is not particularly surprising, in that so-called early leavers are
known to have made a substantial subsidy to long stayers because of
inadequate inflation-proofing of deferred pensions. But the extent of the
cross-subsidy appears greater than many had assumed. Can the legitimate
requirement of paternalistic employers to attract and retain good employees
really justify such a hugely redistributive process, especially when there
are wider policy concerns about the adverse impact of the cross-subsidy on
labour mobility?
It is still possible to argue about the relative merits of the two systems
in the light of different assumptions that could be made about inflation and
investment returns in future. But in practice defined contribution schemes
are growing rapidly because they match the requirements of today's labour
market better than the alternative. And even if the economic arguments are
deemed inconclusive, subject to further research, the wider case for defined
benefits is strong.
Such schemes are transparent and preclude cross-subsidy. They do not
incorporate any incentive to sack older workers, whose pension rights become
more expensive in defined benefit schemes as retirement approaches. They
cannot be so easily milked by directors who bump up pre-retirement salaries
at huge actuarial cost to the fund and thus to shareholders. More work needs
to be done to find ways of reducing the capital market threat to the value
of the pension on the date of retirement. But when City ingenuity provides a
satisfactory answer to that problem, the government should give greater
encouragement to comp-any-backed defined benefit plans.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Leading Article: IT's not a knockout
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that General Motors plans to sell its majority stake in Electronic
Data Systems, its large computer services affiliate, suggest the world's
biggest vehicle maker is not just seeking to raise badly needed cash, but
may be abandoning what was once a mainstay of corporate strategy. As well as
promising relief to its hard-pressed shareholders, GM's apparent rethink
holds salutary lessons for managers of other businesses who are tempted to
view information technology as their competitive salvation.
Purchased for Dollars 2.5bn a decade ago when GM was flush with funds, EDS
has proved a spectacularly profitable investment. However, it has not met
GM's original goals. One was to match Japanese car manufacturers' crushing
productivity advantage by using EDS's computer wizardry to revolutionise
GM's antiquated production facilities. Another was to provide a path for
diversifying into fast-growing IT markets.
These hopes have been disappointed because the industrial logic was flawed.
With hindsight, the acquisition seems to have been motivated by a desire
among GM's top managers to escape from, rather than tackle head-on, a legacy
of industrial decay. Dazzled by IT, a market they did not understand, they
failed to see EDS for what it was. In reality, the company's factory
automation experience is minimal. Its success is based on processing large
volumes of data efficiently for outside clients - notably the US government
 -and aggressive salesmanship. It is a business closer to the economics of
the laundry than to rocket science.
Magic bullet
GM's recent gains in productivity and market share have been largely due to
the pursuit of down-to-earth objectives. These include renewed emphasis on
flexible working practices, quality, sourcing, product design and marketing.
Such steps are indispensable to the company's recovery. The idea that
massive investment in computers and robotics could avoid them was always
suspect.
Yet faith in IT as a magic bullet lives on, in governments as well as
businesses. The latest convert is the Clinton administration, which is
backing a range of commercial high-technology projects in the belief that
they will yield above-average economic and competitive benefits. But the
belief is based on shaky evidence. An exhaustive recent study of
manufacturing productivity by McKinsey, the management consultants, failed
to unearth any company which had succeeded mainly because of superior
high-technology.
Short-lived gain
That is not to belittle IT's importance to business. By rendering obsolete
many middle-management functions, powerful electronic information systems
have provided much impetus for the recent trend towards corporate
'down-sizing'. By linking the world's main financial centres, they have
vastly accelerated capital mobility. And by tearing down barriers between
computing, entertainment and telecommunications, they are revolutionising
the delivery of media to homes and workplaces.
However, for individual companies, IT alone procures only short-lived
competitive gain. That is true even in service industries, such as banking
and retailing, which are its most intensive users. While IT has encouraged
product innovations, notably in retail banking, these are usually easily
copied by competitors. As a consequence, it has ceased to guarantee enduring
advantage in financial markets and become simply a prerequisite of survival.
In retailing, reliance on IT to generate market research data has helped
some retailers challenge branded manufacturers' franchises. These gains,
however, depended crucially on sustained investment in efficient
distribution, supplier networks and just-in-time delivery systems.
To view IT as a means of erecting competitive barriers is erroneous. Its
real impact is to level them and make it easier for new competitors to enter
markets. Though it can enable the fleet-footed to draw maximum advantage
from shrewd judgment, entrepreneurship, innovation and sound organisation,
it cannot substitute for these qualities. Still less can it exonerate
managers from the consequences of their past neglect.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If, as seems increasingly likely, William Donaldson decides not to seek a
second term next year, the New York Stock Exchange may well look no further
than his current number two, NYSE president Richard Grasso, for its next
chairman.
The diminutive Grasso is the ultimate insider (in the nicest possible
sense). He joined the exchange in 1968 as a corporate listings
representative, and has since learnt almost every aspect of the NYSE's
business on his way up.
He has built up close relationships with the frontline troops, the
specialists, who have an important say in the choice of their chairman. 'He
is very much liked on the floor, because he spends a lot of time there and
really understands the needs of the specialists,' one former NYSE executive
points out.
The fact that Grasso looks and talks more like a trader than the current
incumbent also does no harm. During his tenure, the more aloof Donaldson has
never been much of a hit on the floor.
Grasso also happens to be the market's technology chief, which ought to
count for even more. At least he should be aware of the complexities of
dragging the world's largest floor-based exchange into the 21st century.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What with all the Channel tunnel pomp and the D-day landings razzmatazz, it
is perhaps to be expected that another little marker in the history of
Anglo-French merry-making has been allowed to slip by virtually unnoticed.
Last month was the 90th anniversary of the entente cordiale, an
'understanding' cobbled together by Lord Lansdowne, Britain's foreign
secretary, and Paul Cambon, the French ambassador in London. Roughly
speaking, the French conceded that the lobster was a fish, in return for
control of various small corners of west Africa.
Although Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, and Alain Juppe, his
opposite number, had a spot of dinner to mark the occasion, the anniversary
had been otherwise ignored.
Step forward the British Business Lunch Club in Copenhagen. It has invited
French businessmen to a celebratory lunch on May 28 (50 days late, but who's
counting?) where the British commercial attache, Anthony Layden, and his
French counterpart, Bruno Caron, will debate to what extent the hole under
la Manche threatens to destabilise the entente cordiale.

Maybe Yasuhiro Nakasone shouldn't be written off just yet. The domestic
reputation of Japan's prime minister between 1982 and 1987 may be tainted by
involvement in one of the country's many bribery scandals, but he is still
in demand as an international elder statesman.
A colleague bumped into him in Geneva recently, where he was advising the
United Nations on next year's 50th anniversary celebrations, and was
surprised to find him just as keen to talk domestic Japanese politics as
international affairs.
Nakasone's view is that an early realignment of Japan's political parties is
on the cards to restore much-needed stability.
He won't predict who will cuddle up to whom, but says any new grouping will
share a common view on that all-important relationship with Washington.
In such circumstances would he be tempted to re-enter Japan's political
fray? Given that Nakasone turns 77 this month, it's hard to believe he would
want - let alone get - a big political job again. But he refuses to rule
himself out entirely by echoing General MacArthur: 'Old soldiers never die .

Bernard Tapie, France's much-investigated businessman cum politician, seems
to have added an offshore tax problem to his many woes - in the shape of his
splendiferous yacht.
Currently away from her usual berth undergoing repairs, the Phocea,
so-called to evoke the ancient name for Marseille, normally bobs about right
in front of the town hall in the midst of the city where Tapie would be
mayor.
But the French authorities are threatening to take the wind out of Phocea's
sails. Until now, the four-masted, 74-metre schooner, purchased a decade ago
from the widow of racing sailor Alain Colas, has been registered as a
'commercial' vessel. Hence Tapie has been able to treat large renovation
expenses as a business tax deduction - not to mention escape paying VAT when
the yacht was originally imported from Tahiti.
Now the tax people are jibbing at the boat's commercial status, and are also
investigating whether Tapie may have used money from his various companies
in order to help with the lovely lady's very considerable running costs.
Another interested party has also surfaced. According to its new president
Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais has slapped a lien on the yacht as
security for Tapie's unrepaid debts to the bank.
Tapie's own cork-like properties, meanwhile, were amply demonstrated when an
Ifop poll, published in the weekly Journal du Dimanche, showed the Marseille
deputy to be the 14th most popular person in France.
Not a single other politician makes it into the top 15.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Referendum on European constitution
is required
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERNEST WISTRICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly ('The right question time', May 10) supports the European
Movement's call for a referendum on any major reforms that might emerge
after the 1996 intergovernmental conference on political union. Yet he sees
no need to examine the actual proposals on the grounds that Mr Major is
unlikely to support them. This is a pity, for the European Movement's
proposals are largely in line with the views of the European Parliament and
those of the overwhelming majority of political leaders in other EU
countries.
If we in Britain are not to remain totally isolated from our partners on the
future of European integration, a reasoned debate on the subject in this
country would be in our national interest.
The European Movement wants the European institutions to be more
democratically accountable and thus narrow the yawning gap between them and
the general public. That is why it recommends that all European legislation
should be enacted in the open by exposing the secretive law-making of the
Council of Ministers to public scrutiny and ensuring that all European laws
and actions are subject to democratic approval by the European Parliament.
A written constitution, defining the rights and duties of European citizens
and specifying which of these are to be exercised by the European
institutions, is surely the best way to make the European Union
comprehensible to the public.
Such a constitution could only become generally acceptable if it were
approved by a referendum of all the European citizens.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Growth is not the only fruit: The economic upturn in
Australia may prove difficult to sustain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a long time since Australia called itself 'the lucky country'. After
the post-1987 crashes of debt-laden entrepreneurs, the country has been
struggling in the 1990s to cope with corporate restructuring to meet the
challenge of lower tariff barriers, double-digit unemployment and low
commodity prices.
But in his annual budget speech recently, Mr Ralph Willis, the self-effacing
treasurer, not only invoked the old 1960s label - a reference to Australia's
vast resources, spread around a small population - but suggested that the
nation was about to go one better.
He talked of annual growth rates at, or above, 4 per cent for the next four
years; of continuing low inflation; and of the budget deficit - ADollars
13.6bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in the current year - falling away to nothing by the
late-1990s.
All this, he suggested, was the product of a recharged economy and could be
achieved with few government initiatives. Assets, such as the government's
remaining stake in the Qantas airline, would be sold this year, raising
ADollars 2.5bn. But there would be no increases in taxes or in the Medicare
levy, Australia's national health surcharge.
The biggest new expenditure item - a four-year jobs programme, designed to
tackle an umemployment rate of 10.1 per cent and scheduled to cost more than
ADollars 1bn in 1994-95 - would be funded by higher tax receipts resulting
from the upturn in economic activity.
'Australia,' he concluded, in a rare flash of oratorical style, 'has
probably never been better placed to achieve a prolonged period of high
economic and employment growth.'
Australians, not given to enthusiastic credulity, blinked. 'A gamble on
growth', decided the newspapers. 'The budget's deficit figures and growth
forecast are a total fudge,' de-clared Mr John Hewson, leader of the
coalition opposition.
So who is right - a mild-mannered treasurer, renowned for caution, or a wary
public?
In the post-budget round of seminars and speeches, Mr Willis has been
anxious to spell out how unexceptional his predictions are. 'I'm not a
gambling man and never have been,' he told Sydney businessmen. 'The growth
forecasts were a realistic appraisal, provided we continue to play our cards
right.'
He pointed out that the Australian economy was already growing at an annual
rate of 4 per cent, and that the nation had sustained growth rates of more
than 4.5 per cent for several years in the 1980s.
However, this upturn in economic activity is very recent, and many people
are still trying to understand it. The 4 per cent rise in gross domestic
product in 1993 was largely due to a spurt in the final quarter, when growth
was 1.7 per cent. Even in the cities, recessionary fears are only just
beginning to fade. While chic Sydney restaurants are well-attended, they are
not packed. As one Melbourne-based economist put it: 'This doesn't feel like
a boom.'
Even Mr Willis admits that it will take a strong revival in business
investment to push the growth rate up to the forecast of 4.5 per cent in
1994-95. The government's own figures predict that business investment will
have grown by a miserly 1 per cent in the year to the end of June, yet Mr
Willis is talking of a 14.5 per cent rise next fiscal year.
Some observers claim this is unrealistic. 'It's ridiculous,' says Mr Stephen
Kates, economist for the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Recent
surveys of business confidence by the chamber have shown improvements in
sentiment, but only to levels that are 'in general, satisfactory'. Mr Kates
worries that real interest rates (adjusted for inflation) are rising, and
that many companies face labour cost-related pressures - for example, on the
superannuation front, as responsibility for pension funding is shifted to
the private sector. In addition, profits growth in small and medium-sized
companies may be lagging behind that in the quoted corporate sector.
Critics also cite a tendency by Australian companies to invest offshore  -
notably in Asia - and to continue to search for efficiency gains, rather
than invest in new capacity.
But there are more optimistic voices. Mr Paul Simons, chairman of
Woolworths, one of the nation's largest retailers, describes the 14.5 per
cent uplift in investment as 'not unrealistic'. His company's capital
expenditure has increased from ADollars 150m in the early 1990s to ADollars
200m in 1994, and will head towards ADollars 250m next year. 'I don't think
we're unrepresentative . . . There comes a time when you must catch up,' he
comments.
Mr Bill Shields, chief economist at Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based
investment bank, points out the turnround predicted by Mr Willis is 'not out
of synch' with experience in the mid-1970s and 1980s.
If business investment is one potential obstacle to the treasurer's
objectives, a second question mark hangs over the current account. In the
past, Australia has tended to lurch from boom to bust, and part of the
problem has stemmed from instability on the balance of payments front, as
imports have shot up. This could be a worry for the government once again:
if business investment surges too late, and all at once, imports (of capital
equipment and the like) are likely to get sucked in, and the balance of
payments position could go badly out of kilter.
The test will be whether Australia's efforts to create a competitive,
internationally focused manufacturing sector really have developed a
stronger export base.
Third, there is the question of whether low inflation can be maintained,
particularly if labour costs rise. For the past 10 years, Australia has had
a centralised 'wages policy', thanks to a series of accords between the
ruling Labor government and the unions. The current accord is still in
place, but government efforts to encourage enterprise bargaining - that is,
wage agreements struck at individual company level - mean an increasing
number of workers fall outside this centralised framework.
While decentralised wage agreements can help to contain labour cost
inflation, because ailing or inefficient industries are not obliged to pay a
centrally agreed wage rise, it is unclear whether workers will be more
aggressive in their demands if prosperous companies start to award more
substantial pay increases.
At the end of the day, few commentators claim that the treasurer is wrong,
just that his scenario makes crucial assumptions. If the economy fails to
meet growth expectations, perhaps because business investment is sluggish,
Mr Willis's strategy would go awry. In that case, the government's deficit
reduction target would be met only through tax increases or fairly big cuts
in spending. For political reasons, the former is more likely - and that
would not be so lucky.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD DAVISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his otherwise thorough analysis of pupil numbers in the independent
sector ('Sums don't add up', 13 May), John Authers gives the impression that
overspending during the 1980s on 'luxury items such as swimming pools and
sports halls' was responsible for rising school fees.
What actually happened during the 1980s was that all educational costs,
independent and state, went up.
Between 1984 and 1991, average fees at ISIS schools increased by 94 per cent
in cash terms. Over the same period, unit costs in state schools rose by 86
per cent.
Teachers' salaries - which account for up to three-quarters of a school's
costs - are the principal reason for this rise, which may have been less
obvious to the taxpayer than to the independent school parent.
If independent schools are to maintain a competitive advantage, they must
employ high quality teachers. They must also invest in their plant.
Parents of boarders expect modern accommodation standards. All parents
expect schools to be equipped for the rapidly changing demands of the modern
curriculum.
And although only 42 per cent of independent schools have got one, I am sure
that neither Iain Sproat, sports minister, nor John Patten would regard a
sports hall as a 'luxury Item'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / The young pretender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is getting dangerous. If Mr Tony Blair is chosen to succeed Mr John
Smith, we shall have to consider voting Labour. The last time I did that was
in 1964, or it could have been 1966. Those days are now long gone. It is as
if we have been beamed up to a different planet, with Labour or a large
section of it left behind. The party may show by its selection of a new
leader that it has at last caught up, that it understands how different our
polity has become. If so, British public life will be transformed. We would
see a break in the gloom that began to descend after April 1988, when
Thatcherism peaked out.
Did I say gloom? Look around. The electorate is trapped. We either continue
with a moribund Tory government, or take a chance with a party many of us
mistrust. Only something completely fresh, like a totally remodelled Labour
party, could break such an impasse. Voters would enjoy the forgotten luxury
of real choice. A majority might decide that the kindest way to treat the
Conservatives would be to put them out to grass for a season or two. There
would be little fear, as there was in April 1992, of Labour atavism.
The people's party might even win an overall working majority, although I
would not bet on it. Just as likely, many who might have voted Liberal
Democrat in 1992 but were deterred by the apprehension that that would lead
to a Lab-Lib coalition will not be so put off in 1996 or 1997. Either way,
the opposition would take over. The reason is plain. It is best expressed in
a wry remark attributed to an unnamed Conservative MP in one of the Sunday
papers. People will vote for Mr Blair, said this phantom Tory, 'without
feeling they are voting for Labour'.
The young pretender will thank nobody for recycling that observation. It
expresses what his enemies consider to be his fatal flaw. The widespread
endorsement of Mr Blair's candidacy by the newspapers is also said to be
resented by Labour activists. The correct response is: grow up. If Labour
insists on being led by whoever is most disliked by the media, it is not
serious about victory. If it only feels comfortable with whoever most
accurately personifies the traditions of a party four times rejected by the
electorate, it will lose again. As Mr Kinnock would argue, the real
sufferers would be the poor and the disadvantaged, the very people Labour
exists to help.
This is not to say that Mr Blair is superhuman. He may or may not prove to
be a good leader. Whether or not he is chosen will tell us more about the
Labour party than it does about him. We already know of several counts
against him, not the least of which is that he is without experience of
office. If he becomes leader, he will fall under a sharper spotlight than
has yet played upon his boyish young features. If he has faults of
personality, they will be revealed. If not, some of the tabloids will invent
them. Short of changing its name, his programme for modernising the Labour
party is about as radical as you could imagine. If he presses ahead with it
he risks internal rows. If he holds back, he will be derided for his
caution. Whatever he does, the fawning that has attended his putative
candidacy is likely to be replaced, should he win the prize, by scepticism.
His advantage is the subconscious perception that his beliefs have their
roots in Christianity, as did those of Mr Smith. Mr Gordon Brown, the
alternative 'modernist' contender for the Labour leadership, is seen in a
different light. Ostensibly as reform-minded as Mr Blair, Mr Brown was in
early life an intellectual of the now old-fashioned socialist left. Britain
is more likely to restore social democracy in the name of Jesus Christ than
of Karl Marx. To be fair, Marx would not recognise Mr Brown's contemporary
utterances, which are similar though not identical to those of Mr Blair. Yet
the shadow chancellor's intensity, his fierce attention to his anger, his
apparent lack of self-confidence, work against him. If you voted for Mr
Brown you would know that you were voting Labour.
Mr Blair's philosophy is expressed in a foreword to Reclaiming the Ground,
essays published last year by Hodder and Stoughton and the Christian
Socialist Movement. On the cover is a photograph of Mr John Smith, who
contributed the key chapter. Mr Blair's few pages demonstrate how Labour
could capture ground from the other parties. Try this: 'There is right and
wrong. There is good and bad. We all know this, of course, but it has become
fashionable to be uncomfortable about such language.' Tory minister after
Tory minister has tripped up with 'back to basics' of this sort, but in a
Labour leader it could be an asset. Or try: Christianity . . .'is about the
union between individual and community, the belief that we are not stranded
in helpless isolation, but owe a duty both to others and to ourselves and
are, in a profound sense, dependent on each other to succeed'.
It is probable, given a long enough search, that you might find similar
sentiments expressed by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
treasury, or even, at a stretch, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. This
does not make Mr Blair a closet Conservative. He remains attached to Labour
principles. Anyone who thinks of voting Labour if he leads it should do so
with his or her eyes open. This is no left-wing Tory, but a proponent of
familiar elements of Labour thinking, spoken in language that should be
acceptable to southern opinion. In Reclaiming the Ground he affirms his
belief in equality, adding 'not that we are uniform in character or
position, but on the contrary that despite our differences we are entitled
to be treated equally, without regard to our wealth, race, gender or
standing in society'.
Those of us who can recall 1964 will remember not only the excitement that
preceded the election of the then Mr Harold Wilson but also the long years
of disillusionment that followed. Again, this speaks of the party more than
the man. It was Labour, and the unions, that scuttled 'In Place of Strife,'
the Wilson government's effort to bring order to labour relations. Mr Blair
is likewise just a chap. He is a former barrister who has mastered a couple
of prominent shadow cabinet briefs. A Labour party at ease with the
philosophy he expresses would, however, be more than that. It would refresh
British politics.

place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN HARDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Emu fans ready to move the goalposts' (May 12), risks
perpetuating a myth about the Maastricht convergence criteria. To understand
the treaty's provisions about public finance, it is necessary to appreciate
that there are two relevant protocols, not one. The 60 per cent debt-to-GDP
and 3 per cent deficit-to-GDP ratios are contained in the protocol on the
excessive deficit procedure. The figures are 'reference values'. They form
only part of the criteria to be applied. The treaty requires other factors
to be taken into account by the Commission in deciding whether to invoke the
excessive deficit procedure and by the council in determining whether there
is an excessive deficit, if and when the procedure is invoked.
The second protocol is on the convergence criteria. As regards public
finance, this protocol merely requires that a state shall not be the subject
of a council decision that it has an excessive deficit. It is to this
protocol that the judgment of the German Constitutional Court refers in
pointing out that the treaty only allows the criteria to be changed by a
unanimous council decision, thus ensuring a German right to veto any
weakening of them.
This is clearly correct, but does not mean that the reference values have
become rules. That would not be an interpretation of the treaty, but a
rewriting of it. The treaty as it stands requires a highly complex exercise
of judgment by the Commission and council and allows them a considerable
margin of appreciation.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Venture capital provides lifeline to
Czechs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RUDOLF J MINAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I share Christopher Parkes's opinion ('Old ways hamper new prosperity',
May 9) that there is a dearth of finance capital available for new
enterprises in the Czech Republic. But I would like to add that there is an
alternative source - venture capital, which is beginning to, and should
increasingly, play a meaningful role in financing growth for small
businesses.
In the US and Europe equity capital is an important source of financing and
nurturing new enterprises. According to the European Venture Capital
Association Ecu4.2bn (Pounds 3.2bn) were raised and Ecu4.7bn were invested
by European venture capital firms in 1992. Statistics about the impact of
venture capital on economic growth are similarly impressive.
While foreign direct investment in the Czech Republic has slowed, private
equity investment is taking off. Besides officially-sponsored programmes
such as PHARE and the Czech American Enterprise Fund, at least half a dozen
venture capital firms have sprouted up within the past year to provide
financing and technical assistance to entrepreneurs. It is estimated that
Ecu40m has been raised for investment by venture firms.
For the entrepreneur, venture investment has advantages over debt financing.
Besides providing much-needed equity capital, it provides know-how. Venture
capitalists work actively with the management of their portfolio companies,
contributing their knowledge and experience to help the new businesses grow.
They may also bring strategic partners or other links to foreign markets.
As your article pointed out, many Czechs are reluctant to give up control of
their companies, especially to foreigners.
But according to recent surveys ('The emergence of private sector
manufacturing in the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic', World Bank
Technical Paper 230, November 1993), most entrepreneurs want management and
other training as much as they need capital.
The primary problem is one of education. Most entrepreneurs do not know
about or understand venture capital. In the three years Catalyst has been
placing private equity, we have spent as much time educating Czech companies
about the capital and helping them develop management skills and systems as
we have in arranging finance. Once entrepreneurs understand that equity
participation brings training and technical assistance, they are more
willing to surrender a stake in their enterprise.
The Czech Republic's rapid progress to a market economy stems from a dynamic
private sector. Venture capital is ideally suited to provide the critical
lifeline of capital needed by small and medium-sized companies that have
jump-started the economy.

28). This appears friendly, but there is a danger that Mr Kohl's attitude
might appear condescending.
I was born in Berlin, and I can say that I would never call another person
'Du' unless I was a member of their family, had been at the same school, was
a member of the same club, or had received their express permission to use
it. I do not think French President Francois Mitterrand would be happy if
the German chancellor addressed him as 'tu'.
A British prime minister must be treated with the respect he deserves,
whatever the relationship, which cannot be measured through the voice of an
interpreter.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Arts: Mahler's Sixth - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A weekend at the Barbican framed by illuminating accounts of music from the
early years of our century - Friday brought the first UK performance of
Rimsky- Korsakov's Kashchey the Immortal (1902) - ended with Mahler's Sixth
Symphony (1903-5), given on Sunday by the London Symphony Orchestra under
Michael Tilson Thomas.
The LSO and its principal conductor embark on a complete cycle of Mahler
symphonies in the autumn as part of the orchestra's 90th birthday
celebrations, and this concert provided both a tantalising foretaste of that
series and a welcome opportunity to hear one of the less frequently
performed works.
The Sixth Symphony, a cornerstone of modern orchestral music, was once
regarded as 'difficult'; no British orchestra played it until 1950. Most of
Mahler's symphonies end affirmatively, but the life-and-death struggle of
the Sixth ends in catastrophe. With its atmosphere of unreal, almost
expressionist fantasy, it is a work one stands back from, and Tilson Thomas
was persuasive in drawing the audience in.
Tilson Thomas conducted with his characteristic all-out intensity, favouring
fast tempos and lush orchestral sound. The performance was unrelenting, but
no emotions were lost to speed. The Andante gained in concentration, and
brought forth a stream of lustrous playing. The opening march had grim power
and bite, the 'Alma' theme could hardly have been more passionate. Indeed,
the LSO excelled itself with playing of great beauty and virtuosity.
This was a performance that left very few reservations. But although Tilson
Thomas caught the heaviness the composer directs in the Scherzo (placed
second here), the movement sounded too deliberate. It lost momentum, and
consequently some of its horror.
Perhaps the Barbican Hall acoustics were to blame, but at every appearance
the cowbells clattered intrusively, instead of providing a hazy echo of
Alpine slopes.
Overall, though, Tilson Thomas welded this gigantic work together
impressively. His approach is at once emotional and clear-headed, qualities
Mahler conductors require in equal measure.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Arts: Dostoyevsky's 'The Devils' brought to life - Alastair
Macaulay hails the Maly Theatre's three-part production in Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The climax of the Maly Drama Theatre's current tour has been its three-week
residence in Glasgow. Only in Glasgow, as part of its annual Mayfest splurge
of artistic activity, has this Russian company been able to present all
eight plays in its current British repertory: four at the Citizens Theatre,
four at the Tramway. This is only just, for it is the Tramway's programme
director, Neil Wallace, who has worked hardest to plan the Maly tour. And it
is only at the Tramway that the greatest Maly event of all has occurred -
its three-part, all-day production of Dostoyevsky's The Devils.
To carry superlatives further, I add that this is the most marvellous
theatrical event I have yet seen this year. It is also the first adaptation
of a novel I have seen that can be compared with the RSC's 1980 Nicholas
Nickleby. The scenery - by Eduard Kochergin - is wonderfully effective,
indeed eloquent, but what carries all three parts of The Devils is the
acting. Not only are Dostoyevsky's psychologically extraordinary studies
brought onto the stage, but also the tremendous way in which each leading
character is shown in a completely fresh psychological light in scene upon
scene.
Thus, the first time we see Piotr Verkhovskensky (actor: Sergei Bekhterev),
at Mrs Stavrogin's house, we see him as a socially awkward blabbermouth,
newly returned home, who tries, fairly disastrously, to ingratiate himself.
Scene by scene, however, he emerges as a horrifying nihilist, a pathetic
hero-worshipper, a heartless planner of murders. And we are still seeing new
sides of him in the trilogy's long penultimate scene, during which he
engages in half-ludicrous religious and epistemological debate with
Kirillov, often thereby delaying his own purpose, which is to egg Kirillov
on into committing suicide.
This kind of plasticity of characterisation originates with the genius of
Dostoyevsky, but it is heartstopping to see it achieved in the flesh
onstage. I was amazed at the robust diablerie - dangerous, colossal, warm,
vulnerable, by turns - that Igor Ivanov (so different in his lower-key role
in Stars in the Morning Sky) brought to the role of Lebiadkin. This is the
kind of towering force you can find in records, photos and accounts of
Chaliapin; yet not only have I never really encountered it onstage before,
but Lebiadkin is eventually only a minor role.
Fully as fine are the performances of Piotr Semak as Stavrogin (the work's
most heroic and self-doomed character), Sergei Vlasov as Shatov (whose death
is the most affecting of all because his life has been irradiated by the
most hope), and Sergei Kuryshev as Kirillov (whose mad obsession with
self-extinction is seen as noble, funny, intellectual, pointless, vain by
turns).
It is astonishing that acting in Russian can be so enthralling to
non-Russian-speakers. The Devils makes one grateful for surtitles, and
impatient of them too; they are so needed and helpful amid a complex plot,
yet they are also so inadequate - and, worst, they take one's eyes off the
stage. The Maly actors are performers you want to watch at all times; I
would pay money to watch these actors in these roles simply listening to
each other. Yet this is not particularly 'physical' theatre. These actor
make Russian sound as beautiful as great singers do; and their vocal
eloquence catches character, emotion, mood, in astonishingly natural
abundance.
The staging is by the Maly's director, Lev Dodin. Praise for the acting is
also praise for him, but I also praise the brilliant use of silent imagery
(such as the twice-seen view of a young girl slowly climbing a ladder -
which in due course makes alarming sense) and various sound effects (such as
the distant drumming that so excitingly catches the pounding of Stavrogin's
heart during his great confession). I have only space to skim the surface of
this enthralling production. The Devils must, must, be brought back to
Britain, to other cities. Lucky Glasgow.
The Maly Drama Theatre tours to Newcastle this week and to Nottingham next
week.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Arts: The singular art of success / Review of the work of
Avigdor Arikha and other refreshingly non-avant-garde artists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So much, in any successful artist's career, is a matter of luck. Talent will
out, we say, to which the reply can only be: up to a point, Lord Copper. It
is not to begrudge the Israeli painter, Avigdor Arikha, his long and
continuing success, to take his current exhibition to make the point. Now
65, he has been showing regularly and consistently around the world - Tel
Aviv, London, Zurich, Stockholm, Paris, New York, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Los
Angeles, the Venice and Sao Paulo biennales, definitive group exhibitions
from Washington to Vienna - for more than 30 years. Good luck to him.
It is only when we consider the actual nature of his work that we come in
for the surprise. For here is no darling of the avant-garde, no
conceptualist or latter-day surrealist, no neo-dada, post-Duchampian,
thought-provoking poseur. He is nothing more, nothing less, than a painter
of unexceptionable portraits, figures and still-life, with a delicate touch
and a quick eye for the charming gesture and the intimate detail. He is, in
short, a somewhat old-fashioned and conventional figurative painter and none
the worse for that.
Who would then say that representation is old hat - Arikha paints old hats
rather well: and who can begin to account for such critical success? How is
it that he should be picked out for such shows as 'European Painting in the
70s' (Los Angeles 1974), or 'Art as Art (Venice Biennale 1982), or 'Raphael
and French Art' (Paris 1983)? And how does he come to be painting the
portrait of the keeper of the modern collections at the Tate?
It is not that Arikha is no good. He is a very clever painter, with the gift
of being able to make the simplest line or smudge of paint, or twist and
scrape of the brush, register as the true and lively intended image. His
prints are especially impressive in this way, with the subtlest effects
achieved by the simplest means. His chief fault is only that he seems in the
newer work a shade complacent in his cleverness, notably in his drawings and
paintings of the figure and the nude, which proclaim an accuracy and
attention of observation which are no longer there.
He remains an interesting painter, but the more general and serious point is
that even here in England, most especially here in England, there is no end
of figurative painters at the very least as interesting in their work as he,
and certainly no less competent. We have only to go round any summer show of
the Royal Academy, or the prize exhibition of the Portrait Award at the
National Portrait Gallery, both of them coming up next month, to be
presented with the evidence. Yet who among those painters of the figure or
the landscape is ever likely to be picked out for any British Council tour
abroad, or international survey at the Grand Palais or Venice Biennale, or
asked to paint a portrait of the deputy director of the Tate?
The annual show of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters is another case in
point. It may have as always rather more than its fair share of jokes in
doubtful taste, but in the last few years, notably under a recent president,
David Poole, it has revived remarkably from its former moribund state.
Younger members have been recruited from the Portrait Award - Jeff
Stultiens, a former winner, now indeed the Society's secretary - and the
membership generally stiffened.
Many of the works on show are very good by any contemporary measure. Howard
Morgan, the current star, may continue to disappoint: his ambition is
matched as yet only by his self-indulgence. If only he would give as much
attention to drawing as to overall effect, and yet his drawings themselves
betray the inadequacy. Directly alongside, three portraits by Michael
Reynolds offer a merciless contrast, one, of a seated woman in a white
jumper, as fine a portrait and as interesting a new painting as any we might
see in a year. Its water-colour study is exquisite.
Thomas Coates, hung at the other end of the exhibition, is another hero, an
artist of true flair whose energy and variousness sometimes tend to obscure
his underlying distinction. He is a remarkable draughtsman. I only take
exception to an occasional eccentricity in his choice of subject. Were he to
come down within the speed limit, more might be able to judge him at his
true worth, as he flashes past. Daphne Todd, Hans Schwarz, John Ward, Tilly
Willis and Martin Yeoman are among the others whose work stands out. John
Boyd and Susan Ryder successfully take on the conversation piece, that most
testing of genres.
And do we find a Reynolds or Coates among the recent acquisitions at the
Tate, or on tour with an Arts Council selection, or included in a survey of
current painting at the Hayward Gallery? I only ask.
Avigdor Arikha: Marlborough Fine Art, 6 Albemarle Street W1, until June 4.
Royal Society of Portrait Painters Annual Exhibition; The Mall Galleries,
The Mall SW1, until May 30.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Arts: Dreyfus: a grim centenary - Opera in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chorus of Berlin's Deutsche Oper screams 'Filthy Jew] Bastard] Yid] Pig]
Death to the Traitor] Death to the Jew]'. A foyer exhibition of
poster-portraits includes a caricature of a Jew's head, depicting him as
greedy, dishonest and parasitical. In the city where the Nazis plotted the
final solution, no-one raises an eyebrow.
But this is not another example of German anti-Semitism. It is documentary
evidence of the Dreyfus Affair, which divided French society 100 years ago
and set the racist tone for 20th century Europe. To mark the Dreyfus
centenary, the Deutsche Oper has staged the world premiere of Dreyfus - The
Affair, with music by the Swiss composer Jost Meier and a libretto by George
Whyte, a Hungarian-born Jew who has master-minded a series of centenary
events.
In addition to the opera and exhibition, there will be a Dreyfus ballet with
a new score by Schnittke and a musical satire using anti-Semitic songs of
the period, orchestrated by Berio and performed by Ute Lemper. All these
will come together in Basle in October.
Alfred Dreyfus (1859-1935) was a Jewish officer in the French army. In 1894
he was falsely accused of spying for Germany, court-martialled and exiled.
Despite evidence proving his innocence, a retrial failed to clear his name.
After a campaign by his wife and influential supporters, culminating in
Emile Zola's celebrated pamphlet 'J'accuse', Dreyfus was released and
eventually rehabilitated.
The case uncovered a violent strain of anti-Semitism in France. Half a
century later, Dreyfus's grand-daughter was among the French Jews sent to
die at Auschwitz. In 1988, Dreyfus's grave in Montparnasse was desecrated.
In a country renowned for its reluctance to delve into the more
uncomfortable aspects of its past, the case still touches a raw nerve. It is
to Germany's credit, and France's shame, that Berlin has kick-started the
Dreyfus centenary.
With racist attacks again making news across Europe, the Dreyfus Affair is
both topical and salutary. The challenge facing the authors of the new opera
was to turn a tale of political and moral significance into a successful
work of art. The mere fact that an anti-racist opera was being premiered in
Berlin was enough to guarantee the approval of the capacity first-night
audience, which included local dignitaries, Jewish leaders and members of
the Dreyfus family. By the second performance, the euphoria had subsided,
and the work's flaws were all too clear.
The libretto, based on contemporary sources and making use of nightmarish
flashbacks, offers a resume of the Dreyfus case - public humiliation,
torture and solitary confinement, an appeal to the Pope, the discovery of
the real spy, establishment cover-up, re-trial and release.
In an unbroken span of 90 minutes, such prejudice and personal suffering
should hit the audience like a sledgehammer. But Dreyfus is never allowed to
develop a personality: he remains typecast as a symbol of injustice, his
wife Lucie a symbol of resistance. Zola's 'J'accuse' aria is frustratingly
repetitive. Minor characters like the traitor Esterhazy are cardboard
baddies. Far from seething with dramatic contrast, colour and tragedy, the
opera fails to rise above the level of righteous polemic.
For this, Whyte, Meier and the stage director, Torsten Fischer, bear equal
responsibility. Whyte, most of whose family were gassed by the Nazis,
appears to have been too close to his subject. The opera was his baby, the
product of years of struggle. He has not taken the leap of imagination which
transforms human experience into art: his material is more the stuff of
musical documentary.
Meier's pale Bergian modernism wears less well than his previous operas  -
the best of which, Augustin (1988), deserves a wide hearing. The chansons
and dances of the Moulin Rouge scene have the right sort of brash vulgarity,
but the most telling moments are when Meier refines the music down to the
barest thread. The overall impression is of competence rather than
inspiration.
Fischer's production, designed by Andreas Reinhardt, unfolded on a
triangular platform and made theatrical use of paper walls. What it lacked
was a sense of place, of genuine human feeling. Paul Frey's Dreyfus came
across as a rather ordinary chap. Aimee Willis was the spirited Lucie, Artur
Korn a shadowy Zola. A large supporting cast and chorus went through the
motions of rage and outrage. The performance I heard was adequately
conducted by the composer, stepping in for an indisposed Christopher Keene.

There seems to be no let up in the passion for elephant-on-the-floor
documentaries: those programmes where an entire television crew with camera
and sound gear creeps around like an elephant in gym shoes while the local
inhabitants go about their business, studiously pretending to be unaware of
the disruption. 20 Miles From Piccadilly Circus is the first in a six part
series about life in Eynsford, Kent. This week the effort is on to win the
'Britain In Bloom' competition (7.30 ITV). In Assignment Brian Barron
reports on Australia's new law of 'Native Title' which enables aborigines to
reclaim ancestral lands. It seems to have raised the same sort of problem as
the idea of returning museum pieces to the original owners: where do you
stop? (7.45 BBC2). Frederic Raphael pursues Jeremy Bentham's argument in
Without Walls, that 'All talk of rights is nonsense on stilts'. He says that
today's pursuit of special rights for women, homosexuals and racial
minorities encourages people to see themselves as victims and everyone else
as enemies (9.00 C4).

FT  17 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Watchdog barks but the MMC
moves on - Disarray in UK competition policy after a pro-industry shift by
Michael Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent inquiry reports from the Monopoly and Mergers Commission point to a
significant shift in UK competition policy. The MMC has adopted a
pro-industry approach which threatens a rift with the Office of Fair
Trading, the competition watchdog.
The change in policy was inspired by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary. Competition officials and other advocates of a stricter
policy believe the Department of Trade and Industry and the MMC have relaxed
policy to help create strong UK champions capable of competing in global
markets.
The growing frustration of competition officials and consumer organisations
is echoed at Westminster, where influential backbenchers led by Mr John
Watts MP, chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, have set up a lobby
group, the Competitive Forum, to press for tougher consumer-oriented
competition policy and reform of the MMC.
When he took over at the DTI, Mr Heseltine signalled his preference for
industrial over competition policy. His long-awaited competitiveness white
paper, due next week, should confirm that preference.
Mr Graeme Odgers, the businessman who took over as chairman of the MMC a
year ago, appears to share his views. Last week he said he was 'four-square'
with Mr Heseltine on privatisation, competitiveness and deregulation.
Since his arrival at the MMC, Mr Odgers has also tried to instill a
consistency of approach by encouraging a collegiate atmosphere among the
Commission's 35 members. The result, say critics, is an increasingly
doctrinaire style which places the interests of firms under investigation
ahead of those of the public and consumers.
This shift appears to be causing alarm at the OFT. Under Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director general of fair trading, the OFT has taken a strongly consumerist
approach to competition policy.
Sir Bryan gives the impression that he believes markets should be free of
any anti-competitive restraints unless they can be shown to benefit the
consumer. He has made a number of referrals to the MMC recently, among
others on fine fragrances and ice cream, which demonstrate his particular
concern with vertical restraints (those affecting the chain of supply to the
marketplace), such as measures tying in retailers to suppliers.
But the MMC under Mr Odgers appears to take the view that that vertical
restraints and anti-competitive practices must clearly damage the consumer
interest before it will interfere in an industry.
Companies that have built up competitive advantage should be allowed to
profit from their investment, innovation and enterprise, he said last week.
This increasingly laisser faire approach by the commission puts it on a
direct collision course with the OFT.
The clearest evidence of the shift in competition policy comes from recent
monopoly inquiry reports. Some competition lawyers and economists trace the
change back to the report in March 1989 on the supply of beer, when robust
recommendations made by the MMC aimed at weakening the control of the
brewers over pubs were rejected by the government following intense lobbying
by the industry.
Since then, critics say, the MMC has taken a much less interventionist
approach and shown far too much respect for the views of the firms under
investigation, an approach reinforced by the arrival of Mr Heseltine at the
DTI and Mr Odgers at the MMC.
The pattern began with the 1992 report on the supply of new motor cars,
criticised by consumer groups for relying too heavily on manufacturers' own
survey data and consumer satisfaction indices to establish that there was
little wrong with the present system of car dealerships and after-sales
service.
The MMC again found itself under attack in November last year over its
report on fine fragrances which concluded 'snob value' - high prices and
exclusivity - were more important to consumers than value for money, so
allowing leading perfume houses to continue refusing supplies to cut-price
retailers.
That was followed in March by the ice cream report which found that,
although the three leading manufacturers had more than 90 per cent of the
market for wrapped ice creams, the system of freezer exclusivity - providing
free freezer cabinets to shops on condition they are not used to stock rival
suppliers' ice cream - did not limit consumer choice by keeping rival
products out of smaller shops.
The unease at these reports should be underlined next month when the report
on recorded music is expected to clear the record industry of acting
together to keep the price of compact discs in Britain artificially high.
There have been additional reports on mortgage valuations, newspaper supply,
television broadcasting services and animal waste - all of which have drawn
criticism for producing either half-hearted or unworkable recommendations to
remedy adverse findings.
Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association director of policy, says that
at the heart of these reports seems to be a confusion between the interests
of industry in general and the interests of existing companies. But there is
no guarantee, he says, that what existing companies want will necessarily be
in the interests of the productive sector of the economy.
Mr Bill Bishop of Lexecon, the economic consultants, says you only have to
contrast the beer report with the recent ice cream report to see the change
of approach. On beer, the commission found the system of tied public houses
did damage the public interest. It rejected the industry's argument that, if
consumers did not like the choice of beer in one pub, they could go to
another. But on ice cream it reached the opposite conclusion.
Mr Derek Ridyard, associate director of National Economic Research
Associates, says the dispute is really about the extent to which one
supplier should be obliged to give competitors a leg-up in the market.
Even in the case of ice cream there were perfectly sound economic arguments
for saying that Unilever had taken the initiative and developed the market
and invested in freezer cabinets, and that all Mars had to do to compete was
take the same risks. There was a feeling that Mars was simply trying to use
the competition laws as a short cut, he says.
Mr Ridyard believes that, if there has been a change in approach, then it
has come from the OFT which has become more hawkish on vertical restraints
under Sir Bryan. He has referred areas such as recorded music and ice cream,
which had been looked at and rejected for referral by his predecessor, Sir
Gordon Borrie.
Mr Christopher Bright, a partner in City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines,
says it is easy to understand the frustration felt at the OFT at these
developments. But he believes the OFT's main problems lie with the DTI
rather than the MMC.
Twice in February last year Mr Heseltine rejected Sir Bryan's advice to
refer mergers to the MMC. The first case concerned the acquisition by GEC of
the Philips infra-red components business. The second concerned the hostile
bid by Airtours for Owners Abroad. Mr Heseltine considered the issues raised
did not justify referral.
These actions were not exceptional. Other trade secretaries have gone
against the advice of the director general - in all in 11 cases over 20
years, says Mr Bright. But these instances suggested a swing away from the
approach of former trade secretaries such as the late Mr Nicholas Ridley and
Mr Peter Lilley - one of 'if in doubt, refer'.
Further evidence of tension between the DTI and the OFT came in February
this year when Mr Heseltine ordered Sir Bryan to stop his investigation into
bus services on the Isle of Arran. It was the first time a trade secretary
had ever used his powers to overrule a director general in that way.
But the real problem for the OFT is that the DTI seems to have completely
lost interest in competition policy. Merger referrals are at an all-time
low. Only three mergers have been referred by Mr Heseltine to the MMC in the
past 12 months. When the MMC publishes its recorded music report next month
there will be only two monopoly inquiries on the go. The DTI is also
dragging its heels on reform of the law on restrictive practices and abuses
of market power.
These developments are not lost on UK companies, says Mr Bright. No wonder
OFT officials are said to be concerned at recent events.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Barber ruling put to the test
 -European Court
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Preliminary opinions were given recently by the European Court of Justice in
two test cases arising out of the Barber judgment on the equalisation of
pensions. The court is examining the compatibility of methods of pension
equalisation adopted by occupational pension funds post-Barber with equal
pay rules.
The first case concerned the occupational pension fund of Avdel Systems and
focused on the equalisation of benefits in 1991 referred to the ECJ by the
Bedford industrial tribunal.
The second involved similar questions from the Hague cantonal court
concerning equalisation of the pensionable age for employees of the Royal
Dutch Shell group occupational pension fund in 1985.
Advocate General Walter Van Gerven said it followed from Barber that sex
discrimination in occupational pension schemes must be abolished.
The central question in the present cases was whether and, if so to what
extent, an occupational pension scheme can equalise pension ages to take
account of Barber by raising the pensionable age for women rather than
lowering it for men.
Each of the pension schemes had chosen to raise the normal pensionable age
for women which meant female employees in future had to remain longer at
work to gain a full occupational pension.
In the Avdel case, the ECJ was asked whether it was inconsistent with the
equal pay rules for an employer to replace different normal pension ages for
men and women of 65 for benefits received in respect of particular periods
of service. These include:
after the date of equalisation on July 1 1991;
before the date of equalisation, but after May 17 1990 (the date of the
Barber judgment); and
before May 17 1990.
In the Dutch case, the equalisation was in 1985 before Barber and the
pensionable ages were raised from 55 to 60.
In response, the Advocate General said the ECJ should rule that it was not
contrary to the equal pay rules for an employer to raise the pensionable age
for women rather than lowering it for men in respect of future periods of
service after Barber and after the date of equalisation.
EU law does not preclude a reduction of benefits provided that the level of
benefit is the same for male and female employees. To rule otherwise would
amount to an undesirable interference in a policy area presently within the
competence of member countries. European law also does not preclude such
equalisation applying to periods of service completed before Barber.
But, in respect of periods of service between May 17 1990 and the
equalisation date (where later), it is necessary to increase the level of
benefits of the disadvantaged sex because those rules form the only valid
frame of reference for direct enforcement of the principle of equal
treatment, pending the adoption of new rules to remove the discrimination.
In answer to other questions from the national courts, the Advocate General
said that there was no obligation on the employer to minimise the adverse
consequences to women whose benefits are affected by the employer's decision
to eliminate the difference in pension ages.
In particular, an employer was not permitted to maintain transitional
arrangements agreed before Barber under which a limited group of females
enjoyed a lower pensionable age of 55, while the age for men was 60, with
regard to periods of service after May 17 1990, as in the Dutch case.
However, an employer could only justify a cut in benefits paid to women
during the period after Barber and before equalisation in exceptional
circumstances.
It is for the national court or tribunal to assess whether factors which
have no connection with sex discrimination and which represent a need
relating to the existence of the business or the solvency of its
occupational pension scheme justify a restrictive implementation of the
principle of equal treatment. But they must ensure the principle of equal
treatment is not restricted unnecessarily.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Factoring's unsung role
for exporters - An overdraft is not the only option for companies trading
overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK RUNIEWICZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, gave factoring a generous
'plug' at a dinner in London last week. Yet for all the publicity which this
form of finance now receives, a surprising number of businesses, notably
exporters, remain ignorant of its charms.
Around 85 per cent of UK exports are still financed by the traditional bank
overdraft, despite the advantages of using factoring companies - which buy
debts in return for an immediate cash payment, take over debtor records and
provide a collection service for clients.
Overdrafts, indeed, are seldom used effectively to finance overseas trade.
Most banks seek security for loans, often using a company's assets -
including its trade debts - to support any overdraft. Secured by a floating
charge, they will usually lend up to 60 per cent of the value of a current
UK receivable, but they still will not lend anything against the value of
foreign trade debts.
This leads to the absurd situation where a company might be given no credit
on the back of an export sale to, say, a leading multinational conglomerate
 -but would be advanced up to 60 per cent of the value of a sale to a small
corner shop.
Some of the clearing banks admittedly have export finance schemes using
credit insurance on the overseas buyers as security. Unfortunately, the
number of these schemes has fallen from 14 to five over the last two years,
although National Westminster Bank has recently re-entered this market.
As many factoring companies are owned by large financial institutions, it is
perhaps surprising that the wide variety of services provided by factors are
not adopted by the clearing banks for their export finance schemes.
There are, of course, deeply rooted reasons why some exporters are reluctant
to take advantage of factoring companies. Undoubtedly the old image of
factors as 'lenders of last resort' haunts factoring companies. Suppliers
are sometimes concerned that overseas buyers might consider the exporter to
be in financial difficulties if export debts are factored. It is an attitude
which needs to be revised.
The factors now provide highly competitive financing rates linked with fast
information reporting systems and also keep exporters informed of payments
received and outstanding debtor values.
Factoring is also considered expensive by exporters, but they seldom take
the various savings into account. For instance, there is less need to send
out invoice reminders to customers and there is less requirement for
internal credit control and bookkeeping. There are no legal costs in
collecting bad debts.
Experience shows that companies using factors obtain payment faster than
when traditional payment methods are used, because debts can be paid to an
associate factor in the buyer's country.
A company with a turnover of Pounds 2m can expect to save about Pounds
25,000 in costs or 1.25 per cent of turnover in a year. Factors can finance
a company's total debts or sometimes selected invoices.
Factoring, though, is not suitable for all companies and exporters must
assess their specific financing requirements.
Take Company A, which exports 90 per cent of its Pounds 2m turnover to
multinational companies in overseas markets. The company receives payments
on average within 60 days from the date of despatch, for which it requires
working capital of Pounds 300,000.
The company had an overdraft facility of Pounds 50,000 and funded the
balance of its working capital need from reserves, causing pressure on its
liquidity. The company's bank would not increase the overdraft because of
the large proportion of overseas debts.
Company A had two options: reduce export turnover or find an alternative
source of finance. By turning to a factor the company was granted a facility
covering 85 per cent of its debtor book with a limit of Pounds 240,000.
The factor provided finance and a debt collection service in the buyer's
country - an altogether more efficient way of receiving and collecting
payment. Overseas debtor days were reduced from 60 to 45, reducing interest
charges and increasing working capital.
The interest rates charged by the bank and the factor were the same although
the factoring costs were 1.5 per cent of turnover. This cost was offset not
only by the reduction in the interest bill but also by greater use of
working capital.
Company B, which exports 60 per cent of its Pounds 5m turnover and sells
mainly to the Middle and Far East markets, required additional funding to
complete a series of contracts.
The company sold mainly on letter of credit terms with a credit period of 60
days and needed its bankers to confirm both the letters of credit and
provide funding. Although the company had a small overdraft facility, the
bank was happy to extend facilities based on the large value of work in
progress and the company's assets.
The company had considered factoring but found it was not appropriate
because of the large volume of letters of credit received and the small
volume of open account business.
The lesson is that exporters should seek the most appropriate financing
arrangements for trading overseas; and an overdraft should not be considered
the only solution.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Seeing it from both sides
 -Richard Gourlay continues his series on business angels with a visit to a
nursery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some marriages may be made in heaven, but the relationship between private
investors and entrepreneurs is almost invariably stormy.
Sarah Anderson can vouch for this, having seen it from both sides of the
business. Founder of Mayday Staff Agency Services, an employment bureau for
the catering industry in which outside investors took a stake, she is now
lead investor in a start-up business, Teddies Nurseries.
Anderson is convinced the nurturing of business relationships is crucial if
private investors and the entrepreneurs they back are to stand a chance of
succeeding.
'When a business is running well, the entrepreneur thinks they are putting
everything in and the investors are vultures,' says Anderson. 'When it goes
badly it is the other way around, with resentment that they are not pulling
their weight.'
It was the arrival of her children that launched Anderson's career as a
business angel and has inspired a number of her subsequent investments. 'I
was bored with running Mayday full-time, got married and pregnant,' she
says. 'In 1990 I started going to meetings of potential investors at LINC' -
the Local Investment Networking Company run by a group of government-backed
Enterprise Agencies.
Teddies Nurseries was one of the companies that gave a presentation at
LINC's regular investor seminars. Its entrepreneurs - Nicholas Botterill and
Amanda Ramage - wanted to open a chain of high-quality, branded day-care
centres. The first flagship operation would be launched in a residential
area. The rest would be set up near large office blocks to service what they
hoped would be a boom in corporate spending on child care for staff.
'I could recognise a good plan because I had been running a business,' says
Anderson. 'They were very young, bright and one had been a management
consultant with Stoy Hayward. I liked the people and the product and it was
a start-up which I wanted.'
Starting with 20 per cent of the equity, the entrepreneurs were encouraged
by a ratchet agreement that would have given them control of the company if
they performed to plan. However, Botterill and Ramage quickly ran into the
quicksand of London's planning laws. It took longer than expected to find
buildings with the right planning consents. The first Teddies in Fulham -
now full and thriving - was late in opening, the second in Twickenham only
opened in October, 10 months late.
'Each centre makes more money than we ever projected but the ratchet was
flawed because it was based on a time scale which when extended made
majority ownership impossible to achieve over the five-year period,' says
Ramage.
Whatever the reason, the missed targets and the argument over whether the
ratchet should be changed, soured relations. The business ate cash and
Teddies needed re-stuffing with money. 'The ratchet was clearly not going to
be available to them so they were not incentivised,' says Anderson.
'I always felt the investment was something that might be lost,' she says.
'I was far more angry about the relationships that were going wrong and that
it was no longer fun.'
Anderson decided refinancing would not be pouring good money after bad. The
business, now successfully operating two full nurseries, has recently broken
even, and the concept is now proven. But Ramage is trying to find new
investors to buy Anderson out.
'If I had my time over again I would negotiate the contract differently but
I am perfectly happy with the way we found the investors and the people we
went in with,' says Ramage. Both sides made mistakes in negotiating the
original contracts, she says.
This tension is familiar territory for Anderson. At Mayday she had to put up
with outside shareholders. For ten years she had been 'happily working' for
Compass, the catering company, ending up as a personnel and training
manager. Asked to find ways to make money from the personnel department, she
suggested an internal staff agency to replace outside contractors through
which Compass was putting Pounds 500,000 of business a year.
Six weeks after Anderson had set up the agency as a subsidiary, she
persuaded the chief executive she was doing him a favour by taking this
'lousy business' off his hands. For the princely sum of Pounds 7,600 to buy
the goodwill she was running her first business.
Though she did not need the finance, Anderson's father came on the board and
the venture capital company he was then working for took a 10 per cent
stake.
'My view of private investors was very antagonistic,' says Anderson. 'I felt
I did all the work and that was why I had a successful company. I look at it
slightly differently now.'
While Mayday has been a success - with turnover of Pounds 2m and 21
permanent staff - and Teddies is coming good, Anderson has had one
'unequivocally disastrous investment'. Attempting to repeat Mayday's London
success in Cambridge and Bristol, Anderson backed two entrepreneurs to set
up and run a subsidiary. Their sales forecasts proved unrealistic and Pounds
35,000 later the business failed, Anderson says.
'I learned you need to be brave enough to pull the plug early,' Anderson
says. 'We should have pulled the plug after six months. An individual's
capability does not change very dramatically over time.'
Anderson has also raised commitments for money to set up childrens' activity
centres. Again London's planning laws tripped her up and she is now leading
her backers into a similar project in Guildford she found through LINC.
And coming full circle Anderson has also started investing in herself again.
With a neighbour she is launching into the manufacture of a folding
childrens' lavatory seat called a Toodle-loo.
A start-up, a single product, an uncertain route to market: It has
everything that makes bankers and institutional venture capital suppliers
run a mile, but all the features that private investors like Anderson
embrace.

stockbroking firms. It was bought by the Scandinavian Bank in 1987 at the
time of Big Bang. In April 1992 its management bought the business from the
Scandinavian owners and in April 1993 it bought Bell Lawrie, one of

FT  17 MAY 94 / Technology: Healthcare's Holy Grail - Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical companies have a problem: their customers want value for
money. This would be taken for granted in other industries. But it is news
to the drugs sector because not long ago, doctors decided which pills to
prescribe and someone else paid without question.
Now, those who do pay - governments, employers paying health insurance
premiums, and insurance companies paying drug companies - are flexing their
muscles and pushing down drugs' profit margins.
The industry's solution so far has been to pour billions of dollars into
buying health management organisations and pharmacy benefit managers, the
middlemen of the business. Last summer, Merck paid Dollars 6bn (Pounds
4.10bn) for Medco; earlier this month, SmithKline Beecham paid Dollars 2.3bn
for Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services.
Other companies such as Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have preferred
alliances to takeovers, but the intention is similar: to force the middlemen
to promote a narrow range of products.
Such an approach would be doomed to fail in most other industries. Which
kind of insurance broker would you prefer to deal with: one that peddled one
company's products, or one that could offer the best product for your
circumstances?
It is not easy for the drugs industry to convince customers that it is
offering good value. Once, the sales pitch discussed safety and
effectiveness, and clinical trial results provided the facts. Now, the buyer
wants to know whether the deal is good, but there is no reliable body of
economic data.
Everyone recognises that there is more to a good deal than price. One
anaesthetic may be cheaper than another, but if it takes longer for the
patient to recover from the operation, the extra cost of an overnight stay
outweighs the saving on the drugs bill.
According to Jan Leschly, the new chief executive of SmithKline Beecham,
providing the right kind of healthcare for 'managing' diseases is better
than curing them. But disease management relies on a firm knowledge of
health economics. What are the patterns of drug use and the costs of
different levels of treatment? How and why do hospitals and doctors vary in
their costs per patient, per disease type and a host of other measures?
Some of this information is in the hands of drugs companies. Much more is
held by, for example, health insurers. Like all insurers, they need to know
actuarial and demographic figures to charge competitive premiums that return
a profit.
Pharmacies, too, have information that the drugs companies do not.
Dispensing data could be valuable to a drugs maker in the way that point of
sales data from a supermarket is useful to a soap powder manufacturer: rapid
feedback of the level of demand helps in the management of any manufacturing
business.
Then there are other drugs companies which, in the right alliances, could
exchange information with partners.
If any one big drugs company could combine these information sources, it
would have the building blocks for a sales pitch that was as convincing
economically as clinical trials are for safety and effectiveness. At the
same time, it could avoid the accusation that customers were forced to buy
its pills simply because the middleman was pushing them. It could offer
doctors, hospitals, employers and governments the real holy grail of
healthcare reform: a treatment that was rational in terms of safety,
effectiveness and cost.
Of the large pharmaceutical companies, Glaxo is one of the few yet to make
public its strategy. It has plenty of cash, a distaste for takeovers and an
image of itself as the world's foremost drugs company.
Whichever company succeeded in pulling off alliances to exchange information
could claim to have leapfrogged its rivals. It would offer customers what
they wanted - a recipe for success in any business.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Technology: Spiders spin a profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARJORIE SHAFFER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dangling from its web, a spider uses the strongest and most elastic material
in the world. Proportionally, a spider's silk can support external pressures
of 200,000lb per square inch and can stretch up to 135 per cent of its
original length. It is stronger than steel and more flexible than nylon.
Researchers from the University of Wyoming have now cloned the genes that
make the proteins found in an especially tough and elastic kind of spider's
silk. Genes from the golden orb web spinner, found on the US southern coast,
have been inserted into bacteria, which have produced small quantities of
the proteins.
By harnessing the properties of these proteins, dubbed Spidroin 1 and
Spidroin 2, an array of new kinds of super-tough, elastic materials could be
developed, says Randolph Lewis, the molecular biologist who heads the
Wyoming research group. He reported his discoveries at a recent meeting of
the American Chemical Society.
Lewis says the proteins are the ideal material for super-thin sutures that
would cause minimal scarring in surgery. They could also be used for
artificial tendons and ligaments that could withstand the body's demands,
yet still bend.
So far, Lewis's group has only produced tiny amounts of the proteins in
genetically altered bacteria. The next step is mass production. 'With
large-scale production it will be possible to start making fibres for
testing in various applications,' says Lewis.
Other academic and military scientists in the US are also examining the
unusual properties of proteins found in spider silks, although the work has
not yet attracted commercial companies. However, some are likely to take an
interest if researchers can mass produce and then spin the proteins into
real thread.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Technology: Worth its weight in gold - A 'fingerprint' test
for substances is beating fraudsters, thieves, and money launderers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They jumped for joy in Kalgoorlie, centre of the new Western Australian gold
rush, when owners of the Karpa Spring mine announced that test results
showed its ore contained nearly 10 times more gold than usual for mines in
the state.
Joy soon turned to shock when the fraud squad was called in. Karpa Spring
had been sold and drilling by the new owners, Noranda, Canada's biggest
natural resources group, and a small Australian company, Perilya, showed the
mine had scarcely any gold.
Three people eventually appeared in court. Some vital evidence for the
successful prosecution case was provided by John Watling. His analysis
showed that the first sample from Karpa Spring - with the high gold content
 -contained gold from two sources. One must have been added artificially.
'Salting' a gold mine, by adding precious metal from elsewhere, is a
confidence trick as old as the industry itself. But it will be much more
difficult to avoid detection from now on, thanks to Watling and his
colleague, Hugh Herbert, scientists at the Western Australian Department of
Minerals and Energy's Chemistry Centre in Perth.
They have developed an analytical process that gives every mine a unique
'fingerprint'. Its basis is the fact that each of the earth's geological
regions has unique characteristics in terms of the minerals present and the
pattern of their association with other minerals. Gold from a particular
region, sometimes even from a particular mine, has its own identity. And, as
with human fingerprints, the technique can be used in a courtroom to show a
jury patterns on a sheet of paper to compare one gold sample with another.
This technological breakthrough affects not just salters of mines and gold
thieves: it will make life much more difficult for fraudsters and drug
barons too. Watling hopes that the work will result in much of the world's
gold being fingerprinted so that its origins can be pinpointed with
certainty. It will cease to be an untraceable international currency.
This could, for example, make laundering illegal drug receipts more
difficult. One way in which illegal drug rings move their money into the
banking system is to buy exhausted gold mines. Stolen gold is bought with
the illicit cash and mixed with dirt and possibly some metal. The metal goes
to a local refinery, which has no way of knowing it is not newly-mined gold.
When it leaves the refinery, it has become 'legal.'
Watling, a British geologist and geo-chemist, first successfully put his
theory to the test in 1975 when four tonnes of gold were found at Heathrow
airport in London, disguised as a consignment of lead. Watling was working
in Johannesburg at the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research. He showed that the gold came from a mine near Welkom in South
Africa and the owner, Anglo American Corporation, eventually got back its
precious metal.
It is only recently that he and Herbert perfected the technique, using an
ADollars 600,000 (USDollars 425,000) laser ablation, inductively coupled,
plasma spectrometer. Only a tiny trace of gold is required. The sample is
cut by a laser linked with the spectrometer which identifies the trace
elements present.
Today, defence lawyers in Western Australia no longer question the validity
of the technique. Watling and Herbert have been asked to give evidence in 20
gold theft and fraud cases in the past two years, but most defendants
changed their pleas to guilty once the scientists showed their evidence.
Twenty gold-producing countries around the world have asked Watling to carry
out work for them. The technique can be applied in many other ways. Cannabis
can be traced to where it was grown through the nutrients in the water and
fertiliser - the plant's 'signature' is determined by what has sustained it.
Also, where routine blood testing of employees has to be carried out at
mines or process plants for such substances as lead, cadmium, mercury and
arsenic, the technique could be used by a nurse who would take only 20
microlitres of blood (a pinprick) instead of the 10 millilitres usually
needed.
Watling was asked to fingerprint the artefacts at the Angkor Wat and Preah
Khan temples in Cambodia. Artefacts are stolen at ancient sites all over the
world, but where, for example, a head has been cut from a statue and
definitive fingerprinting could prove which statue it came from, 'collectors
would not be so willing to buy and it might not be so worthwhile for such
things to be stolen', says Watling.
He worked with the Australian pearl industry which was worried about the way
some cultured pearls were discoloured. This project cost ADollars 3,500 and
in the past 14 months has saved the industry ADollars 1.5m, equivalent to 2
per cent of annual production.
Now, Watling is fingerprinting diamonds. De Beers, which dominates the
industry, last month delivered a consignment of uncut diamonds from around
the world to test whether the technique can be used to distinguish them.
However, all this work must be completed by July 1, when the Chemistry
Centre becomes a profit centre and it will be impossible for him to carry on
as before, doing much of the work in his free time but using the centre's
equipment.
He hopes to find sponsors to take the technique into the private sector. It
would, he suggests, require ADollars 3m to buy a plasma spectrometer, rent
some space, hire three people - and himself, full-time - to take the new
business through its first 18 months.
Apart from building up a library of gold fingerprints, Watling has been
working on a computer programme that could take over from him the job of
interpreting data from the spectrometer. When that is perfected, he says,
there could be a number of linked gold fingerprinting centres around the
world.

FT  17 MAY 94 / People: Phibro entices Bonner to return
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing bears testimony more eloquently to the gradual re-emergence of
Phibro as a force to be reckoned with in international commodities trading
than Peter Bonner's decision to rejoin the Salomon subsidiary to head its
non-ferrous and precious metals team in London.
Bonner, now 49, joined what was then known as Philipp Brothers as a junior
and worked his way to the top of the metals team during 25 years with the
organisation. With impeccable timing, he jumped ship in 1989 because he
could see Phibro sinking beneath its huge overhead costs. A year later
Salomon reduced Phibro, once world leader in commodities, to a shell,
closing or selling many of its core businesses and making heavy
redundancies.
More recently, Salomon has been rebuilding its commodities business and now
has 15 people in its metals trading team, as well as trading coffee, cocoa,
grain, sugar and, of course, oil.
Bonner spent some time with Credit Lyonnais Rouse and then joined Barclays
Metals which has grown quickly since the banking group decided to embark on
London Metal Exchange trading three years ago. Barclays now wants to pause
for breath and consolidate - which means that Bonner was more than ready to
listen when Salomon offered the Phibro job. He says: 'From Salomon's point
of view, it was better the devil you know, I suppose.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / People: Goodall takes on another chair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb, the Cheshire-based regional electricity company, has become the
latest power group to appoint a relative outsider to one of its two senior
posts. Bill Goodall, on the company's board for less than a year, is to take
over as non-executive chairman at the end of August.
He will succeed Bryan Weston who is retiring after 45 years in the industry.
Before privatisation four years ago, the way to the top in electricity was a
lifetime in the industry. Weston's appointment yesterday means that half of
the 12 regional electricity companies have chairmen who have spent the bulk
of their careers in other industries.
The Manweb appointment means Goodall, 62, now chairs four companies; the
others are Volex, electrical controls group, Hopkinsons, engineer, and
Inveresk, paper manufacturer.
Goodall began his career as a management trainee with Scapa Dryers in 1956
after graduating from Pembroke College, Cambridge, and Leeds University.
From there he rose to be chairman of Scapa Group, a post he relinquished
last October.

PC Pete Allen displays the firearms available to him as a member of an armed
response vehicle crew under measures to apply in London announced by Mr
Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday, Alan Pike writes.
Until now officers have drawn their guns from lockers in the cars only when
arriving at incidents. They must still do this with the carbine, pictured,
but will be allowed to wear sidearms in holsters at all times.
The number of armed response vehicles on 24-hour patrol in London is being
increased from five to 12.
Although critics will see the step as a further move towards the abandonment
of Britain's tradition of an unarmed police service, Mr Paul Condon,
Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he hoped the move would 'postpone the
necessity to routinely arm police officers'.
Arming the police will be an issue at the Police Federation conference,
which opens today in Brighton.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Company rescue plans under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks have criticised government proposals to help companies in financial
difficulties to survive, arguing that they will discourage banks from
lending and could be 'a recipe for abuse' by company directors.
The British Bankers' Association made its attack in its response to a
Department of Trade and Industry consultative paper on company voluntary
arrangements and administration orders published yesterday.
The banks say the proposals would weaken their right to preferential
treatment over other creditors in the case of insolvency, and limit their
freedom to appoint receivers to troubled companies.
The response describes the suggestion that a debtor should be able to obtain
a 28-day moratorium binding all creditors, without having to obtain bank
agreement, as 'a recipe for abuse in the hands of unscrupulous or desperate
businessmen'.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank and the association's
vice-chairman, said: 'If you have got to wait 28 days to enforce debts,
there may not be much left when you arrive.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / Assets of Church return to growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Assets of the Church Commissioners, which declined by Pounds 800m between
1989 and 1992 after over-exposure in property markets, grew by 14 per cent
last year.
Summary accounts published yesterday showed that net assets rose from Pounds
2.1bn in 1992 to Pounds 2.4bn last year. The assets were worth Pounds 2.9bn
in 1989 and the commissioners say that last year's growth makes their value
similar in real terms to the early 1980s. But although asset value improved,
net income declined by 4 per cent last year to Pounds 154.9m.
The Church of England has been forced to recognise that, even before the
collapse in asset values, it was making excessive demands on the
commissioners' income.
As a result parishes are being told that they must make a greater
contribution to the cost of maintaining their churches. The commissioners
last year paid Pounds 58m to clergy stipends - 37 per cent of the total.
Their contribution to stipends and housing support will be reduced by Pounds
5.5m this year and Pounds 12m next year. Parish support for stipends rose by
2 per cent to Pounds 67.8m last year.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Fast growth in premium phone lines forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rapid growth in the market for premium-rate telephone services was predicted
yesterday by the telephone information services watchdog.
The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone
Information Services said it expected cable companies to join the market
soon, offering premium-rate services over their telephone and television
networks in urban areas.
Baroness Dean, who chairs the committee, said: 'There will need to be a
level playing field for all companies operating across all net-works.'
The committee wants the cable industry to sign up to its code of practice
for premium-rate services, to which British Telecommunications and Mercury
already subscribe.
Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Television Association, said he
was 'confident' it would do so.
The premium-rate industry had a turnover of Pounds 250m last year. There are
more than 350 service providers; nearly 20,000 services are in operation
with an estimated 6m calls made each week.
The entry of the cable companies into the business is likely to boost the
number of services, and increase price competition between operators. At
present calls cost a standard 39p a minute cheap rate and 49p a minute at
other times, with only one premium-rate number - Mercury's 0881 - charging a
lower rate.
However, higher tariff bands are also in prospect for 'quality' business and
information servicers, subject to approval by the committee. The committee
said it was 'unlikely' to agree to higher tariffs for services with appeal
to children and a mass audience.
The committee's annual report shows high usage of premium-rate services by
children. A survey of 1,000 youngsters aged between seven and 19 found that
21 per cent had used a service in the previous three months, with usage
highest among 11 and 13-year-olds (34 per cent).
The main cause of complaints to it is misleading advertising for
premium-rate services and inadequate pricing information.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Pension schemes criticise industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A third of pension schemes believe the industry does not communicate
effectively with its members, says a survey released yesterday.
A third also believe that pension-scheme members understand little of the
financial information presented to them, the survey commissioned by
accountants Clark Whitehill indicates. The analysis was based on a sample of
196 schemes with a total of 1.6m members. Nearly two-thirds of schemes rely
on the small amount of information contained in summary financial statements
sent to members.
Clark Whitehill called for regulation of the contents and distribution of
summary reports for members and said that reports should require a separate
auditor's and actuary's report. It said its findings underlined concerns
raised by the Goode committee on pension fund reform about the level of
'gobbledegook' in pension scheme literature.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Church assets return to growth

<TEXT>
Assets of the Church Commissioners, which declined by Pounds 800m between
1989 and 1992 after over-exposure in property markets, grew by 14 per cent
last year.
Summary accounts published yesterday showed that net assets rose from Pounds
2.1bn in 1992 to Pounds 2.4bn last year. The assets were worth Pounds 2.9bn
in 1989 and the commissioners say that last year's growth makes their value
similar in real terms to the early 1980s. But although asset value improved,
net income declined by 4 per cent last year to Pounds 154.9m.
The Church of England has been forced to recognise that, even before the
collapse in asset values, it was making excessive demands on the
commissioners' income. In their report yesterday the commissioners said
distribution of income had been running at more than 7 per cent of assets
'instead of the 4 per cent to 5 per cent which might normally be considered
prudent for the preservation of capital value'.
As a result parishes are being told that they must make a greater
contribution to the cost of maintaining their churches. The commissioners
last year paid Pounds 58m to clergy stipends - 37 per cent of the total.
Their contribution to stipends and housing support will be reduced by Pounds
5.5m this year and Pounds 12m next year. Parish support for stipends rose by
2 per cent to Pounds 67.8m last year.
One of the church's biggest financial difficulties concerns clergy pensions.
These are financed almost entirely by the commissioners, and expenditure
rose from Pounds 63.9m in 1992 to Pounds 69.4m last year. With pension costs
continuing to rise, there is a risk that the present pension scheme would
eventually consume the commissioners' entire income. Alternative proposals
will be published later this year.
The commissioners yesterday said a series of steps had been taken following
'serious criticism' of their asset management last year in reports
commissioned by Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury. An audit
committee had been established, a new financial secretary appointed, the
property portfolio independently valued and assessed and independent
actuaries appointed.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Civil service union in cash crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's second-largest civil service union faces a financial crisis, with
only three months to persuade three-quarters of its 111,800 members to renew
their subscriptions.
Only a quarter of the National Union of Civil and Public Servants' members
have agreed to allow their employers to deduct union subscriptions from
their wages under the check-off system.
The union is already in serious financial difficulties - it is running a
deficit and its latest financial report says: 'It is only the support of the
Unity Trust Bank that is enabling the union to continue functioning.'
The crisis also raises questions about plans to merge with the wealthy
Inland Revenue Staff Federation.
Under new employment legislation the union has until August to persuade
members to renew their mandates for the check-off system.
The union has budgeted for a 5 per cent membership loss from check-off,
which would cost it Pounds 220,000 in subscription income.
The union blames 'foot-dragging' by some managers over check-off campaigns.
It has to deal with more than 200 salary centres and claims that some
managers have been putting administrative obstacles in its way.
Fewer than 1 per cent of members at the Department of Employment have signed
up, 12 per cent at the environment department, and 16 per cent at defence.
At the end of last year the union's overdraft was Pounds 503,109, and the
deficit on its general fund Pounds 120,720. The report states: 'Clearly this
position can no longer be sustained. Deficits can no longer continue since
the union has no liquid assets.'
The union has been in deficit every year since 1987. It overspent Pounds 4m
over the period, transforming 'a very healthy liquid assets position to a
point where our liquid assets do not even cover the overdraft'.
The union spends a third (Pounds 3.35m) of its current expenditure on staff,
but it says 'the potential for reducing staff members by natural wastage
(is) extremely limited'.
Moreover, it admits 'the union does not have readily available funds to
underpin a redundancy programme - be it voluntary or compulsory'.
A number of cost-saving proposals were passed at the union's annual
conference last week but delegates refused to accept a shift of money from
its political to the general fund and committed the union to more spending
that wiped out proposed savings.
Members of the NUCPS and the IRSF are due to be balloted in October on
forming a joint union. According to their merger plan, both unions are
'financially viable in their own right'. It states: 'Neither union needs to
merge on financial grounds.'
It adds: 'The new union will organise its finances on a prudent and
professional basis to get the maximum benefit from its income. A principal
objective will be the avoidance of current account deficits'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Labour MPs hold advantage on leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The vote of each Labour MP in the election to find a successor to Mr John
Smith will be equivalent to those of 14,500 trades unionists paying a
political levy.
Furthermore, in spite of the one-member-one-vote label attached to the
complicated voting system agreed by the party conference last autumn, the
250,000 party members will each have a vote worth 18 times that of their
4.5m trades union comrades.
As officials yesterday wrestled with the arithmetic, it also emerged that
most MPs will have several different votes. One senior backbench MP
calculated that he would have five separate opportunities to put a cross
against his preferred candidate: as an MP, as a member of his local
constituency branch, as a levy-paying trade unionist, as a member of the
Fabian Society and as a member of the Co-operative Society.
The MP assured reporters he intended to cast all his votes for the same
candidate, rather than share them between rival claimants.
Labour has never claimed that one-member-one-vote was more than a rough
shorthand for a more democratic system. The electoral college which chooses
the leader is split into three: the 310 MPs and MEPs, local constituency
members and members of socialist societies, and trades union levy payers.
Each carries equal weight and must ballot its members before casting its
aggregated votes.
Officials are only now beginning to realise the huge disparity between the
influence of MPs, party members and trade unionist members, which is
reinforced by the fact that the union leadership no longer has any direct
control over how its members vote.
Mr Smith was criticised last autumn for not doing more to curb the influence
of the unions in choosing the leader. But as one MP put it yesterday: 'He
was smarter than we thought.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / Hard left unlikely to enter race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Campaign Group of leftwing Labour MPs is expected to reject calls to
enter a candidate in the battle to succeed John Smith as party leader.
The 34-strong group will decide tomorrow whether to nominate a candidate to
carry the hard-left banner or to throw its weight behind one of three
mainstream left candidates.
Leading members say the group was chastened by its experiences in the 1992
election, when it endorsed Mr Ken Livingstone for leader and Mr Bernie Grant
for deputy leader. Both failed to muster sufficient nominations from MPs to
get on to the ballot, forcing members to switch their support to soft-left
candidates.
This time the group has a choice of three potential mainstream left
candidates: Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, Mr John Prescott,
employment spokesman, and Mr Robin Cook, trade and industry spokesman.
Leading members said that there would be substantial support for Mrs
Beckett, who won the deputy leadership on a joint left-right ticket with Mr
Smith and is widely regarded to have performed capably.
Mrs Beckett is thought unlikely to run for the leadership because of her
lack of support on the centre and right of the parliamentary party, and her
low profile among constituency and trade union activists.
Mr Prescott has substantial support on the left, but is regarded with
suspicion by many Campaign members because of his strong support for changes
in Labour's rules which reduced the influence of trade unions.
Mr Cook is also tainted in the eyes of many leftwingers because of his
support for the purge of extremists carried out in the mid and late 1980s by
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader.
However, Campaign Group opinion is believed to be gathering behind Mr Cook
because of his formidable reputation in the Commons and his close links with
the unions.
Support for Mr Cook is also strengthening among soft-left MPs concerned
about the pace of the bandwagon forming for Mr Tony Blair, shadow home
secretary, whose power base is on the right of the party.
Many would prefer to support Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, but fear
that Mr Blair will emerge as the unstoppable sole candidate of the
centre-right.

Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, and his predecessor Mr Kenneth Clarke
were cleared by a judge yesterday of contempt of court in trying to deport a
young Indian woman despite her status as legal guardian of her younger
sister and five brothers.
Lawyers for Ms Dalvinder Kaur, 22, of Nottingham, whose parents have been
deported to India as illegal immigrants, claimed the Home Office 'rode
roughshod' over a 1991 High Court order making the children , now aged four
to 17, wards of court and placing them in their sister's care and control.
But Sir Stephen Brown, Family Division president, refused to make a finding
of contempt. He said the case was an 'abuse' of the court pro-cess.

A private member's bill to reform the law of Privity of Contract, which has
created problems for some tenants during the recession, was presented in
parliament yester-day.
The landlord and tenant (covenants) bill was introduced by Conservative MP
Mr Peter Thurnham, with the assistance of the Lord Chancellor's department.
Privity of Contract is a law under which a tenant retains the responsibility
for paying rent if the lease has been assigned to another tenant who
defaults. The bill seeks to release tenants from Privity of Contract
obligations for new leases after the first assignment.

The Eastleigh by-election is likely to be held on June 9, the same day as
the European elections, 9, Kevin Brown writes.
The Liberal Democrat party is regarded as almost certain to win the seat,
which was held for the Conservatives by the late Stephen Milligan with a
majority of 17,702.
The main candidates in Eastleigh are: Labour - Ms Marilyn Birks, a
further-education lecturer; Liberal Democrat - Mr David Chidgey, a civil
engineer; Conservative - Mr Stephen Reid, a data processing manager and
leader of Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council.
Mr Bryan Gould, a former shadow cabinet minister, last night officially
resigned as an MP, to return to his native New Zealand to take up an
academic post.
This creates a by-election in Dagenham, in London's East End, which is
likely to be held on June 9.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Surcharge on council 'may hit Pounds 55m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversy surrounding Westminster City Council intensified yesterday
as Labour members alleged that Conservative councillors and officers could
be forced to repay as much as Pounds 55m in surcharges.
A BBC Panorama documentary also attacked new aspects of the borough's
alleged 'gerrymandering' policy.
In January the district auditor made a provisional finding that 10
councillors and officers, including the former leader of the council Dame
Shirley Porter, should pay Pounds 21.25m in 'sur-charges'.
He held that the borough's designated council house sales policy, which had
targeted house sales in marginal wards, was 'gerrymandering' for a
'disgraceful and improper purpose'.
The Panorama programme presented in detail claims that the 'gerrymandering'
covered the council's planning policies, environmental work and professional
'dirty tricks' campaigns, as well as housing policy.
All fell under the rubric of the council's Build-ing Stable Communities
policy.
Documents printed in 1987 and obtained by the Financial Times find
references to the 'target wards' in policy documents on 'pavement trouble
spots' and 'zoned improvement patrols' to target specific problems in
individual wards.
Mr Peter Bradley, Labour's deputy leader on the council, said the new Pounds
55m estimate took into account money spent on designated sales from 1989
onwards as the auditor's report only covered the period between 1987 and
1989.
It also took into account other Building Stable Communities policies.
Mr Bradley said: 'We believe these will be proved to be unlawful policies in
all departments.'
He also attacked the BBC for postponing the Panorama broadcast until after
the local elections on May 5.
He said: 'It is dis-graceful that the BBC should have succumbed to pressure
in suppressing this programme until after the local elections just 10 days
ago.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / DTI may extend copyright to TV programme formats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday said it was considering
whether copyright protection should be extended to programme formats.
A programme format is seen as comprising the 'common unifying features' of a
game show or situation comedy.
In 1989 the Privy Council decided that the unifying features of the talent
show Opportunity Knocks, which had been copied by the New Zealand
Broadcasting Corporation, did not constitute a work protected by copyright
law.
Ministers are now considering whether further protection is needed
especially as the government has been trying to find ways to encourage
Britain's broadcasters to export more programmes.
The DTI has issued a consultation paper and is seeking comment by June 24.
'For example, concern has been expressed that protecting formats could
result in simple programming ideas being monopolised with consequent
restrictions on programming freedom,' the department said.
At present broadcasters often either pay for or acknowledge another's
format, but only on an informal basis.
CBS, the US network, was angered last year when the BBC launched its 999
series featuring stories of survival in dangerous circumstances. CBS
believed it had much in common with its programme Rescue 911.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Employers oppose rule change for pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior directors of several large companies including Imperial Chemical
Industries and Unilever told MPs at an unpublicised meeting that they
opposed a central recommendation of the Goode committee on pensions
regulation, it emerged last night. The Goode proposals were drawn up in the
wake of the Maxwell scandal.
Directors of the companies, which also included the J. Sainsbury and Tesco
retail chains, were invited to a meeting by members of the Conservative
majority on the Commons social security committee.
The directors said they rejected Goode's proposals for legislation ensuring
that at least a third of trustees are appointed by scheme members. That was
put forward by Goode because employee contributions make up a third of most
schemes' assets.
The Tory majority on the committee asked the businessmen to give evidence at
a special meeting. It was called last week after the Conservatives rejected
the first draft of the committee's report. They opposed it for advocating
too many new rules. The Tories are determined that the government should
avoid over-regulation.
The handling of the issue, including the involvement of some of the biggest
employers in Britain, has enraged some Labour members of the committee. They
are considering publishing a minority report in favour of further regulation
to prevent the possibility of further pension scandals.
Ministers fear that if the Goode proposal were implemented it might
seriously undermine occupational pensions because managements might question
the value of such schemes if they did not have absolute control of the
trustees.
They are 'delighted' that the company chiefs gave evidence to the committee
underlining their view that it would be a mistake to over-regulate.
The government, which is to publish its white paper later this year, favours
a code of 'best practice', which would leave the composition of the board of
trustees to the management, as is now the case.
While some of the companies which appeared before the committee already
allow scheme members to appoint more than a third of trustees, they oppose a
change in the law which would force them to comply with the measure.
One of the companies said: 'There is now so much regulation that no pension
fund can be sure that they are keeping up with the latest requirement.'
According to a Whitehall official, the message from employers to ministers
is: 'Resist the temptation to over-regulate.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / Ulster searches for equality at work: A struggle to
eradicate decades of religious discrimination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Cooper may not be amused at the prospect of his organisation being
taken before Northern Ireland's fair employment tribunal to answer an
employee's allegations of religious bias. The organisation in question is,
after all, the Fair Employment Commission, set up to help eradicate decades
of damaging workplace discrimination.
But Mr Cooper, the FEC's chairman, can perhaps find some consolation from
knowing that the tough set of anti-discriminatory laws he is in business to
enforce in Ulster are increasingly understood and that workers will not
hesitate to invoke them if they believe they have a grievance.
It is nearly five years since the government revamped legislation to try to
tackle head-on the unlawful discrimination which for decades has scarred
many aspects of life in the province. With problems over the allocation of
housing and electoral abuses largely overcome, new measures were felt
necessary to wipe out the discrimination still rampant in the workplace.
The answer was the Fair Employment Act 1989, a tough package placing fresh
responsibilities on employers to monitor the religious composition of staff
and to enact equal opportunities at work. The act cites more than 20
criminal offences and lays down punitive economic sanctions against
defaulting employers. The compensation ceiling for tribunal awards to
individuals has just been raised to Pounds 35,000, and already a payout
close to the maximum has been made.
Next year the legislation is to be reviewed and organisations across the
province are assessing its success and compiling recommendations for
changes. The general, though not universally accepted, view is that the act
has made a useful start in combating discrimination but that there is still
a long way to go.
For decades, Roman Catholics were in effect banned from whole areas of
public-sector and commercial life and knew it was a waste of time applying
even for jobs they were qualified to do.
Most grades of the civil service were devoid of Catholics - now they hold
three of the province's 10 permanent secretary postings - and there were few
in the professions or in skilled industrial jobs. With unsuitable schooling
and poor qualifications, they were trapped in a vicious circle.
Catholics, who make up nearly 40 per cent of the available workforce, are
still under-represented right across the economic community but the gap is
slowly narrowing.
Discrimination nevertheless remains well in evidence, with a spate of
tribunal findings suggesting that Ulster's district councils and health and
education boards are among the worst and most persistent offenders. Many
private-sector companies, overwhelmingly staffed by workers from one or
other side of the religious divide, have so far failed to make significant
changes in their employment profiles.
The picture is not just one of stubborn Protestant bosses. Among the biggest
employers, some Catholic-dominated companies are apparently proving slower
in redressing the balance than businesses with predominantly Protestant
workforces.
It is accepted, however, that change can be impeded by the religious make-up
of the local labour pool and by declining workforces in the wake of
recession.
The biggest imbalance remains among the unemployed, with Catholics still
more than twice as likely to be out of a job than Protestants. The situation
has barely improved in 20 years with many employers avoiding an underskilled
and inexperienced labour force rather than consciously discriminating on
religious grounds.
As a review of the act approaches, Mr Cooper is not complacent: 'So much
more remains to be done, but if you look at where where we were coming from
we have already moved an enormous distance.'
Mr Nigel Smyth, director of the Confederation of British Industry in
Northern Ireland, agrees: 'The legislation has started to make an impact,
particularly on recruitment and selection practices, but there was never
going to be any quick fix.'
The unions, too, say the legislation has proved more effective than they
expected. Mr Terry Carlin, Northern Ireland officer of the Irish Congress of
Trade Unions, says the law has forced many employers to consider their
recruitment and employment attitudes. But he sees little evidence that 'a
culture of equality is taking root'.
Ulster politicians, predictably, are divided. While the mainly Catholic
Social Democratic and Labour party believes that the 1989 legislation is
beginning to have a beneficial impact on employment imbalances, some Ulster
unionists complain it is now discriminating unfairly against Protestants.
There will, even so, be pressure on the government to make changes. The CBI
believes the tribunal process has become too lengthy, overly legalistic and
costly.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Heath attacks handling of EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sterling crisis would be the inevitable result of a referendum on whether
Britain should agree to a single European currency, Sir Edward Heath, the
former Conservative prime minister, warned last night.
In a wide-ranging attack in the Commons on the government's handling of
relations with the European Union, he also ridiculed suggestions that
withdrawal was a realistic alternative for the UK.
Sir Edward, who took Britain into the EC in 1973, criticised Mr John Major,
the prime minister, for not firmly ruling out a referendum on the
single-currency issue and for allowing Downing Street to be associated with
speculation about possible withdrawal.
Emphasising that a referendum campaign would extend over four or six weeks,
Sir Edward urged those who favoured such a course to remember what happened
to sterling in a couple of hours on 'black Wednesday' when it was forced to
withdraw from the exchange rate mechanism.
He said: 'It's so fantastic it's unbelievable that anyone could even
consider the idea as being possible.'
He said observers in the US and the Far East thought that people who
suggested withdrawal 'are out of their minds, and I agree with them'.
Sir Edward called on the government to return to the prime minister's
earlier statement that Britain should be 'at the heart of Europe'. This
meant being prepared to take part in the 'heartbeats' and to do so
wholeheartedly.
Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, foreign office minister, said that Britain wanted
a 'people's Europe' which was outward-looking and able to face common
challenges with confidence.
It should not be a Europe for politicians and bureaucrats, but one which
responded to people's day-to-day concerns about jobs, security, crime and
the need for budgetary discipline and action against waste and fraud.
The tone of the debate, arranged as a precursor to next month's elections
for the European parliament, was low-key because of the death of Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Government irritated by Reynolds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a breakthrough in the search for peace in Northern Ireland were set
back yesterday as it emerged that the upbeat tone of recent remarks by Mr
Albert Reynolds had irritated London.
The Irish prime minister's comment that written questions from Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing, about last December's UK-Irish declaration were
'answerable' was seen as unhelpful by some in the UK government because it
raised expectations that the deadlock might soon be broken.
But Downing Street yesterday moved towards clarifying one of the questions
raised by Sinn Fein by hinting strongly that acceptance of the joint
declaration was not a precondition for involvement in political talks.
Downing Street said the 'primordial' requirement for Sinn Fein to enter
talks was a permanent end to the IRA's armed campaign. It said this
renunciation of violence was 'at the heart' of the declaration.
London intends to publish the text of Sinn Fein's questions, which were
forwarded by Dublin, at the same time as its comments, probably tomorrow
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has sketched out the areas covered
by the questions without giving precise details.
Government sources at Westminster were yesterday playing down expectations
of what might emerge from London's comments.
They said many of the questions raised matters that would only be resolved
after further talks between Ulster's constitutional parties.
At least one of them constituted a 'trick question', since it appeared to
refer to a unionist veto that the government has consistently maintained
does not exist.
As unionists warned of a likely upsurge in loyalist violence if the
government's response to Sinn Fein was too explicit, police launched a drive
against suspected loyalist terrorists in Belfast.
Following the largest operation of its kind this year, police were last
night questioning up to 20 people, including the suspected leader of the
outlawed Ulster Defence Association.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary said it had seized three submachine-guns and
300 rounds of ammunition.
But the cycle of violence continued when a 35-year-old Roman Catholic man
was shot and injured while making a regular weekly delivery to a shop in
north Belfast.
Downing Street insisted last night that the government was not 'in the
business of clarification' and had only 'helped the Downing Street
declaration to explain itself'.
It said the exercise of commenting on the Sinn Fein document was 'no
different in kind' from previous speeches.
'The fact that Sinn Fein appears to find it necessary to produce a document
indicates that they and the IRA are having to justify their actions to
fellow nationalists.'
Mr Reynolds's comments came after unscheduled talks in the US with President
Bill Clinton. The Irish prime minister said he hoped London would give the
most positive response it could.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Output price rise lowest since 1986
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Factory output prices barely changed last month, suggesting that
inflationary pressures remain weak in spite of the longer-term inflation
concerns voiced by the Bank of England last week.
Producer output prices - the cost of goods leaving factories - rose a
seasonally-adjusted 2.2 per cent in the year to April compared with the
previous year, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
This headline rise was the lowest since December 1986, down from the 2.8 per
cent rise seen in March. But though output figures are regarded as a good
guide to future inflation, analysts pointed out that last month's result was
slightly distorted by the absence of a March Budget this year.
Measured on a monthly basis, excluding petroleum, tobacco, food and
beverages, underlying output prices were unchanged in April, after small
rises in the previous two months.
The headline figure, which includes all goods, rose by 0.3 per cent in April
compared with March. This measurement is regarded as less accurate because
of the price volatility of goods such as petroleum.
Input prices - the price of fuel and raw materials bought by industry - also
remained subdued.
The seasonally-adjusted input price index rose by 0.5 per cent between March
and April. Measured over the year to April, input prices fell by 1.5 per
cent annually, compared with a fall of 2.8 per cent in the year to March.
The Treasury yesterday said the figures were evidence of a 'pretty good
outlook' for inflation over the coming months.
'The figures are further evidence of weak inflationary pressures,' it said,
pointing out that underlying output prices were now lower than at any point
since the 1960s, barring a couple of months during the second half of 1992.
The only worry, analysts said, was a rise in commodity prices, which
contributed to a 0.4 per cent rise in the cost of materials and fuels during
April. This was primarily due to the rising cost of imported materials,
which grew by as much as 0.8 per cent in the food manufacturing sector.
Analysts yesterday pointed out that the fact that these rises in input
prices had not fed through to output prices. This highlighted the intense
competitive pressures in the manufacturing sector - a pressure that was
triggering a broader change in business culture, as companies sought to
widen the margins by cutting costs rather than raising prices, they added.
'Companies would like to put prices up but they can't because of the
competitive pressures in the UK,' said Mr Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist with
Natwest Capital Markets.
Mr Dicks believes prices are likely to start to pick up again in the summer,
as the UK reaches the bottom of the inflation cycle.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Unexpected strength in April retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales were stronger than anticipated last month, according to the
Confederation of British Industry's latest distributive trades survey.
Britain's shopkeepers, however, could not completely shrug off the April tax
increases - sales fell below normal expectations for the time of year for
the fourth month in succession.
Half the 313 retailers polled between April 18 and May 4 said that volume
sales were higher in April than in April 1993, while 28 per cent said that
they were lower. The resulting balance of plus 22 per cent was the highest
since December and well above the 14 per cent positive balance of retailers
who expected a year-on-year increase in sales in April when polled before
the tax increases.
However, only 16 per cent of those polled said that sales were good for the
time of year: just over half reported average sales and 31 per cent said
sales were poor. The resulting negative balance of 15 per cent was in line
with the survey's findings for the first three months of this year and was
consistent with an 'unspectacular economic recovery', according to Ms Kate
Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser.
There were marked differences between retail sectors last month. Strong
sales growth among footwear and leather shops, clothing retailers and
confectioners contrasted with a marked downturn in chemists' sales for the
second month in succession.
Within retailing, mail-order companies, with a positive balance of 93 per
cent, reported a sharp increase in sales volumes. Otherwise, only large
multiple stores reported higher sales in April.
Wholesalers' reported a positive balance of sales in the year to April of 14
per cent. This was the smallest such balance since August last year,
indicating a slow rate of growth. Wholesalers, however, said that sales for
the time of year were higher than normal. A relatively strong positive
balance (31 per cent) of the 128 companies polled said that they expected
increased sales this month.
Among motor traders, a positive balance of 24 per cent of the 62 companies
surveyed pointed to an increase in sales in the year to April. Yet sales
were reported to be below average following 'roughly average' sales in March
and higher than average sales in January and February.
The CBI said that the annual rate of sales growth was expected to improve
for all three distributive trades in May while sales volumes were expected
to be slightly greater than average. A record number of direct mail items
were posted in the first quarter of this year, according to the Direct Mail
Information Service, an independent monitoring group, Diane Summers writes.
The figure of 705m items, up almost 9 per cent over the first quarter of
1993, overtakes the previous record of 648m for the first quarter of
pre-recession 1990. January to March is traditionally the busiest time for
direct mailing activity. The totals exclude overseas mail, for which no
figures are available.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Top car dealers' profits up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The top 200 car dealer groups substantially increased their profits last
year as sales began recovering from their deepest recession since the second
world war.
However, the improvement was more the result of tough cost-cutting measures
than increases in sales volume, according to an analysis of the sector's
performance by motor trade monitoring group Sewells International and the
trade newspaper Motor Trader.
The analysis shows that the top 200 groups, which between them account for
about one-third of new-car sales, collectively earned pre-tax profits of
Pounds 294m, a 75 per cent increase on 1992. The total value of sales, at
Pounds 17bn, was only 21 per cent higher than the Pounds 14bn achieved a
year earlier.
The figures were achieved against the background of an 11.6 per cent rise -
to 1.78m - in the UK new-car market last year. This was still well below the
2.3m achieved in the record year of 1989.
The analysis shows that even dealer groups with a return on sales of 2.6 per
cent did well enough to warrant a top 20 place in the profitability stakes -
'which once again shows the terribly low margins in the motor trade compared
with other sectors', according to the analysis.
Top performer by this yardstick was the relatively small Hanro group, which
made a 10.15 per cent return on sales. AFG Holdings was second with 7.5 per
cent.
The UK's biggest motor retailer with 134 outlets, Lex Retail, achieved a
ninth-placed 3.27 per cent return on sales. The analysis also shows a sharp
increase in takeover activity, with the 20 largest groups now controlling
some 950 of the UK's 7,400 franchised car dealership outlets.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury yesterday announced that a leading industrialist will supervise
a planned internal review of its senior management structure and disclosed
details of the fundamental review of its spending and running costs that was
announced with the November 1993 Budget.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI and PowerGen and a member of the
Court of the Bank of England, will supervise a 'senior open structure
review' looking into possible changes to the way the Treasury deploys senior
staff.
As part of the review of running costs, Sir Colin will supervise an
examination by Treasury staff of how work in their directorates should be
developed and organised.
Detailed work on the organisation of directorates and the allocation of
resources will be carried out by a team headed by Mr Jeremy Heywood, who was
principal private secretary to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr
Norman Lamont, his predecessor.
This part of the review, which will also look at the Treasury's relations
with other organisations and how to contain spending growth, will be
completed in the autumn. The Treasury review of its programme expenditure,
such as payments to the Bank of England and Royal Mint, will be co-ordinated
by Mr Kit Chivers. The results will influence the Treasury's internal
budgeting for 1995-96.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Foreign dairy groups see Britain as potential cash cow: The
likely effects of the planned free market in milk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trains loaded with fresh milk could be running through the Channel tunnel
next year, says Mr Andrew Smith, managing director of the UK offshoot of
Besnier of France.
Besnier - one of the largest dairy companies in Europe - hopes to triple its
dairy sales in the UK during the next three years to Pounds 100m.
Britain is the latest battleground for Europe's large dairy companies. In
November the government plans to abolish the Milk Marketing Board's 60-year
monopoly on the wholesale purchase and sale of milk in England and Wales,
unleashing a free market in the Pounds 3.3bn fresh milk business.
The liberalisation of the milk market will leave dairies to buy their supply
direct from farmers or through Milk Marque, the milk board's successor,
which is being organised as a farmers' co-operative.
Mr Rory O'Mahony, chief executive of the dairy group at the Irish Republic's
Avonmore Foods, said: 'We've got a great deal of experience of buying milk
directly in our other markets which gives us a competitive advantage.'
Avonmore invested Pounds 20m last year in expanding its foothold in the UK
market.
Opening up the market will not eliminate the shortfall in milk production
because European Union quotas restrict output to 85 per cent of UK needs.
The rest of the EU produces a dairy surplus of 15 per cent.
Some European dairies hope to import raw milk from countries such as Denmark
and the Irish Republic which produce up to three times their own
requirements.
'European dairy companies are under pressure from falling product prices and
cuts in European Union intervention,' said Mr Michael Landymore, food
analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite Institutional brokers. 'They are targeting
the UK in the hope of a higher return.'
The introduction of the European single market and the interests of some
retailers in expanding overseas have further fuelled the
internationalisation of Britain's dairy business.
'We can follow the UK retailers as they expand across Europe,' said Mr Roger
Clarke, commercial director of MD Foods, the British offshoot of Denmark's
large dairy company which is partly owned by a farmers' co-operative.
MD Foods has spent Pounds 150m on an acquisition programme in the UK in the
past three years, gaining a 10 per cent share of the milk supply market.
The company, best known internationally for copying brands of cheese such as
feta, is looking to match its success in milk with a drive to boost its
share of the UK cheese and dairy products sectors.
Innovation in the fresh dairy product sector has been led by European
players who hope to see margins for their products improve as a result of
the scramble for milk in November.
Germany's Muller rapidly gained a large slice of the British yoghurt market
and has set up a production plant in the UK.
Mr Smith says the privately-owned Besnier group plans to launch a large
marketing campaign to push some of its cheese, butter and other dairy
products in Britain. In March it consolidated its UK operations into one
company.
Cheese and buttermakers have been a low priority in the arcane system for
allocating supplies and have had to run their plants at well below capacity
because of the problem of obtaining milk. 'Now, efficient producers will be
able to go out and pitch for it,' said Mr O'Mahony.
The abolition of the pricing and supply system will also remove production
constraints from dairy processors enabling them to cut costs. MD Foods plans
to cut its costs by 20 per cent during the next three years. Last month the
company split its UK operations to form two units, one of which will
concentrate on doorstep service.
Doorstep delivery, and the British consumer's appetite for fresh milk, makes
the UK market very different from the rest of Europe. Northern Foods, one of
the biggest domestic suppliers, believes competition will remain restricted
by the limited milk pool.
'Even with the Channel tunnel, transport costs will probably make it
prohibitively expensive to bring in a lot of raw milk from the continent,'
said Mr Neil Davidson, group executive at Northern Foods.
Northern is taking a different approach from some of its European
competitors. It is threatening to invest Pounds 50m in a dairy products
plant on the continent if the government does not ensure there is enough
competition in the milk sales market in the UK.

<TEXT>
The housing market recovery is continuing with a gentle but consistent rise
in prices, particularly in south-east England, a survey of more than 100
estate agents published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors has found.
The survey says more than a fifth of agents in England and Wales have
reported a rise in prices during the three months to the end of April.
Static prices are reported by 74 per cent; and only 4 per cent report price
falls.
In south-east England 46 per cent of agents have reported price rises with a
similar proportion finding static prices, according to the institution. It
says that April's tax increases have so far made very little impact on the
housing market.
It says sales in the south-east have 'improved in a swathe of towns from
Berkhamsted to Windsor'. Sales in Sevenoaks, Kent, have reached the highest
level since the late 1980s while in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, they have
returned to the level of 1987.
Agents remain concerned that would-be sellers are still overpricing
properties, the institution says, adding that buyers remain very selective.
'There is a strong line . . . that overpriced houses are being ignored and
that there is a continued shortage of properties for sale,' it says.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Plan for old power stations faces rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large electricity users are to tell the government that the idea that they
might buy spare generating capacity to help keep their costs down is
unlikely to be practicable.
They say the costs of improving older power stations to meet new laws on
sulphur dioxide emissions would be prohibitive. Their electricity would
eventually cost more than they pay now from the 'pool' run by the
generators.
Even to buy a plant and run it unimproved until the new laws come into
effect in the year 2001 would involve higher costs than the pool, as they
would be liable for redundancy payments, decommissioning, demolition and
environmental clean-ups, possibly costing more than Pounds 100m a plant.
A delegation of big users, Tory and Labour MPs, and council leaders is
arranging to see Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, in the next few weeks.
The move will dash government hopes that selling power stations to big users
could solve their pool-prices problem.
Under the pool system, the price of electricity varies every half-hour and
is fixed at the marginal cost of production of the last available plant
brought on stream to fill national demand. Winter tea-times should be the
costliest periods. In practice, prices have varied according to what plant
is 'available'.
Imperial Chemical Industries has warned it might pull out of
energy-intensive chlorine production - threatening more than 7,000 jobs - if
the issue was not resolved.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, last year persuaded
the generators to peg pool prices to an annual average of 2.4p per kWh and
obtained a commitment from them to offer spare generating capacity for sale.
ICI, Pilkington and British Steel are among several companies that have
formed a loose consortium to consider buying the 2,000MW Fiddlers Ferry
power station at Widnes, only a few miles from ICI's chlorine plant at
Runcorn, Cheshire, and Pilkington's glass factories at St Helens,
Merseyside. The electricity generators paid the government Pounds 100,000
for each MW of generating capacity on privatisation, so Fiddlers Ferry would
have cost PowerGen about Pounds 200m. The asking price is therefore likely
to be in the Pounds 100m to Pounds 150m range.
But the plant is an obsolete coal-fired station and operates only because
the government's pollution inspectorate tolerates its emissions of sulphur
dioxide. Some members of the consortium say there is a risk it could be shut
down at any time.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Professor Littlechild reappointed for second term of office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, yesterday
received a mandate to continue in office until almost the end of the century
when he was reappointed for a second five-year term of office, Michael Smith
writes.
Yesterday's announcement by the Department of Trade and Industry confirmed
industry expectations, but comes after speculation that Prof Littlechild may
have lost the government's confidence because of controversial stands on
issues including the production of coal and electricity. The reappointment
to August 1999 will enable him to oversee the introduction of a system which
many people believe will be as close to full de-regulation as possible.
Electricity distribution will remain a monopoly but consumers will be able
to choose their supplier of power by 1998. By then there will be much more
competition in power generation.
Prof Littlechild, 50, remains on leave from his job as head of the
department of economics at Birmingham University.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, yesterday said that Prof Littlechild had
played an important role in the creation of a competitive electricity market
and had established Offer as an authoritative regulatory body for the
industry.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Large job growth forecast for City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central London is likely to see a growth in total office employment of
between 50,000 and 65,000 jobs by the year 2000, according to a report
published yesterday.
The growth in office employment could generate demand for nearly 10m sq ft
of extra office space, according to a report by the chartered surveyors St
Quintin.
The employment growth is likely to be less important in generating demand
for offices however, than the need for City occupiers to change and upgrade
their accommodation. A quarter of City tenants are housed in unrefurbished
buildings built before 1970.
An anticipated growth in the amount of floorspace occupied by each worker is
also expected to increase demand by up to 4.5m sq ft.
The report says the chance of another explosion in the financial and
business services sectors, which grew sharply in the mid-1980s, is
'extremely unlikely'.
Increasing productivity and greater use of technology means that employment
in the insurance and retail banking sectors is likely to undergo further
rationalisation in the short term.
Overall, the financial and business services sectors, which account for
nearly half of Central London's employment, are expected to grow at an
annual rate of between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent in the next six years.
The bulk of job growth is likely to occur in professional and business
services rather than in the financial sector.
The report's projections are based on the assumption that London retains its
position as Europe's leading financial centre. However, it highlights a
number of potential threats to that position, including inadequate
infrastructure, increased teleworking and competition from other centres
such as Frankfurt.
Mr Peter Damesick, head of research at St Quintin, emphasised the
uncertainties involved in making long-term projections.
'Even the modest increase in occupied floor space in our projections is not
guaranteed,' he said.
The report was commissioned by the Corporation of London, the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Investment Property Forum, a
surveyors' group.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Lending to most business sectors falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank loans to the car manufacturing sector have risen by 15 per cent in the
past 13 months, lending figures issued by the Bank of England yesterday
revealed.
The figures also show that the motor vehicle, hotel and retail sectors were
almost the only business sectors which increased their indebtedness during
the first three months of this year, as total bank sterling lending to UK
residents fell during the quarter by 0.1 per cent.
Bank loans to the motor sector rose by 5.9 per cent, or Pounds 0.1bn during
the first quarter, with Pounds 1.8bn worth of outstanding sterling loans.
Meanwhile, bank loans to garages, hotels and distrib-uting groups also rose
by 0.4 per cent, or Pounds 0.1bn.
This was partly due to a seasonal growth in the demand for credit by hotels
and catering companies, the Bank said.
Overall, though, industry reduced its level of indebtedness by 3.1 per cent
in the first quarter of this year.
This suggests that many companies were seeking to pay off their loans as the
business climate picked up earlier this year.
This happened in spite of evidence from other banking surveys suggesting a
more recent surge in company credit in March.
One of the largest falls in lending occurred among food, tobacco and drinks
companies, which reduced their borrowing by 4.1 per cent, or Pounds 0.3bn,
after a strong increase in lending in the previous quarter.
However, this drop in business borrowing was partly balanced by a 0.9 per
cent rise in individual borrowing, the Bank said.
Although consumer credit fell in the quarter by 0.2 per cent, this was a
result largely due to seasonal factors, and was more than offset by a 1.5
per cent rise in mortgages. Over the year as a whole, mortgages rose by 9.3
per cent, the Bank said.

20m-Pounds 25m.
The sale of the 1m sq ft of industrial buildings and development land will
be a step towards the winding-up of the Ayrshire new town, which is planned

sale of a Scottish new town's industrial assets and the first time a new
town's industrial assets had been offered for purchase by a single buyer.
The industrial portfolio consists of six industrial estates and three groups
of workshops.
So far there have been six sales of industrial estates in Scottish new
towns, which have involved the sale of more than 3.5m sq ft of factories and
development land, raising more than Pounds 50m.
Last October Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, announced that the wind-up
dates of Irvine new town, designated as Scotland's fifth new town in 1966,
had been brought forward by three years.
Livingstone and Cumbernauld new towns are also due to be wound-up in
December 1996. East Kilbride and Glenrothes are scheduled for wind-up by
December 1995.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Gaza prison inmates relive horror of torture: Just hours
after Israelis evacuate notorious jail . . .
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Palestinian inmates of the notorious Gaza prison, forced by Israeli soldiers
to wear dirty canvas hoods over their heads, knew the geography of the jail
by names which captured their torment: 'The Slaughterhouse', 'The
Refrigerator', and 'The Bus'.
Yesterday, hours after Israel quietly evacuated the prison in the middle of
the night, several emotional ex-political prisoners swept through the
corridors, spitting on freshly painted walls, banging doors, cursing Jews
and reliving the painful experiences of their confinement.
One row of murky, tiny cells were known by detainees as 'The twenties' after
their numbers. Here, in claustrophobic 9ft by 5ft cells, up to six
handcuffed prisoners awaiting interrogation had to sleep with their backs on
the floor and their legs resting on the walls for several days.
'There were no windows and you never knew what time of the day it was. Even
the smell was a horrible form of torture,' said Mr Taher Shriteh, a
Gaza-based journalist who spent 38 days inside the prison for having a fax
machine in his house which belonged to a leader of the extremist Hamas
Islamic Resistance Movement.
Upstairs Mr Shriteh showed journalists 'the bus', where blindfolded
prisoners were seated in long rows on small children's chairs for days
waiting to be interrogated by Israeli Shin Bet intelligence agents. 'You
could hear people screaming and crying as they were beaten behind these
walls in the slaughterhouse and everybody was very scared.'
At another set of windowless rooms with just a small round ventilation hole
in the roof, Mr Shriteh said Israeli officers would inject freezing air
during the chilly winter.
Before slipping out of the prison at 3am yesterday Israel whitewashed the
building and broke down walls between cells to conceal the cramped living
conditions.
The prison was part of a larger complex of buildings which included Israel's
military headquarters and functioned as a nerve centre of more than a
quarter century of occupation.
Before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war the compound was an Egyptian prison and
headquarters, known as 'The Palace'. One room had the rusty chains and
trapdoor apparatus of an execution chamber.
Exhausted Palestinian soldiers from the Egyptian-based Ain Jalut brigades
bedded down in rooms which just 24 hours ago had housed young Israeli
soldiers.
Hundreds of Gaza residents thronged outside the prison and pressed up
against the gates to ask whether their relatives were among newly arrived
Palestinian policemen. Palestinian security officers had difficulty holding
back the youths as tempers flared.
One teenager who was being questioned by plain-clothes security staff
threatened that a new civil war would erupt if the policemen did not respect
the 'shabab' - the youths who sustained the seven-year intifada or uprising.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Regional divide marks Malawi poll: Lack of policy
differences has changed the contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half Malawi's children are stunted by malnutrition, according to the
government's own figures. Seven out of ten women cannot read. Nearly half a
million families live on farms of less than an acre (less than 0.5ha) and
earn less than Dollars 50 a year in cash and kind.
This is the grim reality of the 'least developed' tag conferred by the UN on
a country that ranks among the 15 poorest in the world.
It is a reality that has received little attention on the hustings during
Malawi's first multi-party election campaign, because the contenders barely
differ on what to do about it.
Yesterday Malawi's parliament approved an interim constitution on the eve of
today's parliamentary and presidential elections that many analysts believe
will bring an end to 30 years of domination by the ailing President Hastings
Kamuzu Banda, believed to be in his mid-90s, and his Malawi Congress party
(MCP).
The interim constitution curtails the sweeping and absolute powers enjoyed
by President Banda and was worked out by an all-party panel earlier this
year after opposition parties, banned since 1966 in a crackdown on dissent,
were legalised.
President Banda's grip on power was evident when the MCP chose him as its
presidential candidate, despite his infirmity. But public impatience with
his dictatorial ways have showed up in the final days of the campaign, when
his rallies have drawn smaller numbers of supporters than those of the
opposition.
A small, land-locked country with negligible industry and an overwhelmingly
rural population, Malawi has relied since independence in 1964 on rain-fed
subsistence agriculture and cash-crops: tobacco, tea and sugar. This will
not change in the short term, although diversification into low-volume,
high-value crops is being encouraged.
In 1990, Mr Banda's government adopted a 'growth through poverty reduction'
strategy of allowing smallholders a share in the lucrative, export market
for Burley tobacco, previously dominated by large estates. Gradually the
economy has been liberalised through the reduction of import barriers,
divestment and privatisation of para-statals and the lifting of foreign
exchange controls.
All of this, the government believes, will enhance efficiency, boost exports
and attract foreign capital. The opposition agrees.
Two years ago, when trade unionist Chakufwa Chihana, leader of the
opposition Alliance for Democracy (Aford), was imprisoned for his advocacy
of political pluralism and donors imposed an aid embargo to press for 'good
governance', political change seemed inevitable and Mr Chihana the likeliest
man to take the helm.
Now President Banda's MCP has accepted change, albeit grudgingly, and is
struggling to graft a new, democratic identity on to its 'Four Cornerstones'
of Unity, Obedience, Discipline and Loyalty.
One consequence is that Mr Chihana has lost the political initiative and
probably, with it, his chances of the presidency. For lack of policy
differences has, for many voters, turned the election into a contest between
the regions.
Aford is associated with the north, the MCP with the centre, and Mr Bakili
Muluzi's United Democratic Front with the south. If people vote along
regional lines, Mr Muluzi will win, because the south is the most populous.
Ethnically complex regional distinctions were embedded in the early colonial
period when British missionaries developed the best schooling in the north,
and consolidated the south's commercial orientation, which itself stemmed
from early Arab influence.
Censuses in the Banda era did not acknowledge tribal differences, merely
dividing the population into Africans, Asians and a diminishing number of
Europeans. Yet the north-south divide has remained marked with persistent
jockeying for regional advantage.
When President Banda was invited back to Malawi in 1958 to lead the
independence movement, after many years in the US, Britain, and Ghana, he,
as a native of the centre, was the compromise candidate between better-known
contenders from north and south. Since then he has favoured and developed
the centre, building a new capital city there and making its language,
Chichewa, an official, national language alongside English.
Mr Chihana could probably have transcended the regional divide by endorsing
the wage demands of striking private and public sector workers who brought
the country to a standstill last September.
But his 'trade unionist' label is deceptive. If he was ever drawn to
'African socialism', Mr Chihana is no longer. He not only embraces the
market but is committed to an austerity period to check the inflationary
pressures of devaluation, Aford's political secretary and chief ideologue,
Mr Mapopa Chipeta, identifies the future goal as 'developing a dynamic,
indigenous, capitalist class'.
Such talk echoes the first days of African independence, reflecting the
extent to which economic power in Malawi has remained in the hands of
President Banda and the family of his consort, 'Mama' Cecilia Kadzamira,
through their ownership of the enormous Press Group of companies, long
managed by British and South African expatriates.
That capitalism needs popularising and Africanising is also exactly what Mr
Muluzi and other UDF leaders believe. Moreover, several of them, as
medium-scale entrepreneurs frustrated by Mr Banda's grip on the economy, can
convincingly claim to be prototypes of the new capitalist class.
It is this class which will most clearly benefit from economic
liberalisation in Malawi. Mr Muluzi, as representative of it and of the
south, seems most likely to take the presidency, particularly if memories of
repression obliterate the MCP vote in the centre, and despite his own long
association with the MCP in the past.
But any new government will face two big problems. With regional divisions
exposed by the campaign after a long period when unity was enforced through
repression, it will not be easy to maintain national cohesion. Nor will it
be easy to explain to impoverished Malawians that democracy alone is no
guarantor of prosperity.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Syria praises 'keen' US peace efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Syria yesterday welcomed 'intensified' US efforts to broker progress in
peace talks with Israel after Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
delayed his departure from Damascus for two unscheduled rounds of talks with
the Syrian leadership, before carrying the results of his discussions to
Israel.
Praise for Mr Christopher's 'keen efforts' to bridge the gap between the two
sides, carried on the state-run Syria radio, was virtually the sole official
comment on the progress of his two days of talks in Damascus. US officials
would say only that Mr Christopher was 'inching' the talks forward.
However, the secrecy, combined with Mr Christopher's evident willingness to
tailor the present mini-shuttle, his second in two weeks, to the course of
discussions, suggests the secretary of state is exchanging detailed and
specific proposals between the two sides, and is determined to achieve
tangible progress.
The two unexpected rounds of talks with Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's foreign
minister, were punctuated by trips by Mr Christopher to the US embassy in
Damascus, where he is understood to have called Washington. Yesterday's
talks followed a four-hour discussion on Sunday night with Mr Hafez
al-Assad, the Syrian president.
Mr Christopher is understood to have presented a series of proposals to Mr
al-Sharaa and obtained a response before flying to Israel, where he went
straight into talks with Israeli leaders.
Though no details of the talks have emerged, Tishreen, the state newspaper,
yesterday again indicated an apparent Syrian softening on its previous
demand for an 'immediate' withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Golan
Heights.
In a front-page comment it said Israel must offer a 'full withdrawal' from
the Heights according to a 'speedy timetable'. Israel is understood to have
offered a three-stage withdrawal over eight years - a timetable Syria has
rejected - in exchange for Syrian pledges to establish 'full peace'.
Al-Hayat, the London-based newspaper, meanwhile quoted anonymous Syrian
officials as saying Mr Assad had presented a five-point schedule for
progress on the peace talks. This is reported to have begun with Israel
annulling its parliamentary resolution annexing the Golan, and offered as a
final phase Syrian undertakings to normalise political and economic
relations with Israel.
The newspaper said Mr Christopher was also aiming during his present tour to
win agreement from both sides to establish a joint Israeli-Syrian military
committee to agree mutually acceptable security measures on the Golan and
post-withdrawal borders.

Pakistan said yesterday it would switch to a two-day weekend on Friday and
Saturday from next month, reversing the practice of observing a one-day
break on Friday only, Farhan Bokhari reports from Islamabad.
Mr Khalid Kharal, the information minister, told a press conference that the
change would save up to Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) a year in power, fuel and
transport costs. The government also said it would introduce daylight saving
time to be able to increase work hours during the winter.
The change comes as Pakistan is struggling with one of its most difficult
power shortages this year.

FT  17 MAY 94 / S African strikes pose challenge to ANC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Although the newly elected South African government has been hoping to focus
its attention on development issues, its first real test seems likely to be
in the thorny labour relations arena.
Strikes have broken out among provincial government employees and yesterday
ambulance workers in Pretoria walked out to protest against planned
privatisation of the city's emergency services.
More serious are labour relations in the country's huge mining industry. A
strike at Kloof gold mine was resolved only yesterday after the loss of six
days of normal underground production. While the problem appears to have
been solved for the moment, many analysts feel this is a sign of things to
come as unions hope to take advantage of a sympathetic government to wring
concessions from the mines. 'The workers think it's pay-back time,' observes
one mining analyst.
All this will pose a serious problem for the ruling African National
Congress, which remains in formal alliance with the Congress of South
African Trade Unions, the country's largest union federation. Many unions,
because of their position at the forefront of the liberation struggle, feel
that the new government owes them a debt which is now falling due.
The 280,000-strong National Union of Mineworkers, which has been asserting
itself in a wide range of limited actions over the past few months, has
signalled its intention to push harder on traditionally intransigent
companies now that a black government is running the country.
Right at the top of the NUM's hit list is Kloof's parent company, Gold
Fields of South Africa, one of the country's biggest mining conglomerates.
Gold Fields, which has large interests in gold, platinum, copper and zinc,
has a history of poor labour relations, and the union is determined to step
up pressure on the company.
According to Mr Jerry Majatladi, the NUM spokesman, the primary issue is
GFSA's general approach to unions, particularly the right to organise,
although Gold Fields claims the problem stems from misconceptions rather
real grievances.
The NUM plans a big march on GFSA's head office in Johannesburg over the
weekend and will consider further strike action to pursue its goals. If the
campaign succeeds, the union intends to target other recalcitrant mining
houses, notably Johannesburg Consolidated Industries, the parent of the
Western Areas mine where several workers have been killed in political
clashes over the past week.
According to Mr Gavin Brown, an industrial relations consultant, further
strikes in the rest of the private sector are now increasingly likely, given
that many companies delayed wage negotiations until after the election. He
also predicts more unrest among civil servants, particularly in the health
and education areas.
Despite their longstanding links, tensions between Cosatu and the ANC began
to surface shortly before the election, when the federation resisted ANC
calls for a moratorium on strikes. They are likely to widen further when
Cosatu launches its public sector union later this month, expected to draw
in some 150,000 civil servants.
Meanwhile, the demands of office are already forcing many former union
leaders to try to rein in workers' demands.
The former Cosatu general secretary, Mr Jay Naidoo, who, as minister without
portfolio in the new cabinet, is almost certain to be given responsibility
for implementing the ANC's planned reconstruction and development programme,
has already publicly committed the ANC to squeezing productivity gains out
of the civil service to help fund development.
Other ANC leaders have also urged restraint in wage demands to help keep
down inflation, but, so far at least, Cosatu seems unlikely to heed the
call.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Tokyo banks tire of Euro-mess: The resistance to European
loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese banks are experiencing a bad case of Europhobia. 'We're all saying
anything which starts with 'Euro' ends up in a mess,' says an official of a
leading Japanese bank.
Large European projects such as Eurotunnel and Euro Disney have become big
disappointments for the Japanese banks, which are alarmed by the continuous
refinancing requests. Among the largest creditors in the projects, they now
perceive that what they had expected to be one-off financing programmes have
turned into commitments to churn out endless amounts of money.
Since the burst of the economic 'bubble' of the late 1980s, Japanese banks
have been generally cutting their international operations and their
exposure to overseas investments.
Capital flows from Japan to the US and Europe have changed sharply.
According to Sanwa Research Institute, the research arm of the commercial
bank, average annual Japanese investment of the past two years to the US has
fallen by 48.6 per cent from 1988 and 1989 levels to Dollars 29.7bn (Pounds
20.3bn), while it has dropped 30.5 per cent to Dollars 41.2bn in Europe.
The sluggish domestic economy and the sharp fall in loan growth have led the
banks to turn instead to the fast-growing Asian economies. Capital flows to
south-east Asia have grown more than 20 per from the late 1980s to Dollars
7.1bn in 1991-92.
The rise in the yen has increased direct investment into Asia by Japanese
manufacturers and companies, and banks have increased exposure in the
region. Investment in the south-east Asian countries has started to slow
during the past year, while growth in China has drawn investments from
Japanese manufacturers and banks. 'We don't get a feel of what's really
going on in Europe as we do with Hong Kong, China or Singapore,' says one
banker.
The prolonged haggling over Euro Disney's financial restructuring package,
and the tensions over the Pounds 700m refinancing efforts of Eurotunnel,
which needs new funds because of delays, have stemmed from the banks'
un-Japanese show of resistance.
Last month they grudgingly agreed to help Euro Disney reduce its FFr21bn
(Pounds 2.45bn) debt. But earlier in the year, some of them appeared to have
already unloaded their equity holdings because of pessimism over the
project.
The lack of enthusiasm in large Euro-projects, say the banks, is partly due
to the absence of traditional and emotional ties to the region. Projects
like Eurotunnel and Euro Disney are providing services which are not
exportable, and have little commercial relevance outside Europe.
'The banks feel that they do not have the level of control they do in Asia,
where Japanese companies wield influence,' says Mr Mark Faulkner, banking
strategist at brokers SG Warburg in Tokyo. The lack of any political or
other business benefits have meant decisions over the European projects have
become purely commercial.
Japanese banks have gradually started to increase lending to US companies,
which are seeking funds as the economy recovers. The large refinancing
programmes for blue chip US companies have started to attract Japanese
lenders. For example, the banks played a leading role in International
Business Machine's Dollars 10bn loan syndicate last November.
While some banking officials claim that they are not deliberately avoiding
European deals and would still actively participate in leading European
financings, the Euro projects have left a bad aftertaste.
Suggestions that central bankers and the government would use pressure to
force the refinancing have left many banks especially angry. 'If the
European governments think it's such an important project, they should use
public funds,' says a Japanese banking official.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Japan's rich raise earnings: Tax report shows wealthiest are
recovering from recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A rise last year in the number of Japan's top income tax payers suggests
that the rich may be starting to recover from the ravages of recession.
According to the National Tax Administration Agency, 128,000 people paid
more than Y10m (Pounds 65,700) in tax in 1993, some 3,000 more than in the
previous year, when the total fell for the first time, from 175,000 in 1991.
The figure may not be a completely accurate guide to wealth, given the
highly publicised tax evasion cases to have gone through the courts
recently, like that of Mr Shin Kanemaru, former political godfather of the
Liberal Democratic party. But it does at least indicate that the richest of
those who do care to declare their revenues earned more in 1993.
Japan's top taxpayer is Mr Yasuo Takei, chairman of the Takefuji consumer
finance group, a classic rags-to-riches entrepreneur, who paid Y4.3bn in
personal taxes last year. Much of that was in capital gains from selling
shares in his company, to build up a core shareholding ahead of a listing,
Mr Takei explained yesterday. Mr Takei, 64, started his career working in
pachinko parlours and selling vegetables in the streets, before founding
Takefuji in 1968.
The top 10 include a selection of self-made business people and their
relatives, including a race-horse breeder, a computer game producer and the
owner of a video rentals company.
Senior executives of Japan's industrial establishment held relatively modest
rankings, such as Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Japan's largest
car maker, who came in a mere 92nd, with a Y330m tax bill.
The annual list is a rare guide to the identity of Japan's rich, who are
otherwise hard to spot given that only gangsters and the few property
tycoons left feel it socially acceptable to flaunt wealth.
A record 102 MPs are to be found among the Y10m-plus taxpayers, topped by Mr
Yasu Kano, a member of the opposition LDP, with a Y579m tax bill.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom power broker, put in a surprise
appearance as Japan's seventh most taxed politician, but a long way down the
overall national rankings.
He paid Y48.6m in 1993, three times as much as the previous year, much of it
on the Y105m royalties on his new book.
Blueprint for Building a New Japan, which sets out Mr Ozawa's argument for
reforming the political system and taking a more prominent role in
international affairs, has sold 700,000 copies since publication last May.
It just goes to show, Mr Ozawa commented yesterday, that people have high
hopes for reform.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Sumatran town lives in thrall to gangsters:
Military-licensed rackets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, it is hard to see why the plantation managers, traders and
factory owners who make Medan their home keep confiding to visitors that the
place is a throwback to the Wild West, 'a bit of a cowboy town'.
Busy and polluted, with its uneasy mix of Dutch colonial architecture,
Chinese shop houses and new shopping malls of concrete and glass, the
largest city in the Indonesian island of Sumatra looks like a typical
product of Asia's industrial revolution.
There is nothing very unusual about the illegal brothels, the fights in
bars, or the policemen who stop cars outside the town, accept Rp500 bribes
(about 25 US cents), and wave the cars on without even a pretence of looking
at the drivers' documents.
What is special about Medan, according to residents, is the size and
strength of the gangs running the town's protection rackets.
Foreigners rarely come into contact with the gangs because their main
targets for extortion are the ethnic Chinese businessmen who control most of
the town's commerce and industry.
Yet the two largest gangs are believed to have hundreds of members, are
unofficially licensed by factions in the army (the dominant force in
Indonesian politics), and are implicated in almost every significant event
that occurs in Medan.
Recently, for example, gangsters took sides in a violent dispute between
members of the wealthy Pardede family over the management of the Danau Toba,
Medan's largest hotel. People trying to play tennis on the hotel courts were
startled to see groups of men fighting in the car park; one of the Pardedes,
a family of indigenous Bataks, was stabbed in the lobby and the hotel was
closed pending resolution of the dispute.
The gangs are also accused by ethnic Chinese businessmen and trade unionists
of acting as agents provocateurs during the April workers' demonstrations in
support of higher pay. The demonstrations degenerated into anti-Chinese
rioting; one Chinese factory owner was killed.
Mr Muchtar Pakpahan, leader of the Indonesian Welfare Labour Union, says he
has evidence the gang members were paid to cause trouble in Medan to
discredit the independent trade union movement. Mr Pakpahan, who is from
Medan, calls the gang members 'gangsters like the Mafia in Sicily'.
The bread-and-butter business of the gangs is protection - threatening
violence against a business or a person and taking money in exchange for not
carrying out the threat. 'They make their money really by hassling downtown
merchants,' says one foreign resident of Medan.
It is alleged that officials tolerate, even encourage, the practice, which
is seen as a form of informal taxation by the locals of the rich ethnic
Chinese minority. 'It's a way of getting money off the Chinese,' says one
Indonesian. 'It's easier to pay a gang than the military.'
The two largest gangs operating in Medan are Ikatan Pemuda Karya
(Association of Working Youth) and Pemuda Pancasila (Pancasila Youth) -
Pancasila is the official state philosophy of humanism, nationalism and
belief in God.
'Pemuda Pancasila is a nationwide organisation,' says one Medan resident,
'but in northern Sumatra it has long had a history of doing dirty work for
the military in return for being given a free hand in illegal activities
such as gambling and prostitution.'
The IPK was established in the 1980s as a counterweight to the PP, which the
authorities feared was becoming too powerful, and now the IPK is said to
have the upper hand.
One of the curious features of gang leaders is that many of the locals in
Sumatra believe they have magical powers. Both Mr Olo Pangabean, the Batak
who heads the IPK, and Mr Azwanni Wan, a senior Acehnese figure in the PP,
are regarded as magicians; rumour has it that, when Mr Azwanni Wan was
beaten in captivity by a soldier, the soldier went home to find his wife
inflicted with identical injuries.
Life can be good for gangsters, even those who spent only a couple of years
at school. 'A gang leader can live like a businessman,' says one of Mr
Azwanni Wan's associates, pointing to his friend's imposing, 14-room house.
'He runs protection for more than 20 theatres and shopping centres.'
Inside the house there are pictures of Mr Azwanni Wan meeting the mayor and
wearing a white suit and white shoes, but the man himself is not there.
Found guilty of supporting the banned Aceh separatist movement - an
accusation doubtless endorsed by rival gangs - he is serving a 13-year jail
sentence.
His wife, Ms Rosmaini Rangkuti, a singer, makes some money in the meantime
by letting out the upper rooms of the house. She says her husband lives in
style in prison and could be free in four years to take full control of his
business.
Since being in prison, the 45-year-old Mr Azwanni Wan has started saying his
Moslem prayers again after a hiatus of two decades, but his associates say
he still regards four things in life as particularly important: money,
friends, magic and - last but not least - powerful connections.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Indonesian bank loan trial begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A former official of an Indonesian state bank went on trial yesterday in a
massive loan scandal that has provoked a public outcry and student
demonstrations questioning the role of senior officials in the case, AP
reports from Jakarta.
Mr Maman Suparman, 48, former manager of the Jakarta branch of the state-run
Bank Pembangunan Indonesia, was charged with corruption and abuse of power.
The loss to the state from an initial Dollars 430m (Pounds 287m) loan in
1991 to ethnic Chinese businessman Mr Eddy Tansil by the bank has swelled to
Dollars 448.8m, including unpaid interest, the Central Jakarta Court was
told. Newspapers put the amount as high as Dollars 650m.
Mr Mohammed Yamin, state prosecutor, told the South Jakarta District Court
the bank official received bribes of 256m rupiahs (Pounds 79,000) from Mr
Tansil for helping to arrange the credit.
He said Mr Suparman illegally converted a letter of credit submitted by Mr
Tansil. Prosecutors have said the aim was to permit Mr Tansil to use the
loan money without in fact buying machinery for which it was intended. If
convicted, Mr Suparman would face between 20 years and life in prison.
Mr Tansil, 40, went on trial separately last week. He is charged, among
other things, with diverting part of the loan for his personal use.
On Saturday, Mr Gani Djemat, who leads Mr Tansil's four-lawyer defence team,
told the court that the charges should be dismissed and that the case should
be treated under civil law, not criminal law. Mr Djemat acknowledged,
however, that his client faces difficulties in repaying the loan.
Thousands of students demonstrated in several large cities last month,
demanding resignation of two senior officials over the loan case. Some
called for interrogation of President Suharto's son, Mr Hutomo Mandalaputra.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Mexico exhaust catalyst plant

<TEXT>
Chemicals group Johnson Matthey is to build a car exhaust catalyst plant in
Mexico with a capacity of 1m units a year, writes John Griffiths.
The facility, costing Pounds 5m (Dollars 7.5m) and to be located 140 miles
north-west of Mexico City, near Queretaro, is due to go on stream at the end
of this year, supplying Mexico's rapidly expanding motor industry.
The catalysts, comprising a thin coating of precious metals on a cylindrical
substrate, are the active component of the catalytic converter systems being
made mandatory by the Mexican government as part of efforts to reduce severe
city air pollution.
Johnson Matthey, which claims to be the world's largest catalyst producer,
with over a third of the world market, is also planning to build a similar
plant in Malaysia, in a joint venture with HICOM Berhad, a government
investment agency.

FT  17 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Saudis in oil supply talks with China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China and Saudi Arabia are this week consolidating a closer oil trading
relationship, as Beijing seeks long-term suppliers to help it overcome a
shortfall in its own production.
China last year became a net importer of crude.
Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister now on his first visit to Beijing,
will be seeking more extensive co-operation with China in the oil sector,
including possible new contracts for shipments of Saudi crude.
The minister's low-key mission also coincides with reports of Saudi
involvement in a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) oil refinery, with Chinese and
South Korean partners.
The Saudi embassy in Beijing said that Mr Nazer would meet officials from
the China National Petrolem Corporation, the China National Chemicals Import
and Export Corporation (Sinochem), and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Co-operation.
China has been looking to the Middle East to satisfy increasing demand for
crude and derivatives in order to fuel its booming economy, which grew in
1993 by more than 13 per cent.
A western oil industry representative described China's relationship with
the Middle East, and especially with Saudi Arabia, as 'absolutely crucial'
because of China's growing demand for crude.
At a recent oil industry conference in Beijing, Mr Han Gensheng,
vice-president of Sinochem, forecast that imports would reach 50-60m tonnes
by 2000 to meet projected demand. Imports would exceed exports this year by
a small margin.
China, the world's fifth largest oil producer, registered output of 143.7m
tonnes last year, an increase of 2.5 per cent over the previous year.
China is expected this year to match the production of 1993, but is doing so
with great difficulty because most of its oilfields are mature, including
the Daqing field, which accounts for about 40 per cent of output.
Beijing's need to develop closer trading relations with Gulf states was
underlined by the visit to the region last June by the Chinese vice-premier,
Mr Li Lanqing.
He signed supply agreements with Saudi Arabia and Oman. This was the first
time the Chinese had dealt directly with Gulf states for oil purchases,
rather than via intermediaries.
While on his current visit to Beijing, Mr Nazer will also discuss details of
a new oil refinery project involving Aramco, the Saudi state oil company,
South Korea's Ssangyong, Sinochem, and the municipal government of Qingdao
in Shandong province, south-east of Beijing.
The official China Business Weekly reported at the weekend that Aramco would
take a 45 per cent share in the 200,000 barrels-a-day refinery, to be
located near Qingdao, and Ssangyong 15 per cent, with the remaining 40 per
cent shared between Sinochem and the Qingdao municipality.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Markets firm as rate rise expected

US financial markets were moderately firmer yesterday as dealers anticipated
that today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making open market
committee would end the uncertainty over interest rates.
The Fed is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates for the fourth
time this year, from 3 3/4 per cent, perhaps coinciding with an increase in
the discount rate - the rate at which the Fed lends to banks - from the
current 3 per cent.
The markets also took heart from April's industrial production figures,
showing a modest 0.3 per cent rise - the 11th consecutive monthly advance,
but somewhat less than the 0.5 per cent rises in each of the previous three
months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.82 higher at 3,671.50 and the
30-year government bond was up about half a point in late trading, yielding
7.45 per cent, while the dollar was little changed. But trading volumes were
low as many dealers stood on the sidelines ahead of today's FOMC meeting.
The improvement in industrial production was reduced by a little over 0.1
percentage points because of a 2.9 per cent decline in car assemblies,
according to the Federal Reserve. This reflects an adjustment to the near
capacity output reached in February which has proved unsustainable since.
But most of the other component parts of the index remained steady,
suggesting no incipient economic overheating. Industrial capacity stayed at
83.6 per cent, well below the inflationary threshold, and both the average
work week and manufacturing employment were essentially unchanged.
Technology was the strongest sector, with output up 1.2 per cent in April.
The production returns and last week's minimal 0.1 per cent rise in consumer
prices reinforce the impression of sustainable non-inflationary growth.
Against this background, the logic of the Fed tightening monetary policy
further would be to ensure economic growth remains steady and
non-inflationary, and to reinforce the dollar on foreign exchange markets.
The Clinton administration made no attempt to second-guess any Fed move
yesterday. Mr Roger Altman, the deputy treasury secretary, told a
conference: 'We don't have any quarrel with the Federal Reserve on monetary
policy: our hope is that this recovery will be a durable one.'

FT  17 MAY 94 / Senate flexes its muscles over foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's conduct of foreign policy has been heavily
criticised in academic and establishment circles, but increasingly the US
Senate seems ready to act where most others merely write in complaint.
Yesterday Senator John Kerry, the Democrat from Massachusetts, took to the
opinion pages of the New York Times to demand that the US oust the military
junta in Haiti by force - preferably in conjunction with others but still by
invasion.
Over the weekend, Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, and Senator
Bob Dole, his Republican counterpart, called for economic sanctions against
North Korea for refusing to subject its nuclear facilities to full
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Mr Mitchell also said he was in favour of imposing trade penalties on China
unless visible improvement in its human rights record was evident in the two
weeks remaining before Mr Clinton determines whether to extend most favoured
nation trading status.
His blunt comments need to be set against his known willingness to help the
administration find a way out of its dilemma, but Mr Dole, forever
combative, threatened to embarrass the president to the maximum extent
possible by urging him to renew MFN and admit he had made a mistake last
year in linking it to human rights.
Last week, in somewhat contradictory votes, the Senate twice urged the
lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia. Mr Dole's motion urged that the US do
so unilaterally while Mr Mitchell's called for the maximum effort to
persuade US allies to go along.
Though neither yet has the force of law, both constituted advances on an
earlier non-binding 'sense of the Senate' resolution.
Senator Kerry is not the first member of Congress to call for the use of
force in Haiti, though he may be the most influential to have done so to
date.
It is considered axiomatic that the administration would not launch an
invasion without some form of prior consent by Congress.
However, the Republican party is generally opposed, in spite of the fact
that Presidents Reagan and Bush both conducted military ventures in the
region, in Grenada and Panama respectively.
With Bosnia and North Korea, however, senatorial frustration appears to be
growing across party lines.
Many of those who supported Mr Mitchell's compromise amendment last week may
be persuaded to switch sides on the arms embargo if hostilities persist and
no progress is made in negotiations.
Lifting the arms embargo is, as Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the
foreign relations committee, put it, 'the easy cost-free solution'. One of
Mr Dole's central arguments for a unilateral lifting was that no US lives
would be put at risk.
The Clinton administration, intent on pushing healthcare reform through
Congress, is sensitive to the dangers of additional political controversy.
But this caution has already invited criticism that the president is
unwilling to take a stand on too many matters. This sense could well
encourage the Senate to take matters further into its own hands, as it last
did in prohibiting the Reagan administration from funding the Nicaraguan
contras in 1980s.

Haiti's army-installed president named himself prime minister yesterday,
hours after Mr Robert Malval, the premier named by ousted President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ordered government workers to ignore orders from the
military regime, Associated Press reports from Port-au-Prince. Mr Emile
Jonassaint, 81, issued the declaration in defiance of US growing pressure to
restore Mr Aristide to power.  President Bill Clinton has not ruled out
using military force to reinstall Mr Aristide, Haiti's first freely elected

The administration of Venezuela's President Rafael Caldera faces growing
pressure to change its economic policies after a steep devaluation,
predictions that inflation will surge to 60 per cent or more this year and
violent student protests.
The Caldera government began a five-year term in February rejecting the
free-market policies of the previous administration, and offering 'a
competitive economy with social justice'. Thus far, it has produced measures
that attempt to find a middle ground between market economics and government
control of the economy, placing greater stress on the latter.
The two leading opposition parties, Democratic Action and the Christian
Democrat party (Copei), have accused the government of incoherence in
economic policy, allowing cabinet members to contradict one another in
public and advancing a populist strategy. They have sought a return to
market-oriented policies.
Economic and political uncertainty over the last three weeks has sent the
bolivar down 12.5 per cent against the dollar at the official exchange rate
and by over 22 per cent on the parallel market.
This has caused economists to raise their inflation projections for this
year. One prominent Venezuelan economist, Mr Pedro Palma, predicted that
inflation could reach 60 per cent or more in 1994, up from 46 per cent last
year.
The administration has also faced violent protests in Caracas and other
cities after police shot and killed a high-school student during a protest
on May 5.

Mr Orestes Quercia, one of Brazil's most controversial politicians, will run
as presidential candidate of the country's largest party, the Brazilian
Democratic Movement (PMDB), following his victory in a party vote at the
weekend.
Mr Quercia was earlier this month indicted on fraud charges relating to Sao
Paulo state government purchasing policies while he was governor. His
candidature has divided the PMDB and threatens the stability of President
Itamar Franco's government, based on a shaky PMDB-backed coalition in
Congress.
Mr Quercia wants the PMDB to break with the government because it will be
easier for him to campaign for president as an opponent rather than a
supporter of the already weak and ineffectual Franco administration.
If the PMDB withdraws support - and a decision is likely in the next few
days - the government will face more problems co-ordinating congressional
business.
Congress has already almost stopped because of October's general elections.
Legislators are spending more time in their home states than in the capital.
A long-awaited constitutional revision, due to be completed this month, has
so far made almost no progress and would also be further in doubt without
PMDB backing.
Some analysts say Mr Quercia's nomination will lead to a serious and perhaps
irreparable split in the party, which evolved from groups opposed to the
1964-85 military rule.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Unemployment unlikely to have a big influence on voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last time Europeans went to the polls to elect a new European Parliament
in 1989 registered unemployment in the region was nearly 5m lower than it is
today, writes David Goodhart, Labour Editor.
But given the intractability of the jobless problem, and the universal
political commitment to resolving it, unemployment may have surprisingly
little impact on voting patterns next month. In 1989 unemployment was
heading down towards the cyclical low of 8.3 per cent, reached the following
year. It is now stabilising at a cyclical high of around 11 per cent. In
actual numbers it was then about 14.5m and it is now 19m.
But in most large European Union countries the electorate has lived with
persistently high unemployment for nearly two decades and any party offering
a quick-fix solution would face a large credibility gap.
The differences between left and right on the issue have become more not
less blurred in the past few years.
The right has traditionally stressed labour market de-regulation while the
left has placed more importance on active labour market policy and
macro-economic stimulus. Increasingly, the policy mix transcends these
polarities. Where the left has been out of office, as in Britain, it has
been easier to make some running on the issue. But in France, for example,
the Socialist party embraced monetary and fiscal orthodoxy and lived with
persistently high unemployment. If anything Mr Edouard Balladur, the
Gaullist prime minister, has placed the issue closer to the centre of
national politics than his predecessors. In Spain, the Socialist Workers'
party has lived with the highest unemployment of any of the larger EU
countries, and the number is not expected to peak until next year.
In Germany the total seems to have peaked at just over 4m, but that figure
disguises the fact that many people have dropped out of the labour market
and many others are on temporary make-work schemes.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For Italy's government and opposition parties, the European elections come
at an awkward time. The country is still catching its breath after the March
general elections which produced a landslide victory for Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, sworn in as prime minister last week at the helm of the
right-wing Freedom Alliance.
By June 12, the Berlusconi government will have been less than a month in
office - assuming it remains in place after this week's parliamentary vote
of confidence. The opposition parties, for their part, fear they will have
too little time to reassess their performance and make a fresh impact on the
electorate.
The election will be about personalities more than issues. It seems likely
to result in a general endorsement of Mr Berlusconi, although not
necessarily of his generally sceptical views about the European Union.
According to latest opinion polls, his Forza Italia movement will obtain 25
per cent or more of the vote - almost five percentage points more than in
March.
Mr Berlusconi is heading the Forza Italia list in all five of the electoral
colleges into which Italy is divided for the European elections. This
practice is being followed by all the main political leaders. Of the 1,331
candidates for the 87 seats, 156 are standing in more than one electoral
college. Although his position as prime minister would rule out his
attendance at the Strasbourg assembly, Mr Berlusconi hopes his aura of
popularity will lend a general glow to Forza Italia. Only five months old,
it cannot yet be considered a fully fledged party, and has not even held a
constituent congress. Though better funded than any other party, its
organisation is confused.
The main purpose of Forza Italia's 13,000 supporters' clubs around the
country was to get Mr Berlusconi elected prime minister. Their function in
the European elections is less clear.
Mr Berlusconi will be helped by favourable coverage provided by his own
Fininvest television network, as well as by the increasingly obsequious
position taken by the state-run RAI networks.
Mr Berlusconi's position gives rise to a clear risk of conflict of interest.
Fininvest's advertising agency recently sent all parliamentary parties a
faxed letter offering advertising spots for the European elections on
Fininvest's three channels. In addition to the name of the advertising
agency, Publitalita, the paper bearing the message was headed by the name
Forza Italia - an oversight which caused a chorus of protest.
Forza Italia's gains are likely to be at the expense of the centre - the
various fragmented parts of the Christian Democrats which were dissolved in
the run-up to the March elections.
by Forza Italia, the most closely-watched development will be the vote
obtained by the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi. The League
emerged from the March polls with the largest number of deputies within the
Freedom Alliance, thanks to its alliance with Forza Italia.
Aware that it is competing for votes with Forza Italia in the north, the
League has chosen to fight these elections alone, fielding its best known
local names, including the mayors of such northern cities as Alessandria and
Milan.
In contrast to other parties, which are often putting up candidates who
failed to win seats in the general elections, the League is trying to show
its belief in grass-roots democracy. If the League fares badly in the
European elections, its position within the Berlusconi government will be
weakened. This would in turn make the League a more unreliable ally.
In contrast to the League, Mr Berlusconi's other main partner in government,
the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, has benefited from the mantle of
respectability offered by Mr Berlusconi.
The MSI may thus improve its share of the vote, perhaps at the expense of
Forza Italia in southern Italy.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Questions on Europe: Soares argues the case for greater
powers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mario Soares, 69, Socialist president of Portugal since 1986. Prime minister
for three periods between 1976 and 1985, he was the chief architect of
Portugal's successful transition from dictatorship to democracy.
Do you believe the European parliament should be given greater powers? Yes.
We must work towards the creation of a European constitution and true
European citizenship. This will help ensure that the people of Europe become
aware that they have the ability to influence their own future as Europeans.
Where should the European Union place its greatest economic and social
priorities during the next three or four years? The priorities are to
advance to economic and monetary union with an effective European Monetary
Institute. We should not forget the European social charter. Progress in the
economic and political fields must be matched by advances in social affairs.
Is there a danger of a two-speed Europe? This is unacceptable. I see Europe
as a broad space for solidarity between people, regions and countries. The
existing inequalities, aggravated by an unfavourable economic climate,
cannot be used as an pretext for creating a two-speed Europe.
Should the EU give priority to deepening integration among the 12 members or
to widening it towards eastern Europe? Both policies are equally necessary.
There cannot be true broadening without deepening. The EU should adopt
policies aimed at eventually admitting the countries of central and eastern
Europe as full members.
Are you worried that German unification and a shift in the EU's centre of
gravity to the east and north could harm Portugal's interests? There is an
unquestionable possibility of this happening. The EU should take steps to
avoid this development.
Will assistance for poorer EU states inevitably have to be cut after the
expiry of the 1993-99 package? It is important, necessary and urgent to
supply aid to central and eastern Europe. But this should not be done at the
price of reducing aid to southern European countries, which are full members
of the European Union. Aid should continue for as long as inequalities
between countries justify it.
Is European monetary union in 1999 still practicable? Europe has lately been
gripped by pessimism over the potential of the European project. Some voices
describe it as utopian. I do not share this opinion. Only by pressing
forward towards full European union, with realism and resolution, will we
overcome our difficulties.

FT  17 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): A jobless problem that
recasts Euro-debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROUBAIX
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
To judge by the behaviour of other French cities, Roubaix should be in
flames by now. With 28 per cent of its workforce jobless, it has an
unemployment rate that is more than double that of other French cities and
towns which saw violent street protests this spring against a proposed cut
in the minimum wage to promote youth employment.
But this traditional north-eastern textile town of 90,000 has stayed
relatively calm, perhaps because of the attention paid it by the government,
whose prime minister and interior and urban affairs ministers have all taken
care to visit it in recent months.
There is no question that unemployment is the predominant political issue in
Roubaix as much in the current campaign for the European Parliament election
next month as in any local or national poll. But the broad Euro-debate on
unemployment, pitting the right's argument in favour of flexible pay and
labour markets against the left's emphasis on increased training and
work-sharing through shorter hours, is re-cast in Roubaix in far more basic
terms.
Before launching into debates about more vocational training, Roubaix first
needs to tackle 'the problem of the more than 20 per cent of its kids who
leave school at 16 without being able to read or write,' says Mr
Jean-Philippe Leclerq, the head of the town's new special employment
directorate.
Equally, before getting worked up, like the rest of France, about changes in
the so-called Smic minimum wage, Roubaix has a more fundamental problem.
This, says Mr Leclerq, is that an increasing number of Roubaisiens simply
prefer to draw France's basic RMI welfare premium, rather than seek a
full-time job (on the Smic or not).
At FFr2,400 (Pounds 281) a month, the RMI is less than half the Smic, but by
doing some work 'on the black', they can do just as well as Smic-earners
with half the effort. (If someone refuses a job offer, under French law they
cannot have their welfare payments or family allowances docked, Mr Leclerq
complains.)
'With 4,000 on welfare and 11,000 people on unemployment dole, Roubaix,
relative to its size, has the worst situation in France,' says Mr Leclerq.
Jobs exist in the town - 46,000 in all - but most of them go to people from
the surrounding area, because Roubaisiens don't have adequate skills or
interest.
Mr Leclerq points to Roubaix's textile industry, given a new lease of life
by having its products sold by the mail order industry, for which Roubaix is
the centre.
'The problem is that the mail order companies want people with computer
skills, while the tailoring companies are now largely staffed by people from
south-east Asia, like Thailand or Cambodia.' Young Roubaisiens 'just don't
want to re-enter a trade - textiles - from which their parents were made
redundant', says Mr Leclerq. 'I know, because we have set up two workshops
for apprentices and can't fill all the places.'
More troubling to Mr Leclerq is that of the 600 new low-skilled jobs created
in the town each year, Roubaisiens fill only about 200. 'Even jobs like
being a cleaner or a building, parking or garden attendant, require people
being able to read instructions and being able to move around the city
transport city system if need be.'
But in coping with its huge unemployment, Roubaix has something older than
France's Fifth Republic or the European Union on which to fall back - a
rich, almost medieval tradition of private associations whose members look
after each other. The town has some 800 associations, which have spread to
embrace many in the large community of Maghreb origin; after the 1958
devaluation of the franc discouraged Belgians from coming, Roubaix almost
literally sent out the boats to north Africa for people to work its textile
mills.
'These associations start with some leisure activity, often sporting, but
frequently then go on to organise post-school education or homework
sessions,' says Mr Mohammed Benguessi, deputy director of the Foyer de
Jeunes Travailleurs.
The Foyer also tries to place young people in their first job, not an easy
task, says Mr Benguessi who meets a certain amount of anti-Maghreb prejudice
from employers.
In general, Roubaisiens ruefully agree with the Delors White Paper's
conclusion that 'there is no miracle cure' to unemployment. They appear to
expect little possible improvement as a result of the Euro-elections, or
indeed any other election, pinning more hope on their own local efforts.
But there is also a specifically French reason why Roubaisiens and their
co-citizens are apathetic about the Euro-elections. It lies in the 'national
list' system France still uses for Euro-elections, whereby the country is
considered as just one big constituency represented by 87 Euro-deputies who
get elected according to the relative tally that their party amasses
nation-wide.
It is a pure system; unlike regional or single-member constituency systems,
no votes are 'wasted', but nor is there any geographic identification
between a French Euro-MP and his or her electorate. So, Roubaix has no
Euro-MP it can call its own or complain to.
All French parties now recognise this as a weakness that has compounded the
sense of remoteness of their Euro-MPs from their voters, and one that needs
changing.

FT  17 MAY 94 / EU close to Russia-Ukraine trade accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is poised to cement a close relationship with Russia and
Ukraine at next month's heads of government summit in Corfu which would lead
to a common free trade zone by the end of the century.
Following a meeting in Brussels of the Twelve's foreign ministers, all now
hinges on a visit to Moscow later this week by France's foreign minister, Mr
Alain Juppe, aimed at resolving residual French objections on Russia's
exports of enriched uranium.
The EU has already initialled a 'partnership' agreement with Ukraine, and
yesterday all but overcame French objections to a similar but broader
agreement with Moscow, which should be ironed out before Corfu.
If achieved, both agreements are seen by the EU as the foundations of a
stable relationship with profoundly unstable and powerful eastern
neighbours, and the necessary preconditions for the EU's common foreign and
security policy.
'It's going in the right direction,' said a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan,
EU external economic affairs commissioner.
The hope is that both Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and Mr Leonid
Kravchuk, his Ukrainian counterpart, will be in Corfu on June 24 to close
the deal.
The controversies which have snagged the negotiations with Russia have now
been largely resolved. Moscow has agreed a safeguards regime to prevent
sudden export flows of uranium fuel which might undercut French production
for its network of nuclear power plants. The EU and Russia have also arrived
at a modus vivendi on treatment of foreign banks working within the Russian
federation.
Paris nevertheless insists on further guarantees over Russian uranium
exports beyond the planned expiry date of the safeguard regime in 1997. Mr
Juppe is looking for a quotas agreement in his Moscow talks this week, but
EU diplomats believe France values an overall deal with Moscow too highly to
jeopardise it over the fine print.
The Ukraine deal, although it was reached earlier and for that reason alone
has convulsed foreign ministries across the EU, still awaits additional
agreements on how to finance the complete shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear
complex.
The EU wishes to develop a separate policy towards Kiev, through food aid,
macro-economic support and possibly very expensive aid to build alternative
nuclear reactors.
The potential cost of this, estimated at between Ecu500m (Pounds 387m) and
Ecu1bn, was underlined yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary,
who, like his EU colleagues, wants to share the cost with the US and Japan.
'We will have to come back to this, particularly on Chernobyl,' Mr Hurd
said, referring to the summit of the Group of Seven industrial countries in
Naples in July.

FT  17 MAY 94 / French airline in Heathrow complaint
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Anglo-French 'airport war' yesterday took another twist as Air Liberte,
a small private French airline, said it was complaining to the European
Commission about its failure to get adequate slots to open a service to
Heathrow.
Mr Cedric Pastour, deputy director of Air Liberte, said his company was
taking precautionary action so that 'if we do not get satisfaction out of
the new negotiations between the French and British governments. . .
Brussels will take up our case'.
Over the weekend, the two governments agreed that by the end of June,
British Airways and UK Air could start flying into Orly, the main domestic
French airport, in return for French carriers getting better access to
Heathrow.
Mr Pastour said there was a particular problem for new airlines at Heathrow.
Air Liberte had last November requested four landing and takeoff slots at
Heathrow, he complained, only to have half of them refused last week and the
other half granted 'in an commercially unusable form', such as having to
keep an aircraft at the UK airport for 5 1/2 hours.
The British Airports Authority, which runs Heathrow airport, said yesterday
that all slots were allocated every November by Airports Co-ordination
Limited, an independent company. The decision on Air Liberte slots would
have been made according to IATA rules, it said, and without prejudice.
There is intense pressure on slots at Heathrow, with the limited access to
the airport having already led to a breakdown in talks between the US and UK
on the renegotiation of their bilateral air agreement.
The problem has been greatest for new airlines and airlines seeking access
to Heathrow as part of the European Union's 'open skies' policy of
deregulation, with over a third of Heathrow's slots already allocated to
British Airways.
Virgin and American Airlines are just two of a large number of airlines that
have complained of delays in launching new services, or continuing limits on
their services, due to the lack of availability of Heathrow slots.
Earlier this month, the British Air Transport Association, which represents
UK airlines, complained that all of the 520 daily departure slots available
at Heathrow this summer were already booked, while 496 of the 517 daily
arrival slots were pre-booked.
The association is pushing for an extra runway in the Heathrow and Gatwick
catchment area as soon as possible to alleviate the problems of congestion.
Meanwhile, only a few flights to Corsica are expected to escape today's
strike at Air Inter, the domestic carrier belonging to Air France, held in
protest at its imminent exposure to foreign competition. Mr Bernard Bosson,
the transport minister, yesterday said the strike was 'comprehensible, but
not the solution'.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Brussels chief draws a line in the sand / Assessing the
reasons for yesterday's outburst by Jacques Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most of this year, Mr Jacques Delors has been as quiet as a church
mouse. But yesterday he confounded those who hoped he might be ready to
leave Brussels quietly after 10 years as head of the European Commission.
Mr Delors' outburst against Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister
and champion of deregulation, signals he is prepared to fight to the last
minute over how to strengthen Europe's competitiveness without destroying
the European social market model.
But the Delors-Rexrodt clash is also about power, about how far the
Commission should hold sway over European industrial and social policies.
Mr Rexrodt, a Free Democrat who has one eye on the coming German general
election, believes his campaign for a European deregulation initiative has
strong support among German business. He wants to create a group of
independent experts to root out Euro-legislation which could harm employment
and growth.
The German initiative, which has enthusiastic British support, drew a
withering response from Mr Delors at yesterday's sessions of European
foreign and finance ministers. He wondered aloud whether Mr Rexrodt's real
goal was to gut the Maastricht treaty's social chapter; or whether he was
aware that ministers - not the Commission - were responsible for passing
onerous legislation in areas such as the environment.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, retorted that Mr Delors
was acting like any good bureaucrat in defending his territory. But that is
not the whole story.
In the past year or so, mainly as a result of the debilitating struggle to
ratify the Maastricht treaty, the power of the Commission has diminished
visibly. So, too, has its role as power-broker and umpire inside the EU, to
the point where member states are increasingly challenging its authority.
Last week, France declared it was not willing to carry out a Commission
ruling in favour of opening up Orly airport to competition. The issue was
defused at the weekend, but only after bilateral UK-French negotiations in
which Brussels played no role.
Germany declared it was ready to take unilateral action against imports of
British beef because of suspected mad cow disease. The threat remains on
hold.
This year, Greece ignored Commission warnings (and the Treaty of Rome) in
slapping a trade embargo against the former republic of Macedonia.
France is leading a bloc of EU member states questioning the Commission's
'community competence' to negotiate trade agreements on the part of the
Twelve. 'Suspicion after the Gatt trade agreement is at an all-time high,'
says one senior Commission official.
Some observers view these challenges as part of a trend of 'creeping
unilateralism' in which member states are pursuing their national interests
aggressively at the expense of the common good which the Commission is
supposed to define and represent.
Mr Delors is clearly worried that Germany, the most powerful and populous
country in Europe, may be tempted to stir up greater mistrust of the centre
 -either under the guise of the Rexrodt initiative, or through the concept
of 'subsidiarity', the code-word for devolving decision to the lowest
national, regional or municipal level.
Germany takes over the rotating presidency from Greece on July 1. Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has already declared his determination to 'free ourselves from
the notion that everything that has a European dimension automatically falls
under the jurisdiction of Brussels' and make this a presidency priority.
Mr Delors' aides say they are worried about Mr Rexrodt more than Mr Kohl;
but Mr Delors' intervention yesterday still looks very much like a
pre-emptive strike against the incoming German presidency ahead of the
European summit in Corfu next month.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Italy plans more active EU role: Berlusconi pledge to raise
his country's profile in the world

<TEXT>
Italy's new prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, yesterday promised that
his right-wing government would play a more active role in Europe and make
his country's voice heard more worldwide. Of all the countries in Europe or
in the Group of Seven Italy has consistently played a disproportionately
small role in relation to its economic strength and strategic position.
Outlining the government programme of his Freedom Alliance to the senate, Mr
Berlusconi also indicated some reserve about the Maastricht treaty. But, in
a speech lasting nearly an hour, he declined to go into details on either
foreign or domestic policy. He only began to put together a programme with
his main allies over the past week.
Mr Berlusconi also appeared reluctant to reveal his policies in the senate,
where his government is at least eight seats short of the 164-seat majority
to win the required vote of confidence. Mr Gianfranco Miglio, the senior
Northern League senator who has always been distrustful of Mr Berlusconi,
yesterday said he would not vote for the government.
The confidence vote is due tomorrow, and yesterday the prime minister
appealed to senators belonging to the small centrist parties for support. He
hinted they should observe a truce to allow his government to set in place
its programme and judge him by his actions.
Mr Berlusconi began by focusing on foreign policy and with the admission
that his government - sworn in last week with five ministers of the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance - had been received 'in some respects with
a certain justifiable anxiety'.
He said Mr Antonio Martino, the new foreign minister (in Brussels yesterday
to meet EU colleagues) had already begun 'to state and reinforce Italy's
role as a protagonist in the European Union'. He went on: 'Italy must be in
favour of enlargement of the Union, also towards eastern Europe. . . but a
careful process of reflection on the Maastricht treaty should not delay the
process of union.'
On economic policy he promised 'incisive action' on Italy's public finances
in conjunction with a general deregulation and liberalisation of the
economy. He appealed for the dynamic private sector to adopt
'do-it-yourself' attitude to help stimulate economic growth, but said public
works projects would also have to play an important part.
To aid employers, he promised to introduce in his first 100 days a series of
fiscal measures which would ease the cost of employment and help part-time
and temporary employment. On privatisation, he contented himself with
saying: 'The government is pledged to accelerate the privatisation of Ina
(insurance), Stet (telecoms), Enel (electricity) and Eni (oil and gas).'
On the conflict of interest between his role as premier and his position as
owner of the Fininvest media empire, Mr Berlusconi said he hoped he would be
judged 'by facts and not by prejudice'. He offered no further guarantees
other than the establishment of three jurists, selected two weeks ago to
examine anti-trust laws and prepare a report by the end of September.

The German opposition Social Democrat (SPD) leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, has
rebuked business leaders for throwing their weight behind the conservative
chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, ahead of elections on October 16. In a letter to
Mr Hans Peter Stihl, head of the German Federation of Chambers of Commerce

and denied that taxes would rise under an SPD government. Mr Stihl said last
week that an SPD victory would be bad for the economy and the labour market.

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot Citroen, the French motor group,
yesterday warned that the French car market was still in a fragile state and
that sales were likely to fall again once the short-term stimulus provided
by the government's incentive scheme wore off. The car market was badly
affected by the recession last year, with the number of new car sales
falling by 18.3 per cent. However a government scheme to offer payments of
FFr5,000 to people trading in vehicles more than 10 years old to buy new
cars helped to fuel a 13.8 per cent sales increase during the first four
months of this year. Yet Mr Calvet said on French radio that the scheme was
likely only to have a short-term effect and that car sales 'may fall or even
return to a relatively weak level' when it ends next year.

<TEXT>
Moslem forces yesterday tried to push forward around Tuzla, the biggest
Bosnian government stronghold in the north-east, as an upsurge of fighting
defied renewed international efforts to end the war in Bosnia.
Sarajevo radio said the Bosnian army had advanced on Mount Majevica, high
ground overlooking Tuzla, one of six UN 'safe areas' in Bosnia. The radio
also said the centre of Tuzla and the north-west part of the Tuzla airfield
came under Serb fire. Serbian radio, quoting military sources, confirmed
heavy fighting in the region. The Bosnian army push is seen as a move to
strengthen the land links between Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zenica, the three main
government strongholds in Bosnia.
Some European observers felt the international community's failure to come
out clearly in favour of a specific peace plan has fuelled the renewed
fighting.

<TEXT>
The discovery of a hidden microphone in the Portuguese attorney general's
office and allegations that other leading officials are subject to
electronic surveillance are producing a climate of intense suspicion in the
country, with parliamentary deputies, political parties, trade unions and
other bodies calling for police to search their premises for bugging
devices. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, has ordered an
investigation to find out who placed the miniature microphone under
floorboards directly beneath the chair of attorney general Jose Cunha
Rodrigues. Suspicion fell on the government intelligence service, SIS, after
Mr Joao Maria Marques de Freitas, attorney general on the Portuguese island
of Madeira, accused SIS agents of placing an electronic bug in his office.
Press reports that the telephones of at least five cabinet ministers were
also being tapped has led to suggestions that commercial espionage might be
involved. Some of the ministers have been engaged in the adjudication of
important government contracts.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Riva finds new steel bid target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, has joined forces with German and
Italian steelmakers to bid for the special steels division of Ilva, Italy's
state-owned steel company, only days after dropping its offer for Eko Stahl,
the east German manufacturer.
Fried Krupp of Germany and the Italian companies Riva, Falck and Tadfin,
lodged a bid last week for Acciai Speciali Terni, one of two main Ilva
divisions to be privatised.
News of Riva's decision to abandon its offer for Eko Stahl emerged late on
Friday and the Italian company has refused all comment on why it broke off
negotiations with Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency. In a statement
issued yesterday by Lazard and Morgan Grenfell Italia, which are advising
the Italo-German bid for AST, the members of the consortium promised 'a
long-term commitment' to the state-owned company. Iri, the Italian state
holding company, is also reported to be considering offers from Steno
Marcegaglia of Italy and the French-owned Ugine, and two separate bids for
the flat steel division of Ilva.
The German privatisation agency, Treuhand, is now looking for a new buyer
for Eko Stahl. However, even with steelmaking retained on the site, the
government-backed modernisation plan - which would save 3,000 jobs until the
end of the year and guarantee 1,700 until 2004 - is viewed with scepticism
by the industry.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Europe's Changing Cities: St Petersburg's belief in better
times fades - Reform has brought citizens little more than hardship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bust of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of Soviet Russia's hated secret police,
still decorates the lobby of St Petersburg's police headquarters. Other than
that, little tangible is left of the communist era as Russia's second city
forges ahead with pioneering market reforms that have brought its
inhabitants hardship, bewilderment, and mixed hopes for the future.
Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, a pro-western reformer, dreams of transforming this
port city of 5m people into an important financial centre and haven for
foreign investment. Convincing the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development to hold its annual governors' meeting in St Petersburg last
month was part of his efforts to 'sell' the city to the outside world.
But the main challenge facing him and other liberals around the country is
ensuring that market reforms deliver tangible benefits for ordinary people
in time for presidential and parliamentary elections due in 1996.
Few of his fellow citizens believe he can. Popular cynicism is such that
city council elections last month almost aborted when turnout -
traditionally high in the Soviet era - only reached the required 25 per cent
minimum after polling was extended by a day.
The discontent centres on crime and corruption, an inability among
pensioners and the lower paid to make ends meet, nostalgia for the fixed
prices and safe streets of the old order, and a lack of investment to
restructure or convert St Petersburg's numerous defence plants to civilian
uses.
On the bright side, foreign and local investment in the retail sector has
already contributed to a boom of western-style shops, restaurants and hotels
in a city with considerable tourist industry growth potential. A few big
companies - such as Gillette, ABB, and Unilever - have started to invest in
the city's ailing manufacturing sector. But the trickle of investment has
yet to turn into a flood.
'We can handle political instability, inflation, and even the Mafia,' says
an executive for RJR-Nabisco, which makes cigarettes at a privatised local
tobacco plant. 'But what we can't handle is the unstable legal and tax
regime. That's where it all breaks down.'
Mr Sobchak says that his plans for an economic renaissance are hampered not
just by psychological and bureaucratic barriers to investment but by the
'slowness' of the Russian parliament and government in taking the decisions
he needs from them. These range from state subsidies for transport to lower
business costs, a reduction in companies' tax burdens, and new laws to fight
economic crimes ushered in by market reform.
Although he has already talked three western banks, the BNP-Dresdner
alliance and Credit Lyonnais, into setting up subsidiaries in the former
imperial capital, they have found little to do.
Lacking both the volume of Moscow's forex market and the capital's range of
western corporate clients, western banks, as everywhere else in Russia, are
nervous about local lending opportunities.
'If Sobchak wants to make the city a financial centre, he has to offer
appropriate incentives,' says Mr Yevgeny Yelin, head of St Petersburg's
Currency Exchange, where well-dressed dealers trade dollars and D-Marks
underneath a portrait of Catherine the Great. That has not stopped his
exchange and 27 leading banks and investment funds from initiating a
regional system for clearing share transactions in an effort to build a
western-style stock market.
However, despite Mr Sobchak's help in securing premises for western
companies, Russian entrepreneurship has so far flourished in spite of,
rather than thanks to, the authorities. A living embodiment of this state of
affairs is Mr Vladislav Gerasimov, an ex-navy captain who, three years after
acquiring the city's first privatised shop, has become a millionaire. This
summer he plans to start manufacturing the womens' shoes he has been
importing from China, at a new factory employing 400 people.
But the price he has to pay for driving a top-of-the-range Mercedes, owning
a beautiful house and having a daughter who has learnt fluent English at
private school and visited 12 countries, is to keep himself 'free of
enemies'. This means paying off not just the criminal Mafia, which at least
does favours for him in return, but also corrupt officials.
'All I encounter from the state are extortion attempts by bureaucrats. If I
knew that my money was being spent usefully I would not try to avoid paying
taxes,' he says.
Major General Arkady Kramariev, the city's police chief, who admits that
corruption is rife among city officials, the judiciary, and even his own
men, says the good news is that crime fell 11 per cent in the first quarter
of this year. St Petersburg, with 845 murders last year compared to 150 a
decade ago, is now only as dangerous as the most crime-ridden cities of
western Europe but still safer than New York or Washington.
Gen Kramariev says that much of the crime nowadays is due to an antiquated
legal system which cannot cope with the requirements of a market economy.
When, for instance, businessmen refuse to repay their debts, creditors' only
resort is 'Judge Kalashnikov' because by the time a court takes a decision
it is 'meaningless'.
A large part of the problem is psychological - with an increase in domestic
crime due to a loss of old certainties. Many citizens are convinced life is
getting worse even if, in some areas, it is getting better.
Despite earning a decent monthly salary of Rbs365,000 thanks to government
attempts to strengthen law enforcement, Captain Victor Koverzin, a police
officer who patrols the city's elegant tourist area, plans to vote for Mr
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader, as the country's next
president. His wife has been in effect laid off by a defence plant which has
been closed since January but continues to pay her Rbs25,000 a month, just
enough to buy a pair of shoes at one of Mr Gerasimov's stores. While Capt
Koverzin does not believe all Mr Zhirinovsky's promises, he thinks that 'at
least the world will stop pushing us around' if one of the few leaders
'untainted by office' comes to power.
Mr Alexei Kudrin, the deputy mayor responsible for economics, is optimistic
that economic reform will produce an upturn in time for 1996. 'The next two
years will see the economic crisis peak, with unemployment and restructuring
of enterprises. Hopefully, by that time there should also be some results,
with the creation of new jobs and new manufacturing capacity.'
The big unknown is whether an increasingly weary public will appreciate the
improvements by the time they take place.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Greek rates soar on devaluation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greek interest rates soared to record levels yesterday amid speculation the
government may be forced to devalue the drachma, following its surprise
decision to free short-term capital movement. To avoid renewed pressure on
the currency, the central bank raised the overnight borrowing rate from 30
to 33 per cent and imposed a surcharge of 0.4 per cent daily - equivalent to
an annual rate of 186 per cent. The three-month interbank lending rate shot
up to 48.5 per cent from 25 per cent on Friday.
The rise in rates seemed to be having the desired effect, with the drachma
closing yesterday at 148.2 against the D-Mark compared to 147.70 on Friday
and at 247.9 against the US dollar compared to 247.1.
Dealers said the surge in interest rates, which saw the one-month interbank
rate touch 70 per cent, reduced pressure on the drachma early in the day and
the central bank was not forced to intervene. Last week, the Bank of Greece
spent some Dollars 1bn of foreign exchange reserves totalling around Dollars
9.5bn to support the currency. However, analysts said pressure would quickly
resume as such high interest rates could not be sustained for long, reviving
fears of a devaluation.
On the other hand, the government would be reluctant to resort to devaluing
the drachma ahead of next month's European parliament elections. A
devaluation would most likely lose the Socialists several percentage points
in their first electoral test since taking office last October.
Instead, the central bank may have to abandon its 'hard drachma' policy,
intended to restrict depreciation this year to around 7 per cent, and let
the currency slide more rapidly.
'We should expect increased depreciation, perhaps an extra 3 and 5 per cent,
over the next couple of weeks,' said Mr Spiros Damaskos of Sigma Money
Brokers.
The government lifted all restrictions on short-term capital movement at the
weekend, six weeks ahead of schedule, in an attempt to ease mounting
pressure on the drachma. Central bank officials said overnight interest
rates (including the surcharge) would go 'into four figures if necessary' in
order to protect the currency.
The Bank of Greece is in the uncomfortable position of having to defend the
drachma on its own, as Greece has never joined the European Union's exchange
rate mechanism, which would allow it to call on other EU central banks for
support.
The government is relying on today's issues of Ecu- and dollar-linked bond
issues at higher interest rates to preventing a heavy outflow of capital and
boost foreign exchange reserves. Dealers said the dollar issue attracted
more than Dollars 100m from institutional investors yesterday, ahead of the
launch.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: French current account deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
France's current account slid to a FFr4.3bn (Pounds 500m) seasonally
adjusted deficit in February from a FFr16.1bn surplus in January, the
economics ministry said yesterday. The ministry said that the deficit
reflected interest coupon payments on French government bonds to
non-residents and an unusually large French contribution to the European
Union that month. The government said that its definitive surplus for 1993
was FFr59.5bn, or 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with
FFr20.5bn, or 0.3 per cent of GDP, in 1992. France had a basic balance of
payments deficit in February of FFr51.68bn, compared with a deficit of
FFr24.42bn in January and a surplus of FFr13.90bn in February 1993, the
ministry said. The cumulative deficit in the first two months of 1994 was
FFr76.10bn, compared with a surplus of FFr30.65bn in the first two months of
1993.
Italy's public sector deficit narrowed to a provisional L16,100bn (Pounds
6.7bn) in the period January-February 1994 from a L21,410bn deficit in the
corresponding period of 1993, the treasury announced yesterday.
Norway's trade surplus rose to NKr2.86bn (Pounds 264m) in April from
NKr1.67bn in March, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. The cumulative
January-April surplus fell to NKr14.95bn from NKr20.81bn in the same period
a year ago.
Denmark's unemployment in the first quarter of 1994 rose to 13.7 per cent of
the workforce, compared with 13.0 per cent in the first quarter of 1993,
according to the Danish national statistics agency.

General Motors said yesterday it was considering spinning off its Electronic

alliance between EDS and Sprint, the US telecommunications group.
EDS and Sprint simultaneously confirmed that they were in talks which could
lead to a 'merger of equals' or other type of alliance.
A marriage between EDS, the world's largest computing services company, and
Sprint, the third largest long-distance US carrier, would create an
information services powerhouse, with annual revenues of more than Dollars
20bn (Pounds 13.3bn). GM said EDS would best be able to pursue a strategic
alliance if it were an independent company.
EDS has held discussions with numerous potential telecommunications partners
in recent years - including British Telecom - but has found it hard to
clinch an alliance because of its unusual ownership structure.
GM, which acquired the company in 1984 from its founder, Mr Ross Perot,
retains ownership of its assets, but holders of a special type of GM stock,
known as class E, have a claim on EDS's dividend stream.
GM said yesterday it was considering spinning off ownership of EDS to class
E stockholders through an exchange of shares, provided this transaction was
tax-free. GM bought EDS for Dollars 2.5bn, but the company now has a market
value of about Dollars 15bn, so sale of the group could trigger a large tax
liability.
It will be up to the US Internal Revenue service to decide whether the
spin-off is for legitimate business purposes rather than tax avoidance.
GM said the spin-off would be dependent on two other factors. It must be
able to conclude a plan, announced last week, to inject the remaining
Dollars 6bn of class E stock held by its treasury into its underfunded
pension plan; and the spin-off must not result in a recapitalisation of E
shares into GM common stock at a 120 per cent exchange ratio, as provided
for under the group's certificate of incorporation.
EDS and Sprint emphasised that many issues remained to be resolved in their
merger discussions. But Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of EDS, and Mr William
Esrey, chairman of Sprint, said the two companies had the opportunity to
'create a single source for products and services to meet the converging
information and communications needs of customers'.
EDS's strength in the large business market would help Sprint expand here,
while Sprint's presence in the consumer market would allow EDS to develop
products for the individual.
Shares in Sprint jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to close the day at Dollars 37 3/4
while E class stock was up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 34 1/2 .
GM slipped from Dollars 53 1/2 to Dollars 53.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel set to make Pounds 850m cash call after loan
delays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Eurotunnel is likely to seek about Pounds 850m in its forthcoming rights
issue, 20 per cent more than the stock market expected and far greater than
any of its four previous equity-raising exercises.
The disclosure of the sharp rise in the Channel tunnel operator's
refinancing requirements came as it faced continuing difficulties in raising
Pounds 700m of new senior bank loans.
Yesterday's official deadline passed with Eurotunnel still Pounds 150m
short, largely because Japanese banks have yet to make their contribution.
Eurotunnel confirmed, meanwhile, that it does not expect to pay a dividend
to shareholders until 2003.
It also published forecasts of future revenues and operating costs. These
show that over the next decade it will only just be able to service its
total debt - including loans from public sector banks - of almost Pounds
8bn, if the latest refinancing is concluded.
Even as late as 2003, net revenue is expected to be Pounds 1.3bn, from which
Pounds 376m of operating costs has to be deducted and more than Pounds 600m
of estimated interest costs - leaving a margin of just Pounds 300m, from
which to repay principal on the debt and pay the promised dividend.
Because of the slim margin of forecast revenues over debt costs, bankers
said the company's directors have been given little autonomy over financial
decisions in the lending agreements. 'We have the company where it hurts,'
said a principal bank creditor.
The rights issue cannot take place until bankers have provided the new
senior debt. 'Missing the deadline (for raising the bank loans) is not yet a
cause for panic,' a banker said. 'I remain hopeful that we will raise the
money by the end of the week.'
Japanese bankers, who have provided 23 per cent of the company's commercial
bank debt, said they had not yet decided on new finance. But one said: 'We
feel that it's a European project and that European banks should play a
proper role.'
European bankers said they continued to hope the new loans would be provided
by existing members of the 200-bank syndicate, who have provided Pounds
6.8bn of finance to date.
Eurotunnel said yesterday it was continuing to assess how much debt and
equity it needed to raise to provide an 'appropriate margin' over its
'central case projection of funding needs'. Bankers said this was a coded
statement implying that the board had decided it needed to raise
significantly more equity than originally planned.
Eurotunnel, which yesterday received safety clearance to run freight trains
through the tunnel, is to run limited freight shuttle services from
Thursday.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Delors denounces Bonn plan to curb EU law-making: Clarke
backs move to bypass bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday launched
a blistering attack on a German plan, strongly supported by Britain, to push
for faster deregulation inside the European Union.
His intervention reopened political divisions over the degree to which the
EU should promote a more liberal labour market in order to strengthen
competitiveness and tackle unemployment.
But it also reflected fears in Brussels that Germany, the Union's most
powerful member, may be tempted to challenge the Commission on industrial
and social policy.
Mr Delors made his attack at two meetings of EU finance and foreign
ministers in Brussels. He singled out for criticism a German economics
ministry initiative to create a taskforce of experts to root out unnecessary
Euro-legislation.
But Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said the proposals put forward by Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, were an 'excellent idea'. British
experience showed that the only way to make progress on deregulation was to
bypass the bureaucracy, he said. 'President Delors is resisting this,' Mr
Clarke said. 'He gave a splendid illustration of how bureaucracy will not
reform its own procedures and is somewhat impervious to suggestions that we
might make faster progress in relieving the burden on industry caused by
excessive legislation.'
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, stressed that the Rexrodt plan
should not be seen as signalling mistrust towards the Commission. Other
German officials noted Mr Rexrodt's initiative was unveiled ahead of a
German election campaign in which it was important to address the concerns
of German Euro-sceptics.
Other countries, notably Belgium and Portugal, warned that efforts to roll
back Brussels' legislation risked damaging the European single market and
the Commission's authority.
France, whose rightwing coalition government is struggling to balance its
commitment to privatisation and liberalisation without incurring higher
unemployment, remained on the fence. Ironically, it was Mr Delors himself
who propelled the debate over deregulation to centre stage with his request,
a year ago, to prepare a discussion document on jobs, growth and
competitiveness.
The 12 heads of government endorsed the paper at the Brussels summit last
December. The paper was more in favour of labour market deregulation than
expected, but strongly defended the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty,
which seeks to preserve the influence of trade unions.
Aides to Mr Delors stressed that the Commission president was not opposed to
deregulation and pointed to his call yesterday for a 'big step' towards
faster deregulation of the telecommunications market in Europe.
But they added that the Commission president was concerned that the UK and
Germany had 'hijacked' the message of labour market deregulation at the
expense of the rest of the document. In particular, they pointed to its call
for generous financing of so-called trans-European networks, huge,
multi-billion dollar investments in road, rail, energy and
telecommunications.

FT  17 MAY 94 / Factory prices support low inflation outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A survey pointing to moderate retail sales growth in April and news
yesterday of a seven-year low in the inflation rate for goods leaving UK
factories suggested that Britain remains on course for a steady recovery
with low inflation in spite of last month's tax increases.
The Confederation of British Industry reports today that retail sales
volumes grew rather more quickly than expected in the year to April,
maintaining the 'relatively modest annual growth in volumes' of the first
three months of this year.
According to the Central Statistical Office yesterday, producer output
prices - the price of goods leaving factories - rose 2.2 per cent during the
year to April, the lowest rise since December 1986.
The two reports, coming at the start of a week packed with UK statistics,
appeared to support the Treasury's belief that the risks of higher inflation
are not as great as feared by the Bank of England and that the economy is
strong enough to withstand April's increases in direct and indirect
taxation.
That message was hammered home in Brussels yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, when he rejected European Commission forecasts that UK
growth will fall next year to 2.3 per cent from 2.5 per cent.
'The forecasts are plainly wrong and quite out of line with other people's
forecasts,' he said. 'Britain's recovery is well on course. Inflation is
staying down and I think we are going to have a good, steady, sustained
non-inflationary recovery.'
The CBI's monthly distributive trades survey, carried out between April 18
and May 4, showed that most retailers reported higher sales volumes in the
year to April, with especially strong growth in shoe shops and clothing
stores.
The improvement, said Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI survey panel,
showed that the 'high street recovery remains on course'. However, he warned
that April's volume growth remained below the year-on-year growth rates of
late last year while retailers considered sales below the seasonal average.
The picture of an unspectacular recovery with low inflation was supported by
the producer price figures where the 'under-lying' seasonally adjusted
output price index, which excludes food, drink, tobacco and petroleum,
showed no increase in April. The index rose in the latest three months at an
annualised rate of only 1 per cent.
Meanwhile, input prices - the cost of raw materials used by manufacturing -
edged up slightly, reflecting higher commodities and imports costs. The
index of input prices rose 0.5 per cent in April from March and fell 1.5 per
cent during the year to April compared with the previous year.

Today the market will get further evidence of the US discount store group's
difficulties when it produces its results for the first quarter to April.
The company warned last month that the figures would be even worse than last
year's dismal first quarter, so there are unlikely to be any surprises. In
the comparable period, it made net profits of Dollars 50m before
extraordinary items, and analysts expect the figure to be halved.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Japanese season still clouded by
domestic issues - Sony/Matsushita/Honda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Earnings announcements by Japanese companies gather full steam this week,
with brokers, trading houses, construction companies and particularly
leading consumer electronics companies reporting their annual results.
Although many brokers, due to unveil results on Wednesday, reduced their
profit forecasts in March, most are likely show recovery. They have seen a
rise in income linked to the south-east Asian markets and to profits from
bond trading, but the gains have not been large enough to cover
lower-than-expected stock market volumes.
In consumer electronics, Sony will release figures on Thursday. A 30 per
cent fall is expected in parent company pre-tax profits, due to depressed
domestic demand, while pre-tax earnings are forecast to rise 8 per cent
thanks to recovery in the US.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, due on Friday, expects a 4 per cent fall in
parent company pre-tax earnings and a 7 per cent decline at the pre-tax
level. Most consumer electronics companies have made substantial efforts to
cut costs, but the beneficial effects have been offset by currency losses
following the yen's appreciation.
With orders falling for nearly two years, construction companies, reporting
on Thursday, are expected to show weak figures. Nomura Research Institute
estimates that the sector's pre-tax profits fell by about 17 per cent in the
year to March.
NRI forecasts a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the trading houses,
hit by a decline in imports caused by the economic slump. Many companies are
still suffering from securities investment losses made during the late
1980s.
Honda, the carmaker, has pencilled in a 58 per cent plunge in pre-tax
profits because of the decline in domestic demand.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Japanese baseball fans turn to drama of soccer: The
samba-dancing goal-scorers of the J-League draw young audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese office workers are no longer alone in facing 'risutora' or
restructuring. The country's professional baseball teams are also facing a
corporate-style overhaul.
Although baseball teams had been aware of waning public support over the
past few years, not much had been done. But the spectacular arrival of
J-League, the country's professional soccer league, has attracted many
younger fans, and forced the baseball establishment to act.
Some teams have become more fan-friendly. The Hiroshima Carp have started a
'ladies' night', while the Orix Bluewave are giving out melons to fans.
Baseball officials have become so worried that they recently asked Dentsu,
the leading advertising and marketing agency, for help.
The main predicament for Japanese baseball is the younger generation, which
has a faltering enthusiasm for traditional values, as embodied by this
sport. Young Japanese are more individualistic, shun baseball's emphasis on
group effort, and are bored by the players' reluctance to show emotion on
the pitch.
Instead, they are drawn to the aggressive play of the fashion-conscious
soccer stars. The un-Japanese physical reaction - the hugging, kissing and
the baring of chests - shown by players after scoring goals has also
inspired supporters.
The trend is filtering down to school children. Little league baseball is
facing a decline in players, while the soccer club memberships are rising,
thanks to the increase in children who aspire to be like Kazu, a
Brazilian-trained goal-getter who dances the samba after scoring a goal.
This fall in support is posing a commercial threat for the baseball teams.
Last month, tickets for the season's opening game of the Giants, the most
popular baseball team, went unsold, while J-League tickets have been almost
impossible to buy.
Soccer players are grabbing most of the advertisement contracts,
traditionally won by baseball players. The video game generation is also put
off by the long baseball matches, which can stretch to over three hours.
'Even a rock concert lasts less than two hours,' complains Mr Keiya Sasaki,
director of Dentsu's sports business division. He blames the long and dull
matches on the baseball team managers' paternalistic control of the game.
Throughout every baseball match, coaches and managers on the bench twitch
their heads and wave their hands, signalling and instructing every move a
player on the field makes.
Mr Sasaki says the rigid control of teams and even over the players'
lifestyles is stifling their abilities and flair.
To liven up baseball, his company has advised the baseball association to
encourage a younger batch of players, to try to produce more stars and
increase freedom for the players inside and outside the baseball stadium.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Mitchell urges hard line on China's human rights: Senate
leader wants trade sanctions imposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senate Democratic leader Mr George Mitchell said yesterday he favoured
punishing China with trade sanctions unless it improves its human rights
record in the next two weeks, Reuter reports from Washington.
In remarks that could complicate a decision President Bill Clinton must make
by June 3, Mr Mitchell said he was drafting sanctions because he believed
China had not yet met US conditions for the renewal of Most Favoured Nation
trade status.
'There has been significant progress in some respects, not in others,' he
said on the NBC television programme Meet the Press. 'As of now, I don't
think that the terms of the executive order have been met. And therefore the
extension of the MFN status should be conditioned with some sanctions.'
In his executive order last June, Mr Clinton said he would revoke MFN this
year unless China made 'overall, significant progress' on seven human rights
issues, including freeing political prisoners, ending repression in Tibet
and easing emigration.
If Mr Clinton fully carried out his threat, China would be relegated to the
handful of nations whose exports to the US are ineligible for the low
tariffs MFN bestows.
US business groups, among others, fear Beijing would retaliate in kind,
restricting access to one of the world's fastest growing markets for
American goods.
Mr Mitchell said Chinese human-right policy had gone back and forth, and
that a decision on extending MFN would have to be made on 'the full record
on all seven issues' next month.
'I think it'll be a very close call,' he said.
He added that he had already begun drafting a measure to punish China for
any failure to meet the executive order's conditions. 'But it depends upon
what the decision is at the time and what sanctions are imposed,' he said.
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, appearing on the same programme, urged Mr
Clinton to eat crow, renew MFN and admit he had erred in tying it to human
rights.
'My view is that we have to continue to look at their human rights policies,
but we ought to separate the two,' he said.
'The president just ought to say 'Listen, maybe I went too far, I made a
mistake. Let's go ahead and extend Most Favoured Nation status for China and
we'll continue to work on human rights'.'
Being second-guessed on China in Congress by his own party would be a blow
to Mr Clinton. During the 1992 presidential campaign, Mr Clinton criticised
then-President George Bush for unwillingness to make trade conditional on
progress in the human rights field in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square
crackdown.
A classified inter-agency study of the impact of revoking MFN found that it
could cost each side as much as Dollars 10bn to Dollars 13bn (Pounds 6.7bn
to Pounds 8.7bn) if high US tariffs went into effect across the board.
A senior administration official, who discussed the study on condition he
not be identified by name, said: 'We are trying like hell to get movement
(from the Chinese on human rights) so that in the end we don't have to do
this.'
'We assume the cost would be extremely high,' the official added.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate's two highest-ranking lawmakers, responding to North Korea's
latest apparent disregard of international nuclear conventions, yesterday
said they backed the imposition of economic sanctions on the Pyongyang
government, AP adds from Washington.
'I believe that we cannot tolerate the actions that are occurring without
any response at all,' said Senate majority leader Mr George Mitchell. He
called economic sanctions 'the most prudent and likely effective response at
the current time.'
'We've been in this cat-and-mouse game with North Korea now for about the
last 15 months,' said Senate minority leader Mr Bob Dole, of the opposition
Republicans, who appeared with Mr Mitchell on NBC's Meet the Press.
He said he still hoped the issue of North Korean stonewalling over its
reported nuclear weapons program could be resolved. 'But failing that, I
think sanctions should be imposed.'
Both Mr Mitchell and Mr Dole ruled out any immediate pre-emptive military
strike on North Korea. But Mitchell said economic sanctions should be pushed
despite North Korean threats and even if China, one of North Korea's few
allies, objected.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Split proposed for Russian state electricity company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAO, the Russian state-controlled electricity company, would be split up and
its power stations restructured into a series of competing companies under
proposals being considered by the Russian government.
KPMG Management Consulting of the UK, which drew up the proposals as part of
a European Union-sponsored study, acknowledges that the system would lead to
price rises for consumers. This is in part because it would enable subsidies
to be eliminated.
However, the proposed structure would help reduce costs and stimulate
investment needed as power demand increases later in the decade, it says. It
could also provide a framework for the industry's full privatisation,
although KPMG believes that is not essential.
So far about 20 per cent of RAO's shares have been offered to workers and
private individuals.
The country's 72 local distribution companies, or energos, which also
generate some power themselves, have been established as joint stock
companies with some shares distributed to the private sector. However, RAO
still owns majority stakes in most of them. As well as its stakes in the
energos, RAO also runs the country's largest power stations and the despatch
system which selects which of them operate.
KPMG's system, which draws heavily on the UK electricity industry structure,
says RAO's large power stations should be formed into independent generating
companies.
In a draft report, KPMG suggests a system in which each generating company
would bid in production offers daily. High-priced generators would not be
chosen to operate if demand did not require it.
The energos, which operate smaller generation plants, would be required to
sell all of their energy, including their own needs, into the despatch
market and buy back their requirements from it.
Energos would also be required to maintain separate accounting records for
generation, distribution and other activities. This would prevent
cross-subsidisation.
Most of the changes are similar to reforms being proposed in the European
Union.
The report says transitional arrangements would be needed during the
implementation of the system over several years. The market should continue
to be regulated at both a federal and regional level, it says.

FT  16 MAY 94 / French in Chinese cement deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group, yesterday announced
that it is to set up a joint venture cement manufacturing company in China
as part of its strategy of expansion in rapidly growing markets.
The joint venture company, to be called Beijing Chinefarge Cement will be
situated about 50km to the north of the Chinese capital, and will be based
on an existing production facility with a capacity of 700 tonnes per day.
Lafarge Coppee said that production would gradually be expanded to take
advantage of the growing demand for cement in the Peking area.
The French group said that the consumption of cement in Peking totals about
6m tonnes per year and is growing at an annual rate of about 10 per cent
because of infrastruc-ture and public works projects.
Lafarge Coppee, said it would have majority control of the joint venture and
would be in charge of industrial operations. It said it had signed an
agreement to establish the company with the Peking city authorities, but
declined to disclose the size of the investment.
Other members of the joint venture are Beijing Huaibei Mine Cement
Industrial Company, the State Raw Materials Investment Corporation and
Citicorp International.

Monday: The recovery in the UK and the US will be a focus of attention. In
the UK, April's producer prices index today, and the Confederation of
British Industry's distributive trade survey tomorrow, will provide clues
about the strength of the upturn - and its impact on inflation. Market
analysts expect April's output figures to rise to 0.3 per cent, month on
month, from 0.1 per cent in February. Input prices, however, are expected to
fall. In the US, April's industrial production figures will be scrutinised
for clues about the pace of recovery.
Wednesday: UK earnings figures are expected to illustrate the Bank of
England's concern about the growth in average earnings. The growth rate for
March is expected to be unchanged, at 3.5 per cent, after rising
continuously since November. However, the three-month index, measured year
on year, is expected to rise slightly to 2 per cent. In the US, the March
trade deficit will be scrutinised by the foreign exchanges in the light of
the dollar's recent weakness.
Thursday: The report from the UK Treasury's panel of advisers - the 'six
wise men' - is published.

EU ponders Russia policy
European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels to decide whether to give
the go-ahead to a political and trade accord with Russia. Doubts remain over
the latest Russian offer to open up the banking sector, and how to deal with
export of Russian nuclear fuels. But ministers hope to have an agreement
ready to sign at the European summit in Corfu next month.
Ministers will also discuss latest diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in
Bosnia, and are expected to approve a Ecu32m (Dollars 36m) plan for the EU
to take over the administration of the Bosnian town of Mostar. Separately,
the Council will consider a European Commission proposal to send Ecu100m of
food aid to Ukraine, as part of a broader strategy to Russia's neighbour.
Dominican poll: Election day in the Dominican Republic sees President Joaqun
Balaguer, 87, seeking his seventh term at the head of the Caribbean nation.
But it will be a close-run thing since he is trailing in the polls to Mr
Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary
Party. The last time Mr Balaguer won, in May 1990, his main opponent charged
him with fraud.
Ecofin: European Union finance and economy ministers, meeting in Brussels,
will review the economies of
member states and discuss the Commission's white paper on growth,
competitiveness and jobs. Financial assistance to eastern Europe and the
former Soviet republics is also on the agenda, and the ministers will turn
their attention to the Union's anti-fraud strategy.
Japan's taxpayers: A list of the 100 highest taxpayers in Japan is to be
released. The tax list, prepared by the national tax office, is a mixture of
honest and less honest millionaires. It is also an interesting economic
indicator. Last year, for example, the survey showed a decline to 125,000
people paying more than Y10m in tax, down from 175,000 in the previous
survey.
Top of last year's taxpayer league was Hiromasa Ezoe, former president of
Recruit, the employment agency, on trial over the 1988-1989 Recruit shares
for favours scandal. He paid Y3.96bn in tax in 1992.
Platinum survey: Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing
group, publishes its highly regarded annual survey of the world platinum
market. It is likely to make depressing reading for the producers by
suggesting the market remains in surplus and that, unless there is
market-disturbing news from either of the two biggest producers - South
Africa and Russia - prices will remain relatively low.
Holidays: Israel (Shavuot), Saudi Arabia (Eid al-Adha), Venezuela.
TUESDAY 17
US rates likely to rise
Many economists expect the US Federal Reserve to announce another rise in
short-term interest rates following today's meeting of the policy-making
open market committee. A quarter- or half-point increase in the federal
funds rate to 4 per cent or 4.25 per cent is widely seen as necessary to
bolster the dollar and slow the pace of domestic growth.
If the Fed wants to send a strong signal it will also 'ring the gong' -
raise the discount rate, at which it lends to banks. So far the discount
rate has stayed unchanged at 3 per cent despite three increases to 3.75 per
cent in the Fed funds rate.
Malawi goes to the polls:
Presidential and parliamentary elections will give voters a choice of
candidates for the first time since 1964. The multi-party elections follow
last year's referendum in which Malawians rejected President Hastings Kamuzu
Banda's one-party state. Mr Banda (above), who has ruled since independence,
is standing for re-election despite his advancing years.
Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, will report its fourth consecutive
year of losses. Forecasters agree the loss will be about Pounds 2.5bn,
compared with Pounds 2.9bn in 1990 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1989. The market,
which reports its results three years in arrears, will soften the blow on
Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the market, by stripping
out the so-called 'double count'. This occurs when claims produce losses for
the syndicate underwriting an original policy, as well as for those
underwriting errors and omissions, stop-loss or estate protection insurance.
Names will also be allowed to borrow against part of the profits expected
for the current year. Trading conditions at Lloyd's have improved over the
past two years, with steep rises in insurance rates in some sectors.
Bulgaria's largest trade union bloc has called a general strike to push for
higher wages for state sector employees. Prices have risen sharply this year
because of the introduction of VAT and the sharp devaluation of the Lev.
The strike will keep up pressure on the government of Lyuben Berov, a
non-partisan economist, which is facing its sixth vote of no confidence
since taking office in December 1992.
FT Survey: World Forest Products and Power Generation Equipment.
Holidays: Norway (Independence Day), Saudi Arabia (Eid al-Adha).
WEDNESDAY 18
Derivatives report appears
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the US Congress,
publishes a study of financial derivatives, such as options and interest
rate swaps. The study was prompted by a nightmare scenario of a collapsing
world financial system, as overexposed institutions were forced to default
on their obligations. The report is expected to propose increased regulation
of the multi-billion dollar business, both of those issuing and trading
these financial instruments and the companies that use them. The industry,
and some policy makers, are against hasty legislation, arguing that existing
procedures are working well.
Israel is due to complete its military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza
Strip, placing 850,000 Palestinians under PLO control.
Bulgaria's debt: Deutsche Bank and 300 other London Club banks have until
today to indicate their terms to the banking committee handling the
rescheduling of Bulgaria's USDollars 9.3bn foreign commercial debt. The two
sides, which agreed to reduce the debt by about 50 per cent last November,
have set a June 30 deadline for completion of the rescheduling deal.
Bulgaria, which unilaterally defaulted on its foreign debt in 1990, is the
last of central Europe's former communist states to reschedule its foreign
commercial debt.
UK economy: April's retail price index will be scrutinised for any sign that
inflation may be gathering pace, after the Bank of England's warning last
week about inflationary pressures. The market expects the figures to show
monthly inflation to have risen to 1.3 per cent, up from 0.3 per cent the
previous month, largely as a result of rising council tax bills and the
introduction of VAT on fuel.
Saleroom: This week both Sotheby's and Christie's sell expensive jewels and
works of art in Geneva. The auctions reach a climax this evening with
Sotheby's sale of 125 items of jewellery from the collection of the late
Helene Beaumont, who, with her American husband Louis, helped make the Cote
d'Azur the magnet of the smart set in inter-war Europe.
The Jonker No. 2 diamond of more than 40 carats, cut by jeweller Harry
Winston from the rough 726 carat Jonker diamond, and set in a ring, should
make the top price of more than Dollars 2m.

THURSDAY 19
Lome under review
Ministers from the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) group meet in Swaziland to review the Lome Convention, which expires
at the end of the decade. There is tacit agreement on both sides that, with
the deregulation of international trade and changes in the patterns of
private investment flows and official aid, the trade and aid treaty, in its
present form, will be the last of its kind.
ACP officials admit that it will not be easy for many of their economies to
disengage from Lome, with its guaranteed markets for commodity exports and
development finance. The EU, on its side, wants to move away from a system
based on old colonial ties to a more rational foundation for its trade
arrangements.
UK economy: Retail sales figures for April are expected to show that the
rate of consumer spending has slowed slightly, following recent downbeat
evidence from big retailers and the Confederation of British Industry's
distributive trades survey.
Month on month, sales are expected to show no growth, after a 0.8 per cent
rise in March. But with some economists predicting there could even be a
fall of 0.5 per cent in retail spending, the result seems set to provoke
further debate about how far April's tax rises have dented consumer
confidence.
Rao meets Clinton:
PV Narasimha Rao (left), the Indian prime minister who is this week on a
six-day visit to the US, is due to meet President Clinton today. The two
leaders' discussions are expected to include improving bilateral trade and
investment, nuclear non-proliferation and the tensions between India and
Pakistan.
Frisson of interest: The UK Building Societies Association begins its annual
conference in Birmingham, central England. The recent Pounds 1.8bn bid by
Lloyds Bank for Cheltenham and Gloucester building society, the announcement
of a merger between two societies in the north-east of England, and the
statements by several banks that they are interested in buying societies
should all serve to enliven the atmosphere.
Informal plotting and intrigue aside, the formal events include a speech by
Rosalind Gilmore, head of the sector's statutory regulator.
FT Survey: World Taxation.
Holidays: Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (Eid

FRIDAY 20
Japan's budget expires
The 1994 provisional budget expires, necessitating fresh provisional
financing, pending agreement on a full budget. This has been delayed by
obstructionism from the opposition, Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation as prime
minister, and the fragmentation of the ruling coalition.
John Smith: The funeral of the Labour party leader, who died suddenly of a
heart attack last week, takes place at Cluny Parish Church, Edinburgh.
Labour has called for campaigning for June 9's European Parliament elections
to be put off until after the funeral. Despite losing its leader, Labour
looks set to make big gains, after which it will begin the process of
selecting a successor.
Nobel lectures: FW De Klerk, former president of South Africa and now joint
deputy vice-president, winner of the Nobel peace prize along with Nelson
Mandela, gives one of a series of lectures by last year's laureates at
London's Royal Albert Hall.
Exit Florence: The UK Pounds 10 note featuring Florence Nightingale ceases
to be legal tender after today.
WEEKEND 21-22
Tougher embargo on Haiti
Unless Saturday's deadline for Haiti's military rulers to step down is met,
the United Nations is due to impose further and tougher sanctions. The
regime ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a coup in 1991 and last
week installed 81-year old Emile Jonassaint as president.
US president Bill Clinton has said military intervention remains 'an
option'. His administration says it would prefer any action to be
multinational and take place under a mandate from the UN.
Prague's spring arts festival begins on Saturday.
Yachting: The Whitbread Round the World fleet of yachts leaves Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, on Saturday for the last 3,818 mile leg of the race.
The race should arrive at Southampton, southern England, on June 6 or 7.
Football: The Scottish Cup final is played in Glasgow between Rangers and
Dundee United on Saturday.
Cycling: The Giro Italia tour of Italy begins on Sunday and is scheduled to

FT  16 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Bond market stability the key to growth -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock-market analysts are sounding increasingly frustrated as they watch the
FT-SE 100 Share Index sitting on the 3,100 fence, unable to disentangle
itself from the bond markets but unwilling to give any further ground.
Most still take a bullish view on the market, but few can make a case for
any dramatic move in the near term. S. G. Warburg bases its case on a shift
of interest towards earnings estimates for 1996, admitting that 'a dull
summer' may, meanwhile, be in prospect.
There is considerable institutional support whenever the Footsie Index dips
into the 3,100 area, mostly showing itself in the stock index futures
market. But the stock market remains unable to decouple from the bond
markets.
Kleinwort Benson points out that, with equities yielding a prospective 4.2
per cent, cash ought to be burning in fund managers' pockets. 'Bond market
stability would release it into the equity market,' it adds.
This week may bring some movement on this front. It was clear on Thursday,
when London had the European field to itself, that UK bonds are still moving
in step with US Treasuries and waiting for the Federal Reserve to tighten
policy again.
However, some analysts argue that more determined action from the Fed would
stabilise bond markets, and give UK equities the environment they need to
respond more strongly to the improvement in economic and corporate news.
Unfortunately, developments on Friday afternoon suggested that the UK
markets now reckon the Fed may not act as strongly as they once feared.
Setting aside the overall economic background, there are signs that
attitudes towards some sectors are changing. BZW believes pricing
sensitivity may be beginning to present a challenge to the bull run in
manufacturing stocks. Its answer to this is to recommend focusing on
manufacturers displaying superior pricing power and with exposure to Europe,
a favourite BZW theme.
The UK engineering and vehicles sector offers the highest (40 per cent)
exposure to Europe on the manufacturing sector, according to BZW. Close
behind is the printing and packaging sector, with 36 per cent exposure, and
building materials and merchants, with 31 per cent.
The same argument is applied by BZW to close its bearish stance on the
domestic consumer service sectors. Pressures on pricing and profit margins
have depressed these sectors, particularly food. But Sainsbury sounded more
positive on gross margins last week, and BZW links its own more favourable
views on sector margins to its faith in European exposure.
On the consumer and services side, European exposure is less marked. Brewing
has only a 4 per cent exposure, although the addition of spirits, wine and
cider interests takes that figure to around 23 per cent. Pharmaceuticals
have 27 per cent exposure but these stocks have yet to recapture investor
confidence.

STOCKHOLM
Astra's first-quarter figures come out tomorrow. Analysts are looking for
sales of SKr6bn, a rise of some 20 per cent, with sales of Losec up 30 per
cent to almost SKr2bn, and Pulmicort sales up 35 per cent to SKr870m. Hoare
Govett says pre-tax profit in the first quarter of 1993 was very positively
affected by a large translational benefit. 'Consequently, although operating
profit is expected to increase by more than 35 per cent, on a comparable
basis, pre-tax profit is only expected to increase by 15 per cent to SKr2bn.
For all 1994, sales are expected to reach SKr27.2bn, with pre-tax profit of
SKr9.45bn and earnings per share of SKr11.4.'
MADRID
Telefonica's first-quarter figures are due out today. UBS global research
says that while quarter-on-quarter results are particularly difficult to
forecast, they expect a 4.7 per cent rise to Pta14.7bn in net income for the
parent company. 'A better measure of performance may be cash earnings: we
are forecasting first-quarter cash earnings of Pta118.7bn, up 9.2 per cent.'
AMSTERDAM
KNP BT, the paper and graphic supplies group, announces first-quarter
results on Wednesday. The group has already reported at its recent annual
meeting net profits of around Fl 50m, compared with a loss in the same
period last year. Hoare Govett notes that the recovery is broadly based,
'with all divisions showing better results. Demand volumes, as well as
prices for paper and packaging products, have recovered from low 1993 levels
and sales volumes in the trading divisions (paper merchanting/office
products and graphic information systems) are also expected to show
improvements this year. Restructuring programmes will improve results in all
divisions. Our current earnings per estimates are: 1994, Fl 1.60 and 1993,
Fl 4.20.'
TOKYO
Share fluctuations this week will be affected by the currency movements and
the strength on US stock and bond markets. Hopes of a US credit tightening
helped the dollar against the yen last week, and further stabilisation of
the currency markets, which will largely depend on US interest rates, is
expected to encourage investors. Meanwhile, many investors are likely to
remain inactive due to the spate of corporate results, which may cause some
volatility.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Inflation alarm bell likely to stop ringing
 -New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent weeks, long-term US interest rates have been climbing rapidly amid
growing concerns about resurgent inflation - concerns which have spread to
the stock market, where prices have struggled to make any headway in spite
of mostly bullish news on the economy.
This week, the stock market will be able to judge for itself whether
inflation is on the rise again, and some good news should allow stocks to
shake off their inflation fears.
Tomorrow, the February producer prices index is released and a day later,
the consumer prices index is published. Although analysts expect the two
indices to show slightly stronger growth than in January (the brokerage
house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette forecasts that both the PPI and CPI rose
by 0.4 per cent last month), the inflation alarm bell is likely to stop
ringing.
If analysts' forecasts prove correct, the annual consumer inflation rate -
the most closely-watched of the two indicators - will measure close to 2.4
per cent. That is a full point below the comparable rate recorded at the
same stage of the year in 1993, a remarkable reduction considering the
economy has been growing at a significantly faster pace over the past two
months than in the same eight weeks a year ago.
A hint of how markets are likely to respond to favourable inflation reports
came last Friday, when after a poor start, shares rose steadily on the back
of declining bond yields. Stocks firmed partly because investors turned more
optimistic about this week's inflation data.
But even if the inflation picture brightens, political problems that have
unsettled investors in recent days are unlikely to fade especially quickly.
While most of Wall Street was in agreement by the end of last week that the
fuss the bond market, and later the stock market, made over the rumours
swirling around the Whitewater affair was overdone, the White House is
unlikely to emerge from under the clouds of the 'scandal' particularly soon.
As long as the perception holds that President Clinton is politically
hampered by the growing inquiry into Whitewater, and by press reports of a
possible cover-up, then it is of concern to investors.
Why is not easy to answer, but it is often said that if the President gets
into deeper trouble, so does his political agenda, which includes such
market-sensitive programmes as healthcare and welfare reform. If Mr
Clinton's position weakens because of the Whitewater affair, then the dollar
will probably also weaken. And a weaker dollar means imports are more
expensive, which puts up the rate of inflation.
Politics aside, the stock market's immediate future depends greatly on what
happens to long-term interest rates. While the 30-year yield may edge a bit
higher, bond investors may soon realise that the correction in the Treasury
market has gone far enough. This would give the stock market some
much-needed breathing room, and allow investors to digest the events of the
past few weeks in a more considered fashion.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Debate over need for European clearing
system - Risk and Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The official opening of the Channel Tunnel earlier this month has finally
linked the UK with the rest of Europe. Although much slower and far more
expensive to build than most people had ever imagined, this engineering feat
shows that the hurdles which stand in the way of European integration can be
overcome.
So it seems absurd that in the fast-growing and high-tech world of
derivatives, there are no links between Europe's futures and options
exchanges, even though an electronic trading and clearing system could be
set up at a fraction of the cost and the time needed to complete the Channel
Tunnel.
At the moment, institutions which deal on Liffe in London, the Matif in
Paris, the DTB in Frankfurt and the other exchanges from Spain to Austria
have to put up margins and pay membership and dealing costs at each
exchange.
This is an inefficient use of capital, since their risk profile is often
lower than the margin they have put up because a position on one exchange
might be offset by another elsewhere. 'The consolidation of the clearing
mechanism would be beneficial to users,' says Mr Graham Newall, chief
executive of BZW Futures.
The DTB and the Matif are in the process of linking their trading systems.
By October, Matif members will be given direct access to selected DTB
products through the installation of screens in France. The next stage would
involve listing two Matif products on the DTB. This alliance aims to make
the two exchanges more international, increase liquidity and reduce costs.
However, the link will be limited to trading since issues such as
jurisdiction and currency risk hinder the linking of the two clearing
systems. Mr Willi Brandt, spokesman for the DTB, says the DTB products will
be cleared through a DTB clearing member and the Matif products through a
Matif clearing member.
According to Mr Gilbert Durieux, chief operating officer at the Matif, the
final aim is to have a centralised clearing system which he says would be
easy to design. 'Having said that, we are not in the US but in the European
Union, which means there is no single currency and no single central bank,'
he says.
As a result, the formation of a centralised clearing system is being
hampered by important legal questions such as who would be the lender of the
last resort.
Even proposals such as 'mutual offset' between the two exchanges (whereby
members would be able to offset their positions in contracts with similar
maturities) would run contrary to the principle of a clearing system, which
requires it to be balanced at the end of each trading day.
Mr Durieux adds that it is by no means certain that exchange members want a
centralised clearing system, since this could eat into income they derive
from providing clearing services to their customers.
In the near term, the DTB and the Matif hope that the co-operation will
attract business away from Liffe, where the lion's share of trading in bund
futures and options takes place. By contrast, Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's
chief executive, does not feel the need to forge any strategic alliances.
'We are essentially an international exchange whereas the DTB and the Matif
are domestic exchanges,' he says.
Liffe may be riding high at the moment - on 12 days in the last quarter it
exchanged more contracts than any other exchange in the world. But observers
say if it does not look after its non-sterling products, Liffe could see
business drift away. 'The DTB and Matif could really take Liffe on if they
are clever about clearing,' says one banker.

<TEXT>
A flood of economic statistics and comment this week will keep the gilts
market on its toes. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at HSBC Greenwell,
says: 'Gilts could end the week three points up or three points down',
depending on Wednesday's news of retail price inflation in April and average
earnings in March.
A jump in average earnings growth to 3.75 per cent in the year to March from
February's 3.5 per cent would be 'dreadful', he says. A rise in April's
retail price inflation, minus mortgage interest payments, to above 2.5 per
cent from 2.4 per cent would be 'disappointing'.
According to Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, the
background for gilts looks more favourable than for some time. Last week's
UK trade figures reduced fears of a trade-induced sterling crisis and he
expects less talk of leadership struggles in the Conservative party
following last week's tragic death of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader.
Recent US news may also foster calmer conditions on global bond markets.
The Bank of England contributed to the better tone with Friday's
announcement of its first convertible gilt since 1987. Details are due
tomorrow. The Bank's apparent determination to resist a cut in base rates
has also boosted hopes of steady and sustainable economic recovery.

FT  16 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Bundesbank takes a bet on its
credibility - Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Wednesday's generous cuts in the German discount and Lombard short-term
interest rates came after a long period in which rates had been allowed to
fall only in a sequence of teasingly small steps.
'Prima]' ('Great]') was how Mr Norbert Walter of the Deutsche Bank greeted
last week's cuts, which took the discount rate to 4.5 per cent and the
Lombard rate to 6 per cent. Mr Martin Hufner of the Bayerische Vereinsbank
said the German central bank was taking full advantage of an ideal
combination of circumstances.
The move was readily comprehensible against a favourable background of
falling inflation (inflation is set to drop below 3 per cent early in the
second half of the year) and a weak dollar. Many economists saw the move as
a natural extension of the Bundesbank's intervention to support the US
currency in the previous week.
For once, then, a cut was supported by both international and domestic
policy considerations - a pleasant change, economists observed, from the
state of affairs over recent years, when domestic policy considerations have
run contrary to the wishes of other countries.
The interest rate cuts, which many expect to be the last before the
Bundesbank policy-making council's summer break in 10 weeks, were not
without elements of surprise and controversy.
The timing was unexpected - the consensus had been that the central bank
would not move until its meeting in two weeks, when it would have had more
data on inflation and money supply to support further easing.
More importantly, the reasoning behind the move was unusual, not to say
revolutionary for the Bundesbank. The central bank said it was justified in
the light of the improving outlook for inflation in Germany - so far, so
conventional - but also that it would help dissolve the 'monetary blockage'
which led to the explosion in money supply growth in the early months of
this year.
The statement that a reduction in interest rates will contribute to a
reduction in money supply growth stands the Bundesbank's standard
argumentation on its head: it has previously maintained that interest rates
have to be kept high to prevent growth in M3, the broad measure of money
supply on which the Bundesbank relies as a leading indicator for the
development of future inflation.
The Bundesbank justifies this volte-face in reasoning by saying that under
current circumstances a substantial reduction in interest rates will
encourage investors to shift money out of short-term deposits into
longer-term investment vehicles, such as bunds, which fall outside the
definition of money.
The central bank believes this will reverse the flows of money which have
led the explosion of M3 growth - M3 was up by a seasonally adjusted,
annualised 15.4 per cent in March compared with the 4 to 6 per cent target
range for 1994 - and cause the formation of capital instead.
This claim is highly controversial and many economists believe the central
bank is taking big risks.
'The Bundesbank is taking a major gamble on its credibility,' said Mr Adolf
Rosenstock of the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt. 'A big bet on M3
slowdown', is how Mr Kermit Schoenholtz at Salomon Brothers International in
London put it.
The risk is that M3 does not behave as the Bundesbank wants it to. 'Then in
a few months time, the Bundesbank will face an awful dilemma,' observed Mr
Joachim Fels at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. 'It will realise the policy has
failed and it will either have to abandon M3 altogether, or it will have to
start raising rates to bring money supply back under control.'
The danger that investors will continue to park their liquid assets at the
short end of the yield curve is real. Bund yields, up more than a full
percentage point from a low of 5.58 per cent in early January this year,
failed to respond substantially last week.
'The current yield of 6.6 per cent is not sufficient to compensate investors
for the risk of holding long-term assets,' said Mr Fels. 'Given the
volatility in the bund market over recent months, the Bundesbank can't
expect to shock investors out of short deposits - the uncertainty factor is
too high.'
The pessimism is underscored by a shift in market expectations about
interest rates. Futures markets now expect short-term rates to bottom out in
September, rather than at the end of the year, and at a higher level than
had been expected only months ago.
This reflects worries about the chances of a recovery in the German economy,
stimulated by a crop of recent data suggesting that the economy will avoid a
'double-dip' recession. The more buoyant the economy, the more likely it is
that the Bundesbank will start raising interest rates again.
Ironically, the lower rates introduced last week will stimulate the economy
and make the Bundesbank's task trickier later in the year.

A fall in short-term interest rates to record lows and increased buying
interest from institutional investors are expected to support Japanese bond
prices this week.
Since the instability of US financial markets, caused by fears of rising US
inflation, have also unnerved Japanese bond investors, they will be focusing
on the US Federal Open Market Committee meeting and the Federal Reserve
Board's stance on interest rates.
While the fluctuations of the currency markets and the US bond market
continue to affect investor sentiment, Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo
expects domestic institutional interest in short- and medium-term bonds to
support the new issue market for four- and six-year government notes and
bank debentures.
Market volume is a benchmark for the recovery in confidence towards the bond
market. A rise in trading volume for the 10-year benchmark bond on the
broker-broker market to above Y200m a day - a level not seen on a sustained
basis since early March - will signal a return of investors, says BZW.
Meanwhile, the spate of corporate earnings announcements this week is
expected to confirm the fragile state of the economy, and the deflationary
effect of the yen's strength on profits of export-oriented companies.

A combination of domestic and international factors will determine the
course of the bund market during the next few days.
On the international front, any move by the US Federal Reserve to raise US
interest rates will have a knock-on effect on the German market.
Paradoxically, the sharper the expected increase in US rates, the better the
immediate outlook for government securities in Germany - a decisive move
from the Fed may eliminate the uncertainty which has induced the German
market to follow the US downwards this year.
On the domestic front, the focus will be on this week's 'repo' tender
operations. Traders will be concerned to see how willing the Bundesbank is
to follow the generous, half-percentage point reductions in the discount and
Lombard rates last week with a substantial cut in money market rates.
Later in the week, the Bundesbank may release data on M3 money supply growth
for April. It is too early for last week's interest rate moves to have had
any effect, but the data will be studied closely for signs that the
'exceptional factors' which have bloated M3 growth this year are beginning
to recede. The consensus is for seasonally adjusted, annualised growth of 14
per cent or less, after more than 15 per cent in the previous month.

All eyes in the US fixed-income market will be on the Federal Reserve and
the meeting of its Open Market Committee tomorrow, which is expected further
to tighten monetary policy.
Wall Street is expecting an increase of 50 basis points in the discount
rate, taking it from 3 to 3.5 per cent, and an increase of either 25 or 50
basis points in the Fed funds rate, taking it to 4 or 4.25 per cent.
Positive inflation statistics late last week increased the possibility of a
25-point increase. The Labor Department reported on Friday that consumer
prices rose just 0.1 per cent in April. This gave some support to the
market, with the yield on the 30-year benchmark issue ending the day at 7.49
per cent, down from 7.56 on Thursday.
However, the Fed will be looking for signs of inflation months down the
road, and in weighing its decision will have the advantage of April's
industrial production statistics, due this morning. Output has risen for 10
months in succession and March saw a strong 0.5 per cent increase. The
median forecast for April is a rise of 0.3 per cent.
Other figures which may affect the market include April housing starts, due
on Tuesday and expected to show an annual rate of 1.45m; and the trade
balance, out on Thursday, which is expected to narrow to Dollars 8.3bn in
March from Dollars 9.7bn in February.

FT  16 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Dutch win back state debt trade -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is claiming a victory on its home turf. After
years of witnessing the steady seepage of trading business in Dutch
government bonds to London, the Amsterdam exchange now claims the tide is
turning and that the proportion of trading in Dutch state debt conducted
overseas is gradually declining, due to the introduction of a new
inter-dealer-broker (IDB) system in Amsterdam.
The Dutch central bank, which has been monitoring the relative level of
trading of Dutch government bonds both in Amsterdam and in London, announced
earlier this month that the proportion of business carried out in London has
fallen from 50 per cent during 1992, to around 30 per cent this year.
London had seen as much as 60 per cent of the trading activity in Dutch
government bonds back in 1989, and the Amsterdam exchange was clearly
concerned about the flow of business overseas. In its efforts to claw back
trading volume, it asked McKinsey &amp; Co to study the problem and make
recommendations as to how the exchange should develop in order to become
more competitive.
McKinsey made its report in late 1992 and noted that the competitive
position of the Amsterdam stock exchange in both equities and bonds had
deteriorated in the late 1980s, adding 'quantitative comparisons and
interviews point to three major causes for the recorded loss of market
share.
'First, foreign investor trading in Dutch securities has grown strongly.
Second, competition from foreign intermediaries has increased. And third,
the performance of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange has lagged behind that of
London's securities market.'
Foreigners have been keen investors in Dutch government paper in recent
years for several reasons.
The Dutch currency is very tightly pegged to the D-Mark, and Dutch monetary
policy has followed that of the Bundesbank very closely.
Furthermore, the Dutch inflation picture was far less of a worry than in
Germany, so when 'convergence' was the buzzword of the European government
bond markets, investors simply regarded Dutch government bonds as 'bund
surrogates' with the result that Dutch yields have tended to trade very
close to, or even lower than those on German bonds.
The Agency of the Ministry of Finance, which sells new issues of Dutch
government paper, has steadily tried to increase the appeal of Dutch bonds
to international investors.
Mr Henk Bevers, the agent, stresses that the key change has been to improve
the liquidity of the individual bond issues.
'Foreign investors said that liquidity was very important, so we have been
trying to boost that,' he says, adding that while the Agency of the Ministry
of Finance used to hold about 10 tap issues a year of around Fl 2bn to Fl
3bn each, 'now we have four or five issues a year but of greater size'.
The Agency has also opted for a wider array of maturities - issuing a
30-year stock at the end of 1992 which had considerable appeal for both
domestic and international institutional investors. Such long-dated issues
are a common in the French and US bond markets.
'The market was very appreciative when we did our 30-year issue,' said Mr
Bevers. The decision by the Dutch to launch a 30-year bond may well have
provided some of the inspiration for Germany, which followed with its own
30-year bund a few months later.
However, while ownership of Dutch bonds by foreigners steadily increased
from 19 per cent in 1988 to 24 per cent in 1993, the Dutch authorities were
far less thrilled at the clear signs of trading activity disappearing to
London.
To counter this flow of business, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange encouraged
the establishment of an inter-dealer-broker in Amsterdam last year, whereby
banks and brokers could inform the IDB of their bid and offer prices. The
IDB then advertises the prices on its screen system while ensuring the
anonymity of the prospective buyers and sellers.
In October last year, foreign broking houses which did not have offices in
Amsterdam were invited to take up 'special membership' of the Amsterdam
Treasury bond market so that they could buy and sell via the IDB without
having to set up offices in Amsterdam.
Already, the Dutch authorities are claiming the structural changes have
proved a success as trading activity is gradually enticed back to their home
territory.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Devaluation raises questions about Mexico
 -The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A poor first quarter performance by large Mexican companies, caused
primarily by an 8.6 per cent devaluation of the peso, has foreign investors
re-evaluating the creditworthiness of the country's private sector.
It has also prompted borrowers to search for new hedging instruments in case
of a further fall in the currency's value.
Over the past couple of years, Mexican companies have borrowed some Dollars
20bn to take advantage of dollar interest rates being well below those in
pesos.
In the first quarter of 1994 they paid for it. Exchange rate losses on this
debt, reflecting the increased cost of repayment, approached Dollars 1bn.
Telmex, Cemex, Aeromexico and other companies were forced to take charges
against earnings of Dollars 100m or more.
Companies suffered such large losses because they were not active in
Mexico's meagre foreign exchange coverage market, where rates are expensive
and contracts short.
One solution would be for the Banco de Mexico, the central bank, to offer
the instruments necessary for the development of a futures market for the
peso, allowing companies to hedge their dollar debt with a minimum of fuss.
However a return of the peso to the futures market would require the central
bank to issue long-term fixed-rate government debt in pesos. At the moment
two-year variable-rate notes are the longest the bank offers.
In addition, Mr Miguel Mancera, governor of Banco de Mexico, is said to
oppose a futures market for fear of losing control over the exchange rate to
speculators.
However, if the central bank does not move quickly, an offshore parallel
peso futures market may develop. For some time, a few companies have been
using the cheap dollars lent to them by foreigners for speculative rather
than investment purposes.
Some stop-gap hedging techniques are beginning to emerge. Tribasa, a
construction company, has over-collateralised the toll roads it has recently
securitised, placing between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of bond proceeds in
offshore dollar accounts, to be used in case of a devaluation.
Other companies, such as Grupo Carso, decided to convert a significant
portion of their dollar loans to peso debt when domestic rates fell below 9
per cent in February.
The arrival of foreign banks to the peso lending market, scheduled for this
summer, is also likely to bring new tools for corporate treasurers. One US
banker said that a recently approved trade line in dollars was turned down
by the soliciting company. 'Instead they want us to teach them how to hedge
their current dollar obligations.'
Potential investors and lenders say that they are beginning to change the
focus of their credit analysis of Mexican companies, with the size of
current dollar obligations together with potential foreign exchange earnings
becoming more important than overall debt-to-equity ratios.
'The price-driven market is probably over, with fundamental credit analysis
replacing spread over treasury as the defining criteria,' said Ms Rebecca
Miller of Bear Sterns. 'It's time to be sticking to the knitting.'
While companies argue that their capital assets, which increase in value
with each fall of the peso, are enough to guarantee their dollar loans,
foreign lenders are increasingly seeking to link new capital to actual
dollar income.
'We don't lend working capital,' said one US banker in explaining why his
bank was unlikely to suffer from the recent devaluation. 'Dollar loans must
equal dollar revenues. More than being scared by this first quarter, we
remember 1982.' Mexico's shortage of foreign exchange in 1982 presaged the
1980s debt crisis.
Even share offerings are being scrutinised for their ability to generate
non-peso revenue. Managers handling a recent Dollars 130m public offering of
Gruma, Mexico's largest tortilla maker, say that they were only able to get
the price they wanted after assuring investors that three-quarters of the
revenue would be destined for expansion projects outside Mexico.
There is little doubt that Mexican companies, paying local lending rates of
about 20 per cent, are still in the market for foreign debt, even in these
times of higher risk.
'We need dollars. It is the only way to compete,' said Enrique Flores of
Alfa, the steel and petrochemical conglomerate. He was undaunted by first
quarter exchange write down of more than Dollars 100m and an overall loss of
Dollars 61m.
'This quarter reminded us that we have to watch our proportion (of dollar
debt) and make sure we earn some dollars from each new capital investment.
But we are still in the market.'
Others, if they have sufficient cash in the bank, are likely to try to ride
out the instability, not forcing any new dollar issues until cost
estimations can be properly determined. For many, it may be the most wise
move until the exchange market volatility subsides.

Foreign exchanges will again focus on the dollar this week, with markets
anticipating a further tightening of US monetary policy.
The dollar has been fairly stable since central banks intervened to support
it earlier this month, but further stability presumes that the policy-making
Federal Open Markets Committee will lift interest rates when it meets
tomorrow.
The market is expecting a fairly aggressive tightening, with most observers
predicting that the Fed will lift the discount and federal funds rates by 50
basis points. Anything less is likely to lead to a renewed sell-off of the
dollar, and further weakness in the US bond market. The two have traded in
tandem recently.
Last week the dollar gained support from the Bundesbank's aggressive cut of
50 basis points in official interest rates. It also benefited from the Bank
of Japan easing monetary policy, by allowing overnight interest rates to
fall to their lowest level in 18 months.
A tightening from the Fed would represent the final stage in what appears to
have been a concerted sequence of monetary policy initiatives, aimed at
supporting the dollar, after the initial round of intervention.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said that
the cut in German rates last week appeared to have given the dollar a solid
base against the D-Mark. He said European investors also tended to believe
that the dollar would recover from current levels.
He is less optimistic, however, about its prospects against the yen.
Although US officials have recently been more emollient in their approach
towards Japan, Mr Hannah doubts whether this will persist if - as he
predicts - the Japanese government fails to deliver on market access
measures.
He said Japanese investors remained sceptical about the outlook for the
dollar. They have a history of poorly performing foreign investments, mostly
because of the strength of the yen. Mr Hannah said he could not foresee
large Japanese capital flows abroad again 'just because the dollar settles
down for a few days.'
In the UK a plethora of economic data, including inflation, unemployment and
retail sales, will be published. The six 'wise men', who offer advice to the
Chancellor on the economy, will deliver their quarterly report, and the
minutes of the April monetary policy meeting will be published.
The data are expected to confirm that the next move in UK rates will be up,
which should support sterling.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Pakistan fall blamed on a number of
factors

<TEXT>
Pakistani share prices had recovered some of the week's losses as the
Karachi stock exchange closed for the week on Thursday, writes Farhan
Bokhari in Islamabad.
But the temporary recovery did little to strengthen investors' confidence
after a week of spectacular falls.
The KSE-100 index gained 38 points to 2,227, still significantly less than
last Sunday's opening index of 2400.50.
Many analysts saw the falls as having been triggered by the law and order
situation in Karachi where recent politically motivated killings and public
demonstrations, have created fresh uncertainty.
Moreover, Pakistan's annual budget, due next month, is expected to include a
widening of the general sales tax to more than 100 new items.
In addition, a leading company on the market, Dewan Salman Fibres, has
suffered a setback after a recent Euroconvertible issue. At one point, the
bond was trading at 10 per cent below its face value. That has dampened
hopes for other companies considering similar plans.
Finally, many brokers argued that falls in share values at other Asian
markets had an effect. 'The overseas investors' buying momentum has really
slowed. There's a total lack of fresh buying coming in,' said Mr Mudassar
Malik, a director at BMA Capital Management.
However Mr Nasir Bukhari, chief executive of Khadim Ali Shah Bukhari, said:
'There had been a fabulous run-up which was due for correction.' Other
brokers share Mr Bukhari's assessment of the index, which had almost doubled
in the past 6 to 7 months.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN
Taiwan has abolished rules restricting foreign insurers from establishing
subsidiaries on the island, agencies report. The finance ministry said that
it had scrapped a rule restricting a foreign insurer from taking a stake of
no more than 30 per cent in a local insurance company. A ceiling of 49 per
cent on total investment by foreigners in a local insurer was also
abolished, the ministry said.
PORTUGAL
The country's bond market is to be reformed next month with a comprehensive
package of measures designed to increase liquidity, improve efficiency and
bring trading practices into line with other European capital markets. The
government has said that the measures will create a wide range of new
instruments.
VENEZUELA
The new tax on private sector debit transactions is not to be applied in
full force to the stock exchange. Instead, the 0.75 per cent tax, taking
effect later this month, will be applied just to the buyer's cheques.
However, Mr Tony Ewell of BZW in London noted that foreign investors would
be taxed another 0.75 per cent when they seek to repatriate their money.
MEXICO
The government has sold the final stake in Telefonos de Mexico, the
telephone utility, in a convertible offering worth up to Dollars 550m. This
concludes the privatisation of Telmex, the largest public company sold by a
developing country. The privatisation began at the end of 1990 when the
government sold a controlling 20.4 per cent stake for Dollars 1.76bn.
CHINA
China plans an increase in B share listings which are denominated in dollars
for foreign investors in an attempt to encourage its stock markets. Mr Liu
Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the
B-share market was too limited.

FT  16 MAY 94 / The Markets: Fed strives for right pitch - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global markets will take their lead this week from the US, where the Federal
Reserve seems certain to put up short-term interest rates at tomorrow's
meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee. The only question is how
much it will tighten, and how well or badly this will be received by Wall
Street.
Opinion is sharply divided as to whether the bank needs to raise the Fed
funds rate by 25 basis points, to 4 per cent, or 50 points. There is a
general presumption that it will couple a move on Fed funds with a 50 point
increase in the discount rate, which the Fed itself charges for loans. While
the discount rate is nowadays regarded by Wall Street as a largely symbolic
indicator of monetary policy, it still carries some weight internationally.
The Fed's gradualist approach - it has increased in 25 basis point
increments since it started tightening in February - suggests it will raise
Fed funds to 4 per cent, with another 25 point increment at or before the
FOMC's next meeting, in early July. Recent signs of greater moderation in
the rate of US economic growth could reinforce this stance. But investor
sentiment argues for a 50 basis point increase.
The bond market's volatile behaviour over the past two weeks suggests that
the Fed still has to convince Wall Street of its inflation-fighting
credentials, even though last week's excellent inflation statistics for
April underscored that rising prices are not yet a problem.
The Fed's three previous 25 point increases have merely served to leave the
market anticipating more, and Fed Funds at 4.25 per cent is already largely
factored in to short-term rates. A rise on Tuesday of just 25 basis points
could thus be bearish for bonds, the dollar and stocks.
A 50 point increase would be more likely to underpin current bond market
values and the dollar. Certainly, higher US rates are a necessary second
step to reinforce the recent round of central bank intervention to support
the currency. And a 50 point rise would neatly match last week's unexpected
cut in German rates, creating the impression that banks are co-ordinating
their interest rate structures as well as their foreign exchange market
operations.
But even this more aggressive stance may be insufficient to trigger a
sustained bounce back in bond and stock prices from the current correction.
The fragility of sentiment in recent weeks shows Wall Street is still
struggling to come to grips with the dimensions of the turn in the interest
rate cycle, with economic opinion sharply divided over the wisdom of Fed
policy: while a majority fears the bank is still too accommodating, a vocal
minority argues that it is in danger of choking off growth by fighting
yesterday's enemy, since improving productivity, and intense domestic and
international competition will keep inflation under control. A plethora of
economic statistics and historical analogies suggest long bond yields are
abnormally high, but in the current market such fundamentals are of limited
help, and it may take a further cathartic plunge in fixed income and equity
values before investor psychology turns.
France
Whatever the outcome, and rights or wrongs, of the current Anglo-French tiff
over aircraft landings at Orly airport, the publicity surrounding the affair
is unlikely to bolster France's image among US fund managers, who account
for such a large part of global investment flows.
The economy may be starting to recover, but since the French Government's
climbdown last October over a threatened strike at Air France, American
investors have questioned the willingness of Prime Minister Balladur to put
the competitive restructuring of French industry ahead of social goals.
The Orly row can only reinforce that concern. For example, Morgan Stanley
strategist Mr Richard Davidson recently went underweight on French equities
in his model portfolio, fearing that 'French Government policies are
reacting to political pressures rather than economic objectives.'
China/ Hong Kong
Weekend news that Beijing has freed the second of two dissident leaders of
the Tiananmen Square uprising increases the chances that the US Government
will renew China's Most Favoured Nation trade status. The Clinton
Administration is due to decide on the issue on June 3 and uncertainty over
the outcome could hang heavy over Hong Kong equities for the next few weeks.
The White House, which has tied renewal to significant Chinese progress on
human rights, seems unlikely to withdraw MFN status completely, since this
would provoke a crisis in bilateral relations, severely damage American
companies' opportunities in the burdgeoning Chinese market, and cause fresh
unease in global bond and currency markets over the president's execution of
foreign policy.
MFN revocation would hit Hong Kong hard. The China Analyst newsletter
reckons that the increased tariffs would price at least Dollars 20bn (Pounds
13.6bn) of Chinese exports out of the US market - nearly 63 per cent of its
exports to America - and that some 70 per cent of this trade goes through
Hong Kong.
An alternative being kicked around Congress, is a partial removal of MFN
status, imposing punitive tariffs on selected state-owned Chinese factories,
but keeping them off private sector products. This would be hard to enforce
and would still infuriate China.
The noises from both capitals have been more conciliatory in recent weeks,
but anything less than than full MFN renewal would have a depressing impact
on Hong Kong stocks. Renewal could spark a rally in the Hang Seng, yet an
overblown Hong Kong property market, tightening credit conditions in China,
and rising interest rates in the US (to which the colony's currency is
pegged), suggest that the relief would be overshadowed quickly by other
concerns. It still looks wise to be underweight here.
Sprint
Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telecommunications group, is
talking to Electronic Data Systems, the world's leading computing services
company and a subsidiary of General Motors, about a merger or alliance.
The discussions are the latest manifestation of the convergence of the
telecommunications and computer industries and a full takeover would create
a powerful new force, both in the US and internationally, in the multi-media
revolution.
A looser alliance may be the more likely outcome, given the cultural
problems of putting the two together and possible tax complications for GM
in a full disposal.
However it is structured, a deal could be very beneficial for both
companies. Sprint would get greater access to EDS's large business
customers, and EDS's computer expertise would be helpful in a nationwide
cellular telephone service which Sprint is trying to set up.
EDS, which runs its own global communications network, could substantially
cut the cost of its leasing lines, and become more centrally involved in
multi-media.
Sprint is one of the cheaper US telecom stocks, trading on a prospective p/e
of about 14.5. It seems never to have shaken off its lacklustre Wall Street
image of several years ago, when poor long-distance marketing led to a loss
of market share.
However, it is has now built up a strong brand name, thanks to an aggressive
advertising campaign, and its careful targetting of affluent individuals and
small business is winning back market share. Its local telephone business is
among the most efficient in the nation and its cellular operations are
enjoying particularly fast growth.
As the smallest of the three big long-distance companies, it is subject to
greater investor anxiety about eventual long-distance competition from the
Baby Bell companies, now barred from that market. But that is a good five to
10 years away, and Sprint is well on the way to establishing itself as as a
nationally branded telecommunications service. A non-dilutive EDS deal
should bolster the stock, as would a link with an international partner.

FT  16 MAY 94 / The Markets: Deficit criteria could prompt EU struggles -
Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been customary for policy-makers in the European Union to ignore or
minimise awkward issues and then be surprised when market or political
forces overwhelm their plans.
This happened in 1992 and 1993 when member governments so underestimated the
problems of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty and the impact of recession and
divergent monetary policies on the European Monetary System that the EU was
wracked by political and currency crises.
Things may now be changing. Partly because of those events, and partly
because the Maastricht Treaty includes tough rules against 'excessive
deficits', officials in the European Commission and EU finance ministries
and central banks are giving early thought to Europe's large fiscal
deficits.
Not only are the deficits a significant economic problem in their own right:
they are emerging as the biggest economic (as opposed to political or
technical) barrier to a move by member states to the third and final stage
of economic and monetary union by the end of the century. They also have the
potential for creating strains in the EU between anti-deficit hardliners,
such as the Bundesbank, and those who see political advantages in a flexible
approach to deficit reduction.
The latest Commission forecast, published last week, highlights the problem.
Under the Maastricht Treaty's convergence criteria, a country is supposed
not to become an Emu member if its fiscal deficit exceeds 3 per cent of
gross domestic product or its stock of government debt is more than 60 per
cent of GDP.
But, as the top chart shows, only three countries - Ireland, Luxembourg and
Germany - will meet the deficit rule by the middle of the decade. The lower
chart shows that a majority of EU members exceed the debt guideline, with
four countries having stocks of debt of more than 50 per cent above the
Maastricht limit, including Belgium and Italy, members of the original EEC.
At present, 11 of the 12 member states appear to be running 'excessive
deficits' as measured by the Maastricht criteria. Although Mr Henning
Christophersen, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, has
predicted that during 1997 a majority of present members should fulfil the
criteria , it is hard to imagine Belgium, Italy, Greece and Ireland ever
being able to meet the 60 per cent debt to GDP ratio. Relatively high real
interest rates and typically moderate EU growth rates offer no escape from
the debt trap.
No-one is shedding tears for Greece, the EU's economic delinquent. But the
political pressures to smooth the entry to Emu for Ireland, which meets all
other Maastricht requirements, and Italy and Belgium are mounting. They
could become especially powerful in Belgium's case if Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
the Belgian prime minister, succeeds Mr Jacques Delors as commission
president
The treaty makes provision for the deficit and debt criteria to be
disregarded in certain limited circumstances. The deficit guideline need not
apply if the ratio 'has declined substantially and continuously' towards 3
per cent or the excess is 'only exceptional and temporary.' In both cases
the ratio should be close to the guideline. The 60 per cent debt ratio can
be disregarded if the actual ratio 'is sufficiently diminishing and
approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.'
It is less well known that the commission has important discretionary powers
that could enable member states, which fail to meet the convergence criteria
regarding the deficits and debt, to be exempt from the excessive deficit
rule.
Under the complex procedure for defining and acting upon excessive deficits,
it is up to the council of economic and finance ministers to determine
whether a country has an 'excessive deficit' that would bar it from Emu.
But the council acts on a recommendation from the commission. According to
article 104c paragraph 5 it is for the commission to decide if a given
deficit is excessive and to address an 'opinion' about it to the council. If
the commission provided no opinion, the ministers would have no basis for
deciding whether the country was infringing the excessive deficit rules. The
applicant country's membership of Emu could not be blocked on these grounds.
These issues may seem arcane, especially if Emu turns out to be several
years away (and may never come in Britain's case). But the excessive deficit
procedure could be applied for the first time this year. Already some policy
makers are trying to ease the impact of the rules.
In Belgium's case there has been a suggestion that privatisation proceeds be
counted towards the deficit reduction effort, even though this is
technically not possible under the treaty, which measures deficits by the
European system of national accounts.
Earlier this year, Mr Christophersen touted the idea of liberal
interpretation of the deficit and debt criteria so that countries such as
Belgium would not be excluded from Emu. He told a Brussels seminar it had
'always been understood that the judgment on whether a member state fulfils
the conditions for participation in stage 3 would be based on an assessment,
and not on a mechanical application of the convergence criteria.'
Remarks such as these have prompted angry responses from members of the
Bundesbank central council, including Prof Reimut Jochimsen, the influential
head of the state central bank in North Rhine Westphalia. Such rumblings
could presage a greater storm.
The commission looks as if it could land between a rock and a hard place. If
it takes a hard line with the EU's debtors, and Belgium in particular, it
will only advertise how far the EU countries are from achieving Emu. If it
tries to bend the Maastricht criteria for political reasons, it risks
running foul of the Bundesbank, other EU central banks and the German
constitutional court.

Tabacalera, the partly-privatised Spanish tobacco monopoly, saw earnings
recover in the first quarter of the year after a sharp setback in 1993,
writes David White in Madrid.
Pre-tax profits were 17 per cent higher at just under Pta4bn (Dollars 29m).
Net sales reversed last year's trend to increase by 9 per cent to Pta140bn
in the three months.

FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: Alcatel tries to keep Turkish
unit afloat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcatel BV, a Belgian subsidiary of the French telecommunications group, is
negotiating a Dollars 150m loan to the Turkish government in an attempt to
keep its Turkish subsidiary afloat.
The loan would allow the PTT, the Turkish state telecoms company, to settle
its TL4,000bn (Dollars 120m) debts to Teletas, Alcatel's 65 per cent owned
subsidiary. Senior Belgian Alcatel executives were in Turkey on Friday
trying to win backing for the scheme.
Teletas's troubles highlight the problems of companies dependent on
government contracts in the face of the economic downturn. Teletas derives
95 per cent of sales from the PTT.
The collapse of Teletas, which was spun off from the PTT in 1988, would
further undermine international confidence in Turkey's proposed programme of
privatisations.
Turkey has mandated S. G. Warburg to sell convertible bonds in the PTT, as a
first step towards floating it. The government hopes to raise Dollars 3.5bn
this year alone, selling stakes in petroleum refining and distribution
groups, a steel concern and THY, the national carrier.
Last month, Teletas sought court protection from creditors, owing TL2,743bn
to 34 foreign and Turkish banks.
The crisis caused the resignation of the Teletas president Mr Sakip Sabanci.
With Akbank, the Sabanci family bank, one of the largest trade creditors of
Teletas, Mr Sabanci indicated he wanted to shelter from allegations of
conflict of interest.
Three Turkish banks, Demirbank, Vakifbank and Alternatifbank, hold liens
against company assets. The remaining creditors, of which Societe Generale,
the French bank, has the largest exposure, are unsecured.
If less than 75 per cent of creditors agree to Teletas's proposed
rescheduling, the court will force the company to declare itself bankrupt.

plans placing

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australis, the would-be Australian satellite broadcaster, has secured
commitments from both international and domestic institutions, which would
allow a ADollars 175m (USDollars 126m) private placement of shares or
debentures to go ahead. The stock was priced at ADollars 1.30, a small
discount to the current Australis share price of ADollars 1.40.
The placement, of 135m shares or debentures, is subject to approval by
Australis's existing shareholders, and a meeting will be called shortly.
The fundraising marks a further step towards the company's goal of having a
satellite pay-TV system up and running by the end of this calender year. The
fledgling company, which was floated on the stockmarket last year, became
the surprise owner of one of the two publicly-available satellite licences.
In recent weeks, Australis has put out a flurry of announcements, suggesting
that its plans are beginning to crystallise. It announced that
Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US cable company, was making a small
direct investment in Australis, and unveiled a programming tie-up between
itself, TCI and TCI-related companies.

FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: Endesa book-building begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Book-building for the global share offer in Endesa, the big Spanish
electrical utility, has officially begun and subscriptions for the domestic
retail tranche of the shares open on Wednesday.
The offer is being made by Endesa's chief shareholder Grupo Teneo, which is
part of INI, the public-sector corporation. It will reduce its holding from
75 per cent to 65 per cent.
When Teneo announced the issue in February, it confidently expected it to
bring in around Pta200bn (Dollars 1.45bn).
At current prices the offering, which will be managed by Goldman Sachs and
by Argentaria, the state-controlled domestic bank, is unlikely to raise more
than Pta170bn.
In February, Endesa shares were trading on the Madrid stock market at
Pta7,350. On Friday they closed at Pta6,500: their January high was
Pta7,900.
The expected reduction in sale proceeds will deal a severe blow to Spain's
cash-strapped public sector. Endesa is by far the most important profit
earner among state-controlled companies.
The proceeds shortfall of some Pta30bn at current prices is equivalent to
around half the losses posted last year by Iberia, the state airline and the
biggest loss-maker in the Teneo group.
Mr Luis Saenz, Teneo's financial director, said funds raised from the Endesa
offering would go towards consolidating the rest of the industrial group.
Losses at Iberia were chiefly responsible for dragging down Teneo's profits
from Pta21bn to Pta3bn last year. Losses at INI, Teneo's parent, totalled
Pta125bn last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
First results from Thai commercial banks for 1994 suggest that the sector is
continuing to increase profits by maintaining wide spreads between deposit
and lending rates.
Siam Commercial Bank announced yesterday that net profit in the first
quarter rose by 20 per cent to Bt1.41bn (Dollars 56m) from Bt1.18bn, while
the smaller Bank of Asia more than doubled its net profit to Bt265.9m from
Bt129.9m. Bank of Ayudhya reported a 24 per cent rise to Bt800.7m from
Bt647.8m.
Full details have yet to be released, but bank executives said their cost of
funds had remained low in the first quarter - a situation which is unlikely
to continue throughout the year - while some lending rates had risen.
Serm Suk, bottler and distributor of Pepsi-Cola products in Thailand,
reported a 72 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit to Bt97.3m from
Bt56.4m.
PepsiCo is planning to increase its stake in Serm Suk from 28 per cent to 42
per cent and use the company as a vehicle for expansion into other markets
in the region.

FT  16 MAY 94 / International Company News: SmithKline in agreement on
cimetidine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs company, has reached an out-of-court
settlement with Novopharm, a US manufacturer of generic unbranded drugs, and
Schein, its distributor, on the marketing of cimetidine, a generic version
of Tagamet, its best selling ulcer treatment drug.
The US patent on Tagamet runs out tomorrow. Under the agreement, Novopharm
will be able to market cimetidine from Wednesday.
Last week, SmithKline applied for an injunction against Novopharm, citing
patent and trademark infringements: Tagamet tablets are green, as were the
cimetidine pills Novopharm proposed to sell.
Under the settlement, Novopharm's cimetidine tablets will be a darker green
rather than the pale green of Tagamet.
Novopharm is likely to be one of many generics companies selling cimetidine.
SmithKline has in the past said that up to 10 could eventually compete for
the market.
Tagamet's US sales are worth Dollars 650m a year. The generic products will
be sold at a discount that Novopharm estimates to be 30 to 50 per cent of
the branded drug's price. Previous price wars between generics companies
with other products have taken the discount beyond 80 per cent.

<TEXT>
Singapore Airlines (SIA), consistently one of the world's most profitable
carriers, said intense competition and the continuing strength of the
Singapore dollar caused profits last year to decline.
For the year ended March, pre-tax profits dipped to SDollars 871m (USDollars
555m), a 7.7 per cent reduction over 1992-93. It is paying an unchanged
total dividend of 22.5 Singapore cents.
Group revenues rose 10.4 per cent to SDollars 6.24bn and the airline's
overall load factor - seen in the industry as an important barometer of
performance - improved by 1.7 per cent to 69.5 per cent, in spite of a
significant growth in capacity.
Passenger revenues rose by 7.2 per cent and cargo revenues by 14.5 per cent.
However, price competition, particularly on European routes, and the
strength of the Singapore dollar pushed yields down by 6.5 per cent.
Analysts estimate that nearly 50 per cent of SIA's overall revenues come
from its European and transatlantic routes.
In the past, SIA has benefitted from significantly lower staff costs
compared with carriers in the industrialised countries. However, increased
wage costs are chipping away at SIA's competitive advantage: staff costs in
the last 12 months went up by more than 21 per cent.
To reduce operational costs SIA has opened a computer software development
and maintenance facility in India, where wages are considerably lower than
in Singapore. The airline is also considering transferring its reservations
service to India.
SIA's performance improved in the second half of 1993-94. Mr Cheong Choong
Kong, SIA's managing director, said there was some indication that the worst
was over, and described 1994-95 as a year of transition.
The carrier claims the most modern fleet among main carriers, with its 64
aircraft having an average age of five years. It has forecast annual growth
of 8 to 9 per cent until the end of the decade, and is negotiating an order
for up to 52 wide-body airliners worth more than Dollars 6bn.

FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bumper period for flotations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies have tapped the stock market for a record Pounds 5.2bn in the
first four months of 1994, more than was raised in the whole of last year.
Major issues so far this year include the Pounds 464m flotation of Beazer
Homes and House of Fraser's Pounds 413m market debut.
A report by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick shows companies seeking full
listings raised Pounds 5.17bn in 1993 and just Pounds 2.3bn in 1992.
Mr Neil Austin, KPMG's head of new issues, said the number of flotations had
begun to pick up in the last quarter of 1993.
'Economic recovery and solid levels of business confidence have allowed more
companies to come through,' he said.
A total of 84 companies were floated in the first four months, against 169
for the whole of last year and 79 in the last three months of 1993.
Mr Austin said that, while there were a substantial number of companies
waiting to float, he did not expect the value of funds raised to equal the
first four months.
'I think we have seen the peak,' he said.
The largest issue currently being expected by the market is the flotation of
the venture capital group, 3i.

FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: JCB firing on all cylinders - How Bamford
faced up to the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JC Bamford, the UK's biggest construction equipment group, has a justifiable
reputation for its product range, design innovation and marketing flair, but
its profits have always been more of an unknown quantity.
That is because the Staffordshire-based company, owned by the Bamford
family, has long preferred to keep its key figures to itself. But now Sir
Anthony Bamford, chairman, has opened the books - at least partially.
Cynics might suggest the timing of the announcement is no accident. After
the worst recession in the industry's history, JCB has recovered strongly
from the downturn, as the table shows, and Sir Anthony believes pre-tax
profits will rise to Pounds 30m-Pounds 40m this year.
In fact, the company has recently introduced a tax-free profit-related pay
scheme, which obliges it to give employees more details of its financial
performance. And, says Sir Anthony, people outside the company may also be
interested in hearing about the financial side of a British engineering
success story.
He stresses, however, that there is no other motive. JCB has no outside
shareholders and no debt, and Sir Anthony says: 'We are not about to issue a
bond or float the company.'
The figures revealed by JCB reflect a creditable performance coming through
the recession without dropping into the red, but also suggest there is
plenty of room for improvement.
The effects of the downturn are shown in the sharp reduction of units sold,
to 10,642 in 1991, and in the low point for turnover of Pounds 312.3m the
same year - when UK sales were little more than half the level of 1989.
Margins have also been severely squeezed by the competition for sales in
what has been a buyers' market. JCB's pre-tax return on sales averaged 11
per cent during the 1980s but plunged to just 2.3 per cent in 1992.
Last year's recovery was due partly to a big upturn in UK sales, now
virtually the same as in 1989, while a strong surge in US sales helped trim
the overall downturn overseas.
However, the recovery - and the fact that JCB avoided a loss even in the
dark days of 1991 and 1992 - also reflected internal measures. 'We have
faced up to reality, have looked at some pretty bleak scenarios, and have
decided what we need to do,' says Mr Martin Coyne, chief executive.
By last year the group had reduced its break-even volume to 72 per cent of
the 1990 level, through looking hard at its overheads and distribution costs
and by obtaining better prices for its products.
There has also been a significant turnround from a modest cash outflow in
1990 to a very positive cash inflow of Pounds 52m last year, due to better
control of working capital. Machine stocks held by overseas subsidiaries
were reduced by Pounds 16m last year, says Mr Tim Leadbeater, commercial and
planning director.
Nonetheless, the return on sales last year was still only 6.7 per cent and
Mr Coyne says anything less than 10 per cent is 'not acceptable.' The target
is 12 per cent, which Mr Coyne says could be achieved next year.
The immediate challenge for JCB is to stem losses at its wheeled loader
division and at JCB-SCM, its excavator joint venture with Japan's Sumitomo
Construction Machinery.
The venture had been expected to get into the black this year, but the
downturn in the European excavator market and the strength of the yen have
put it about two years behind schedule.
The wheeled loader division, meanwhile, has long been in need of a main
product development programme, which has just culminated in the launch of
new products. Sir Anthony says he is not sure when it will return to profit.
A further rise in group profits this year would still put JCB short of its
record Pounds 47m in 1988, when the construction equipment industry was at
the peak of an artificially high boom.
However, Sir Anthony believes sales will hit a record Pounds 455m this year,
up 15 per cent on 1993, and JCB looks on course to achieve that.

FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Goldman Sachs takes main stake in cable
consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldman Sachs, the international investment bank, has demonstrated its faith
in the future of the British cable industry by taking a significant stake in
a large cable operation in the Nottingham area.
The US group has taken the largest financial stake in a consortium that has
acquired control of Diamond Cable, which owns seven franchises covering more
than 530,000 homes in the east Midlands.
Goldman has been interested in UK cable for some time and is one of the
financial houses involved in the flotation of Telewest, the largest cable
operator in the UK. But this is its first direct stake in the industry.
Values of Pounds 200 or more are now being quoted for each home in a cable
franchise area so the Diamond deal could easily be worth more than Pounds
100m overall, although no price has been disclosed. It could cost a further
Pounds 200m to complete the franchises.
Goldman Sachs is in partnership with two US cable investors, Mr Bob Goad and
Mr Ralph Booth, through their company European Cable Capital Partners.
The group of franchises came on the market because of the death of their
founder, Mr Alan McDonald, whose family will retain a 20 per cent interest.
Work on the Nottingham network was badly hit by Mr McDonald's death.
Now the intention is to take several hundred people on during the next few
weeks to speed up construction of the network.
The Nottingham franchises offer both television and telephone services - at
the moment there are more telephone subscribers than television subscribers.
Goldman has no present plans to take further cable industry stakes but
regards the Diamond deal as providing valuable information about the
realities of the industry as well as 'putting our money where our mouth is.'
The sale of Diamond was handled by the NatWest Bank.

FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: De La Rue may act over bid rumour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De La Rue, the banknote printer, may be forced to make a statement this week
following heavy speculation at the weekend that it is in takeover talks with
Portals, the high security paper manufacturer.
Neither company would comment on the speculation yesterday, which followed
an announcement from Portals on Friday that it had received a possible bid
approach.
However, Mr Les Cullen, De La Rue's finance director, said the company was
'very concerned about the speculation'.
The board is expected this morning to consider making an announcement if De
La Rue's shares suffer as a result of the market rumours. On Friday, De La
Rue closed 7p down at 878p.
Portals, which has a market value of about Pounds 500m, is expected to make
a further announcement on the takeover talks within the next couple of
weeks.
The market has also identified Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper
group, as a potential bidder.
However, De La Rue, with its Pounds 200m cash pile, appears to be the
favourite. The company has made no secret of its intention to hit the
acquisition trail.
Portals, which supplies paper to De La Rue, claims 50 per cent of the
available world market in banknotes and second place in the global tea bag
market.

FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ward issues Dollars 85m writ against
Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guinness said yesterday it would vigorously defend an Dollars 85m (Pounds
58m) writ issued by Mr Thomas Ward, a US attorney, and a Guinness director
at the time of the takeover of Distillers in 1986.
Mr Ward, who aided Mr Ernest Saunders, the then Guinness chief executive,
during the successful Pounds 2.7bn bid battle, is suing Guinness and four
executives connected with the takeover for damages on a variety of charges.
These include loss of earnings for Mr Ward's law practice, libel and
slander.
Enjoined with Guinness is Mr Shaun Dowling, a former director. The writ is
also thought to cite Sir Thomas Risk, the former governor of the Bank of
Scotland, and Lord MacFarlane of Bearsden, who succeeded Mr Saunders as
chairman of Guinness and is currently non-executive chairman of United
Distillers. The fourth is also believed to be a former Guinness director.
The suit, filed in a Los Angeles court, follows Mr Ward's acquittal last
year at the Old Bailey on charges of stealing Pounds 5.2m from Guinness. The
drinks group said it was an unauthorised payment by Mr Saunders, but Mr Ward
maintained it was a legitimate 'success fee' for his services in winning the
Distillers bid.
Although Mr Ward repaid Pounds 1.3m of the fee prior to his trial, Guinness
is currently pursuing Mr Ward for the return of the remainder plus interest,
totalling Pounds 9m.
Mr Ward's action does not include punitive or exemplary damages, which would
be decided by jury if the case against Guinness was proven. Guinness said
that a separate action, being brought against Guinness by Mr Ward's legal
partners, would also be strongly defended.
The company said: 'We have instructed our lawyers in California to take
steps to have these actions dismissed.' The company has been granted a
30-day extention before it responds to the claim. It is thought that
Guinness will act in conjunction with the four co-named executives.
Mr Ward's action is the latest legal fall-out from the takeover of
Distillers in which Guinness fought a prolonged battle with Argyll Group.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Pub beer still flat while food and
leisure thrive - Whitbread/Allied-Lyons/Bass
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The brewers' results season gets into full swing this week, with full-year
figures from Whitbread today and Allied-Lyons tomorrow, and interims from
Bass on Wednesday.
So far, the season has produced only one real upset: Grand Metropolitan's
statement that de-stocking in the US wines and spirits market was likely to
cost it Pounds 40m in the full year. The big question is therefore how far
Allied, also a big player in the US market, will confirm GrandMet's
experience.
For the UK, a common theme is likely to be that brewing and old-fashioned
basic pubs are still doing badly, while pubs relying more on food and
leisure are thriving. The worst figures from the trio are therefore likely
to come from Bass, the UK's biggest brewer and also a significant pub
operator. Against Pounds 229m last year, pre-tax profits this time could be
flat or even slightly down, though there should be some improvement from the
Holiday Inns hotel chain.
Whitbread is expected to do better, with pre-tax of perhaps Pounds 232m
against Pounds 220m before exceptionals last time. Again, profits from beer
and tenanted pubs should be down, but Whitbread is particularly strong on
more up-market, restaurant-type outlets.
Allied's figures will take a little interpreting, since this will be the
first full year to show the effects of its brewing joint venture with
Carlsberg. While stated brewing profits may be slightly up on the enlarged
business, the underlying position remains weak. The market will be alert for
any suggestions that Allied is closer to extricating itself from the
venture, which it has already hinted does not fit its overall strategy.
The actual pre-tax figure is not a matter of debate, since it was forecast
by Allied at Pounds 630m at the time of its deal with Domecq in March. This
compares with Pounds 542m - again before exceptionals - the year before.

Although many brokers, due to unveil results on Wednesday, reduced their
profit forecasts in March, most are likely to show recovery.
In consumer electronics, Sony will release figures on Thursday. A 30 per
cent fall is expected in parent company pre-tax profits, due to depressed
domestic demand, while pre-tax earnings are forecast to rise 8 per cent due
to recovery in the US.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, due on Friday, expects a 4 per cent fall in
parent company pre-tax earnings and a 7 per cent decline at pre-tax level.
With orders falling for nearly two years, construction companies, reporting
on Thursday, are expected to show weak figures. Nomura Research Institute
estimates that the sector's pre-tax profits fell by about 17 per cent in the
year to March.
NRI forecasts a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the trading houses,
hit by a decline in imports caused by the economic slump. Many companies are
still suffering from securities investment losses from the late 1980s.
Honda, the carmaker, has pencilled in a 58 per cent plunge in pre-tax
profits because of decline in domestic demand.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Profits revealed at JC Bamford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JC Bamford, one of the UK's largest privately owned manufacturing companies,
more than trebled pre-tax profits last year and is considering building a
new factory at Cheadle, Staffordshire, to cope with rising demand.
The company, Britain's biggest producer of construction equipment, will tell
its 2,700 employees this week that pre-tax profits surged to Pounds 26.6m
last year from Pounds 8.3m in 1992, as sales rose to Pounds 398.4m from
Pounds 359.8m.
JCB, founded by Mr Joe Bamford in 1945, has traditionally said little about
its overall financial performance. But his son Sir Anthony Bamford,
chairman, has revealed for the first time details of the company's recent
profits record.
The figures show that JCB's pre-tax profits dipped to a low point of Pounds
8.3m in 1992. But it is one of the few construction equipment producers in
the world to have come through the recent recession without making an annual
loss.
Sir Anthony said all the company's divisions were profitable last year,
except its wheeled-loader business, which had just launched long-awaited new
products, and its three-year-old excavator joint venture with Japan's
Sumitomo Construction Machinery.
The joint venture, JCB-SCM, shares a factory in Uttoxeter with the JCB
Special Products company, which makes small machines. Sir Anthony said the
factory was 'bursting at the seams', partly because the strong yen had
increased the need for local content in the venture's Japanese-inspired
products.
JCB's intention was to move Special Products to the 91-acre site of a former
opencast coal mine at Cheadle, which the company bought two years ago. The
move, said Sir Anthony, would be 'positive' for employment, but JCB had yet
to make a final decision.
The company has added 400 jobs this year, and produced 4,000 machines in the
first quarter, up 68 per cent from a year earlier. Sir Anthony said profits
this year should rise further to Pounds 30m-Pounds 40m.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Hanson increases investment pay-back time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has lengthened its pay-back period for
new investments by up to two years, in a move to take advantage of low
interest rates and inflation.
Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive, confirmed that the company had
lowered its pay-back criteria for capital investments. They will be
authorised if they pay for themselves within five or six years instead of
the previous target of three to four.
The move comes as other companies are considering lowering investment
thresholds, and targets for return on capital, in response to falls in
interest rates. But other big industrial groups have not yet lowered their
pay-back levels.
Hanson's change of strategy is partly based on the company's outlook for
interest rates and inflation, which Mr Bonham expects to remain under
control. But it is also keen to deflect charges of short-termism often
levelled at conglomerates.
In a report on UK competitiveness, the Commons Trade and Industry Select
Committee warned of an alarmingly low level of labour productivity and
'remaining deep-rooted problems' in investment.
Hanson believes the falling cost of capital will enable it to take the
longer-term view on capital investment that has been urged by the Bank of
England and the Confederation of British Industry.
While analysts welcomed Hanson's change of policy some voiced fears that the
company may be making an admission that short pay-backs are no longer
feasible.
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, has generally had a pay-back period of
less than four years, although it told analysts this was not feasible during
a recession.
The General Electric Company, which told the trade and industry committee
that institutions were pre-occupied with short-term economic performance,
said its real target rate remained unchanged at 20 per cent.
Mr Alan Spall, finance director at Imperial Chemical Industries, believed
inflation to be only one element in the equation. 'The fact that inflation
has come down doesn't at all mean that our hurdle rates have come down as
well,' he said recently.
Hanson is expected to confirm tomorrow, when it publishes its results, that
the US still offers the best acquisition opportunities, although it would
like to make a big takeover in the UK.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Atlantic Richfield loses on derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Atlantic Richfield, the US energy company, has confirmed press reports that
investments in derivative securities led to steep losses last month in an
employee investment fund it manages.
Arco is the latest of several large US companies, including consumer
products group Procter &amp; Gamble, to acknowledge suffering significant losses
in derivatives due to volatility of markets. Losses have reinforced
pressures in Congress for regulation of derivatives markets, which critics
argue are poorly policed, badly understood and could pose a systemic risk to
the financial system.
Mr Al Greenstein, an Arco spokesman, told Reuter the group's Money Market
Plus Fund lost Dollars 22m (Pounds 15m), or 5.3 per cent of its principal in
April, and all the losses were associated with derivative securities with
principal risks.
He said the company had since liquidated all derivative securities in
question, and changed strategy to avoid such investments. Mr Greenstein
added Arco had informed investors in the fund that it wants to 'make good'
on the losses. He said it was consulting the Internal Revenue Service to
work out 'highly complex' tax issues involved with a reimbursement.
It was not Arco's policy to reimburse employees for fund losses, but it
wanted to do so for investors of the Money Market Plus Fund since they 'had
the expectation that their money was not at risk'.

The UK fashion retail group, which includes such names as Debenhams, Top Man

increase in reported pre-tax profits, after exceptional items, from Pounds
30m to about Pounds 35m - but a fall in underlying profits. As last year's
figure was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 11.9m to cover the costs of
the move towards greater part-time working, pre-tax profits will actually
have fallen.

Shareholders will be interested to find out how much the US Peabody coal

Estimates hover around the Pounds 80m mark. The profits figure - stripping
out the strike costs - should be between Pounds 580m and Pounds 675m
pre-tax, up from Pounds 507m. But it is thought the quarterly dividend will

Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits for British Telecommunications of
around Pounds 2.7bn when chairman Sir Iain Vallance announces its full-year
results on Thursday. That represents a 40 per cent increase on last year
(Pounds 1.9bn). But taking account of last year's exceptional items, the
increase comes down to a more modest 2 per cent. Strong competition from
Mercury and the cable companies has restricted growth. Earnings per share
are expected to be around 29p, against 19.8p last year before exceptionals.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Four ambitions and a European film studio: Raymond Snoddy on
why PolyGram may be laughing all the way to the bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a few hours on Wednesday evening London's Leicester Square could have
passed for Los Angeles or New York on a big movie night. There were the slow
procession of stretched limousines, the hundreds of fans behind barriers,
and the stars bathed momentarily in flashlights for the UK premiere of Four
Weddings and a Funeral.
An audience which has been longing for the revival of the British film
industry was there to salute the success of a movie minnow, a Dollars 5m
(Pounds 3.4m) romantic comedy shot in 36 days in Britain with the help of
Channel Four finance. It has become the first British film for six years to
take the number one spot at the US box office.
With equally good results coming in from France and Australia, the film  -
produced by Working Title, a subsidiary of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment -
is beginning to look like a worldwide hit.
Yet as Michael Kuhn, the London lawyer president of PolyGram Filmed
Entertainment, prepared for the premiere he was not donning the Union Jack
or planning to claim another rebirth of the British film industry.
That sort of thinking Mr Kuhn denounces as 'total crap'. For good measure he
says those who seek subsidies for British films 'drive me nuts'. 'Four
Weddings is a major movie success and what's 'British' got to do with it?'
says 43-year-old Mr Kuhn, whose business is part of the PolyGram group,
controlled by Philips of the Netherlands.
'This has been funded by the profits of 32 record companies around the
world. That's what paid for this movie and its marketing. It's nothing to do
with British. It's the entertainment business and it's ludicrous to keep
talking about the British industry in this way,' he adds.
Mr Kuhn has set himself the uniquely difficult task of building a
European-based 'studio' - on a Hollywood scale but without walls. The studio
simply exists as a collection of independent production companies either
owned or controlled by PolyGram. Over the past three years with hardly any
fuss PolyGram has got on with making films - 29 so far with eight more in
various stages of production.
No less than Dollars 8m out of a total marketing budget of Dollars 15m for
the film - PolyGram's first unambiguous success - was spent in Los Angeles
and New York on an intensive advertising campaign for the launch at five
cinemas. Average revenues were Dollars 27,000 per screen on the first
weekend - the sort of figures that could be used to persuade exhibitors to
show the quirky sort of film that rarely makes it to mid-West cinemas.
But make it it did, and by the time of the London premiere Four Weddings had
taken Dollars 31m at the box office. Mr Kuhn believes Dollars 50m gross
could be earned from North America and a similar amount from the rest of the
world.
That is only a small proportion of the film's financial potential. The
typical film earns about a fifth of its revenues at the cinema box office,
video 50 per cent, television 20 per cent and other areas of exploitation 10
per cent.
'We need just one more film not dissimilar to Four Weddings and then on a
project basis - forget the overheads - these two would have recouped the
losses on all the movies we have made to date,' he says.
Others have done reasonably well - Backbeat, the PolyGram film about the man
who walked away from the Beatles will certainly get its money back. And with
others the risk is minimised. The actual cost of the film is covered by
selling rights in advance and usually only the marketing costs are at risk.
But film history suggests that when Europeans try to challenge Hollywood the
moment of success is the moment of maximum danger. Revolution was the
expensive flop that did for Goldcrest in the wake of its association with
successes such as Chariots of Fire. Raise the Titanic scuppered Lord Lew
Grade's film ambitions. 'It would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic,'
Grade cracked at the time.
Mr Kuhn says he has taken a step-by-step approach in putting in place the
building blocks of a studio, without property but combining the essential
components of production and distribution. 'By 1996 or 1997 if God is in his
heaven and smiling on us we will be the only European-based studio. The only
and unique case of a (European) film company with its own distribution.' By
1996 he hopes to be producing 15 to 20 feature films a year.
Because the company is taking on a larger number of more ambitious pictures
and handling more of the distribution itself, Mr Kuhn will later this year
have to go back to his board to ask for more backing. The original deal,
designed to take PolyGram into the mainstream movie business, announced in
1991, involved an initial investment of around Dollars 200m over three
years.
That may have to rise to Dollars 400m compared with the Dollars 500m to
Dollars 1bn of working capital needed by an orthodox major studio. 'Once we
emerge from the chrysalis, suddenly you will see, I hope you will see
anyway, a significant increase in shareholder value. This is no longer a
record company. This is an entertainment company,' says Mr Kuhn.
He had to edge into film production through music videos and later music
films after a disastrous previous attempt to take on Hollywood with PolyGram
Pictures. Combined with the 1979-81 recession in the record business,
'PolyGram was bust,' he says.
He had four ambitions: he tackled production first through the acquisition
of stakes in independents rather than spending billions of dollars buying an
established studio. So PolyGram acquired or took large stakes in
independents such as Working Title (My Beautiful Laundrette), Propaganda
Films (Wild at Heart) and Interscope (Three Men and a Baby) - the last, a
Dollars 35m deal, came with 75 projects in development.
The second ambition was to add video distribution to the group's existing
international record distribution network. The third was to set up Gramercy
as its North American distribution company for smaller films - big pictures
in the US still go through traditional distribution channels. Kuhn's fourth
ambition is to acquire a major film catalogue to smooth out the troughs in
film distribution.
As Four Weddings and a Funeral opens in the UK, he is very enthusiastic
about a new PolyGram film, Priscilla Queen of the Desert, about three
transvestites travelling across Australia to perform at Alice Springs. And
that only cost Dollars 2m to make.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Violence returns to townships: S African leaders compete for
scarce resources ahead of budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN and GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG, CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's respite from its problems ended at the weekend as at least 18
people died in political violence and ministers in the newly formed all-race
government tussled over budget allocations.
The killings and political tensions showed the harsh realities facing the
new government, following the post-election euphoria. President Nelson
Mandela's government also has to make early decisions on economic policy.
Fears of a resurgence of violence grew after 12 bodies were discovered on
Saturday in a house in Thokoza, a black township east of Johannesburg, in
the worst incident since the elections began three weeks ago. Although the
political affiliations of the dead were not immediately known, Thokoza had
been a centre of clashes between supporters of the victorious African
National Congress and the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom party.
A soldier was shot dead in front of a hostel in the township yesterday,
after four gunmen believed to be Inkatha supporters dragged him from a car.
In the KwaZulu/Natal region, where the worst pre-election bloodletting took
place, there were at least five politically motivated deaths over the
weekend. But Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi urged his Inkatha stalwarts to make
peace with their rivals, warning that violence would scare off vital foreign
investment.
Meanwhile, provincial and national leaders have begun competing over scarce
budgetary resources in the run-up to next month's budget.
Mr Ben Turok, a radical political scientist from the University of Durban
Westville, who has called for increased rates and taxes for whites, has been
put in charge of implementing the ANC's reconstruction and development
programme in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV) region around
Johannesburg. This is South Africa's economic heartland, responsible for
some 39 per cent of GDP. However, Mr Tokyo Sexwale, the region's premier,
has promised wide consultations before imposing any new measures.
The cabinet will this week begin shaping its legislative agenda, and Mr
Mandela is due to address parliament tomorrow to spell out the government's
plans.
The budget to be presented by Mr Derek Keys, the finance minister, will have
to reconcile many conflicting regional spending needs. The ANC has costed
its reconstruction and development programme at R39bn (Pounds 7.1bn) over
five years. The previous National party government, of which Mr Keys was a
member, said it would cost much more.

FT  16 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the stirrings of competition, credit cards are still a lucrative
business for Barclays and National Westminster who together control around
half the market. Both still charge annualised percentage rates around 22 per
cent even though base rates are only 5.25 per cent. Newcomers have failed so
far to make significant inroads. Save &amp; Prosper, whose APR is only 13.9 per
cent, has less than 1 per cent of the market, though it has been selective
in targeting customers. But the GM Card has attracted 350,000 customers in
the space of a few months. The big issuers would be rash to assume their
profits are secure.
High margins and low barriers to entry mean credit card companies must be
vulnerable to competitive attack. Part of the trouble has been inertia on
the part of consumers, who tend simply to look to their existing bank to
provide a card. Gradually that is starting to change as brands proliferate.
GM's role is important in this regard as is that of niche operators like
Bank of Scotland who promote affinity cards. It is behind the card issued by
The Sunday Times, for example.
It may take only a spot of aggressive marketing for the stranglehold of the
big two to be broken and pricing to crumble. It would make sense for Mr
Peter Wood of Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance
subsidiary, to take a serious look. Direct Line has the necessary expertise
in marketing, cheap processing and risk analysis. It is already spreading
its wings into household insurance, consumer loans and mortgages. If he went
into credit cards too, Mr Wood could easily do to that industry what he has
done to motor insurance.

FT  16 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome's recent recovery has been nearly as startling as its decline. The
shares have risen by 15 per cent in three weeks and on the evidence of
Friday's 7p rise to 586p there is still some momentum. For investors who
bought shares from Wellcome Trust at 800p two years ago, the rally will be
of scant comfort. After a string of disappointments - culminating with the
decision in March to abandon development of a new anti-viral compound - the
company will struggle to regain a premium rating.
There is no single reason for Wellcome's sudden rehabilitation. Although
Retrovir will never be the money-spinner once hoped, the company has
cemented its position in Aids therapy by signing a marketing agreement with
Glaxo. Early data suggests Famvir, SmithKline Beecham's anti-viral
treatment, will not elbow aside Zovirax, Wellcome's biggest selling drug.
Roche's acquisition of US drugs company Syntex at a large premium to the
market share price also pointed to value hidden elsewhere in the sector.
On a multiple of around 10 times this year's forecast earnings at the
depths, Wellcome certainly looked cheap on all but the bleakest diagnosis.
But much still depends on the growth it can squeeze out of Zovirax in the
face of competition and expiring patents. Disappointment on that score would
cast doubt on Wellcome's ability to make the global grade as an independent
company. The Trust - which still holds 40 per cent - might then wonder
whether it would be better off with a smaller stake in a larger, less risky
company.

FT  16 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways appears to be the main winner of the battle for Orly. As
part of yesterday's deal, Britain agreed to study whether access to Heathrow
by a number of small French airlines could be improved. But this looks more
like a face-saving device for the French than a serious concession by the
British. The main point is that France has accepted that BA and its fellow
UK airlines, Air UK and British Midland, will have access to Paris's
strategically placed southern airport by the end of June at the latest.
Even so, the fuss kicked up by Paris before it gave way shows just how hard
it will be to pry open the French aviation market. Surrender in this battle
does not mean further liberalisation will come easily. The French government
is so keen to protect the nearly bankrupt Air France that it can be expected
to fight a rearguard action to frustrate BA's further expansion.
The next flashpoints are likely to concern Air France's Fr20bn
recapitalisation and plans by TAT, BA's French affiliate, to fly from Orly
to Toulouse and Marseille. The Fr20bn recapitalisation is probably illegal
under the Treaty of Rome as it constitutes state aid but the European
Commission is expected to let it through - albeit with conditions - because
of France's political clout. Similarly, although the Commission has ordered
France to open up flights from Orly to Toulouse and Marseille, Paris is
appealing to the European Court of Justice. BA's shareholders have further
bumpy rides to endure before they can enjoy the fruits of the airline's
Gallic investments.

FT  16 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Hanson's longer horizons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's name is so linked with short-termism that its decision to lengthen
its target pay-back period may seem odd. New investments are now to be
authorised if they promise to pay for themselves within five or six years
rather than the previous target of four years. Nevertheless, the move looks
logical. With inflation low and money cheap, it makes sense to accept a
lower rate of return. That, at any rate, is what the Bank of England and the
Confederation of British Industry have been telling industry in recent
months.
Whether the stock market views it that way remains to be seen. Sceptics may
think Hanson's move signals that it is running short of profitable
investment opportunities. For many years, Hanson was able to increase
earnings by exploiting the anomalies of acquisition accounting. But that is
no longer possible. Investors may fear that Hanson will now turn to poor
investments to maintain growth.
Another worry could concern dividends, which were frozen last December.
Hanson's cash position will become clearer tomorrow when it reports its
half-year profits. But the danger is that a longer pay-back period could
skew the group's cash flow profile as a result of a higher investment rate
and a longer wait for projects to pay off. That, in turn, could undermine
Hanson's ability to increase dividends. An extended pay-back looks justified
given low inflation and interest rates. Even so, investors will probably
need reassuring.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Crest project criticised as 'too complex'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's handling of the Crest share settlement system has been
sharply criticised by a former executive of the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, in an article published late
last week in a legal journal.
The article argues that paperless share settlement, which is due to be in
operation by 1996 or 1997, could have been achieved more cheaply and quickly
by augmenting the stock exchange's existing Talisman and Institutional Net
Settlements systems. It argues that Crest is unnecessarily complex and that
it creates additional risks that do not currently exist in share settlement.
The approach outlined would have left the stock exchange broadly in control
of share settlement and left no visible role for the Bank of England.
It is understood that the article, originally submitted last autumn for
publication in Butterworths Journal of International Banking and Financial
Law, was withdrawn at the request of the Bank of England, which wanted it
delayed at least until after an important Crest taskforce report was
published in February. The author, Ms Kathleen Tyson-Quah, who was an
assistant director in SIB's capital markets division, resigned in March.
The SIB has declined to comment on the article specifically. However, it
said: 'We believe the Crest project is progressing successfully but we don't
wish to make any further comment because we have a formal recognition role
under the Financial Services Act.'
The bank began setting up Crest immediately after the collapse of the stock
exchange's own Taurus project for paperless share trading. The aim in both
cases has been to reduce risk in equities trading by cutting the time
between agreeing a bargain and receiving shares or payment, which requires
the elimination of paper share certificates.
Ms Tyson-Quah argues that instead of building a new system, shares could be
transferred through electronic messages.
Among the great shortcomings of Crest, she argues, is that it calls for
'gross' settlement of equity trades and is likely to require some securities
firms to increase their bank borrowings substantially. Separately, the
British Bankers Association is already holding talks with the Bank of
England about this area.
Responding to the article, the bank said it had considered the option
outlined by Ms Tyson-Quah at an early stage of Crest development but 'all
things considered' decided that Crest was a better option. A key factor was
their view that Talisman is nearly 20 years old and its technology is
insufficiently flexible.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Uncle Sam, salesman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A salesman who won two separate orders totalling Dollars 10bn from the same
customer in three months would normally deserve congratulations and a hefty
bonus. But when the salesman is the US government acting on behalf of
private companies and the customer a foreign sovereign state, it becomes
instead a subject of serious global concern. Such tactics jeopardise the
stability of the multilateral trading system and threaten the economic and
political interests of the US, as well as of other countries.
That, unfortunately, is not the view in Washington. Rather, the Clinton
administration is hailing its role in clinching the sales of Boeing aircraft
and AT&amp;T telecommunications equipment to Saudi Arabia this year as the first
fruits of an aggressive government-backed export drive. Indeed, this early
success, which builds upon the use of such tactics in the sale of military
hardware, is being seized upon as vindication for a broader policy of
government support for industry. This includes sharply increased subsidies
for commercial research and development.
Inevitably, other bidders for Saudi contracts have cried foul. The US
response has not been convincing. If, as it insists, political arm-twisting
did not secure the AT&amp;T deal, why did Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce
secretary, need to intervene in the negotiations? Given that Saudi Arabia is
a US client state which depends heavily on an American defence umbrella,
Washington's protestations look thin.
Official meddling
It is illogical for the administration to fall back on the assertion that it
is only doing what other countries have long done. The argument is
inconsistent with the long-running US complaint that official meddling
prevents free competition on Japanese markets. Exactly the same charge can
be levelled at the way the recent Saudi contracts were awarded.
Washington is on firmer ground in pointing out that many European
governments, notably France and Britain, have long peddled high-level
political influence to secure orders for national exporters, while Japan has
achieved the same goal in developing countries through tied-aid policies.
Nonetheless, the fact that the US is in some respects a recent sinner does
not mean it is a justified one. Though government salesmanship may bring
short-term gains, it is bad for everyone in the longer term. Customers get a
poor deal, because their choice is not based on the quality and price of
what they buy. Exporters are damaged by being encouraged to curry favour
with bureaucrats, rather than meet customers' needs.
Unhealthy collusion
Governments suffer, both because excessively enthusiastic championing of
exports can breed unhealthy collusion with private companies, and because
their own integrity and judgement can be compromised. Witness the British
government's recent embarrassment over the Malaysian Pergau dam affair.
Furthermore, the practice unfairly penalises companies from countries whose
governments have limited resources and international clout.
In reality, aggressive export promotion is the obverse of trade protection.
It similarly distorts markets, impairs efficiency and invites a spiral of
beggar-my-neighbour escalation. Some European Union governments may, indeed,
urge a competitive response to the US. That temptation needs to be resisted.
Instead, the EU should seek talks with the US and Japan aimed at reversing
the proliferation of government-sponsored export drives. One aim should be
to strengthen the controls on subsidised export credits negotiated in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and to provide for
stiff sanctions against offenders, preferably by bringing the whole area
under the new World Trade Organisation.
In addition, tougher international rules are needed to prohibit tied aid and
limit covert political intervention in export contracts. That latter goal
may prove difficult to achieve. But it can be facilitated by encouraging the
privatisation of purchasing entities.
Clinton administration officials say they would be prepared to scale down,
or even eliminate, their export promotion efforts if other governments did
the same. The EU should put those professed good intentions to the test.

FT  16 MAY 94 / No exits on the road to market: Despite setbacks, Russia
will not abandon its commitment to economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR CHERNOMYRDIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past three months the west's view of Russian reform has undergone a
significant evolution.
From the panicky statements about a 'reactionary turn in the economy' to the
forecasts of a burst of hyperinflation which prevailed in January, the
world's media has begun to offer a more considered and objective view. And
though at the beginning of the year some ultra-radicals, including some of
our own in Russia, called on the west not to give a cent to the 'red
directors' who had taken control of the Russian government, the
International Monetary Fund still took the symbolic decision to assign to
Moscow the second tranche of a Dollars 3bn loan in exchange for commitments
to market reform.
What happened in these first 10 - 12 weeks of this year to justify the IMF's
decision? There was no great turnover of ministers in the Russian
government. The economic reform programme, adopted in August 1993, did not
change. Most significantly, events themselves have refuted the unscrupulous
allegation that our course would change, an allegation that proceeded simply
from the political ambitions of those who made it.
The continuation of reform, financial stabilisation and structural change
remain the core of Russia's economic policy. The economic evidence of the
first three months of this year attest to that. Between February and April,
the monthly rate of inflation fell to 10 per cent. We do not expect the
picture to change in May. In the planned 1994 budget, the deficit is pegged
at 9 per cent of gross domestic product. By observing these parameters, we
will see inflation lowered to a monthly rate of 7-8 per cent by the end of
the year.
To achieve this goal we must adopt the most resolute measures aimed at
limiting the budget deficit and the emission of credits. In particular, we
took a difficult decision to increase state revenues by changing a range of
previously-fixed taxes, customs and excise duties. And we did that against
the backdrop of a 25 per cent fall in production in the first quarter of
this year compared to the corresponding period in 1993. At the same time we
continued to carry out a tight monetary policy to which the central bank
interest rate - significantly higher than the inflation rate in the past few
months - bears witness.
It is vitally important that every member of the Russian government fully
understands that a strong rouble is the indispensable condition for the
revival of the Russian economy, and the Russian state as a whole. Naturally,
as elsewhere in the world, ministers will lobby for more resources. However
as every member of the Russian government knows, the important thing is not
the amount of money they receive; rather it is that the money they get
should have a real and lasting worth. It is counter-productive to have a
currency which in one month alone loses about a quarter of its value. Such
has been the fate of the rouble.
Our common task is thus clear: to ensure that Russian citizens should know
that everything their government does is directed towards protecting the
purchasing power of the rouble, so that with these roubles Russian citizens
will be welcomed anywhere in the world.
The question naturally arises as to why we do not introduce an even tougher
financial policy and limit even more tightly budgetary expenditure so as to
bring down inflation more rapidly. We are told by critics that in other
countries, in eastern Europe and the Baltics for instance, the authorities
have managed to achieve financial stabilisation more quickly. And when we
insist, in defence, that Russia is fundamentally different from these
countries, our critics retort that all countries are different but that
economic laws work in the same way everywhere.
Posing the question in this way reveals an inadequate understanding of the
specifics of the Russian situation. In a small state the government can
follow what happens in every large enterprise and, where needed, take urgent
action: in Russia, however, the geography of the country significantly
reduces such a possibility.
If a disaster strikes a small country and its economy grinds to a halt, the
world community will come to its aid. Even Russia, in spite of its worsening
economic crisis, continues to help its neighbours in trying to overcome
their poverty. Indeed Russia's donor status vis-a-vis the member countries
of the Commonwealth of Independent States is parallel to that of the Group
of Seven leading industrialised countries vis-a-vis Russia.
In other words, while economic laws work the same in all countries, the
possibility of a government responding to them depends on the historic
particularities of that country's economy.
For 70 years, the former Soviet totalitarian economy accumulated vast
structural disparities. Tackling these problems demands prolonged effort and
huge expense. It is clear that we cannot sanction mass closures of our
exhausted plants since that would usher in an unsupportable rise in
unemployment and sharply worsen both the political and the social situation
in the country. Besides, it would be simply unreasonable, since many
enterprises have significant reserves with which to improve their financial
position. All industrial enterprises should get the chance - and that means
time - to overcome their present difficulties.
Today, we can define three groups of basic industries in Russia:
Enterprises that have successfully completed a period of adaptation to new
market conditions and are already increasing turnover.
Enterprises which have yet to undergo such a period of adaptation, but which
display the necessary potential to do so and have some hope of succeeding.
It is these enterprises which should get help from the government. This
group is by far the most numerous.
Enterprises which are beyond salvation and should be closed down in
accordance with the law on bankruptcy. A list of such companies is already
prepared. We do not, however, want to throw the baby out with the bathwater;
and we cannot ignore the social consequences of each step on this road.
Imagine a provincial Russian town, built up around a big defence plant set
up some years ago. The entire population of the town - maybe 100,000 people
 -works at the defence plant, including those engaged in the service sector.
Assume that the plant has long since ceased to have any social use and no
longer receives orders. Should we shut the enterprise without considering
the consequences for its employees?
Consider another example: a northern mining town with a population of 50,000
which was established to work the coal reserves. The extraction of the coal
is carried on with huge losses, the reserves are near to exhaustion, the
equipment is obsolete and the cost of transporting the coal has gone up
several times. There is no other settlement for 500km. There are hundreds of
such cities and towns throughout Russia.
What should be done? We have no choice but to study carefully each case and
patiently find a solution.
We do now feel there is some understanding in the west for these problems.
The talks last month between the Russian government and representatives of
the Group of Seven during the annual meeting of the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development in St Petersburg showed that our colleagues
in the US, the UK and other countries recognise the importance of assistance
in the social sphere. They intend to take an active part in the search for a
way to separate out from the enterprises the social components traditionally
provided by them, such as schools and kindergartens, so as not to threaten
the basic living conditions of millions of people. The issue here is the
possibility of channelling the international credit given to Russia towards
the resolution of, above all, social problems. We can cope with the other
issues ourselves.
We recently finished a round of talks in Moscow with the IMF; our approach
met with understanding and support. Our relations with the IMF, to which we
have furnished the most complete information both on the economic situation
on what we intend to do to correct problems in that sphere, have become a
symbol of our new openness in economic matters. We believe that the
agreement with the IMF will lay a good foundation for our talks with the
Paris and London clubs of sovereign and commercial creditors on the
restructuring of Russia's foreign debt which we inherited from the Soviet
Union. Successful co-operation with our creditors should also assist our
efforts to achieve financial stabilisation.
The further integration of Russia into the world economy fully accords with
our interests. We have left behind the former artificial exchange rate of
the rouble, the state monopoly of internal trade and other former obstacles
and limitations. We welcome foreign investment in the Russian economy and
very much count on attracting further foreign investment - even though we
understand that much will depend on the success of our economic reforms and
the improvement of the legal and tax regimes for foreign investors.
At the same time we will continue to insist on the establishment of equal
trading relations, on the ending of the discrimination against Russian
exports. In that regard, we are determined to push through Russia's
application to join the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. In the near
future Russia will take its proper place in the system of world trade and it
will benefit both Russia and its trading partners.
I know that much of this appears over-optimistic. Indeed the country has
still to emerge from its deep economic crisis. At the same time, we see the
first signs that our efforts are bearing fruit. Th privatisation of small
businesses - shops, restaurants, workshops - is almost complete. As a
result, the look of Russian cities is changing: in place of the dejected and
sombre queues to which we were accustomed we see smart advertising hoardings
and attractive, lively goods. We count on the privatisation of the larger
companies to produce the same positive effect.
The first stage of privatisation, based on the use of vouchers issued free
to every citizen, will soon be complete. From July 1 the remaining shares in
state hands will be sold not for vouchers but for money. This new approach
should replenish the state budget and also strengthen the financial position
of the enterprises themselves.
The strengthening of political stability is also an enormously important
condition for successfully addressing the economic crisis. Last year, a new
constitution was endorsed by the people in a popular referendum, marking the
end of the long-drawn out and weary confrontation between the executive and
legislative powers. The other important step in the development of the
democratic process was the holding of parliamentary elections, also in
December.
There are differing views on the results of the December parliamentary
elections. Yet the first 100 days of the federal assembly's work shows that
the new parliament is a great improvement on the old Supreme Soviet. We
count on close co-operation between the government and the parliament as a
necessary condition for the creation of a legal base for the new economic
environment. Political stability has been further strengthened by the
achievement of a civil accord of national reconciliation, a process led by
President Boris Yeltsin and now endorsed by a broad range of Russian
political parties, enterprises and associations.
In today's Russia we are seeing a new beginning: a time for those who know
how, and have the ability, to do business. We are now living through the
trough of the economic crisis. In the next few months we can make a break
from the basic negative tendencies which have held back our development in
the past two or three years.
I am certain that we will make the break. Russia has only one path to tread
 -that of reform, and it will not depart from it.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Competition and competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government exhortations to British companies to raise the level of their
performance in world markets are welcome, as are intelligent government
actions to facilitate the private sector's efforts. No doubt Mr Michael
Heseltine's white paper on competitiveness, delayed as a mark of respect to
the late Mr John Smith, will be a virtuoso performance in this regard.
However, it will not obscure an undesirable by-product of the campaign -
namely, a relaxation in competition policy.
One symptom is the increasingly laisser faire approach to the investigation
of anti-competitive practices by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The
MMC has found no threat to the public interest in reports on the supply of
motor cars, perfumes and ice-cream. In each case, there had been alleged
abuses of power by dominant suppliers, with new entrants complaining of
barriers to entry. Yet the MMC has appeared willing to challenge such
anti-competitive practices. For example, the MMC rejected a complaint from
Mars, a recent entrant to the ice-cream market, about exclusive freezer
cabinets. The MMC was unconvinced, even though Walls has nearly two-thirds
of the market.
According to a report in today's FT, decisions such as these have alarmed
the Office of Fair Trading. Under Sir Bryan Carsberg, the former telecoms
regulator, the OFT has taken a strongly consumerist approach to competition
issues. Sir Bryan gives the impression of believing that anti-competitive
practices should be removed unless it can be shown that they benefit the
consumer. He wishes to attack vertical barriers to competition such as
agreements that tie retailers to manufacturers.
Consumer interests
In contrast, the chairman of the MMC is Mr Graeme Odgers, a former
businessman. He points out that there is no shortage of competition within
the industries that have been investigated. His view is that it needs to be
shown that anti-competitive practices damage the consumer before the MMC
interferes in an industry. He says that companies that have achieved
competitive advantage should be allowed to profit from their investment,
innovation and enterprise. However, there is a fine line between legitimate
rewards for investment and seeking to exclude competitors - and practices
such as exclusive freezer cabinets smack uncomfortably of the latter.
The actions of the Department of Trade and Industry reinforce the impression
that competition matters less these days. Early in Sir Bryan's term of
office, Mr Heseltine over-rode him on two references to the MMC. The first,
a merger of two infra-red defence components businesses, was a relatively
unimportant case. But the second, less than two weeks later, caused a bigger
stir. Mr Heseltine decided not to refer the hostile bid by Airtours for
Owners Abroad, although it would have created a situation in which two
companies controlled two-thirds of package tour sales.
Further intervention
This year has seen a further intervention by Mr Heseltine over the Arran bus
case. The OFT was investigating claims that a company with a fleet of two
buses was attempting to drive a much larger competitor off the island of
Arran by running services at a loss. Mr Heseltine instructed Sir Bryan to
call off the enquiry as the size of the case did not justify the costs and
burden. Whether this was true is debatable: with the market worth almost
Pounds 300,000 a year, the investigation could have been cost-effective. In
any case, most bus competition cases involve small local markets where
established operators attempt to drive off new entrants, often by predatory
pricing. The decision appeared to legitimise such practices.
Many businesses would welcome a relaxation in competition policy because it
confers freedom to profit richly if not fairly in the UK market, enabling a
company to take bigger risks overseas. But the idea that the UK can build
strong international businesses by protecting them in the home market is a
chimera. Companies that have grown flabby in the UK because they have not
felt threatened by competitors breathing down their necks are unlikely to
succeed in the more demanding world of global markets.

Alarm bells are sounding at The Independent as the move to Mirror Group
Newspapers' Canary Wharf Tower approaches. Tucked away in a job description
questionnaire being circulated to Indy staff is a query about whether the
person filling in the form is sitting at their own desk.
The question is not as innocent as it sounds. The Indy has around 370 staff,
and the word is that there is only room for around 320 desks in the paper's
new premises. Apparently, Mirror chief executive David Montgomery is a great
believer in the 'hot desk' theory where staff find their desks on a first
come, first served basis.
It's said to be a good way of insuring that they turn up on time.

Observer has to confess, without a trace of sycophancy of course, that it is

The nomination by Bill Clinton of Judge Stephen Breyer from Massachusetts to
the Supreme Court extends the connection into the highest US bench,
something that Rupert Murdoch certainly cannot boast
For Judge Breyer was married in 1969 to the former Joanna Hare, which makes
him the brother-in-law of Viscount Blakenham, the current Pearson chairman,
and nephew-in-law of the Hon Alan Hare, ex-chairman of the FT. In a story we
could never use last summer, because Breyer lost out to Ruth Bader Ginsburg

remained discreet. 'He likes a spot of good claret,' one of them said, in
itself a pretty fair recommendation for the world's most famous judicial

The Bank of China is not alone in upsetting people with its bank notes. The
Bank of England has also put a few noses out of joint during the 300 years
it has been printing the country's money, judging by Derrick Byatt's new
book - Promises to Pay.
Getting the Queen's picture right seems to have been particularly tricky.
Professor Robert Austin was taken to task in the 1950s by Lord O'Brien, then
chief cashier, for giving the Queen too much hair, too full a chest, a
pinched chin and a left eye which did not seem to be looking in the correct
direction. Another of Austin's designs was dismissed by Harold Wilson as
'more like a ticket on a detergent (gift) voucher' than a bank note.
Worried by the criticism, the Bank invited Sir Anthony Blunt to join its
informal design panel only to find some years on that Blunt was a Russian
spy.

Blackpool without its tower, given that Jardine properties dominate the Hong
Kong skyline.
Li Ka-shing, a friend of China, gets a plug through his HIT Terminal

despite the fact that the Bank of China HQ is next to a raft of Jardine
buildings, the pictures ignore them.
Jardine is not one of China's favourites. It is shifting its domicile to
Bermuda, before the Chinese arrive, and is a big fan of Governor Chris
Patten. Do the new bank notes carry a first hint of revenge?

FT  16 MAY 94 / Another plunge into the red: With Lloyd's due to unveil
further losses tomorrow, Richard Lapper examines the market's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is going through what its iconoclastic deputy chairman, Mr
Robert Hiscox, refers to as its annual 'mid-year wobble'.
For the fourth spring in succession the insurance market's future has been
brought into question by the prospect of another devastating loss for
hard-pressed Names, the individuals whose personal assets have traditionally
supported the market. The forecast Pounds 2.5bn loss for 1991, which Lloyd's
will report tomorrow in line with its system of reporting three years in
arrears, would bring the cumulative loss since 1988 to more than Pounds 8bn.
The 1991 loss is substantially greater than predicted by Lloyd's last year
and is the latest in a number of blows to hit the market in the past six
months which together make Mr Hiscox's 'wobble' sound like an
understatement:
In February, Names seeking compensation for losses of some Pounds 3bn
rejected an out-of-court settlement worth Pounds 900m which had been
negotiated under Lloyd's auspices. Their decision set the scene for a
succession of court cases. The first and biggest of the current round is
being fought by 3,095 Names belonging to Gooda Walker syndicates, one of the
worst performing business at Lloyd's in the late 1980s. Two separate reports
have suggested that Lloyd's exposure to multi-billion-dollar asbestos and
pollution claims in the US will far exceed the insurance market's reserves.
The latest report, published last month by US lawyer Mr Randolph Fields,
indicated the market faced a shortfall of at least Pounds 11bn, although the
cost would be spread over many years. It also suggested that plans to form a
reinsurance company into which Lloyd's aims to transfer most of these
historic liabilities would be frustrated by difficulties in finding
sufficient capital for its launch.
Critics have recently claimed that the 1991 loss may impair Lloyd's ability
to pass the 'solvency' test set by the Department of Trade and Industry each
August in which the assets of Names are matched against outstanding
liabilities.
If Names are found to have liabilities exceeding their assets, Lloyd's has
to earmark money from its Pounds 1bn Central Fund, which meets claims when
Names are unable to fulfil their obligations. But last month Lloyd's annual
report showed that more than two-thirds of its fund was already set aside
for such purposes, raising the spectre of the market having to call for even
more money from Names to replenish the fund.
The setbacks appear marked since they follow a period of optimism over the
winter. Following management changes over the past two years, Lloyd's was
able to persuade the City to provide Pounds 800m of limited-liability
corporate capital - for the first time in its 300-year history. That
success, however, has persuaded many of Lloyd's top managers that the latest
gloom is being overdone. 'It is so easy to attack us. So easy to wound the
great elephant,' says Mr Hiscox.
Lloyd's is confident its plans to form the reinsurance company will be
implemented: some underwriters acknowledge in private that many US pollution
claims will be settled at less than their full face value, so avoiding legal
costs for both sides. Negotiations may reduce some pay-outs to as little as
five cents in the dollar - particularly if policy holders decide Lloyd's
difficulties mean that is the best they can realistically expect.
Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, is also optimistic that
negotiations might re-open between Names and agents over possible
out-of-court settlements later this year. Above all Lloyd's is confident
that it can survive its more immediate pressures on solvency by stepping up
efforts to collect debts from Names and by borrowing against profits
expected in 1994.
Insurance rates increased sharply in 1993 and Lloyd's believes both that
year and this year will be profitable. Last year Names were allowed to
borrow against their projected 1993 profits to meet part of their
liabilities. Last week Lloyd's announced these 'exceptional measures' would
also apply in 1994.
Lloyd's is also moving to soften the impact of the 1991 losses by
eliminating so-called 'double counting'. This happens when Names that have
made losses in turn claim on their 'stop loss' policies (which provide cover
for losses over pre-set limits), 'errors and omissions' policies (which give
cover if agents are successfully sued for negligence) or 'estate protection
policies' (which cover the losses of deceased Names).
Even so the 1991 loss is expected to force many Names out of the market.
Members' agents, who allocate Names to syndicates, forecast the capacity
(the amount of business that can be underwritten) available from Names - as
opposed to the new corporate members - will fall sharply in 1995, possibly
to about Pounds 7.5bn compared to the current Pounds 9.3bn.
Though corporate investors could make up part of the shortfall, most
observers believe that the total amount of capital will decline next year.
'There just isn't the institutional demand out there at present,' notes one
agency chief executive.
At the same time, reforms planned by Lloyd's could aggravate the market's
difficulties over the next year or two. Changes to Lloyd's rulebook could
mean many syndicates have to seek more capital simply to underwrite the same
amount of business. Earlier this month the Lloyd's council indicated that
during 1995 and 1996 it intended to introduce a system of 'risk weighting'
which would link the amount of capital required by a syndicate manager to
the riskiness of the underlying business. For instance, syndicates
underwriting motor business would need less capital, those underwriting
catastrophe reinsurance more.
The consequence of the scarcity of capital is likely to be a more rapid
restructuring of the market. The number of syndicates has already fallen
from 401 in 1990 to 179 this year and further rationalisation seems
inevitable. The main casualties are expected to be the smaller and less
successful syndicates and agents.
Already there are indications that larger managing agents are using their
greater influence to secure as much capital as possible for their own
syndicates - at the expense of smaller operators.
The restructuring is not just about the number of syndicates and agents
operating at Lloyds: it is also about the way the market works and how it
raises capital. Many large agents, who have been among the quickest to
introduce new technology and improve their management standards, are now
seeking closer links with corporate investors.
Some agents are moving towards setting up 'dedicated' investment funds which
will channel capital into just one agent's businesses rather than, as now, a
spread of different agents and syndicates. By doing so, they are creating a
framework for embryonic 'insurance companies' operating within Lloyd's rules
but with greater long-term stability than existing syndicates.
'Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland (Lloyd's chairman) have unleashed a process of
change which is accelerating like a turbocharger,' says one leading
underwriter.
Mr George Stevens, managing director of Brockbank, one of the biggest agents
at Lloyd's, predicts that the market will be dominated by between six and 10
corporate syndicates before the end of the century.
Such upheavals may ensure the long-term survival of Lloyd's and its
businesses, notwithstanding the latest 'wobble'. But the market that emerges
when 1993's expected profits are reported in two years, will be radically
different from the one that slid into loss in 1988. Names, trading on the
traditional basis of unlimited liability, are likely to play an increasingly
marginal role.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Marketing power of electronic cash
cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GILES KEATING and Mr SEAN SHEPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report ('EU curbs urged on cash card issuers', May 11) that the
European Monetary Institute recommends legislation to give banks a monopoly
in the issuance of electronic cards used as a substitute for cash. At first
sight this seems appropriate. These are pre-paid cards so the issuers, like
banks, will hold deposits from the general public. This suggests they should
be supervised in the same way as banks. But it is essential that new
entrants be encouraged, to create competition and speed up innovation.
However, much bigger issues are at stake. Electronic cash cards will, within
a few years, offer issuers immense power over information about spending
patterns of different types of consumer. This information will be highly
valuable in marketing and in product development. Who will own it?
The cards may also in future allow currently unheard-of opportunities to
boost profits by discriminating among different groups of consumers, for
example by offering discounts for customer loyalty, or lower prices to
people on low-incomes. Who will control access to the necessary data?
Even more intriguing, as electronic transactions become almost universal,
the technical question of international compatibility of cash cards will
become an issue of sovereignty. If the pound remains outside the single
currency, will the British government allow residents, as well as visitors,
to use cards loaded with Ecus in stores throughout the UK? Will French
residents be able to use cards loaded with US dollars everywhere in Paris?
If yes, smaller currencies, at least if they have any hint of instability,
will rapidly disappear almost completely. This is currency competition, as
envisaged by the UK's Treasury in its response to the Delors report,
something that was impractical in the old days of notes and coins.
Governments will be tempted to prevent this by keeping their retail systems
incompatible with others, a type of electronic protectionism.
The EMI's apparently innocuous recommendation has far-reaching commercial
and political implications. It should be be subject of the widest possible
debate.

Sir, David Goodhart's article, 'Pay deals analyses differ on growth' (May
9), makes much of the 'differing analyses' of trends in pay settlements
recently published by Incomes Data Services and Industrial Relations
Services.
A closer look at the two sets of data would have revealed a crucial
difference - namely, that they cover different time periods.
While the IRS figures cover the three months to March, the IDS analysis
focuses particularly on settlements in April, one of the key months for pay
reviews.
When data is available for the same time period from both organisations, we
have little doubt that the results will show a similar picture.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Inflating its ego again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BOB EDWARDS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Diane Summers reports 'Saatchi raps 'sloppy' advertising industry' (May
11), in particular the blandness and misconception of most global
advertising campaigns. This would be valued criticism were it not for the
fact that Saatchi and Saatchi was itself the arch proponent of the global
'one brand one campaign' movement throughout the 1980s. If Maurice Saatchi
really wants to speak in 'simple universally recognised truths', he could
start by acknowledging this error of judgment.
Another part of his speech suggests that advertisers seeking these truths
may yet be hard pushed to discover them. Mr Saatchi bemoans the fact that
advertising is no longer seen as 'part of that virtuous circle, in which the
gift that advertising bestows - a premium price - is asked to provide funds
to re-invest in superior product quality, innovation, product development. .
.'
This is the advertising industry inflating its ego again. The truth is
advertising should reflect company philosophy, not be a substitute for it.
For example, financial services spent nearly Pounds 1bn on advertising over
five years in the 1980s. These advertisers and their agencies conspired to
substitute 'sexy' advertising for basic improvements in service, clarity and
value. They failed. Belatedly, financial institutions are looking to their
product and their service first.
Advertising is simply a communication tool (often a blunt one at that) and
one of a number available to advertisers. The sooner the industry recognises
that the better. Bob Edwards,

FT  16 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Swedish stock futures already a
significant market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID COURTNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with some interest of the Sydney Futures Exchange's plans to
launch individual stock futures on May 16 ('Sydney to trade share futures',
May 12), but was rather dismayed that the existing market for Swedish stock
futures was not given the credit it deserves.
Stock futures have been listed on both OMLX, the London Securities and
Derivatives Exchange and OM Stockholm for several years. At present, a total
of 23 Swedish companies has stock futures available on them and it is our
intention to launch further contracts in due course. As such, this can
hardly be described as a 'handful'.
I would also like to point out that volumes are rising at an exponential
rate. The year-on-year increase to the end of April was some 238 per cent
with almost 90,000 contracts traded.
I would also like to point out that, with a total volume of 23.3m contracts,
the total volume of Swedish derivatives traded last year exceeded that of
the Sydney Futures Exchange by 1.75m contracts, thus making it a significant
market in outright and comparative terms.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Market v state in education: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American parents are voting with their children's feet. Despairing at the
quality of public (government-run) schools and either unable or unwilling to
pay for private tuition, many now prefer to teach their children at home.
Nearly 500,000 children - 1 per cent of the school-age population - are
taught at the kitchen table compared with only about 15,000 in the early
1980s.
The 'home-schooling' fad in the US is an extreme example of a global trend:
parents in most industrial countries are demanding a greater say in how
their children are educated. In the past only a minority of wealthy parents
actively sought the best schools (often private) for their children. Most
families were passive consumers of education, allowing local educational
authorities or school districts to assign their children to a school,
usually the nearest. On matters of curriculum, teaching methods, discipline
and so forth, parents typically deferred to the superior wisdom of
educational 'experts.'
This age of educational deference is now passing, as Schools: a Matter of
Choice, a report by Mr Donald Hirsch of the Paris-based Organisation for
Economic Development and Co-operation makes abundantly clear. He examines
six countries - the US, England, Sweden, the Netherlands, Australia and New
Zealand - and finds that, to different degrees, all are experimenting with
policies to expand parental choice, enhance the range of educational options
and devolve power to school principals.
Some countries - such as Sweden - have increased choice by offering
substantial subsidies (85 per cent of the cost of education in the public
system) to parents who select private schools. Others, such as England, have
opted to expand choice within the public sector by allowing open enrolment
and through financial rules allowing money to follow pupils. In the US,
school districts have widened parents' options by supply-side measures: the
deliberate creation of 'magnet' schools - schools that offer specialised
education by concentrating on, say, science or the performing arts.
Teachers will find much to admire in Mr Hirsch's report, which exploits the
OECD's unique ability to make cross-country comparisons. He illustrates the
global pressure for greater choice with 16 'case studies' that describe
reforms on the ground in cities as diverse as Haarlem in the Netherlands,
Whangarei in New Zealand and Milwaukee in the US. And he seasons the factual
analysis with a thoughtful commentary on the theory behind greater
competition in education.
To my mind, however, the tone of the report is disturbingly collectivist. He
argues that parental choice may not lead to greater educational pluralism
because schools 'may compete to deliver the same thing'. He claims that
research cannot demonstrate that choice raises educational quality because
the effects of other relevant differences between schools cannot be
separated out (on this criterion no economic research would reach a
conclusion). And he gives credence to educationalists' self-serving claims
that parental choice can inhibit their ability to set priorities. In
typically wishy-washy OECD style, he concludes it is beyond the report's
scope to decide 'whether greater choice of school is a good or a bad thing'.
Well, this reader can decide. Greater choice of school is indisputably a
good thing. To bring home the absurdity of the traditional restrictions,
imagine that the same policies were adopted for other educational media such
as books.
Suppose, with the exception of a small 'private' sector for the rich, all
books were produced by teams of government employees and supplied free of
charge to grateful families. By analogy with public schooling suppose
further that each family was allocated only the books produced by
bureaucrats in its local 'book authority' or 'book district'. Under such a
system books would surely be of uniformly low quality, although the bindings
might be fancier in richer areas.
Now imagine that a bold educational reform is proposed: book choice. Instead
of being forced to read the books produced by their local book authority,
families can choose books from any book authority. Moreover, since reformers
also stipulate that 'money follows books', the revenue earned by each book
authority now depends on the number of books it 'sells'.
Families will obviously benefit from this expansion of choice (which
corresponds roughly to the enhanced choice of school now allowed in
England.) But sceptics such as Mr Hirsch may well claim that it cannot be
proved statistically that average book quality has risen. They will worry
that middle-class families are taking more advantage of the increased choice
than poor families. And they may complain that since all the book
authorities are competing to provide the same types of books, the extension
of choice is illusory.
In a sense the objections are valid. Since with the exception of the small
private sector all books would still be produced by teams of government
employees, the range of choice would be limited. Yet we all know the
solution: liberalise the book market completely. Let anybody write a book.
Let book sales be determined by public demand. If some poor families cannot
afford books, then give them book vouchers or cash subsidies. Do not make
the mistake of thinking that since everybody ought to read books, the
government should seize control of 95 per cent of book production.
I do not claim there is an exact analogy between books and schools as
educational vehicles, but it is close enough to demolish arguments against
greater choice in education.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unworthy view of Labour position on
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JOYCE QUIN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your negative editorial 'Labour after John Smith' (May 13) is unworthy of a
serious newspaper. Your question, 'Who can say today where Labour stands on
any important aspect of the development of the European Union', shows also
an arrogant ignorance. At its conference last year Labour adopted a detailed
statement on Europe, Prosperity through Co-operation. Subsequently, Labour's
Treasury team made a detailed submission to the Delors consultation entitled
Economic Renewal in Europe. There have also been papers produced on European
employment and environment policies and in many other areas. The European
dimension is now fully built into the range of our domestic policies.
I find it deeply depressing that a serious political commentator can dismiss
this evidence so lightly or, even worse, can apparently remain in total
ignorance of it.

Labour frontbench spokesperson on European Affairs,

FT  16 MAY 94 / Arts: The Kirov Opera - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The energy of the Kirov Opera under the artistic directorship of Valery
Gergiev seems to know no bounds. Plans for the link-up with the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra show it venturing beyond the concert performances of
Russian operas that one thought to be its limit to Wagner, Mahler and
Berlioz in 1995.
This year the operas of Rimsky-Korsakov are the Kirov's focus of attention,
although that does not mean any less effort and activity. In June the
company has the 'White Nights' Festival in St Petersburg. In July it is
visiting the Mikkeli Festival in Finland and Istanbul. By late autumn it has
reached Paris, where the Theatre des Champs-Elysees is presenting four
operas, including Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko and The Legend of the Invisible
City of Kitezh. Do Gergiev and his team never tire?
Friday's concert at the Barbican offered a foretaste of Kitezh. This was the
second in the RPO/Kirov series (following their success with Tchaikovsky's
Iolanta) and suggested that Gergiev and the orchestra have formed a good
working relationship. A suite from the opera featured some delicately
atmospheric sonorities and playing so quiet that it could have been Simon
Rattle holding the baton. Rumours of minimal rehearsal time were not
obviously borne out.
Just as one can expect fairies tripping through Mendelssohn's music, so
Rimsky-Korsakov invariably wallows in the high romance of fairy-tale. Give
him a stage direction that calls for a snowstorm swirling around a castle in
a magic kingdom and Rimsky-Korsakov will respond with mysterious divided
strings and harps sweeping up and down glissandos.
That is the opening tableau of his one-act opera Kashchey the Immortal. Its
story of a captive princess rescued from the clutches of an ogre with
supernatural powers is typical Russian folk-tale, for which the composer
mixed a blend of his usual luscious orchestral colours with a distinct
Wagnerian tint (especially the Walkure storm). This was said to be the first
UK performance of the opera and Gergiev made it a vivid one.
Whenever singers from the Kirov appear, there is one who makes a big impact.
This time it was Larissa Diadkova, who delivered the goods in no uncertain
fashion as Kashcheyevna, the Kundry-like figure who lures knights to their
doom on her enchanted island; her Slavic mezzo has a bite and force with
which one would not like to argue. The soprano Marina Shaguch sang a nicely
wicked Lullaby as the princess who wishes everlasting sleep upon her captor.
Konstantin Pluzhnikov was the Mime-like Kashchey, supported by Alexander
Gergalov and Vladimir Ognovenko, the baritone and firm bass. The London
Choral Society doubled for the Kirov Chorus - an uneviable task.

<TEXT>
Benny Hill was one of the earliest British casualties of political
correctness. Though his popularity with the general public never waned, he
was banished from British television by the feminists. They sought brownie
points at smart London parties by having fits of the vapours over Hill's
'sexism'. The fact that his comedy was in direct line of descent from
Chaucer and Shakespeare, and that 90 per cent of the audience loved it, was
ignored. Yet ironically he became, simultaneously, a huge success in the US
despite the greater prevalence of feminism there. Benny Hill - Unseen
comprises material produced abroad, late in his life, and not previously
screened here (8.00 ITV). Horizon tells how Barry Marshall happened upon the
real cause of most stomach ulcers but has had an uphill job persuading the
stick-in-the-muds of medicine to abandon their 'stress' diagnosis (8.00
BBC2). The BBC says that today's Panorama will be the one about shenanigans
on Westminster council which was supposed to have been shown just before the
recent local elections (9.30 BBC1).

FT  16 MAY 94 / Arts: La vera storia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a rainy Saturday, Luciano Berio's opera La vera storia crowned the South
Bank's festival of his music magnificently - perhaps even beyond the
expectations of the festival-planners and the BBC, who put this concert
version on.
Premiered at La Scala in 1982 but new to Britain, La vera storia was here
'semi-staged' by Tim Hopkins, as tidily as could be managed on a stage
crowded with Berio's very large orchestra.
Berio's dramatic plan for Act 1 involves only bare archetypes on the 19th
century Italian model: as exemplified by the four principals of Verdi's Il
trovatore - their operatic voice-types, their standard roles, sentiments and
fraught relations ' and by his lusty crowd-choruses. There is no story (true
or otherwise), just a second-order 'story' about what those musical stories
were like and what they meant. So far, so Italo Calvino, who indeed wrote
the libretto.
He and Berio discussed ideas for the opera in 1977, and soon he supplied the
words, first for the archetypal chorus in its many moods, jocularly
unbuttoned or feral or political, and then for the soloists, stereotypical
too but more elevated. At that point Calvino apparently withdrew to let
Berio develop his own plan for Act 2. It recycles the music and most of the
first-act words, with some re-ordering and reassignment to different voices,
for a more immediate drama: an urban nightmare of modern authoritarianism,
with the 1969 Milan scandal about the death-in-custody of the anarchist
Pinelli at its polemical heart.
Berio conducted the BBC Symphony with many extra players, its full-time
singers, its part-time chorus and various electronics chaps, to hugely
assured effect. In Act 1, which proceeds in block-like distinct numbers, the
chorus shone in theirs, as did the peripatetic brass band. For some of the
excellent soloists, the onslaught of Berio's exposed, brass-heavy orchestra
(designed for quarantine in an opera-pit) was daunting ' but not for
Felicity Palmer's 'Azucena' archetype: indomitably eloquent, and superbly
forceful in tragedy-vein.
Still less Milva's stentorian ballad-singer, intruding brassily wry,
down-to-earth songs amid the idealised operatic routine of Act 1 (vide
Zerbinetta in Strauss's Ariadne,and Brecht passim). Berio intended the
successive ballads for various voices, but since Milva can deliver every one
to perfection she sang them all. Between them, Milva and Miss Palmer claimed
Berio's most intimately characterful vocal lines, inspired by the accents of
southern Italian folk song.
In Act 2, where the orchestral weight is more fluently lightened, all the
other soloists (Sue Patchell, Luisa Castellani, Michael Myers, David
Wilson-Johnson, Jeremy White and Peter Hall) came into their own, as did
Berio's jazzy clarinet and saxophone. If the semi-staging left the implied
action vague, the music rendered it cruel and clear - but visionary too.
Though at the very least La vera storia is agit-prop of a high order, all
its best music transcends that. A full staging at Covent Garden or the ENO
would be an exciting prospect.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Arts: Architecture as an art - Colin Amery signs off from
this page
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is architecture art? It is a fair question, since this is my last Monday
column for the FT on the Arts page - although I shall still be writing for
the FT and still on a Monday.
Once upon a time, especially around the last turn of the century, it was
commonplace to talk of architecture as 'the mother of the arts'. Today the
debate about architecture has become the mother and father of all debates,
but whether or not it is an informed debate about artistic virtues is highly
questionable.
Even the secretary of state for the environment joined the militant tendency
of architect haters last week by describing many of them as 'arrogant
creators of brutal and alienating buildings'. Of course Mr Gummer is not
wrong; but he should be aware that in the last decade things have improved
considerably.
There is greater public awareness of architecture, brought about by a
reaction to both the brutal horrors of the 1960s and the boom follies of the
1980s. There is more informed interest in conservation - witness more than
two million members of the National Trust, a lively conservationist
television programme (BBC 1, One Foot in the Past), and the growth of
'historic home' magazines.
At the commissioning level, there is much more concern about hiring good
architects, which in turn has lead to more competitions, as developers
realise that good buildings are good business.
During the period I have been writing on this page, I have been lucky enough
to sit on many juries and competition adjudications and have been involved
with a range of new buildings that all demonstrate architecture as an art,
and never as just a hand maiden of nihilist modernist propagandists.
The Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery in London by Robert Venturi and
Denise Scott-Brown succeeds in being a complex work of art in itself while
never overwhelming the paintings. The Supreme Court in Jerusalem designed by
the Karmi brother and sister team is a unique example of a late 20th century
monumental building that is timeless in its relationship to its environment,
in this case the sensitive stones of the Holy City. At the Tate Gallery at
St Ives, Cornwall, Eldred Evans and David Shalev produced a building of such
pristine clarity and form that it gleams as a work of art almost more
brightly than some of the collections it displays. It was an excess of
talent which divided the jury of that competition.
The debates and discussions that took place during the selection of
architects for these three buildings was always at a highly intense level.
Client bodies and benefactors for buildings of this calibre should never be
under-estimated: they show great concern and, in some competitions, are
frustrated by the lack of an adequate creative response from architects.
What has become increasingly clear, is the need for architects to bring
practicality and art together. This is not such an Herculean task if
architects are prepared to take the client on board as they move from
concept to detail. Clients often know far more about the way they want their
buildings to work than the architects - and there is such a thing as
creative collaboration.
There were some happy signs in last week's Sunday Times/Royal Fine Art
Commission Architecture Awards that commerce and industry have, despite the
recession, completed some innovative and worthwhile new buildings.
The Building of the Year 1994 went to the Cable and Wireless College in
Coventry, designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. Cable and Wireless has
shown itself to be a brave patron. For its refurbished London office,
sculptor William Pye was commissioned to design a brilliant water feature.
In Coventry, its training school for advance communication technology does
not adopt the obvious architectural language of 'high-tech'; it is much more
low tech, almost vernacular, with its sweeping roofs and lattice of glazing.
Commerce triumphed, too, with a dazzling new Sainsbury store at Canley, also
near Coventry, an elegant glass and steel pavilion designed by Lifschutz
Davidson.
Both Sainsbury and Cable and Wireless are major companies that see the real
value of good design. These two new buildings are worthy prize winners
because they bring art to life. That must be the role of good architecture.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Arts: Kunsten Festival des Arts - Alastair Macaulay welcomes
an important new theatrical event
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brussels, centre of the European Union, has a new international arts
festival - the Belgian Kunsten Festival des Arts. Britain, the most
notoriously Eurosceptical of EU nations, is not represented.
The festival, which runs throughout May, has offerings from France, Germany,
Italy, Holland, and Belgium; from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Africa,
and from the US, but nothing from Britain - which places it in the company
of Luxembourg, Denmark, Austria, Spain, and Greece. What does this say about
Britain's artistic standing in Europe?
The emphasis of this first Belgian festival (others are likely to follow in
later years) is on progressive theatre. The few dance offerings consist of
modern dance (including a world premiere from Merce Cunningham, on May 18).
No ballet, no opera, no Shakespeare. Is it not odd that Brussels, possibly
the world's most bourgeois city, should house so new-wave a festival in no
less than 17 auditoria? Odd to a Brit, maybe. But 'epater les bourgeois' has
so long been a motto of much continental European art that one should hardly
be surprised. Particularly in European theatre, tradition is seldom
considered a virtue.
Stanislas Nordey, the 28-year-old director of the Compagnie Nordey, has not
only staged Pasolini's long play Pylade, he also prefaces it with Iannis
Rissos's short soliloquy Chrysothemis. And he begins his show with the
actors sitting at a table in front of the raised stage, facing us, like
speakers on a panel.
Both Pylade and Chrysothemis are rampantly revisionist. They focus on
characters who in Greek literature were never more than also-rans: Pylades,
the loyal friend of Orestes, and Chrysothemis, the timid sister of Orestes
and Electra. Nordey has the soliloquy Chrysothemis spoken by another of the
panel-speakers, but, as she develops her monologue, she rises through a
series of statuesque positions, until her feet are planted on the table.
Pylade, which follows, gradually opens up the whole stage area. This, an
altogether more serious and political re-telling of legend, begins just
where Aeschylus's Oresteia end. The court in which Athena has freed Orestes
from the charges of the Furies was the beginning of rule by law rather than
religion; and Orestes replaced tyranny with the first democracy. Here -
echoing or pre-echoing post-revolutionary France and Russia - there is
intense debate about the role of religion and the nature of government.
Electra proves to be a nostalgic reactionary; Pylades is conservative enough
to call for religion and a return to pre-civilised values.
So far Pylade has been interesting but laboured. When Pylade takes his
ideals into exile, the play remains highly symbolic, but becomes more fully
a play; his journey reminds one at times of Shakespearian heroes - Henry VI,
Hamlet, even Lear. And it is now that Nordey's direction starts to flower,
and to reveal the physicality for which the advance blurb celebrates him.
The actress playing the Furies has a marvellously incessant, restless, tread
on the spot, while - caught in a blaze of side-lighting - she holds her arms
in a single huge martial gesture and inflames Pylade with her rhetoric about
removing the barriers between high and low. Just as memorable is the tall
male Athena, a figure of justice who becomes more bizarre, indeed camp, with
each appearance, until he/she is virtually unrecognisable.
Nordey's production is a long epic - four and a half hours - but despite its
frequent post-modern self-awareness it has a cumulative power, and becomes a
serious exemplum of the Theatre de Parole championed by Pasolini ('Theatre
of Dialectic'). The title role and most other parts are played with great
dignity and humanity.
In utter contrast, but also commenting ironically on the legacy of the past,
is Murx .., from the Volksbuhne in Berlin, directed by the Swiss Christoph
Marthaler. Eleven people sit in a huge dilapidated hall without
communicating, like inmates in an institution. They have their fatuous
routines - tea, cake, washing - and each person, though stunted in some way,
is a highly individual character, pathetic and funny. The one routine that
transforms them is singing; and their songs  - whether folk, popular, or
national anthems - are all highly German.
Singing, these disparate Germans suddenly co-operate, sometimes in elaborate
harmony. They are so foolish as individuals that it seems to be sheer
accident that, the more nationalist their music, the more harmonious they
become. Marthaler paces all this so well that the central meaning of the
piece - the disturbing power of nationalism and anthems to galvanise people
who usually are silly incompetents - never clobbers you. Superb performances
by all.
These two are large productions, and have launched the festival
impressively. There are other, much more intimate stagings.
I will report later in May on further offerings of this festival. It is not
only patriotism that makes me wish some British theatre was included. Yet,
since three of the four events I watched in May 1-2 were so interesting,
this Brit can only commend the festival's start and look forward to more.
The Kunsten Festival des Arts, Brussels, continues until June 5

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Airport shoppers are to be courted even more aggressively by the British
Airports Authority, in its effort to turn the time that travellers spend at
airports into revenues for BAA.
For travellers in two minds over making impulse purchases, BAA has announced
a Worldwide Guarantee scheme. This offers 'no quibble' refunds on products
bought at any of BAA's seven UK airports, whether they are faulty or simply
unwanted.
Advice on how to spend money and fill shopping time will also be available
from help desks at all BAA airport terminals. And for the forward planner,
BAA has introduced a Freephone shopping line (0800 844844) to allow
travellers to check on items in stock and reserve or order goods.
A freepost address for the Worldwide Guarantee, and postage refunds to users
outside the UK, will give travellers 'the confidence to buy goods in the
knowledge that if they are not satisfied for any reason they will get their
money back, no questions asked', according to Sir John Egan, BAA's chief
executive.
And why is BAA so keen to win shoppers' confidence - even at the price of
making refunds later?
'The money we make from people shopping at the airports is ploughed back
into providing new facilities for all our customers,' says Sir John. 'This
means that passengers win both ways.'
As so, presumably, does BAA.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Swissair ahead - confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who has ever been bumped from a confirmed homebound flight will cheer
the news that Swissair is abolishing the annoying requirement to reconfirm
return flights from June 1. The alleged purpose of reconfirmation is to give
the airline a destination contact number so it can warn passengers of a
substantial delay or cancellation of the return flight, although it has
never been clear why the absence of such a number should entitle the airline
to cancel a confirmed booking.
Swissair said it already kept in its reservation system a home contact
number for its passengers and often the name of the destination hotel. From
now on, it would start asking for a destination contact number when bookings
were made so reconfirmation would no longer be necessary.
Was the airline worried about 'no-shows'?
'We always worry about no-shows,' a spokesman said. But he doubted that the
problem would worsen as a result of the abolition of reconfirmation.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Push for punctuality - Delays at UK
airports are being reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airport delays are to business travellers what traffic jams are to city
drivers: infuriating, unpredictable, but inevitable.
No more, says Britain's National Air Traffic Service, the body responsible
for organising UK air traffic control.
With an announcement due from the government on whether the service will be
privatised, NATS has become aggressively consumer-oriented. It is
reorganising flight paths, introducing more flexible take-off and landing
procedures, and upgrading technology - all in a concerted effort to
eliminate hold-ups.
In a programme that began in early 1993, NATS has cut average delays on
scheduled flights from Heathrow to nine minutes last year, from 20 minutes
in 1989. The average delay on morning commuter flights from UK domestic
airports was 3.8 minutes last summer, down from 20 minutes in the summer of
1992. Delays on chartered flights have also been reduced.
The service now looks on its past indifference to delays with disdain.
'There was a problem in our attitude before,' says Mr Derek McLauchlan, NATS
chief executive, 'in that we thought we knew what was possible and we were
satisfied with that. But following the management reorganisation of two
years ago, we took a more proactive stance, and found that many of the
problems were solvable.'
Many solutions have been simple. One problem was the early morning influx
into British airspace of some 400 transatlantic flights, which tended to
hold up departures from Glasgow, Belfast and Manchester. 'We instructed flow
managers to be more careful about transatlantic tracks, so as not to block
domestic take-offs, and delays were cut at a stroke,' says Mr McLauchlan.
In addition, a computer link from Canada is giving London Heathrow
controllers 4 1/2 hours' notice of transatlantic traffic into UK airspace,
making it easier to tailor routes.
Routing clashes caused by the limited number of air tracks, or flight paths,
are also being addressed. The Civil Aviation Authority, of which NATS is an
agency, is implementing a Pounds 750m investment programme to increase
airspace capacity over south-east England by 30 per cent from 1995, and
capacity for en route flights over England and Wales by 40 per cent from
1996.
However, airspace is only part of the problem. With the CAA forecasting a
doubling of air passengers in Europe between 1992 and 2005 - increasing
passenger flights by 55 per cent - airport infrastructure is also a
constraint.
The British Air Transport Association, representing UK airlines, argues that
take-off and landing slots are so fully booked that a new London runway is
essential.
However, NATS has been tackling the issue in a different way. Last year, it
introduced a free-flow system between Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle
airport, Paris. Normally, airlines must book slot times for their departure,
their air track and their arrival. Mismatches cause delays, which put
rescheduling pressure on the congested take-off and landing slot timetables.
Under the freeflow system, aircraft can leave whenever their departure slot
permits, without needing an air track slot.
As a result, British Airways reported a fall of 94 per cent in delays from
Paris to London, and of 47 per cent from Heathrow. Air France said delays
had been cut by 97 per cent from Paris and 98 per cent from London. Trials
have begun on other routes.
NATS is also investigating how Heathrow's two runways could be used more
efficiently.
If all goes well with its plans, the service's ingenuity will go unnoticed
this summer - as travellers pass through departure lounges without delay.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Setting sights high - Paul Betts on the
competitive strategy of British Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its latest ticket code-sharing and marketing agreement with Air Canada,
British Midland Airways, the UK's second largest scheduled carrier, is
extending its net of international co-operation agreements to compete
against its much bigger rival, British Airways.
The Air Canada move follows a string of other code-sharing deals - which
enable two airlines to use each other's ticketing code on each other's
flights, making arrangements simpler - and commercial agreements between
British Midland and bigger international carriers. These include the two
biggest US carriers, United Airlines and American Airlines, as well as Japan
Airlines and All Nippon Airways.
British Midland also co-operates with Virgin Atlantic and is planning a
code-sharing agreement with Malaysian Airlines later this year. 'We are also
working with South African Airways over possible co-operation,' says Mr
Austin Reed, the airline's managing director.
Although British Midland has steadily been expanding its own international
operations, Mr Reed emphasises that the airline is continuing to concentrate
on developing its European short-haul route network. 'Any plan to expand
into longer-haul flights are at this stage very much in the future,' he
adds.
The growing number of international marketing alliances are part of British
Midland's efforts to offer its passengers services comparable with those
offered by BA. British Midland's attraction for its international partners
is its strong position at London's Heathrow airport, where it has built up
the second biggest pool of take-off and landing slots - 14 per cent - after
BA, which has about 38 per cent.
British Midland's strong position at Heathrow was one of the main reasons
behind Scandinavian Airlines Systems' decision to buy a 35 per cent stake in
the UK carrier. SAS is expected to increase its holding to 40 per cent this
summer.
In Europe, British Midland has challenged the big flag carriers by taking
advantage of the newly liberalised air transport market and driving down
business-class air fares on five of the busiest routes it serves from
Heathrow: Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin, Brussels and Amsterdam. Sir Michael
Bishop, chairman, claims that, where his company has taken on the big
European airlines, business air fares have fallen by about 40 per cent.
The problem, he says, is that 95 per cent of European Union air routes
continue to be operated through state-owned airline monopolies or duopolies.
'Only 26 routes are served by more than three carriers. Of the 15 busiest
cross-border routes in Europe, 10 continue to be served only by the two
national airlines of the countries concerned.'
Real fare competition has occurred only on routes served by at least three
carriers. Where just two carriers serve a route, their tendency is to offer
similar frequencies, provide similar services and apply identical fare
structures.
Sir Michael is also a vociferous campaigner against state aid for airlines,
which he argues is continuing to help prop up bankrupt carriers, distorting
competition in the European market. 'A number of smaller airlines are going
bust, while the bigger companies which are really bust are being allowed to
carry on through artificial supports.'
British Midland, like other UK carriers including BA and Air UK, has
fulminated against French government proposals to inject a further FFr20bn
into Air France.
It is also angry over the French government's decision to try to stop UK
airlines flying today into Orly, Paris. But unlike BA or Air UK, British
Midland has decided not to seek an immediate confrontation with France.
Instead, it intends to start flying from Heathrow into Orly in September,
when it hopes the dust will have settled.
In the longer term, British Midland sees another threat emerging from the
Channel tunnel. 'We expect it will lead to a drop in some short-haul air
traffic,' Mr Reed says. British Midland is thus already drawing up plans to
serve longer-distance European routes which would not face direct
competition from the tunnel, to maintain the momentum of its steady
international expansion in the European market.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Business Travel: A trip abroad is no holiday - Many staff
feel entitled to keepperks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My recent article on this page asking whether business travellers should
give their frequent-flyer points and cash rebates to their employers ('A
partiality for perks', April 25) attracted the following riposte from a
reader in Suffolk. 'The fact that you have written the article at all is
evidence of the common view of those left behind at the office, that leaping
on to an aeroplane means that one is going on holiday.
'The serious business passenger is the victim of every inconvenience
afforded by airlines, datelines and civil disturbance. He or she should be
the beneficiary of any advantage, personally.'
The majority of respondents held this view. A business traveller from
Volkswagen said: 'Why should the company penalise travellers and take away
their little innocent pleasure of accumulating perks that they won't be able
to use anyway? Remember, when they are on vacation they want to stay at
home, not fly again.'
A reader from the Netherlands added: 'I hope you will also leave us with the
benefit of another perk - the copy of the FT we receive on board.'
However, one senior executive wrote: 'Imagine if BA said: 'Choose our
routing and flights for your next business travel purchase - even though
they are a bit more expensive than the competition - and we will give you
money in a brown envelope, addressed to your home.' Unarguably, a case of
significant bribery.
'Yet staff have no qualms about air miles. Travel agents will tell you that
executives will practically kill to gain air miles. Please don't attribute
any quotes to me. I am in a minority of one, it seems.'
Not quite. A substantial minority made the same point, adding that the
company should also receive any cash rebates paid to travellers. One
respondent wrote: 'Any time spent travelling is working time, paid for one
way or another as part of the contract of employment. If some of this time
is wasted and there is compensation to be had, then the compensation belongs
to the owner of the wasted time - the company.'
Mr Geoffrey Budd, company secretary of Dixons, the electrical retailer,
asked whether travellers who accepted frequent-flyer points or cash
compensation could experience legal difficulties. 'Where the employee is a
director, there is an obligation not to make a secret profit and therefore
he should account to the employer for all such benefits,' Mr Budd wrote.
'If, as a matter of corporate practice (whether articulated or adopted by
default), employees are allowed to retain these benefits, they are
presumably disclosable to the Inland Revenue and liable to income tax. This
may be less important so far as free flights are concerned, but could be
significant in relation to cash compensation.'

FT  16 MAY 94 / The Monday Interview: Branching away from the ranch - Ted
Waitt tells Katharine Campbell how he made Sioux City the Gateway to the
world's personal computer-users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the typically eccentric 'milestones' by which Gateway 2000 chooses to
chart its growth was July 1992, the month the gravel parking lot was paved.
Ted Waitt, 32, who created the world's ninth largest vendor of personal
computers from a farmhouse in Iowa nine years ago, cares deeply about such
things. 'The gravel symbolised our philosophy of keeping the cost of doing
business low, and not losing sight of our roots.' The rest of the staff,
with their mud-spattered cars, eventually won him over, but even then, a
colleague had to send in the engineers to explain why keeping his own space
unpaved would be a symbol too far.
Now the largest mail-order PC vendor in the US, Gateway sold Dollars 1.73bn
worth of IBM-compatibles in 1993, 56 per cent more than the previous year.
It claims to be leaner and meaner than its rivals, including Dell, the
industry pioneer of direct marketing.
Dispensing entirely with dealers and their mark-ups, Waitt assembles
machines using brand-name components, and addresses its computer-literate,
price-sensitive clientele through ads in specialist magazines. That works
even for sales to large corporations, at least those with decentralised
purchasing organisations. If the function is centralised 'you have to do a
lot of schmoozing. We don't schmooze much; it's expensive,' Waitt explains.
Convinced the formula would travel, Gateway established a subsidiary in
Dublin last October, from where it wants to service the rest of Europe.
Sales in the UK have gone better than expected, but the continent will be
far trickier. Waitt unveiled his French models at the beginning of this
month, and Germany is pencilled in before the end of the year. Rivals are
deeply sceptical that the relatively unfamiliar mail-order approach will
catch on.
But if it wasn't a high-wire act, Waitt wouldn't be having fun - which he
patently is. The antithesis of the computer nerd, his gifts are not those of
the technical visionary; his is basically a highly gifted sales and
marketing brain.
When forced to sit down, the nervous energy is challenged alternately into
fiddling with his lank pony tail and getting through the daily two packs of
Camels. No friend of the business suit, he made his mark in London a few
years back by showing up at a black tie ceremony in cowboy boots and a
string tie. Given his apparent restlessness, it comes as a slight surprise
that he has settled down to a wife - Joan is a real estate broker - and two
young kids.
Product of the boondocks of Sioux City - and proud of it - Waitt happily
admits he had always set out to make money, 'and, um, for whatever reason, I
was fairly convinced I would be successful at something'.
As the marketing literature for Gateway will not let you forget, the Waitts
have been in cattle for five generations, but Ted, it seems, was not exactly
encouraged aboard. Instead, he took himself off to the University of Iowa,
where he failed to stay the course in finance and marketing - 'college in
America doesn't prepare you for a whole lot of anything' - and went to work
as a salesman in a computer store in Des Moines.
Then, as now, no gizmo freak, he started off knowing nothing about PCs - but
nine months later was in business on his own. Mike Hammond, whom he met at
the store, provided the technical brains and his elder brother Norm -
trained in the family cattle business - the financial nous. Ted, meanwhile,
did what he does best - selling.
Ads have been a company trademark from the start. At first Waitt wrote his
own copy and the creative work is still done in-house - including that for
Europe. And of course he continues to star in the big parts in the ads: he
posed in pirate gear in the US; as King Arthur for the UK launch; as
Lafayette for the French. It is all intended to reinforce the company's
home-spun philosophy - which is also why the packaging is covered in
splashes of black and white - supposedly reminiscent of cowhides.
His taste for convertibles and jet-skis aside, Waitt claims he actually
doesn't like spending money. He certainly kept his hands off the cash as the
business grew. Started on Dollars 10,000 secured against Granny Waitt's
certificate of deposit, the company still makes much of its low gearing.
Gateway belonged solely to him and his brother until 15 per cent was floated
on Nasdaq last December.
Like a child who resists growing up, Waitt does not relish everything that
running a big company entails. Outside shareholders, he concedes, are indeed
'a bit of a nuisance, yes'. He also affects not to track the share price:
'It would drive me crazy'.
One can see his point. Launched at Dollars 15, it motored up to Dollars 24,
but was last week lingering only just above the low of Dollars 13.5. Even if
Gateway's net margin of 4.1 per cent is still one of the best in the
business, Wall Street disliked being surprised by the 1994 first quarter
earnings - down 2.7 per cent on a 12 month comparison. Waitt is only just
learning - reluctantly - to play the game. And his investor relations man,
Jim Wharton, who joined last autumn after having been mayor of Sioux City,
certainly followed an unusual path to the post.
Earnings were down partly because an unexpected change in 'bus' technology,
the process by which data is moved around within the PC, caught the company
on the hop. The problem illustrates the ever-present risk of being tripped
up by change in a business where minimal inventory is a crucial component of
cost minimisation.
The company was also eventually forced to allocate more resources to its
(free) customer support service when some other software companies began to
charge for after-sales assistance.
Waitt does not deny the difficulties. 'Six months ago, the time spent on
each call suddenly went up by about 50 per cent.' 'We are finding we are
giving DOS lessons over the phone - people stay on the line for four or five
hours, particularly at night.' Unhappy customers complain that at one point
last year their calls might not be returned until the following day.
Another thing Waitt has disliked, one suspects, has been the need gradually
to cede control to others. Bob Spears, managing director of the European
operation, observes that Waitt loves coming to Dublin. 'He likes to be
around a Gateway of just 200 people again.'
Founded a year before Gateway, Dell, which plunged into loss for the first
time in 1993, is further down the road to adulthood - and struggling. What
lessons does he draw?
'Dell is a very different company' begins Waitt, who himself could not be
more different from his earnest, terribly mature, but actually younger rival
Michael Dell. He believes that if you combine mail order with more
traditional selling - as Dell does - managing it becomes very complicated.
While Waitt thinks he has already achieved 'critical mass' sufficient to
survive among the big boys, there are hurdles aplenty ahead. Europe will
almost certainly prove tougher than he imagines, to begin with. At the same
time, Gateway's strength to date does lie in its marketing and distribution
formula; if margins are cut to the bone on PCs, Waitt could always shift to
mobile phones, or almost anything else.
So how can he prove Gateway is not just another a rocket chip, in the
jargon? Much fingering of the pony tail. 'That's the tough part,' he says.

FT  16 MAY 94 / People: Saenz poaches from BBV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After its takeover two weeks ago by Banco Santander, wits said that Banco
Espanol de Credito, Banesto, should more properly be called Banco
Santanderino de Credito and known as Bansanto, writes Tom Burns. But perhaps
it ought to be identified as Banco Vizcaino de Credito, Banvito; and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, the bank that was outbid in the auction, should simply
be referred to as Banco Bilbao.
The key to all the playing with name-tags is Alfredo Saenz, 52, chairman of
Banesto, former vice-president of BBV and former heir apparent to Banco
Vizcaya before the latter merged with Banco Bilbao in 1988. Saenz, an
acknowledged troubleshooter in the domestic banking business, was 'lent' by
BBV to rescue Banesto after the Bank of Spain's intervention at the end of
last year. Santander duly scooped Banesto and immediately asked Saenz to run
its prize.
Saenz not only accepted the offer but also persuaded eight colleagues to
leave BBV and join him on Banesto's management board. To a man, the
Saenz-picked team has an emphatical Vizcaya pedigree.
The most senior defector, after Saenz, is Banesto's new managing director,
Victor Manuel Menendez Millan, 53. He was Vizcaya's treasurer at the time of
the merger with Bilbao and went on to be a member of BBV's management board
with responsibility for information systems.
The Saenz-inspired stampede of Vizcaya managers into Banesto is likely
finally to pare BBV down to its Bilbao bone. Three years ago Francisco
Luzon, once Saenz's rival first at Vizcaya and then at BBV, became chairman
of Argentaria, and has since lured some 70 one-time Vizcaya employees away
from BBV to the state-controlled bank.

FT  16 MAY 94 / People: Rapid Path for Donovan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever flown in or out of New York and cursed the lack of any rapid transit
link between the city and its airports, asks Richard Tomkins. Then meet
someone who hopes to help put that right - Kathleen Donovan, the first woman
to chair the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The Port Authority is an odd institution. Apart from running the three main
airports - JFK, La Guardia and Newark - it operates the PATH rapid transit
system linking New Jersey and Manhattan, six interstate toll bridges and
tunnels, two bus terminals, a ferry service, the New York-New Jersey port,
three industrial parks and the World Trade Centre. It has annual revenues of
nearly Dollars 2bn, but as a self-governing public agency it is accountable
to neither electors nor shareholders.
Could things change under Donovan? An attorney, an active Republican and a
former New Jersey legislator, she was appointed to the board by New Jersey's
Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, for whom she campaigned in last
year's state elections. Given that context, you might think a touch of
privatisation could be on its way.
Donovan, however, is reluctant to be cast in the role of revolutionary. If
anything, she seems set to expand the authority's business empire further by
pressing ahead with plans for a rapid transit system linking JFK and La
Guardia airports with Manhattan. True, that will be expensive, she says:
'But then nearly everything the authority does is expensive.'
Still, Donovan, 42, does not rule out a growing role for the private sector.
The management of some of the authority's functions could be contracted out
even if the ownership does not change, she says. 'I am sure you are going to
see a lot more public and private sector partnerships.'

FT  16 MAY 94 / People: Chapman - poised to 'take on more' for Nomura
Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Max Chapman, the combative American who in the past four years has turned
Nomura Securities' sleepy and unprofitable US operation into an unlikely
Wall Street success story, was asked recently if he would stay with the
Japanese firm when his contract expired in September, writes Patrick
Harverson. He replied: 'At some point, Nomura will say to me: 'We would like
you to do something more.' Or I'll decide to do something else.'
Well, now it seems that Nomura has asked if Chapman would like to do
something more: namely, take over the additional task of running the firm's
London operation. And it looks as if the ambitious Chapman is ready to
accept the offer.
Although the details of his appointment as chairman of Nomura International
in London were still being worked out last week, an announcement is expected
within a few days. If he does take charge of London, and with it the rest of
Europe, it will be an acknowledgement both of Chapman's growing influence at
the world's largest securities house, and of the importance that Nomura
places on integrating its far-flung overseas operations into a unified
whole.
Like many securities houses with global pretensions, Nomura has discovered
that competition and rivalries between its separate foreign units has been
counter-
productive, not to mention costly. To rectify the situation, Nomura wants to
merge its individual fiefdoms, and Tokyo clearly believes Chapman is the man
to get US, London and Europe all reading from the same page.
Assuming he accepts the offer, the tough-looking and tough-acting Chapman is
likely to bring to London the same intensity of purpose that he brought to
New York, which, after a few run-ins with Tokyo, he eventually turned into a
smart, and highly profitable US-style securities house.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Management: Japan culture shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Nick Collins, licensing controller of Pringle of Scotland, it was an
opportunity to become 'immersed in an alien culture', learn a 'horribly
difficult' language, and find out about management styles on the other side
of the world.
Collins is one of more than 500 young managers who has benefited from the
European Commission's Executive Training Programme in Japan - a 15-year-old
scheme that aims to develop the presence of European companies in the Far
East. Last week 40 more Europeans headed east to start the intensive
18-month course, of language training, factory visits, culture and business
seminars and a secondment to a Japanese company.
Initial screening is carried out across the European Union by PA Consulting
Group, with the final assessment in Brussels by the Commission (which pays
the training costs and living expenses). Successful candidates range from
managers in companies with sales as low as Pounds 2m to multinationals such
as Royal Insurance and Michelin. Law firms, software companies and
electronic components suppliers are among those represented in the latest
group.
'All these companies are currently doing business in one way or another
already with Japan, although often in very small volumes,' says John
Patrick, PA's recruiter. Up to 70 per cent of 'alumni' are still directly or
indirectly involved with EU/Japan trade and almost 50 per cent are living in
Japan.
Pringle's Collins believes participants will get more out of the programme
if they do a stint with their company in Japan when the course has ended.
'It's a country that changes very quickly, it is easy to lose track.'
Recruitment details from PA's John Patrick, 123 Buckingham Palace Road,
London SW1W 9SR. Tel: 071-730 9000, Fax 071-333 5050).

FT  16 MAY 94 / Management: More power to the team - Christopher Lorenz
explains why managers do not always know best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performance measurement systems for multi-functional teams should not be
designed by managers, but by the teams themselves. Nor, except in extreme
circumstances, should managers intervene when measures show that problems
are developing: the teams should be left to take the necessary remedial
action themselves.
These are two of the many far-reaching changes which companies must make,
according to Christopher Meyer, an American consultant, if they are to
succeed in the popular attempt to replace their traditional 'functional'
(departmental) structures with cross-functional, or 'process-focused'
organisations.
Many executives have not yet even realised that they need new types of
measures if multi-functional teams are to succeed, Meyer claims. But even
where this need has been recognised, managers often use the new measures to
reinforce their own power, rather than that of the teams, he argues in an
article in the latest Harvard Business Review*.
A measurement system designed to support a process-based organisation should
help teams overcome two basic obstacles to their effectiveness, says Meyer:
getting functions to provide expertise when it is needed; and getting people
from different functions on a team to speak a common language.
As Meyer argues, traditional measurement systems fail to solve these
problems in several respects. First, their primary role is to pull 'good
information' up the organisation, so that senior managers can make 'good
decisions' that flow down it.
To that end, each relatively independent function has its own set of
measures. Marketing tracks market share, operations watches inventory,
finance monitors costs, and so on. Such 'results measures' tell the various
parts of an organisation where they stand, but not how they got there or
what either they or the organisation as a whole should do differently. As
Meyer puts it, the few cross-functional 'results measures' in most
organisations are financial: revenues, gross margins, cost of goods sold,
capital assets, debt and so on. They 'exist only to help top managers'.
By contrast, 'process measures' monitor the activities throughout an
organisation that produce a given result. They are essential to help
cross-functional teams deliver an entire product or service, such as order
fulfilment or product development.
Staffing is a far more helpful measure than most companies realise, he
suggests. If it covers not just the number of people, but also the years of
experience in main job categories, it can have a marked effect on a team's
performance, he says. If particular staff are missing at a particular stage
in a project, time-consuming and expensive problems arise later.
Contesting the popular view - especially in the US - that 'what gets
measured gets done', Meyer advises strongly against the temptation to pile
measure upon measure. Otherwise, team members end up spending too much time
collecting data and monitoring their activities, and not enough time
managing their projects. In general, a team
should have no more than 15 measures.
Meyer illustrates his warnings against relying on traditional measures, and
also against managers using a team's measures to reinforce their own
control, with episodes that have occurred at Ford in the US. In one case,
the result of executive intervention in a product quality project was
frustration for team members and managers alike, and also delay.
Meyer fails to explain how an organisation can avoid incompatibility and
chaos when it allows teams of various shapes and sizes to design their own
measures. But his overall message is powerful all the same: that 'managers
must never make the mistake of thinking that they know what is best for the
team'.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Management: Cupid's arrow across the desk - Lucy Kellaway on
reactions when colleagues fall in love
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do Bill Clinton and Bill Gates have in common apart from being at the
top of their respective trees and having the same first name?
Both are married to colleagues. They are members of a club that includes
Anita Roddick of Body Shop, Michael Green of Carlton Communications, and
Derek Bonham of Hanson on its rapidly growing membership list. Some couples
met through their work, some met first and then found a job for their
partner, and some set up a business together. All are evidence of the same
trend: business and pleasure are being mixed on a scale never seen before.
A recent survey by Alfred Marks employment agency shows that 60 per cent of
employees have had an office romance, and half of these ended in wedlock or
in cohabitation. A similar study in the US suggests a staggering 70 per cent
of a cross-section of employees have had a relationship with a colleague.
In the old days bosses dated secretaries. As greater numbers of women are
working in increasingly senior positions, men are marrying their equals at
work. At British Airways, pilots used to wed air hostesses, yet next month
the first husband and wife team of captains will be created when Jenny Fray
and Steve Pock get married.
Traditionally, an office marriage was a signal for one partner to leave the
company. Now there is less pressure to choose between job and spouse.
Melinda French, who married Bill Gates, evidently feels no conflict between
being the boss's wife and being a Microsoft manager. She is carrying on with
the company as before.
Work romances are a mixed blessing for companies. 'These relationships are
an extra complication in the working environment,' says Susan Bloch of
career consultants GHN. 'Companies need to be very sensitive about it or
they can get into a mess.'
Many companies say there is no policy because there is no problem. But
research from Strathclyde Business School suggests that middle and senior
managers in UK companies still disapprove of office affairs.
Companies that decide to take the ultimate sanction and fire one or other
partner may be breaking the law. An office romance can only be grounds for
dismissal if the employee's conduct is disruptive, or threatens to harm the
employer's business. If a couple marry, one partner can only be dismissed if
it can be proved that their continued employment would be impracticable, and
the rules forbidding marriage are both reasonable and clear.
An industrial tribunal recently upheld the dismissal of a senior manager of
a small UK company called Alarmco. He had been engaging in bizarre feats
including a toast and jam fight with his secretary, with whom he was having
an affair.
In another case Ann Tomen, a marketing assistant with Irish Bonding, was
fired after her husband, who also worked there, left to work for a
competitor. She contested the case, but a tribunal ruled that her sacking
was fair.
Despite romances that end in tears, most office affairs cause little
trouble. The majority view among UK companies is that relationships between
members of staff are both inevitable and beyond the scope of corporate
involvement. NatWest is typical in having no policies at all. 'It's just not
a problem,' says the company.
At the other extreme are some US corporations which forbid employees from
dating. According to Michael Rubenstein, editor of Equal Opportunities
Review, some companies have taken this route to protect themselves from
litigation.
He says office romances raise several thorny issues for businesses. The
first is sexual harassment. 'The concern is that if you have a relationship
that goes wrong, and one party wants to continue, you have a ready-made case
of sexual harassment,' he says.
A further problem is conflict of interest. This can arise if the couple work
closely together. Some employers think this problem sufficiently serious to
have rules to keep couples apart. At Arthur Andersen couples are not allowed
to work in the same business unit. 'The basic policy is that partners should
never be in the position where one supervises the progress of another,' says
the company, adding that the rule applies not just to couples but to members
of the same family.
McGraw Hill takes a slightly more flexible approach. 'We deal with every
situation on its merits. Where there may be a potential conflict, we review
it,' the company says. 'It is an issue if the man is married to someone more
junior in the department, and others think the partner is getting more
favourable treatment. If that person isn't a good performer, it could be
harder for their husband to talk to them.'
For most companies there is much to be said for doing nothing. 'We know that
people are more likely to meet their partners at work than anywhere else.
Usually it means more loyalty not less,' says Angela Baron of the Institute
of Personnel Management. 'The only time there is a problem is when people
fall out. If that creates an atmosphere it should be dealt with under normal
performance management techniques.'
There is some evidence that couples can be an asset rather than a potential
problem. American research shows that morale and absenteeism improve when a
workplace romance is in full swing.
David Norburn, director of the Management School at Imperial College and his
wife Sue Birley are a veteran career couple. Over the past 23 years they
have held jobs together at six different business schools and universities,
but found some more accommodating than others. 'A bad response is the fear
factor of the power of two people working together. A good response is that
a couple gets up to speed more quickly. One plus one equals more than two,'
says Norburn.
In his latest job at Imperial, he is her direct boss. He admits that there
is a danger that some colleagues could suspect favouritism, just as there is
a similar risk that he might be unfairly severe on her. He thinks these
problems are minor compared to the advantages. 'The real plus is that you
can gossip about the same people.'
Others might complain that dinner at home is not much different to lunch in
the staff canteen.

FT  16 MAY 94 / DTI guidance on brand lookalikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry will today announce the results of a
consultation exercise which examined how the government should deal with the
issue of supermarket 'lookalike' products.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the junior minister responsible for technology, has
been asking brand manufacturers if they believe protection for brand names
against lookalikes should be offered in amendments to the trademarks bill,
or whether new legislation on fair trading would be more appropriate.
The British Producers and Brand Owners Group, whose members include
Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive, Gillette, Mars, Nestle and Procter &amp; Gamble,
has persuaded Mr Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York, to put down an amendment
to the trademarks bill which would offer brand names extra protection.
As the bill now stands, trademarks are defined primarily by name and logo.
The amendment clarifies the definition of trademarks to include the shape,
design and overall packaging of a brand.
The bill will go to committee stage tomorrow. Mr Bayley said he did not
'realistically expect the amendment to get into the bill', but hoped it
would encourage government debate of the issue.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Organised crime reaps rewards of copying: Milan, Paris . . .
Preston. Pirates are trying to broaden Armani's horizons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is home to hundreds of illegal operations filling fake perfume
bottles, embroidering logos on accessories, screen-printing T-shirts and
copying audio and video cassettes.
Yet 10 years ago it was a net importer of counterfeit products, with the
goods seized in Britain nearly always manufactured elsewhere.
Companies and trading standards officers say illegal copying of goods is set
to continue as an unchecked boom industry dominated by organised crime.
This is in spite of two measures to combat it: the launch of a national
intelligence and data service and the trademarks bill which is due to enter
its parliamentary committee stage tomorrow.
Industry estimates suggest counterfeiting is costing Britain Pounds 1bn a
year through a combination of sales taken from legitimate producers and
retailers, about 100,000 lost jobs and lost tax revenues. The record
industry alone says that a quarter of tapes sold are illegal copies.
The surge in domestic counterfeiting has been aided by technology, with
sophisticated photocopiers used to imitate packaging and high-speed
recorders to copy tapes. However, it has been the high returns and patchy
law enforcement that have really fuelled the industry's growth.
Costs are far lower for an unregulated producer. 'Counterfeiters are not
renowned for paying taxes, registering for VAT or observing employment or
health and safety regulations,' says Ms Anthea Worsdall, secretary of the
Anti-Counterfeiting Group, which represents more than 130 companies affected
by illegal copying.
The street price for copied goods reflects consumers' belief that they are
obtaining something of a higher quality or value than is the case. 'If the
quality were as good as was claimed, there would be no need to steal someone
else's trademark,' says Ms Worsdall.
The net effect is high earnings on minimal outlay. A raid last month on a
mill in Preston, Lancashire, found children as young as 11 packing suspected
fake Giorgio Armani and Paul Smith jeans. A week's production was seized,
with a street value of Pounds 500,000. It was estimated that the haul would
have cost just Pounds 8,000 to produce.
Returns such as these have attracted organised crime. Last November police
raided on one day seven video-counterfeiting factories in Northern Ireland,
which it claimed were funding a paramilitary group, and seized Pounds
70,000-worth of copied audio and video tapes.
Syndicates in Manchester and London have also moved into the mass production
of counterfeit goods. The recession has provided a pool of workers willing
to take the risk of selling pirated goods, providing ample street-trading
networks.
Meanwhile, the trade descriptions, copyright, trade mark and theft laws,
which make copy-cat goods a criminal offence, are being enforced by council
trading standards departments which say they are over-stretched.
Britain's 1,500 trading standards officers cover a far wider remit than
counterfeiting, and local authorities are anyway not obliged to enforce
anti-counterfeiting legislation.
As a result, the Institute of Trading Standards Administration recently
reported that three-quarters of 98 trading standards departments surveyed
spent less than 10 per cent of their time on anti-counterfeiting work, with
many spending 2 per cent or less.
When counterfeiters are convicted penalties are minimal, with prison
sentences rarely passed and fines usually lower than the value of goods
seized.
Last year the Court of Appeal ruled that street traders who identified their
goods as fakes were not in breach of the Trade Descriptions Act. This
brought a rash of disclaimers on copied audio and video tapes, which left
the consumer wiser, but music and film companies less protected.
The trademarks bill is set to close the loophole on dis-claimers, make
enforcement obligatory on local authorities, and increase penalties - moves
which the government says could save British companies Pounds 60m in the
first year and an annual Pounds 30m in later years.
However, the resources available to enforce the new legislation remain the
same.
'Having the legislation is only part of the story,' says Ms Worsdall. 'It
needs to be effectively enforced and that needs more resources.'
The ITSA national data and intelligence service is establishing links with
enforcers in continental Europe through Interpol to try to track down
cross-border trade.
However, as part of the local government review, trading standards
departments may be reorganised into smaller units which, they claim, will
make national co-ordination and specialisation even harder.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A national intelligence and data service has been launched to try to curb
pirated goods that may be costing Britain up to Pounds 1bn a year.
'Counterfeit goods have reached epidemic levels in the UK,' said Mr Ed
Chicken, the Institute of Trading Standards Administration official
masterminding the service. Its remit will include logging counterfeiting
prosecutions and seizures.
The institute says counterfeiting has become a core activity for organised
crime because of the big rewards and low risk of prosecution. British
counterfeiters are mass-producing designer-label clothing, audio and video
tapes, perfume, watches, computer software, leisure goods, toys, furniture,
pottery and antiques.
The service will log where goods were seized and from whom, and will produce
the UK's first annual statistics on counterfeiting.
The institute has also set up a network of intelligence officers who will
supply to the national agency information on suspects and the distinctive
features of pirated goods.
The ITSA will need clearance under the Data Protection Act to store the
intelligence data on computer, and is considering how it could ensure
security. It believes the information could do much to curb counterfeiting
crime.
'Trading standards offices cover local areas, but the mass producers of
counterfeited goods operate in networks across the UK,' said Mr Chicken.
'Pooling local intelligence is going to really help us to track these people
down.'
The surge in counterfeiting has brought urgent calls from industry for
national co-ordination to combat it. The industry-led Anti-Counterfeiting
Group says copied goods are cutting the turnover of legitimate producers and
retailers, and are causing lost jobs and tax revenues.
'Up until now monitoring has been haphazard,' Mr Chicken said. This has
restricted investigations to local level and has hampered efforts to develop
national enforcement strategies.
Last year the institute made an initial effort to quantify the scale of
counterfeiting through questionnaires sent to trading standards offices. The
78 per cent of offices that responded seized nearly Pounds 9m-worth of goods
last year against which charges were laid, but up to 10 times that amount
was seized without subsequent legal action.
'We are not really interested in prosecuting the street traders themselves,'
said Mr Len Swift, leader of North Yorkshire's trading standards special
operations unit. 'We often just seize and caution. It is the producers and
organisers that we are trying to stop.'
However, only an estimated 10 per cent of pirated goods circulating in the
UK are seized by companies, trading standards offices and the police, says
the group.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Holiday companies escape check-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shortage of resources is hampering investigation of holiday companies
accused of providing travellers with inadequate financial protection, says
the body representing trading standards officers.
Mr Alan Street, chief executive of the Institute of Trading Standards
Administration, said in a letter to the Association of Independent Tour
Operators (Aito) last month that the pressure of other work meant officers
had to devote less time to holiday companies.
Under a European Union directive introduced last year, trading standards
officers are responsible for checking that holiday companies have made
arrangements to ensure money can be returned to customers in the case of
corporate collapse.
Mr Street wrote: 'In some areas of the country, the enforcement of the
Package Holiday Directive is not seen as the most pressing of demands and
resources are committed to other matters such as sales of unclassified
videos, unsafe food and consumer products, and attention to the statutory
demands required by more than 50 acts of parliament, together with the
associated 900-plus sets of regulations.'
Aito had written to Mr Street in July last year complaining about 75 tour
operators allegedly operating illegally by not providing proper financial
protection.
Earlier this month, Mr Street again wrote to Aito saying it appeared there
were few operators which did not have adequate financial protection and that
others had stopped selling package holidays.
But he added: 'The greatest difficulty is establishing, without personal
visits, which in themselves are time-consuming and may provoke some
irritation on the part of the recipient operator, what arrangements are in
being.'

FT  16 MAY 94 / Pensions provision poses hard choices for the future:
Targeted state schemes and new company plans urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Personal pensions have had a bad press in the past year. Yet the controversy
over how they have been sold has obscured a larger issue: whether the rise
of personal pensions is a passing fashion or a permanent change in pensions
provision.
In the past few years, the structure of pension provision in the UK has been
revolutionised and with it the relative incomes of pensioners.
The revolution, the details of which are outlined in Pension Policy in the
UK: an Economic Analysis, published today by the Institute for Fiscal
Studies, means pensioners are no longer society's poorest group.
The income of richer pensioners has risen faster than average incomes over
the past 15 years or so: for the top 20 per cent of pensioners the rise was
more than 50 per cent between 1979 and 1990-91. But the gulf between rich
and poor pensioners widened.
In the same period, incomes of the poorest 20 per cent rose by only about 10
per cent.
State benefits now make up only half of pensioner incomes. For those reliant
largely on state-provided pensions the future does not look rosy: the value
of the contributory basic pension fell from 20 per cent of average male
earnings at the end of the 1970s to 15 per cent at the start of the 1990s.
By the middle of the next century it will fall to just 6 per cent or 7 per
cent. The generosity of the supplementary State Earnings Related Pension
Scheme (Serps) was curtailed in the 1980s.
Increasingly, the income-tested sector (income support and housing related
benefits) will be a significant source of income for the poorest elderly
people while the rest come to rely more on private income.
The perception that state provision is diminishing has fuelled the expansion
of the personal pension sector. This growth in individual provision has been
enhanced partly because coverage of workers by traditional occupational
pension schemes peaked over two decades ago. In future, more people will
retire with pension values determined by the success of their plan's
investments rather than the scheme's tenure or earnings.
The extent of these shifts is often underestimated. For example, among
private-sector workers covered by a private pension, a majority (about 6m)
belong to a contracted out money purchase or personal pension rather than to
an occupational scheme (5.6m), according to the government actuary.
Should this trend towards personal provision be resisted?
As far as the basic pension is concerned a coherent and transparent policy
is needed which will continue the move towards greater targeting of state
resources, without creating the pitfalls of the current system of
means-testing.
Given the increasing diversity of pensioner incomes and the future increase
in the numbers of pensioners simply raising benefit levels within the
present structure will be expensive and inappropriate.
It is often suggested that personal pensions are inherently riskier than
other forms of provision. But reliance on state pensions is also risky:
policy changes over the past 15 years have reduced both basic and earnings
related components below expectations.
The move towards defined contribution schemes feeds on some of the risks
attached to traditional defined benefit schemes.
Such schemes are inappropriate for many. Traditional occupational schemes
penalise those who move jobs frequently, and often reward long servers and
high earners disproportionately. So long as they do, defined contribution
schemes, which are more flexible, will spread. In the US since 1975, 80 per
cent of newly covered workers have joined defined contribution schemes. To
compete, traditional occupational schemes must reform.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Insurance sales manager sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Portfolio, the insurance company, sacked one of its sales managers
on Friday for a serious breach of training practices.
The company, which has 67 branches in the UK and contracts with 1,600 sales
agents, has also suspended two other managers in its direct-sales branch at
Farnborough, Hampshire, while it considers their 'suitability to carry out
their responsibilities'. The sacking offence occurred towards the end of
last year.
These actions follow an investigation into allegations that managers at the
branch did not follow training procedures for new sales agents.
The manager was fired for falsifying sales-agent training records. Lautro,
the life industry's self-regulating body, stipulates that managers must keep
records of observations made during meetings between new sales agents and
potential clients.
The company specifies that managers must keep records of four such meetings.
The company found that one manager had completed records 'confirming his
presence at a meeting between a company representative and the client
despite not being present'.
Former sales agents also alleged that managers encouraged them to use
unauthorised competition entry forms offering potential customers prizes to
tempt them to buying products.
The company's investigation comes in the midst of controversy surrounding
the sale of personal-investment products, particularly pensions. In recent
months Lautro has fined several companies for breaching industry standards.
Mr Paul Smith and Mr Richard Hannan, two former sales agents, also alleged
that before a compliance office visit in December, a memo was sent out
ordering consultants to destroy all 'unauthorised' competition entry forms.
They also said they were only aware of one of the advertised prize draws
taking place.
General Portfolio said its head office had approved three of the competition
entry forms and that the remaining unauthorised forms were destroyed on the
request of the company's compliance office.
The company said it had no evidence that breaches in the Farnborough branch
were 'anything other than an isolated incident'.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Waves of concern spread through City over Crest: Norma Cohen
on the Bank's proposal for paperless share settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England is in a tetchy mood over its proposed Crest system for
paperless share settlements. Last week, executive director Mr Pen Kent
lambasted the press for suggesting that the project 'will be late, over
budget, disappointingly undersubscribed and insensitive to small investors'.
So the Bank, which has generally received high marks from the City for its
efforts to build Crest, is unlikely to be pleased about the criticisms
contained in a prestigious legal journal which suggests that the project
actually increases risks in the securities industry rather than helping to
reduce them.
Most significant among these risks, the article says, are those which will
be created because Crest uses 'real time gross settlement' rather than the
net settlement system currently in use. While gross settlement of equity
bargains tallies up payments for each transaction separately, net settlement
adds up all the bargains between two counterparties and calculates the 'net'
payment, or balance, which one must make to the other.
Bankers who have been very supportive of the Crest project say they share
this concern. They have held meetings with the Bank of England and with
their largest customers to discuss how much additional credit they will need
to ext-end as the Crest project progresses.
'We are hearing estimates of marketmakers needing Pounds 20m, Pounds 30m,
Pounds 40m,' said one banker involved in the talks.
Net payments are a fraction of the value of all deals, and thus reduce the
need for borrowing by participants in the market. This has particular
implications for marketmakers - securities firms which are required to buy
and sell equities at firm prices in all market conditions. Many of their
bargains are among themselves and they have benefited from net settlement.
In an article in the May 1994 edition of Butterworths Journal of
International Banking and Financial Law, Ms Kathleen Tyson-Quah, a former
Securities and Investments Board executive, wrote: 'Given the
cost-effectiveness and capital efficiency of net payments it is likely to
put market-makers in particular out of business.'
The Bank has told bankers that 'risks must be recognised and they must be
paid for'.
'Initially I don't think the Crest taskforce has considered the implications
for the securities industry,' one banker said.
A portion of the demand for increased credit also comes from the move to
10-day rolling settlement on July 18. This abandons the two or three-week
account settlement period which had allowed for net settlement of trades on
a single day. From July there will still be net settlement but only of a
single day's trades at a time.
The Bank is drawing up a matrix to help banks gauge how much extra credit
their securities-house clients are likely to need.
Gross settlement in the Crest system is expected to cause particular pain
for marketmakers when, as many bankers expect, the Bank of England follows
the US Federal Reserve Bank and begins charging interest on so-called
intra-day borrowings from its own reserves. These are funds borrowed in the
morning and fully repaid by the close of business.
Gross settlement is likely to cause marketmakers to borrow heavily at
various points during each day. 'If they go overdrawn we will have to charge
them,' one banker said.
The point is an obscure one which has eluded most of the City up until now.
Bankers are also worried about the role they have been accorded in the
design of Crest. Privately, the British Bankers' Association has expressed
its concerns to the Bank.
First, bankers are worried that they will in effect be the final arbiters of
which securities firms are allowed to participate in Crest. Denial of credit
facilities to securities firms or higher credit cost to customers will spark
accusations that banks are driving firms out of the business, bankers fear.
'The banks are afraid they will be cast as the villains of the piece,' said
one BBA official, adding that the Bank of England's response had been that
'it will be a public relations exercise'.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Impact of tax rises appears short-lived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, NEIL BUCKLEY, MOTOKO RICH and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impact of last month's tax increases on discretionary spending may have
been immediate but short-lived if figures released by Barclaycard are a
guide - and many retailers say the increases have had no impact.
Barclaycard's figures suggest spending is beginning to rise again following
a slight drop when consumers received monthly pay packets reflecting the
April rises in income tax and National Insurance.
On April 26, the amount processed by Barclaycard stood at 120 per cent of
the amount processed on the equivalent day in 1993. By May 6, the cumulative
figure, which covers the period after April 26, had fallen back to just 106
per cent of the 1993 figure for the same number of days.
By last Friday, however, this cumulative figure had risen slightly to 109
per cent over the period from late April.
Barclaycard estimates that, with some 38 per cent of UK credit card
spending, it accounts for between 5 per cent and 6 per cent of UK
discretionary spending in total.
Mr Gordon Blunt, information and planning manager at Barclaycard, said that
he would have expected any fall in spending as a result of the tax rises to
have continued for longer. 'It seems to have been a short-term blip,' he
said.
The effects of the tax increases on retailers have been mixed.
Kwik Save, the UK's largest discount food retailer, this week said trade was
being damaged. Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said like-for-like sales,
which exclude new store openings, had increased 3.2 per cent in the six
months to March 12. But since the tax changes, sales growth had fallen to 1
per cent.
But J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery group, said on Wednesday that
while trading remained tough, like-for-like sales growth had been positive
since mid-January.
John Lewis Partnership said sales in its 22 department stores in the first
week of May - just after many people received their first pay slips after
the tax increases - were up 11.8 per cent year-on-year.
'We have been looking at the figures keenly for evidence of any effect and
there is none,' the group said.
Littlewoods, the chain store and mail-order group, said business had been
tough for more than two years. It had not felt any 'discernible difference'
in trade since the tax increases.
'We are now into the mid-season of merchandise. If the tax increases were
going to be felt it would have been last month,' the group said.
The pace of the recovery in sales of new cars has been slowed by recent tax
increases, but motor industry leaders believe the impact will be
short-lived, writes Kevin Done.
Mr Paddy Byrne, sales director of Ford of Britain, said Ford forecasted a
year-on-year rise of between 9 per cent and 10 per cent this month in
new-car sales compared with April's 5 per cent increase.
'People have been taking a long, hard look at their disposable income,' said
Mr Byrne, 'but it is my hunch that the underlying growth trend will soon be
resumed.'

FT  16 MAY 94 / Graduate pay faces squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
Expansion of higher education in the UK could force employers to change
their recruitment strategies and reduce starting salaries, says a report
published by the Institute of Manpower Studies today.
Evidence from the US, where the number of university degrees awarded doubled
between 1962 and 1972, and then continued to increase at a much slower rate,
shows that real graduate starting salaries have fallen since 1969.
In the UK, student numbers in higher education have increased by more than
50 per cent during the past five years, and similar trends are expected to
develop.
According to the IMS research, real US starting salaries peaked at Dollars
25,288 (at 1990 values) in 1969, and fell 16 per cent by 1990 to Dollars
21,319.
The number of graduates failing to use their degree, or 'under-utilised',
increased during the same period from 11 per cent to 20 per cent, and this
proportion is projected to increase to 30 per cent by the year 2005. Such
graduates ended up in jobs including retail sales, clerical work, and craft
and labourer occupations not traditionally regarded as needing a degree.
IMS also found profound changes in the way graduates looked for work, with
students needing to be far more 'proactive' in looking for work.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Watchdog considers big auditing shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Auditing Practices Board is considering proposals that would radically
alter the relationship between auditors and their corporate clients.
Board members are discussing a recommendation for the introduction of a
panel of shareholders or an audit commission that would wrest control of the
remuneration and appointment of auditors from executive management.
The change would be an attempt to respond to the prevailing suspicion that a
'cosy' relationship exists between auditors and the boards of directors of
the companies they serve.
The law states that the auditors are responsible to shareholders of the
com-pany for ensuring that the accounts show a 'true and fair view'.
However, auditors spend most time in discussion with the board, which hires
and fires - and sets their remuneration - leading to a belief by some
critics that their opinion will also be subject to influence by the board.
There has been growing public attention to the issue of improving the
quality of auditing and restoring the credibility of accountants after a
series of high-profile corporate collapses since the late 1980s.
The Auditing Practices Board, which is controlled by the accountancy
profession, does not have the power to implement the proposals. However, its
membership of leading City figures is highly influential and could lead to a
substantial movement for reform.
The recommendations echo more tentative calls for reform along similar lines
in the report published in November 1992 on the development of auditing,
chaired by Mr John Macfarlane, now a director of Standard Chartered, the
banking group.
A working party to develop the ideas has been meeting, and includes Mr
Macfarlane; Mr Ian Percy, chairman of the Scottish Accounts Commission; Mr
Ian Plaistowe, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board; and Mr David
Hatherly, head of the accounting department at the University of Edinburgh.
Mr Percy helped to write a report by the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of Scotland last year which also called into question the relationship
between auditors and executive management.
In spite of lengthy discussions, the working party has not yet reached a
final decision on its recommendations, which are expected to be published in
October this year.
It is also exploring boosting the role of audit committees in the short term
and the introduction of a German-style supervisory board to strengthen the
hand of a company's non-executive directors in relation to the audit.

<TEXT>
Yorkshire miners are trying to organise a union buy-out of their coalfield,
in the face of strong opposition from Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the
National Union of Mineworkers, Clive Cookson writes.
The buy-out initiative comes from the union branch at Maltby colliery near
Rotherham. It is backed by Mr Kevin Barron, a former miner who is Labour MP
for Rother Valley.
The Unity Trust Bank, which is controlled by the trade union movement, told
the miners that it was prepared to help finance the bid. However, Mr
Scargill's refusal to have anything to do with the privatisation of British
Coal has blocked the initiative so far.
His hard line has infuriated more pragmatic union members who want to
compete for their pits.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Quality of life 'barely above 1950'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality of life in Britain is worse than in the mid-1970s and hardly higher
than in 1950 when some goods were still rationed, says a report published
today.
Researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute use consumer
expenditure as the base measure for a quality of life index and adjust it by
20 factors ranging from conventional measures, such as net capital growth,
to factors such as the costs of commuting and of lost farmland.
The index aims to replace gross national product as a broader measure of
affluence.
The researchers say that 'sustainable economic welfare is not the same as
GNP, and has departed from it from the mid-1970s onwards'.
Their calculations suggest that, between 1950 and 1990, GNP per head grew by
230 per cent in real terms, or an average of 2.1 per cent per year. The
researchers' index grew by just 3 per cent over the entire period.
Since the 1970s the researchers' index has been falling at an average rate
of almost 5 per cent a year. Much of the decline is accounted for by the
fall in value of natural assets such as North Sea oil.
In the case of measuring the cost of lost farmland, the researchers subtract
a value of the land lost to urbanisation and the fall in farming
productivity as the soil quality deteriorates.
But even without accounting for the depletion of natural resources, the
index is still at the level of the early 1970s, having almost doubled
between 1950 and 1970.
The researchers blame increasing inequality in the distribution of incomes.
They say an income increase of Pounds 1,000 a year for a poor family means a
much sharper improvement in quality of life than the same gain would for a
rich one. This phenomenon is seen when the method is applied to the US, but
the divergence is more marked in the UK.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Growth upturn 'will shrug off' April increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic growth will be barely hindered by last month's tax rises, although
in the long-term the current account deficit will rise and public borrowing
will remain above Pounds 30bn a year, says a report published today.
Oxford Economic Forecasting, the independent research group, says in a
broadly optimistic May report: 'Economic recovery is two years old, interest
rates are low, spending is on a strong upward trend and incomes are forecast
to rise.'
The recovery will be supported by a strong upturn in investment spending
driven principally by better company finances and higher profits.
Inflationary worries have been exaggerated, says the report, noting that
inflation forecasts have been consistently revised downwards during the past
18 months, including those of the Bank of England.
'The level of spare capacity in the economy will be sufficient to keep the
lid on prices for several years to come,' it says.
Interest rates will rise slowly over the next three years, says the report,
from a 1994 three-month interbank figure of 5 per cent to 5.6 per cent in
1997.
Recent data suggest that the rise in wages has also been 'modest', partly
because the increase in employment has been fuelled by greater numbers
working in part-time jobs. Unemployment will continue on its present gentle
decline from 2.56m to 2.24m in 1997.
One of the motors of recovery is the company sector, where profits have
risen for seven successive quarters.
In manufacturing there are a number of positive factors which point to 'a
more buoyant picture in the period ahead':
Better company finances are easing restraints on spending.
Output of goods for investment rose strongly during this year's first
quarter. Evidence of investment intentions has improved during the past
year, especially in manufacturing where the January and April Confederation
of British Industry surveys recorded the best figures on plant and machinery
since 1989.
Manufacturing investment should grow by 5.8 per cent this year and by 8.6
per cent in 1995, says the report.

covered by the organisation's demand for clarification of the Downing Street
declaration on the future of Northern Ireland.
He declined at a meeting in Dublin to give precise details of questions
submitted by Sinn Fein to the government of the Irish republic and passed on
to the UK authorities. But he outlined issues on which his party expected
progress:
What are the means and within what timescale does the British government
expect to see agreement reached between all the Irish people?
What are the constitutional options which Britain sees as a realistic
alternative to the present constitutional structures?
What are the long-term political objectives of the British government in
relation to Ireland?
On what basis does the unionist veto exist, and how far does it extend over
constitutional change and political policy?
If the Government of Ireland Act claims sovereignty over Northern Ireland,
why was it not mentioned in the declaration?
What are the subsequent steps which the British government envisages in the
peace process?
What are the structures and processes which the government expects to be
developed from the declaration?
Is acceptance of the declaration a precondition for involvement in talks on
the development of new political arrangements?
What is the process which will lead to 'de-militarisation'?
Mr John Taylor, Ulster unionist MP for Strangford, yesterday accused the UK
government of 'playing the tune' of the IRA. He said the people of Northern
Ireland had lost all confidence in Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary.
'He has been sent written questions from the IRA via Sinn Fein, via the
Dublin government, and then posted into London, and he is going to answer
those written questions and publish the answers,' Mr Taylor told BBC Radio.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Rover to introduce Sunday shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover Group is to introduce Sunday working at its Longbridge plant near
Birmingham from next weekend to raise output of its 200/400 medium-size car
range.
The six-hour shift, to be worked by existing employees on overtime, is
intended to raise production by 5.5 per cent to 4,750 cars a week from
4,500.
Rover, which is owned by German carmaker BMW, said at the weekend that the
increased production is to meet higher demand in the UK and several large
continental markets. It also reflects a broadening of the model range to
include an estate car, the 400 Tourer, which is to go on sale next month.
The Longbridge plant, which also produces the Mini, Metro and engines and
gearboxes, at present makes 200s and 400s on a non-stop, 24-hour basis five
days a week.
Rover said that the Sunday shift would require about 1,000 of the 2,500
employees currently engaged in 200/400 assembly, all of whom had
volunteered.
The Sunday-working programme will continue until the annual summer holiday
shutdown at the start of August, when the situation will be reassessed.
Rover was the only carmaker to increase sales in western Europe's slumping
car market last year. In the first quarter of this year 200/400 sales rose
by 15 per cent in the UK to 23,302, and continental sales rose by a similar
amount to 35,574.
Rover has also increased production of its larger 600 model by 30 per cent
since the start of this year to 1,110 a week from 850. Last month the
four-wheel-drive subsidiary, Land Rover, announced it was creating 600 jobs
through an 8 per cent output rise - following a 20 per cent production
increase last year.
Total west European sales of 132,000 in the first four months of this year
were only 2,000 behind those of its BMW parent.
The first small saloon car to be produced by Rover since it was taken over
by BMW will be a model code-named R3 on a shortened Rover 200 body platform.
The new model will come on to the market in autumn 1995.
The ageing Metro will be given a facelift at the end of this year and the
200 series will be replaced next spring.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Direct Line may launch credit card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct Line, the telephone insurance company owned by Royal Bank of
Scotland, is considering launching a credit card as part of its attempt to
step up sales of other financial services products to its customers.
The move could lead to stiffer competition among credit card issuers because
of Direct Line's ability to use its customer database to target lower-risk
card users. Card issuers are competing to attract such customers.
Carmakers including General Motors and Ford have issued credit cards which
offer users savings on new cars. But although these cards have been
successful, large banks still dominate the market.
Direct Line might use its successful red telephone-on-wheels advertising
logo as a trademark for a credit card. However, the idea is seen as a
long-term project, and would follow launches of other financial products. Mr
Peter Wood, the company's chief executive, said: 'We are queuing up products
to go out, but you can't do everything at once.'
Direct Line is to launch a pilot scheme to sell mortgages in the summer and
plans to begin sales of simple protection life assurance products next year
after the expected authorisation of its life assurance subsidiary.
Direct Line Life Assurance would specialise in sales of term assurance and
income-protection plans, again mainly cross-selling to existing customers.
Another new initiative is a separate motor insurance company, jointly owned
by Royal Bank of Scotland and Mr Wood, which would specialise in so-called
'non-standard' risks, such as fast cars and younger drivers.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Tories remove Smith references from manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative party officials announced yesterday that references to John
Smith in the party's European election manifesto were being deleted before
its delayed launch next week.
That followed Friday's postponement by the government of the white paper on
competitiveness, a gesture intended to underpin the new, less
confrontational mood of British politics ushered in by Mr Smith's death.
But a row over campaign literature prepared by the Tories before Mr Smith's
death last week underlined the fragility of the present suspension of
hostilities between the main parties.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader and a long-time campaigner
against personal mudslinging at Westminster, said he was worried that the
new mood would not last.
Close colleagues of Mr Major, who like Mr Smith has a reputation for
integrity, said the prime minister saw a genuine opportunity for politicians
on all sides to raise the level of political debate. In the process they
could seek to rebuild their battered reputations with voters.
But the dispute over the alleged 'smears' in the latest edition of the
Conservatives' campaign guide was seen by many at Westminster as a more
reliable pointer to the future.
The guide included many familiar attacks on Mr Smith's leadership,
describing him as 'ineffectual' and 'visionless'. Its tone contrasted
sharply with the fulsome tribute to the former Labour leader by Mr Major in
the Commons on Thursday.
Ministers insisted the criticisms were simply part of the normal
'rough-and-tumble' of politics during elections campaigns and pointed to
similar personal attacks by Labour figures on Mr Major's leadership.
But Mr David Blunkett, the Labour party chairman, said the guide advised
Tory candidates in the forthcoming European elections to say 'very personal
and unpleasant things which had little to do with the policy differences we
have in Europe'.
He added: 'This personal abuse contrasts with what has happened over the
last three days.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had planned to
launch the white paper on British competitiveness alongside Mr Major and
several other cabinet ministers later today. However officials said it would
be delayed at least until next week.
Bookmakers William Hill made Mr Tony Blair the favourite for the Labour
leadership. He was originally quoted at 2-5 and is now 1-5, with others as
follows: Gordon Brown 4-1, Robin Cook 8-1, John Prescott 12-1, Margaret
Beckett 20-1, Jack Cunningham 33-1.
Labour are 8-11 favourites to win the next general election, with the
Conservatives at even money.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Union stands aside from Labour race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public services union,
yesterday said that the union executive would make no recommendation on the
new leader of the Labour party to those members who pay the political levy.
Unison's stance, announced at the start of its annual conference, was not
unexpected since only parts of the union are affiliated to the Labour party,
but some other union leaders may follow the lead.
Some leaders said at the weekend that they hoped the new party leader would
emerge without a contest, as they honoured the request not to name their
preferences at least until after the funeral of John Smith later this week.
But yesterday Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU engineering union president, said:
'It would please us no end if a natural leader emerged. If the politicians
within the Labour party believe they have consensus among themselves on who
should be their natural leader I'm fairly certain that would be welcomed
throughout the trade union movement.'
The AEEU would probably back either Mr Tony Blair or Mr Gordon Brown in the
event of a contest.
Most unions, including the TGWU general union, Labour's biggest affiliate,
are expected to hold postal ballots but some may opt for cheaper workplace
ballots. 'We certainly hope that everyone will go for postal ballots; we all
know that workplace ballots are not always transparently fair in all
workplaces,' said one union leader.
Unison and other large unions confirmed yesterday that a July election was
perfectly practical, although some smaller unions might have an
organisational problem. The election will be open to some abuse as the
electorate should not only be political-levy payers but also supporters of
the Labour party, something which will be difficult in practice to
ascertain.
Assuming that most unions do make recommendations, the field looks wide
open. Leaders have been stunned by Mr Smith's death and have been careful
not to repeat the 'undignified rush' to publicly anoint his successor as
happened in Mr Smith's favour after Mr Neil Kinnock's resignation.
One official said last night that 'the heart is for Prescott but the head is
for Blair or Brown'. Another added: 'Union leaders are just desperate to win
and there is a grudging acceptance in some quarters that Blair is the only
one who can do it.'
Separately at the Unison conference, Mr Jinkinson yesterday committed the
union to a protracted campaign against the public-sector pay-bill freeze and
job cutting programme. He urged members however not to be drawn into early
industrial action.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Doctors resolve dispute with OFT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute that threatened to lead to legal action by the British Medical
Association against the Office of Fair Trading has been resolved.
In February the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended that the BMA
should stop publishing fee guidelines for private practice by consultants.
The government accepted the recommendation, saying the commission had
established that doctors following the recommended scales could charge
higher fees than would otherwise be possible, and the BMA immediately agreed
to stop publishing and distributing the guidelines.
Since February, however, a disagreement has raged between the BMA and OFT
over the form in which its undertaking to stop publishing the guidelines
should be formally expressed.
The BMA complained that a form of words demanded by the OFT went beyond the
scope of the original commission recommendation on private medical services,
and could have been interpreted to cover guidance on such activities as
certificates written by general practitioners and medical examinations for
legal actions.
After taking counsel's opinion, BMA officials told the OFT that, unless the
matter was resolved satisfactorily by the end of last week, they would seek
judicial review. The BMA said yesterday that a satisfactory form of words
had now been accepted by both sides.
Although the BMA agreed to withdraw its guidelines after the government
accepted the commission report, it has made clear that it regards the entire
issue as perverse. Private medical insurers such as Bupa and PPP will be
free to continue issuing guidelines.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Mexican attorney general resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Diego Valades, Mexico's attorney general, resigned abruptly at the
weekend, the second justice minister to quit in the past four months. The
resignation, announced without any official explanation, adds to the turmoil
surrounding the administration of security and justice as the country
prepares for presidential elections in August.
Mr Valades had come under fire in the past weeks over the arrest of the Baja
California deputy state attorney general, Mr Sergio Ortiz, on charges of
collaborating with drug traffickers. Mr Ortiz is a member of the
conservative National Action party (PAN), which interpreted the action, as
well as Mr Valades' refusal to investigate allegations of corruption they
levelled against Mr Carlos 'Hank' Gonzalez, the powerful agriculture
minister, to be a declaration of political war.
The administration of President Carlos Salinas and his ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI) can ill afford a fight with PAN, which has
generally been a government ally. Mr Valades may have been forced to resign
in order to placate the opposition party.
A climate of insecurity, highlighted by the assassination of the PRI's
presidential candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, and a series of kidnappings
of Mexican businessmen, also helped to damage Mr Valades' public image.
Mr Valades, according to aides, had his own problems with a lack of respect
given to him and his post by Mr Salinas.
The investigation of the Colosio assassination has been placed under a
special prosecutor, while a new National Public Security Commission, which
is run directly from the president's office and to which Mr Valades had to
answer, was formed less than a month ago.
The appointment of little-known Mr Humberto Benitez to replace Mr Valades in
the attorney general's office is a sign that most serious law and order
issues, including the election, will be dealt with by the presidency.
In Mexican political circles, the circumstances surrounding the resignation,
which are unlikely to go away with a simple change in chief personnel, were
lamented more than the resignation itself. One newspaper, La Jornada,
entitled its editorial 'The Fraying of the Attorney General'. Little by
little, the editorial said, 'the attorney general's function is wasted under
a justice system overwhelmed by demand and a climate of corruption that
permeates nearly all levels of the ministry.'

FT  16 MAY 94 / International Press Review: A death to prompt French regrets
 -British Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Correspondents
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is very rare for the death of a politician to be commemorated in an
editorial on the prestigious front page of Le Monde, the bastion of the
French political press: all the rarer if the deceased was foreign, not
French, and in opposition.
Yet Le Monde's leader writers decided that John Smith merited such a tribute
and summed up their conclusions about the consequences of his sudden death
in the headline - 'British Disarray'.
Mr Smith himself was described in a separate story in the flowery style
characteristic of French journalism as 'a devout presbyterian and opera
lover. . . his sober appearance and heavy physique, hiding a surprising
intellectual agility'.
Le Figaro, the conservative daily, devoted nearly a page to 'John Smith:
Convincing and Competent'. It also alluded to the more raffish side of the
former Labour leader by noting, approvingly, that it was he who had ordered
a bottle of champagne on the night before he died at the end of a meeting on
the European elections with Mr Michel Rocard, the French socialist leader.
Liberation, the left-liberal daily, also made reference to the champagne
interlude. It quoted a Rocard aide as describing Mr Smith as having been 'on
good form, relaxed, cheerful, but also alert' on that night.
Mr Rocard himself was generous in his praise when reflecting upon Mr Smith
in a French radio interview. 'It was John Smith who convinced me that there
could be a Europe with Britain,' he said.
The Japanese media generally reported the death of Mr Smith as a significant
blow not only to the Labour party but to UK politics as a whole. The TV
Tokyo network said the loss of Mr Smith, whose personal popularity was seen
as a significant factor behind Labour's recent favourable ratings, has left
the party in a difficult position. Mainichi Shimbun, a national daily -
whose headline 'Party Leader Smith Dies Suddenly' is printed above -
foreshadowed the battle within the Labour party to succeed Mr Smith: 'The
death of Mr Smith is likely to have an effect not only on the Labour party
but on British politics as a whole.
'The Conservative party chose Mr John Major as leader, after it was led by a
very strong leader, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, and is always struggling with the
problem of internal dissension. Similarly, it is questionable whether the
Labour party will find a leader as strong as Mr Smith and it is possible
that both the Conservatives and Labour will enter a leaderless period.'
The UK Press Association headline, 'John Smith's death stuns the world', may
have been understandable, but it was also hyperbolic, at least as far as the
US media was concerned. The main TV network Thursday evening news programmes
all recorded Mr Smith's death, but relatively briefly and in the second half
of their 30-minute broadcasts.
The leading newspapers treated the story respectably. Both The New York
Times and the Washington Post did not start their coverage on their front
pages beyond putting little boxes there drawing attention to stories in
their foreign news sections.
The Times ran two items from its London bureau - a straightforward news
story on the details of Mr Smith's death and reactions to it, plus a more
analytical piece on the political consequences for the Labour and
Conservative parties. The Post combined both elements in a single piece.
In general, the recent twists and turns of UK politics are not followed
minutely in the US media, perhaps understandably so. This stands in sharp
contrast to the UK press's fascination with every minute and salacious
detail of President Clinton's private life.
Not one of the 46 national and regional newspapers in Germany spared any
editorial space for the former leader of the Labour party on the day after
his death, focusing instead on an uneventful two-day visit by President
Boris Yeltsin, the affairs of the new Italian government and interest rates.
The only UK event to stir interest on Friday was a few lines on 'mad cow'
beef in the Schwabische Zeitung. Most papers merely recorded Smith's death,
sometimes on inside pages.
'The best prime minister Labour never had,' was how the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung put it, drawing the parallel with Hugh Gaitskell's sudden
death in 1963. 'While he may not have been a brilliant speaker, the Scottish
lawyer radiated statesman-like authority which one often misses in his
opponent, John Major.'
The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau made most of how Smith had added
colour to the party: 'He infused the party with his own quiet
self-confidence; his humour, his advocate's intellect and strict morality
presented Labour with an attractive advertisement for the 90s.'

FT  16 MAY 94 / The fault-lines show in the Grand Old Party: Jurek Martin
looks at the many contenders aspiring to lead the opposition to President
Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's assorted problems ought to be good news for the
Republican party. In the medium-term, marked by this November's mid-term
elections, this may prove to be the case. Regaining control of the Senate
for the first time in 10 years is not out of the question.
But many of the old fault-lines in the Grand Old Party so apparent in 1992
remain, to the point that it can be far from confident about recapturing the
White House in 1996 - unless the incumbent hands victory to them on a plate.
This much was evident in the content and reception of former vice president
Dan Quayle's new book, Standing Firm. The volume was intended to re-launch
Mr Quayle on the national political scene as a potential Republican nominee
in 1996. Unlikely though it may seem, given the low esteem in which Mr
Quayle was generally held, it has certainly served that immediate purpose,
even if the boost proves ephemeral.
As Mr David Broder's column put it in the Washington Post: 'He is running
for president, with the Christian conservatives, against the press - and
without the insignia of the Bush administration.'
Certainly, Mr Quayle used his book to settle old scores with some past
colleagues and future rivals, among them Mr James Baker, the former
secretary of state (only concerned about himself and less influential than
Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser); Mr Jack Kemp, ex-housing
secretary (prone to run off at 'tangents' with 'no discernible point'); and
Mr Bob Dole, still minority leader (a closet big spender and rude to boot).
All three are proto-candidates - surprisingly for Mr Baker, who has never
liked running for office on his own account. They are often on the rubber
chicken circuit in New Hampshire and Iowa, the states which hold the first
votes in 1996.
So are Mr Dick Cheney, former defence secretary, Mr Lamar Alexander, former
Tennessee governor, Governor Caroll Campbell of South Carolina, Senator Phil
Gramm of Texas, Governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts, Mr Bill Bennett,
one-time education secretary and anti-narcotics czar, and a few others
besides. This is not counting the talk show right, such as Mr Pat Buchanan
and Mr Rush Limbaugh, who now register in GOP polls.
The nominal leader of the pack is Mr Dole, whose position gives him
visibility. But he will be 73 in 1996 and, even if he does not look or act
his age, it is hard to imagine the party putting him up as anything other
than a sacrificial lamb. He also deeply offended the right in a funeral
oration commending the late President Richard Nixon's social policy
activism. Mr Cheney generally ranks second in the polls.
The party's biggest fault-line divides the Christian-influenced right, which
part-shanghaied the 1992 Houston convention with its proclamation of
conservative family values, from the broadly establishment middle, mostly
old Bushmen.
They will fight some bitter Republican primary battles this year - for
example, in Virginia, where Oliver North is running for the Senate,
California, where Governor Pete Wilson is seeking re-election, and
Minnesota, in both the gubernatorial and senate races.
The party also has sub-divisions. The libertarian strain is articulately
represented by Governor Weld and, to a degree, Mr Kemp and Mr Bennett, whose
own recent book on values gives him reasonable claim to be the new GOP
philosopher king.
But this wing finds itself pitted against the religious right on such issues
as abortion and homosexuality, which libertarians feel should not be
proscribed by law. On foreign policy, it finds itself at odds with the
establishment middle, which has no truck with isolationism.
Activists such as Mr Rich Tafel, who used to work for Governor Weld and now
runs Log Cabin Republicans, the homosexual pressure group, claim to have
made much ground since the divisiveness of the Houston convention. But any
half hour spent tuned in to the Rev Pat Robertson's Christian broadcasting
network demonstrates the depth of opposition to a party platform tilted
towards tolerance.
The problem for internationalists like Messrs Cheney and Baker is that they
represent an approach explicitly rejected in the 1992 election. The
Republican party was instrumental in getting the North American Free Trade
Agreement passed last year. But since then party attitudes, not far out of
step with the rest of the nation and egged on by talk show hosts, have
turned more inwards.
Evidence of this can be found in the recent behaviour of two party
bellwethers. Congressman Newt Gingrich, certain to be the next House
Republican leader, supported Nafta but will fight ratification of the
Uruguay Round because of a perceived threat to US sovereignty that did not
trouble him over hemispheric trade. Mr Dole got the Senate last week to vote
in favour of a unilateral lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo.
The healthcare debate is equally divisive. Having declared early in the year
that there was no health 'crisis,' Republicans have been all over the lot
since, united only in resistance to the detailed Clinton reform plan. The
fear, sometimes acknowledged by Mr Dole and occasionally exploited by Mr
Clinton, is of being blamed for blocking any bill, although the hard right
would not mind this at all.
Mr Kevin Phillips, former Republican strategist who publishes the American
Political Report newsletter, sees dangerous historical parallels, with risk
of 'incipient fratricide'.
He writes: 'Keep in mind that when parties that have held the White House
for two terms or more lose it, their next nomination race is often wide
open, bloody and unproductive - the Democrats in 1924, the Republicans in
1936, the GOP in 1964 and the Democrats in 1972. That is the sort of
situation the GOP seems headed towards. . . too many contenders with no
obvious strong choice.'
Unless, of course, one of them catches fire - or the economy or Mr Clinton
self-destructs.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Bentsen gives assurance on dollar
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said yesterday the feeling that
Washington was content to see the dollar drop in value was a
'misrepresentation,' Reuter reports from New York.
'There was a misinterpretation that we wanted to see the dollar go down,' Mr
Bentsen told CBS television. He said the Clinton administration 'saw no
value in undervaluing the dollar'.
While Mr Bentsen did not say outright that the administration opposed an
increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, he said it should be
determined 'by the market and underlying economic factors'.
He said that he felt short-term interest rates would be up one-half point by
the end of the year to 4 per cent.
Referring to the Federal Reserve's two recent quarter-point rate increases,
Mr Bentsen said: 'It seems we have reached a point where no good (economic)
numbers go unpunished.'
On Friday, Mr Bentsen said he shared the Federal Reserve Board's goal of
promoting low-inflationary economic growth.
'Let me just say that Alan Greenspan (chairman of the Federal Reserve) and I
share the goal of steady, well grounded, low inflationary growth,' Mr
Bentsen told the Business Council, a meeting of top business executives.
'I think that's what we have and the Fed is just being cautious to make
certain it stays that way,' he added.
Financial markets have been on edge anticipating more interest rate rises by
the US central bank.
Mr Bentsen acknowledged that long-term interest rates have moved up in the
past few months. 'But it's worth noting that what's behind rates is growth,'
he said.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Gun crime rises sharply in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Violent crimes committed with handguns set a record in the US in 1992,
soaring almost 50 per cent from the annual average during the previous five
years, Reuter reports from Washington.
The Justice Department said yesterday that handguns had been used in 931,000
murders, rapes, robberies and assaults in 1992.
This was up from an annual average of 667,000 from 1987 to 1991.
Handgun crimes accounted for an increased percentage - now about 13 per cent
 -of all violent crimes, it said.
The figures - from the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics - were
released as the Clinton administration and Congress are considering new ways
to restrict guns to cut down on rampant inner-city violence.
President Bill Clinton has already signed into law the so-called Brady Bill
requiring a five-day waiting period for the purchase of handguns.
He has also vigorously supported legislation banning a number of assault
weapons.
Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, has advocated gun licensing and is
considering whether to propose such a system nationwide.
The department's report said the number of murders with a handgun totalled
13,200 in 1992, a 24 per cent jump from the five-year average.
The murder numbers were based on FBI crime statistics. The other statistics,
from a nationwide crime victims' survey, also showed dramatic increases for
robberies and assaults involving a handgun.
The only crime category to show a decrease was rape, with handguns used in
11,800 cases in 1992, down from the previous annual average of 14,000.
The report also found that:
Males were twice as likely as females to be victims of handgun crimes, and
blacks three times as likely as whites.
Young, black males were most vulnerable to handgun crimes. Among males
16-to-19 years old, the most victimised age group, the crime rate for blacks
was four times higher than for whites.
For rapes, burglaries and assaults, the offenders fired their weapons in 17
per cent of the crimes and missed the victim four out of five times.
Only 1 per cent of the violent crime victims used a firearm in an effort to
defend themselves. Of those who used a weapon, one out of five suffered an
injury in the incident.

FT  16 MAY 94 / World's whales worth more alive than dead: International
Whaling Commission meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whales are worth more alive than dead, UK and US officials will argue when
they meet in Mexico tomorrow ahead of the annual meeting of the
International Whaling Commission.
Potential revenues from whale watching - an increasingly popular form of
tourism - could soon reach several hundred million pounds worldwide,
officials are likely to claim.
The issue is likely to be one of the flashpoints at this year's meeting,
whose formal sessions begin next week.
The break-up of the IWC - which regulates the catching of the 12 species of
'great whale' - is possible if growing disputes between whaling and
non-whaling countries are not resolved, environmentalists have warned.
Iceland has already left the IWC in protest at the body's moratorium on
commercial whaling, introduced in 1986. Last year Norway declared that it
was not bound by the moratorium, while Japan continues to press for the ban
to be lifted.
Countries with strong animal rights traditions, such as the UK and US, have
begun exploring whether potential revenues from whale watching will prove a
powerful enough argument to block the resumption of commercial whaling.
Controversy at this year's meeting will also focus on:
Proposals for a whale sanctuary around Antarctica.
Japan's demand for a quota of 50 whales to be caught in its coastal waters
this year.
The reliability of the 'revised management procedure', the IWC's complex
model of how many whales could be caught without damaging stocks.
Proposals for the southern sanctuary are officially sponsored by the UK, the
US, France and Australia, but agreement may be elusive given fierce
opposition from Japan and from some non-whaling Caribbean countries which
have sided with Japan on past contentious issues.
The Japanese request for a 50-whale quota - in addition to its plans to
catch around 300 whales for scientific research - will also attract
opposition. Some countries argue that the quota, intended to help coastal
villages, does not qualify as aboriginal whaling, which is permitted by the
IWC.
However, the fiercest rows are likely to centre on the scientific model for
'sustainable whaling.'
Norway argues that the model, which has had years of development, would
never allow so many whales to be caught that stocks would be jeopardised.
However, the UK is pressing for more research, in the light of new evidence
that the former Soviet Union seriously under-reported the number of whales
it caught in the 1960s and 1970s.
Some non-whaling countries have indicated that even if the IWC approves the
model they may not back commercial harvesting of whales. Methods for
'humane' killing and for verifying the numbers caught still remain to be
settled, they argue.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Hint of flexibility in Syria peace talks: Christopher starts
shuttle in Damascus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DAMASCUS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, arrived last night in
Damascus on a mini-shuttle that US officials hope can produce discernible
progress in talks between Israel and Syria, amid a rare official hint of
possible flexibility from Syria.
Mr Christopher went straight into talks with Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian
president, and Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, his foreign minister, and is expected to
travel on within the next 24 hours to Jerusalem. US officials said they then
expect Mr Christopher to return for further talks in Damascus.
The intensity of the shuttle, coming just two weeks after Mr Christopher's
last visit to Damascus, indicates US determination to achieve progress on
the Israeli-Syrian front following the Israeli-Palestine Liberation
Organisation agreement earlier this month to implement the first stages of
limited Palestinian self-rule.
Mr Christopher's prompt return also suggests Syria believes there is
something to be discussed, despite the fact that Israeli and Syrian
negotiators have not met face-to-face since the last round of
Washington-hosted peace talks in September last year. Negotiations have
since proceeded primarily through US mediation, both in Mr Christopher's two
previous shuttles and in the Geneva summit earlier this year between
President Bill Clinton and Mr Assad.
Mr Christopher will certainly seek Syrian commitment to accept the
longstanding US invitation to resume bilateral talks with Israel in
Washington. But there are signs his mediation is itself making progress.
After his last trip on the eve of the May 4 US-PLO deal, Mr Christopher
spoke of the Israeli-Syrian track having entered a new 'substantive' phase.
Mr Christopher will also visit Jericho, the West Bank town newly handed over
by Israel to limited Palestinian authority, during the shuttle, US officials
said yesterday. The visit will be the first by any international statesman
to the new areas of limited Palestinian self-rule.
After his last shuttle, Syria rejected an Israeli proposal for an Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights staged over a number of years. Syrian
officials instead repeated Mr Assad's firm demand that a peace deal could
come only after an Israeli commitment to full and immediate withdrawal from
the heights, which it has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
However, Tishreen, the state newspaper, yesterday signalled a possible
softening on the question, saying that Syria was ready to reach a deal with
Israel if it concluded 'a clear commitment for withdrawal from the whole of
the Golan within a reasonable and acceptable period of time'.
Diplomats in Damascus said that while the question of a phased Israeli
withdrawal has long been privately aired, it has seldom been officially
referred to so directly or positively. 'It is certainly a sign of more
flexibility,' said one. Most observers believe Syria would insist on a
phased withdrawal over months, rather than the several years suggested by
Israel.
However, few observers in Damascus expect Mr Christopher's visit to achieve
a public breakthrough. For this, Israel is still requiring Mr Assad to spell
out in detail what he means by a 'full peace' with Syria, while Mr Assad in
turn wants Israel to make an unequivocal statement of willingness to return
the Golan to Syrian sovereignty and withdraw from it entirely.
Moreover, Syria is also determined to wrest bilateral concessions from the
US in return for delivering a deal with Israel - a matter which will
certainly feature in Mr Christopher's talks.

FT  16 MAY 94 / Gunshots and 20 checkpoints on hazardous road to Aden: Eric
Watkins' epic journey from Sanaa ends in frustration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sitting in the dark with two armed guards at my back, I was beginning to
wonder whether my efforts to reach Aden had been worthwhile. I had travelled
nearly 600 miles in two days from Sanaa, the capital in northern Yemen,
bluffing my way through more than 20 military checkpoints, and two sets of
front lines in the civil war between northern and southern Yemeni forces.
Then, with the Gulf of Aden in view, I was nabbed by northern military
forces who accused me of espionage. In the company of a French journalist, I
had headed south. Northern troops, we had heard, were rapidly approaching
Aden and were soon likely to enter the city.
From the south, however, we had heard nothing. Communications between north
and south had been cut and Aden Radio was off the air.
As we wound through back roads to avoid the first military checkpoint, our
guide told us to invent a story to get us through later checkpoints.
Our first test came quickly. A few miles up the road, an armed soldier
flagged us down. He demanded to know who we were. 'Oil men,' our guide,
Mahmoud, said. 'They don't speak Arabic.'
The story held up mile after mile. But the strain had got to Mahmoud who
declined to go on with us. Resting in the lobby of a hotel in Mareb, north
of Aden, I was soon joined by officials, who had brought along AK-47s.
'Good afternoon,' said one, extending his hand. 'I'm the chief of police
here and this is the head of the petroleum board. Are you the BBC
journalist?'
'No, I'm with the Financial Times.' I explained that we had heard northern
broadcasts claiming that southern jets had bombed the oilfields at Mareb.
'Oh no,' he said, 'that has never happened. Last week one jet buzzed the
town and soldiers fired at it. But the jet dropped no bombs.'
After producing my press pass and a copy of the Yemeni press law, and
answering 'not at all' to the question 'are you doing anything illegal?', we
got approving nods. 'Well,' the police officer said, 'just take care. There
is plenty of trouble on the road.'
He was not wrong. A couple of miles along the road, two young tribesmen
tried to wave us down. Our driver sped on past them. Looking back, I saw one
of the tribesmen raise his rifle, aim, and fire. He missed us. He shot again
and missed.
Our journey had so far revealed few signs of war, apart from the occasional
military patrol and the odd tank here and there, half-camouflaged in the
golden sands. But people along the way assured us the desert was full of
soldiers and urged us along our way.
Located some 300 miles to the south-east of Sanaa, Ataq is a dreary little
town, a motley collection of concrete buildings. But it had an airport and
had become important over the past two years as a transit point for the
eastern oil fields.
Ataq's strategic importance had been underlined by unconfirmed reports of a
major battle there just days before. Ataq was clearly in the hands of
southern forces. Armed soldiers at the checkpoint entering town examined our
papers thoroughly, climbed into our vehicle, and ordered us to drive to
central security headquarters.
Within minutes, the chief told us there had been no battle at Ataq. Four
northern jets had tried to bomb the airport, but they had missed. One
aircraft was shot down. The chief agreed to our travel plans and gladly
provided us with an an official pass showing our names and professions, and
an itinerary.
The next morning, we waited an hour on the main road before getting a ride.
A local man was cashing in on the war by charging exorbitant rates to taxi
people around. We piled into the car, followed by half a dozen other people.
Coming round a bend, we were stopped by military police. Their leader
spotted a young lad and ordered him out of the car. 'You're a soldier and
belong with us,' he bellowed, pulling the boy from his seat. The lad was
frightened. He was in tears. He was begging to be released. The officer held
on to him and waved us through.
Farther along the commander of a southern brigade said we were free to
travel, but he advised against it. 'The northerners occupy the road below,'
he said.
We pressed on, the road now becoming clogged with southern tanks and heavy
trucks coming towards us.
They were, perhaps, in a tactical retreat, moving in an orderly procession
to join their comrades behind us. We soon reached the battlefield, the road
littered with charred and abandoned vehicles. A northern brigade, we were
told, had defeated the southerners and secured the area.
By early afternoon we had progressed well, moving along in a series of lifts
in handy vehicles. Just a few miles more and we would be overlooking Shuqra,
a small town on the Gulf of Aden. And there, we hoped, we could hire a small
boat to take us the remaining 60 miles into Aden.
But our luck failed. A northern military patrol sped past in the opposite
direction.
We thought nothing of it. Minutes later it sped back to stop us. An officer
jumped out and came to the side of our latest pick-up truck. The searches
and interrogations lasted nearly eight hours. A young officer began by going
through our bags.
Hours later they were still worried about the absence of film in our
cameras. They insisted we had taken photos along the way and had handed the
films to southern forces for onward transmission to Aden. Two armed guards
were told to watch us. In the distance, flashes of light intermittently
illuminated the sky, followed by ominous rumblings.
After accepting that we had no offending films, in the early hours of the
morning, they drove us back northward in a pick-up truck with six armed
guards and a heavy machine gun. They asked for references in Sanaa, and I
though of giving them the home number of the president, General Ali Abdullah
Saleh.
But that seemed a bit too much. Would the name of the president's personal
advisor be enough? It was. They released us with apologies for the
inconvenience. There was no inconvenience, we said, apart from the theft of
some of our equipment and the failure to get to Aden.

<TEXT>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees yesterday appealed to the
warring sides in Yemen to let an urgently needed convoy reach a camp where
Somali refugees have been killed in the civil war crossfire, AP reports from
Geneva.
The agency has been trying since the middle of last week to send the trucks
with food, medicine and other supplies to Al Koud camp, 50km east of Aden.
It said it had been unable to confirm the number of Somali refugees killed
since open fighting erupted between northern and southern forces in Yemen on
May 4.
But camp elders had reported the death toll at 175, with an unknown number
wounded.
Previous estimates said between 100 and 270 had been killed.
A team representing the UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red
Cross reached the camp from Sanaa on Saturday and found only 1,500 refugees
left out of a population estimated at 6,000. The rest have fled to a nearby
village or into the surrounding countryside.
Refugees told the team that uniformed men had taken batteries and generators
that had been used to pump water to the camp and had confiscated their food,
leaving the camp with little or no water, food and medical supplies.
The team brought in only four boxes of ICRC medical supplies, and much more
was needed, the UNHCR said.
A second team from Aden that has been trying to reach the camp with the
convoy will try again today.
The camp was set up to house 10,000 Somali boat people who fled the civil
war in their own homeland two years ago across the Gulf of Aden.
About 4,000 refugees are believed to have moved into Aden before the
fighting began.

Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, signalled the end of a
debilitating week-long political impasse over a proposed cabinet reshuffle
by calling an extraordinary cabinet meeting for today.
His decision ends a week in which Mr Hariri 'withdrew' from his duties as
prime minister in protest at opposition, predominantly from Mr Elias Hrawi,
Lebanon's president, to his proposals for enlarging Christian influence in
the cabinet.
It follows a weekend trip by Mr Hariri to Syria, Lebanon's powerful
neighbour, which retains 35,000 troops in the country, during which he held
talks with Mr Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president.
Lebanese officials would not say what resolution had been reached to
persuade Mr Hariri to end his 'strike', but said a solution to the crisis
would be discussed at today's meeting. Mr Hrawi and Mr Nabhi Berri, speaker
of Lebanon's parliament, had objected to Mr Hariri's proposal to introduce
two senior Maronite Christians into the cabinet and had complained at his
appointment of close aides.
The impasse hurt confidence in the Lebanese pound, requiring the central
bank to spend an estimated Dollars 200m (Pounds 137m) to steady the
currency.

FT  16 MAY 94 / India curbs lending to help control inflation: The
authorities are sensitive to the dangers of rapid price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, at the weekend imposed curbs on
bank lending in order to help contain rising inflation but has left interest
rates unchanged to prevent stifling industry.
The central bank aims to cut the inflation rate, as measured by the
wholesale price index, by four percentage points from its current level of
over 11 per cent a year, said Mr C Rangarajan, the governor, after a board
meeting on Saturday.
The board met to determine credit policy for the period to the end of
September amid mounting concern about inflation which has risen from a low
of under 7 per cent last summer to over 11 per cent recently.
But with interest rates high by international standards and industry only
just beginning to recover from prolonged stagnation, the central bank's
directors felt they could not tighten monetary policy much. They judged that
after cutting rates four times in the year to February 1994, bringing the
lending rate down to 14 per cent, it was too early to start raising rates.
Instead of increasing interest rates the central bank has lifted by one
percentage point the cash reserve ratio - the proportion of deposits which
commercial banks must deposit at the central bank. Controls on export
finance are also being tightened. With the help of these measures, the
central bank hopes to reduce the rate of increase in the money supply from
an estimated 17.9 per cent for the year ending in March 1994 to 14-15 per
cent for 1994-95.
Mr Rangarajan said after the meeting that he would not hesitate to act more
aggressively if inflation continued to rise further then expected. He
thought the rate of increase would level off after another two months.
Inflation has been pushed up in recent months by a combination of price
increases in important commodity markets, including sugar, edible oils and
cotton, and of financial pressures. The flood of foreign exchange coming
into India, fuelled by increases in foreign portfolio investment, has raised
foreign exchange reserves to a record level of Dollars 17bn, (Pounds 11.6bn)
compared with about Dollars 1bn in mid-1991 when a balance-of-payments
crisis forced India to take emergency loans from the International Monetary
Fund and start wide-ranging economic reforms.
The inflationary impact of this inflow has been compounded by high levels of
government borrowing. The fiscal deficit for the year ended in March rose to
7.3 per cent, against a target of 4.6 per cent and the target for this year
has been set at a generous 6 per cent. Even though Mr Rangarajan said that
the government has kept its borrowings well under control in the first few
weeks of the new financial year, some economists doubt whether the
discipline will be maintained.
With important state elections due later this year and early next year, the
ruling Congress (I) party will be tempted to overspend rather than
underspend the budget, particularly on subsidies to farmers.
India has generally been more successful than many developing countries in
controlling inflation. Prices rose by an annual average of just over 8 per
cent in the 1980s. The inflation rate soared during the 1991 economic crisis
to a 13.7 per cent, but, with the help of curbs in public spending, fell
sharply to 8.2 per cent for 1993-94.
However, with so many poor people, the country cannot accept sustained high
levels of price increases without bringing hardship and the risk of civil
unrest. The authorities therefore tend to be very sensitive to the dangers
of inflation.
Whether they succeed in curbing price increases this time will depend
largely on how the government manages its budget in the face of political
pressures. The IMF, in its recent report, the World Economic Outlook,
singled out inflation and a weakening of fiscal management as 'troubling
features'.
