FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Recovery lifts Royal Insurance to Pounds
32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Insurance, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 32m for the first three months of 1994,
further underlining the recovery of the sector after its heavy losses
between 1990 and 1992.
The result compared with a Pounds 2m profit last year, and followed positive
figures earlier this week from both General Accident and Commercial Union.
Like its rivals, Royal was hit by a decline in the value of its investment
in both bonds and equities over the quarter, with the group's solvency
margin - which measures shareholders' funds as a percentage of non-life
premium income - falling to 54 per cent (60 per cent).
Also like its competitors, Royal's better operating performance mainly
reflected continuing improvements in the UK, where the underwriting profit
of Pounds 10m (Pounds 41m loss) was Royal's best start to the year since
1989.
Excluding the reduction in its reinsurance operations, which Royal has
scaled back, underlying general insurance income in the UK rose by 6 per
cent. Rate increases are still being achieved in commercial lines, and
pricing has been stabilised in personal lines.
In the US, Royal was hit by losses from winter weather of Pounds 31m and
from the Los Angeles earthquake of Pounds 17m. Overall, underwriting losses
in the US climbed from Dollars 94m to Dollars 131m (Pounds 90m), with the
operating ratio (claims plus expenses as a percentage of premiums) reaching
134.3 per cent (123.7 per cent). The ratio on US householders' business rose
to 206.8 per cent (147.9 per cent).
At group level general insurance premium income amounted to Pounds 846m
(Pounds 909m). Life income was Pounds 92m (Pounds 94m). Underwriting losses
were Pounds 96m (Pounds 129m).

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J explains bid recommendation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the lossmaking Poundstretcher chain of discount
stores, said yesterday it was recommending a rescue offer from Pepkor, of
South Africa, because the group offered greater financial security and
retailing experience.
B&amp;J had previously recommended a capital injection by the Weisfelds, the
millionaire couple who created the What Everyone Wants discount clothing
chain.
The Weisfelds had offered to inject an initial Pounds 6m, in return for a 19
per cent stake and two seats on the board. If their investment had reached
its proposed maximum of about Pounds 28m, their stake would have reached 42
per cent.
Pepkor has proposed injecting an initial Pounds 20m, but will receive a 63
per cent stake if it puts in the full Pounds 56.2m proposed.
In a circular B&amp;J said the Pepkor offer included an offer of trade finance
of up to Pounds 12m, which would allow the group to pay off its bank loans.
The Weisfeld's plan included a bank guarantee of up to Pounds 3m, but
further facilities until the end of this year would be subject to strict
conditions.
B&amp;J said these conditions would be costly and create a climate of continuing
uncertainty. Pepkor's offer of finance arrangements with a five-year term
would reduce the uncertainty and greatly increase the ease with which the
business could be managed.
The circular said that the experience in variety discount retailing offered
by Pepkor is greater than that of Mr and Mrs Weisfeld and will in the long
term outweigh the contribution that the Weisfelds' experience is likely to
make to a business of the nature and scale of B&amp;J.
Mr Christo Wiese, Pepkor's chairman, said B&amp;J, represents a discount store
chain with good volume and market share. It is an established brand within
the discount market and has an established supply and distribution network.

FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland at IPounds 280m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A substantial drop in loan loss provisions and a turnround in its US and UK
divisions were the main factors behind a IPounds 156m (Pounds 152.4m) surge
in pre-tax profits at Bank of Ireland, the Republic's second largest
clearing bank.
The group reported sharply higher pre-tax profits of IPounds 280.1m on total
income up 17 per cent to IPounds 983m (IPounds 841m) for the year ending
March 31. This included IPounds 13.5m in profits resulting from the
harmonisation of accounting dates of certain subsidiaries.
Group loan loss provisions have fallen from IPounds 150m to IPounds 69m. The
biggest drop was in its First New Hampshire subsidiary where provisions fell
from IPounds 66m to just IPounds 7m. FNH put in profits of IPounds 11.2m,
its first contribution since it was acquired in 1988.
Interest income grew by 16 per cent to IPounds 646m, while other income  -
derived mainly from fees and commissions - rose by 18 per cent to IPounds
337m.
Operating expenses increased 12 per cent to IPounds 631m (IPounds 564m),
although the underlying increase was only 2.9 per cent after adjusting for
exchange translations.
Corporate and treasury operations showed a 6 per cent decline in profits to
IPounds 61.2m after an exceptionally good year in 1992-93 when the ERM
currency crisis resulted in a sharp boost of activity.
A strong performance was also recorded by other activities, primarily in
Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages in the UK and by life assurance and
investment services. Their contribution to group profits jumped from IPounds
3.5m to IPounds 58.3m.
The Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio improved to 7.9 per cent (6.6 per cent).
Mr Pat Molloy, group chief executive, said that expansion of its retail
banking operations into the continental European market 'has been looked at'
but ruled out, and that further growth in the group would therefore focus in
its existing markets in Ireland, the UK and the US.
He would neither conform nor deny that the bank was looking to buy a large
mortgage portfolio in the UK from another institution, but said: 'We have
been very encouraged by the success of BIHM in the UK and we expect to see
substantial further growth in this market . . . I am open-minded about an
acquisition.'
Earnings were 35.2p (12.8p). A final dividend of 6.75p makes a total of
10.5p (9.83p).
COMMENT
After several years of poor performance, Bank of Ireland is once again
firing on all cylinders having finally cleaned up the mess it drove into at
full speed in New Hampshire. Steady earnings growth should result as its
main markets all emerge from recession, with pre-tax profits of IPounds 300m
and earnings of some 38p attainable in the current year. This puts the group
on a prospective p/e of 6.9, which places it at the low end of the financial
sector, which is hard to justify given its strong turnround and good
business prospects.

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Winterflood to trade gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Winterflood Securities, the smaller companies marketmaker owned by Close
Brothers, plans to move into trading UK government bonds this August.
The company has already started hiring gilt traders and is hoping to obtain
permission from the Bank of England to join the ranks of gilt-edged market
makers (Gemms).
Mr Brian Winterflood, chairman of Winterflood Securities, said the intention
was to specialise in private client business and 'smaller deals'. At
present, only a handful of the Gemms carry out small deals for private
investors, and many gilt market participants claim the business is
uneconomical. 'It doesn't pay them to do these small bargains: some Gemms
quote (prices) to miss, but we'll be quoting to deal,' claimed Mr
Winterflood yesterday.
Mr Adrian Ireland, formerly at SG Warburg Securities, has become head of
trading.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Price pressure clouds outlook for Mercury: The UK telecoms
company's discount strategy is threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury, the god of commerce, is sometimes depicted holding a purse full of
cash. The UK telecommunications company bearing his name could do with both
the purse and his more customary winged sandals to aid it in the
increasingly competitive UK telecoms market.
A study of industry price trends published yesterday by Analysys, the
Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, highlights Mercury's predicament. It
shows telecoms prices falling fast across Europe in the past five years; in
Britain, Mercury's price differential with BT has progressively reduced.
This raises questions about Mercury's future strategy, for until now it has
essentially been 'BT-minus-about-10-per-cent'. Recognising telecoms as a
commodity business, Mercury has sought to maintain a guaranteed discount to
BT, making little pretense of offering a more advanced service. pressure on
Mercury's price discount to BT can only increase. On the one hand BT is
being forced to cut prices rapidly: its pricing agreement with Oftel, the
industry regulator, obliges it to cut tariffs by 7.5 per cent a year after
allowing for inflation.
On the other hand, new entrants to the UK's long-distance telecoms market
are targeting Mercury as strongly as BT. Re-sellers such as Worldcom, a US
group, and Energis, the National Grid subsidiary which is erecting a
fibre-optic network on the nation's electricity pylons, are aiming to enter
the City of London, where Mercury is now the dominant long-distance carrier.
The first six months of the current financial year saw Mercury's turnover
rise by 24 per cent; but operating profit grew by only 5 per cent, notably
less than the other companies in the Cable &amp; Wireless group of which it is
part. Special factors - including the opening of a state-of-the-art customer
service centre in Manchester - partly account for the squeeze, but leading
analysts remain downbeat about Mercury's medium-term prospects.
'There is considerable uncertainty about the outlook for Mercury's profits
in the next two years,' says Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst with
Robert Fleming, the investment bank. He notes in particular Mercury's
surprising decision last December to take Oftel, the industry regulator, to
court over the inter-connection charges it has to pay BT. 'They would not
take the regulator to court unless they felt seriously in need of regulatory
relief.'
Mercury's justification for the court case supports that view. It claims it
needs a more flexible inter-connection regime, based on total capacity not
the per-minute cost of connecting calls, to break free of BT's tariff
structure. Implicit is the recognition that its ability to continue
mimicking BT tariffs, while guaranteeing a discount, is finite.
The nightmare for Mercury would be if BT mimicked Telecom New Zealand, which
last year took on its main competitor - Clear Communications - by ruthlessly
attacking its cost base and matching Clear's tariffs.
Telecom New Zealand reacted to Clear's 18 per cent market share gained in
barely two years. With almost 90 per cent of the UK market, BT is unlikely
to take such action in the near future. Even so, existing pressures mean
that to sustain growth Mercury needs to increase rapidly its market share
while differentiating its product from that offered by BT.
Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, emphasises a second dimension.
'There is a new game opening up, with telecoms companies selling not just a
commodity but communications applications.' He divides the applications into
two types: the management of quasi-private networks - outsourcing, in the
jargon; and new services, such as personal telephone numbers which direct
calls to their 'owner', made available by 'intelligent networks' software.
Last month Mercury announced a Pounds 200m investment in 'Project Eagle' to
upgrade its backbone UK network for the purpose.
Both strategies command respect. Armed with the resources of Cable &amp;
Wireless and Bell Canada (which owns 20 per cent of Mercury), Mr Harris is
far from David on his own with Goliath. Mercury has been successful in
branding itself. And it has also done a fair job of weaning customers from
BT: in the past two years alone it has gained more than 600,000 residential
customers, aided by the - mostly US - cable companies attacking BT's local
monopoly and routing their long-distance traffic via Mercury.
But Mercury's strategy remains problematic. The outsourcing market is
largely speculative: recent surveys show companies reluctant to outsource
central telecoms functions.
As for next-generation 'intelligent networks' services, the capacity of any
one company to gain a medium-term leading edge in the market is doubtful.

FT  13 MAY 94 / NatWest enters Hong Kong broking venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank is to re-establish an equity broking operation in
Hong Kong three years after closing its broking arm there. It is setting up
a Dollars 100m (Pounds 68.4m) joint venture with Wheelock, the local
merchant house.
The venture, which will initially employ about 100, is the latest attempt by
European and US investment banks to expand in Hong Kong and China.
Although NatWest Markets, National Westminster's corporate and investment
banking arm, already has lending, structured finance and fund management
operations in Hong Kong, the venture re-establishes a stockbroking presence.
The partners are to announce the deal in London today. They are each
investing about Dollars 50m and expect that the operation, to be called
Wheelock NatWest, will not require further capital unless it expands
greatly.
Wheelock, which already has links in China as a Hong Kong trading house, has
wanted to expand into financial services. At the moment, it has a small
broking operation with a seat on the Hong Kong exchange.
Mr Martin Owen, NatWest Markets chief executive, said that the bank believed
that setting up a joint venture would help it to overcome any local
scepticism caused by its decision to close down in loss-making broking arm
in 1991. Mr John Howland-Jackson, deputy chief executive of NatWest Markets,
said that it considered buying a local broking house, but 'we believed that
we would either end up paying through the nose or buying something of
questionable quality'.
Mr Nicholas Sibley, managing director of Wheelock CIC, who will be deputy
chairman of the venture, said it was the only venture 'which marries a
heavyweight bank with a local house which has as good connections in China
as anybody'.
Wheelock has already applied for a seat on the Shanghai stock exchange,
which would be transferred to the joint venture if approved.
Mr Owen said that while NatWest Markets could distribute equity globally, it
believed that it would have been 'a long, hard struggle' to establish a
strong underwriting arm in Hong Kong without Wheelock's connections.

FT  13 MAY 94 / 3i plans to offer a quarter of share issue to retail
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3i Group, the venture capital group owned by high street banks, expects a
quarter of the shares it is selling in the planned early summer flotation to
be available to retail investors, senior directors said yesterday.
Sir George Russell, chairman, said it had canvassed about 100 retail
brokers, and believed there would be interest among more sophisticated
investors in buying up to 25 per cent of the shares.
The company expects to publish its pathfinder prospectus giving details of
the offer later this month, along with preliminary annual results. This will
disclose a net asset value figure on which the share price will be based.
Mr Simon Borrows, a director of Baring Brothers, the merchant bank
sponsoring the flotation, said shares would 'probably' be priced at a
discount to 3i's net asset value. He said the company and its advisers had
not 'got to the stage of pricing' but he emphasised that 3i's past
performance had been better than comparable quoted venture capital
investment trusts.
Mr Borrows said brokers would target shares at individuals who would invest
'a reasonable amount for a reasonable amount of time'. 3i expects bank
shareholders to undertake to hold their remaining stakes after the float for
at least a year.
The company has made presentations to about 70 UK institutional funds, and
is to make more throughout Europe.
Mr Borrows said the company and its advisers would go through 'an informal
book-building exercise' after the publication of the pathfinder prospectus
to gauge demand for shares at different prices.
The banks are likely to sell about a third of 3i's equity, which could be
worth about Pounds 500m, in the flotation. The group expects all the main
shareholders to retain some holding, including the Bank of England, which
has a 14.5 per cent stake.

FT  13 MAY 94 / GEC agrees to buy Ferranti defence units from receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC has reached final agreement to buy Ferranti's main UK defence businesses
from the receivers, Arthur Andersen. An announcement on the sale is expected
today.
The price, which has not been disclosed, was apparently agreed in advance
and is thought to be around Pounds 50m.
The package of businesses to be sold to GEC remains essentially unaltered
from the start of negotiations in March. It includes the military systems
integration business, based in Bracknell, Berkshire, which employs 570
people, and the simulation and training operations with headquarters at
Cwmbran, Wales, with 540 employees.
There have been redundancies in both operations since Ferranti went into
receivership last December after GEC withdrew its 1p a share offer for the
whole company. However, most of the 630 redundancies were at Ferranti's
Manchester and Oldham sites.
Negotiations had been expected to be completed in April, but had to be
extended to allow further time for due diligence work.
A management buy-out team had been ready to bid for the business had GEC
withdrawn. Several other potential bidders were also thought to be
interested, including British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF of France.
GEC is also in separate negotiations to buy Ferranti's 50 per cent share in
its sonar joint venture with Thomson. That business is not in receivership
and Thomson is expected to exercise its pre-emption rights to buy the
Ferranti shareholding. It will then be passed on to GEC in a simultaneous
transaction.
The Ministry of Defence was thought to be unhappy about a crucial technology
for Britain's nuclear submarines passing completely into foreign hands. GEC
was thus considered by analysts to be the preferred buyer.
Ferranti's components manufacturing plant at Cairo Mill in Oldham remains
with the receivers. It produces complex printed circuit boards, avionics
equipment for military aircraft, and designs military equipment from
helicopter sites to sophisticated anti-tank and anti-helicopter mines.
The receivers have decided not to sell this business at present, as it is
undergoing changes to improve profitability.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Fall in US drink sales hits GrandMet: International food
group keeps its options open on the future of struggling IEL joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Grand Metropolitan, the international drinks and food giant, fell
26p to 457p yesterday as the group disclosed that de-stocking in the US
drinks market was likely to cost it Pounds 40m this year. The group also
dashed hopes of immediate disentanglement from its struggling Inntrepreneur
Estates (IEL) joint venture with Courage, saying only that it was 'studying
a range of options'. IEL, Britain's biggest pub operator, broke even in the
half compared with a loss of Pounds 12m last year.
Group pre-tax profits were up 10 per cent at Pounds 446m, in line with
expectations.
Mr George Bull, chief executive, said the revival of the US economy had
prompted GrandMet's IDV drinks subsidiary to stock up last autumn in the
hope of increased sales. In fact, the market had fallen 3 per cent and IDV's
sales by 2 per cent. At the same time, IDV had tackled overstocking problems
caused by concentration among US drinks wholesalers. 'We decided that now
was the moment to grab the nettle,' Mr Bull said. Half the cost had been
incurred in the first half, with the balance to come in the second.
IDV's worldwide operating profit fell 2 per cent to Pounds 254m, with an 18
per cent rise in North America offset by a 13 per cent fall in the rest of
the world. The North American increase was almost wholly due to a one-off
payment of around Pounds 17m on the termination of US distribution rights
for Absolut vodka.
GrandMet said IDV's longer-term prospects were better than at any time in
the past decade. 'The market we're selling in has the capacity to double.
China and India alone are providing 500m new drinkers who weren't available
to us two years ago,' said Mr Bull.
Operating profit in food manufacture rose 6 per cent to Pounds 147m, with a
19 per cent increase in North America while Europe fell into a Pounds 3m
loss, from Pounds 1m profit. Mr Bull said the improvement in the US was
strategically very important. 'We've done a lot of work straightening it
out, and it's now starting to pay off.'
Profits at the Burger King hamburger chain were up 16 per cent, with 244 new
restaurants opened and 5 per cent volume growth in existing outlets.
The Pearle opticians chain broke even, after a Pounds 2m loss. GrandMet
aimed to return the business to modest profit, then sell it.
The tax charge fell from 32.4 per cent to 29.2 per cent. Mr Gerald Corbett,
finance director, said restructuring of group borrowings to take advantage
of tax losses would cut the tax charge by some Pounds 30m this year and for
three or four years thereafter. Lower tax helped earnings per share to rise
15 per cent to 15.0p before exceptionals. The dividend was raised 6.2 per
cent to 5.15p.
Free cashflow was Pounds 232m (Pounds 95m), due largely to falls in working
capital, interest charges and capital expenditure. Net borrowings were
Pounds 2.4bn down Pounds 460m. This reduced gearing from 83 per cent to 62
per cent including intangibles. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman, said funds
from cashflow and disposals would be spent on add-on acquisitions in branded
food and drink, on which GrandMet had already spent Pounds 350m in the half
year.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Visible trade deficit narrows to Pounds 731m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade balance may be improving, it emerged yesterday, with figures
showing the surprise narrowing of February's deficit.
The slight closing of February's deficit - to a seasonally adjusted Pounds
731m from January's Pounds 880m shortfall - was greeted with relief in the
City, which had predicted a widening to about Pounds 1.1bn.
The Central Statistical Office also released a government review which
revised the 1993 deficit figures by a smaller-than-expected amount.
The news helped to lift sterling by nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark
in London to close at DM2.5052.
After a sweeping analysis of the new system used to collect trade data in
the European Union, known as Intrastat, the CSO said UK imports from the EU
had been revised up by Pounds 300m - lifting last year's visible trade
deficit to Pounds 13.7bn from Pounds 13.4bn previously. The City had
expected to see a significant deterioration in the 1993 UK trade balance of
about Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn.
But some market analysts yesterday remained unconvinced by the review. They
warned that February's improvement partly reflected record oil exports. If
oil and other erratic items are excluded from the February figure, the
deficit widened to Pounds 1.34bn in the month from Pounds 1.29bn in January.
The three-monthly balance - regarded as the more accurate indicator of
trends - showed an improvement in the deficit to Pounds 3.02bn for the three
months to February from Pounds 3.58bn during the previous three months.
February's smaller-than-expected deficit was largely brought about by a drop
in imports, which fell 3 per cent, compared with a 1.8 per cent fall in
exports.
Coming after five months of strong import figures, some economists suggest
this indicates a slight easing in the pace of UK recovery. Others believe UK
industry may be replacing imported goods in home markets.
The Treasury welcomed the figures. 'This should ease commentators' worries
that the balance of payments will be a constraint on performance,' it said.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the figures showed a 'pretty stable
performance'.

FT  13 MAY 94 / US Senate votes to defy arms to Bosnia embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate voted yesterday for the US to break the United Nations embargo
on arms shipments to the Bosnian Moslem government, adding to pressure on
President Bill Clinton to become more aggressively involved in the Bosnian
conflict.
By a single vote margin, the Senate passed a resolution proposed by Senator
Robert Dole, the Republican leader, to prohibit the administration from
blocking shipments of conventional weapons to the Bosnian government. The
Senate also voted for a less radical measure, backed by the administration,
calling for efforts to persuade America's allies to agree to lift the arms
embargo.
The vote is unlikely to have any immediate impact on US policy, since it
would first have to come to a vote in the House of Representatives and could
then face a presidential veto.
But it raises the domestic stakes for Mr Clinton, who himself favours
lifting the embargo. However, he has refused to do so without the agreement
of the UN and his European allies who have troops at risk in Bosnia.
European diplomats had been rallying opposition to any unilateral move,
fearing it could jeopardise UN humanitarian operations in Bosnia and create
an ominous precedent by disregarding a UN resolution.
US senators supporting the resolution argued that Bosnia had suffered most
from the 1991 UN resolution prohibiting arms shipments to any of the
republics of the former Yugoslavia.
The Senate vote comes on the eve of talks between foreign ministers from the
US, Russia and the European Union meeting in Geneva today to try to relaunch
the peace process. The vote also reflects a growing frustration among
western nations about the failure to secure a settlement that all sides will
accept.
A Foreign Office spokesman said the UK planned to discuss the Senate vote
with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, at today's meeting. UK
observers feared it could push the warring parties away from the bargaining
table.
France will propose today that the countries meeting in Geneva should demand
an immediate ceasefire, reaffirm the existence of Bosnia-Hercegovina as an
independent state and recognise that it can exist only as a confederation of
different communities.
But Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has caused concern in the
US by referring to the possibility of an imposed settlement, a position
opposed by Washington.
The US has been unwilling to press the Bosnian government to accept a
territorial division that it believes to be unjust.

FT  13 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: ECC/Camas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While English China Clays' decision to demerge its aggregates division makes
strategic sense, the timing now looks less inspired. The building materials
sector has under-performed the stock market by 20 per cent since the peak in
mid-March. While it was never the intention to raise additional capital
through demerger, Camas might have wished for more auspicious circumstances
in which to make its debut as an independent company.
Profit-taking rather than a sober reappraisal of the growth prospects seems
to be to blame for the sector's slide. Earnings forecasts have not in
general been lowered. But aggregates companies never promised an immediate
profits recovery. While building products prices will probably rise in the
UK this year, volumes remain weak due to restrained public spending. Camas
is especially vulnerable to any cuts in the government's roads programme.
Its US aggregates business is also earning decent margins already, which
might lessen the recovery prospects. These factors argue for caution in
valuing the shares.
A share price of around 80p would give a yield of 5.8 per cent on the
promised 3.75p dividend. Bardon, the closest in the sector in terms of
business mix, yields a shade more but has a weaker balance sheet. Such a
share price is doubtless lower than Camas hoped for a few weeks ago. Even
so, a market capitalisation of around Pounds 250m would be better value for
ECC shareholders than could have been realised through a trade sale.

FT  13 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal is not alone in having its climb back into UK profits spoiled by
losses in the US. First-quarter figures from General Accident and Commercial
Union this week also carried the scars of storms and earthquakes. The US
insurance market as a whole has had its worst ever start to the year. Even
when losses from severe weather and the Los Angeles earthquake are stripped
out, though, Royal's US underwriting performance shows no improvement over
last year.
Since the company started to sacrifice market share in the interest of
profits in 1989, that must be counted as a disappointment. Annual written
premium has fallen by around 30 per cent since then as Royal retreated from
the western states. The snag is that premiums have fallen faster than
expenses, making Royal less competitive. Persuading insurance agents to pass
on the best business has also proved difficult. One can only hope that
another round of cost-cutting and an infusion of new management will have
the desired effect.
Royal certainly cannot count on help from others in the insurance market.
Despite recent underwriting losses, there is no sign of a general increase
in rates. Turmoil in the bond market might just spur US insurers into
action. With a US fixed-interest portfolio of around Dollars 4bn, Royal
cannot relish any further plunge in bonds. But investment losses are only a
short-term worry. Until investors can scent a decent insurance return from
the Pounds 1bn capital tied up in the US, Royal will continue to trade at a
discount to net assets.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While it is a comfort to see the trade deficit narrowing in February, it is
still difficult to know how much trust to place in the government's reworked
statistics. The apparent discrepancies remain startling. Non-oil imports
from the EC, for example, are recorded as falling 3.5 per cent by volume in
the quarter to February compared with the same period a year before; those
from other countries are shown rising 5 per cent. Despite the lingering
effect of sterling's depreciation, the unit value of exports grew by 6.5 per
cent while those of imports were up only 4 per cent. Either exporters have
used the fall in sterling to claw back margin rather than build sustainable
market share, or the figures are wrong and more goods were actually exported
but at lower prices.
That would have broader significance because it would mean the government
has also understated manufacturing output and hence the overall economic
growth rate. But it does not mean the trade balance will be less of a
constraint in the end, especially since the chances are that import volumes
have also been understated. The UK retained a propensity to import
throughout the recession. Recovery elsewhere in Europe may prove a
palliative by boosting exports, but it may not suffice for long.

FT  13 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: GrandMet's long vision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan's interim results contain a couple of disappointments for
which even several tots of its new cinnamon schnapps laced with flakes of
real gold cannot compensate. Economic recovery in the US has not filtered
through to the drinks industry. GrandMet has failed to enjoy the uplift that
would offset the Pounds 40m cost of destocking there. Admittedly, its North
American food business is doing better, but recession has pushed European
food into a Pounds 3m loss on first-half turnover down around 10 per cent -
despite the effort that has gone into Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Since the
market does not attach much quality to the extra earnings that Grand
Metropolitan now promises from a lower tax rate, it is no surprise that the
shares fell nearly 6 per cent on yesterday's figures.
Consider the longer term perspective, though, and a different picture
emerges. GrandMet has not only reduced its debt due to the sale of Chef &amp;
Brewer; it is also generating more cash, partly as a result of sharply lower
provisions spending. Gearing would still be 270 per cent if intangibles were
stripped out of its balance sheet, but interest cover is a comfortable 8.9
times. Trading improvements at both Pearle spectacles and Inntrepreneur pubs
mean these businesses could be shed within a couple of years. That could
yield another Pounds 750m or so in cash.
This receipt would enhance earnings even if it were simply put on deposit.
GrandMet ought easily to find a way of investing the money to secure
additional growth. At some point, it will have to decide whether there is
sense in trying to acquire critical mass in European food. But US food and
the emerging drinks markets in the developing world offer opportunities that
GrandMet will increasingly be able to afford. As that sinks in, its shares
may start to look cheap.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Paris resists 'strong-arm' UK tactics in Orly row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's confrontation with France over access to Orly airport in Paris
heated up yesterday. The British government gave 'full support' to UK
carriers planning to start services from London to Orly on Monday while the
French government said it would not bow to 'strong-arm tactics'.
The row threatens to undermine European efforts to liberalise air transport
and to provoke fresh strains within the European Union.
Britain's Department of Transport said it was reviewing its position and
taking legal advice over possible retaliation should France carry out its
threat to ban UK airlines from landing at Orly on Monday.
'We are quite convinced that under European Union rules UK carriers have the
right to fly to Orly,' a British government official said, adding: 'What we
do ultimately depends on what happens on Monday.'
Mr Bernard Bosson, French transport minister, said Paris rejected the
'strong-arm tactics' being used by British Airways and Air UK, confirming
Wednesday's declaration that flights between London and Orly could not start
on Monday.
The French minister reaffirmed his willingness to open the route, but said
it was necessary to overcome a number of problems, including congestion at
Orly and environmental issues.
He said it would take 'a maximum of a few weeks' to resolve these
difficulties. 'I'm absolutely flabbergasted that they are trying to force
our hand,' he added.
Both BA and Air UK confirmed they would go ahead with their flights to Orly
on Monday.
British Midland, second largest UK scheduled carrier after BA, said it also
felt 'particularly aggrieved' by the French stance but planned to start
services to Orly in September when it hoped 'the mud had settled'.
Mr Bosson also raised the issue of landing slots at London's Heathrow
airport which he claimed was 'hardly open to French carriers'.
Mr David Holmes, BA's head of government affairs, said Air France had more
flights than BA from Charles de Gaulle, the main Paris airport, to Heathrow.
There were no restrictions on Air France flights to London.
Orly was less crowded than Heathrow and not as congested as London's Gatwick
airport and the French authorities 'had no right to prevent our flights', he
said.
BA's French affiliate, TAT, also planned to start Orly-London services on
Monday, Mr Holmes said.
UK carriers regard the French move as an effort by Paris to delay the
introduction of more competition at Orly at the expense of Air Inter, Air
France's domestic subsidiary.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Labour after John Smith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith's death at the early age of 55 is a shock to his party and a
loss to British politics. As leader of the Labour party Mr Smith combined an
acerbic parliamentary style with a stabilising gravitas. His supporters
believed that under him Labour was at last cruising through the wreckage of
a shattered Conservative party towards its first general election victory
since 1974.
Mr Smith was, in certain respects, ideally qualified to lead the Labour
party. A committed member of Labour's moderate wing through its internecine
1980s struggles over defence, Europe and the economy, he was attractive to
the party's right wing.
At the same time, his burning sense of social justice buttressed by a belief
in engaged government, deeply rooted in his Scottish political base, made
him acceptable to those on his left. A period as shadow chancellor prior to
the 1992 election confirmed his stature and led to overwhelming triumph in
the leadership contest later that year.
Yet for those whose starting point is not Labour loyalism, but a desire to
see more than one modern political party capable of forming an effective
government, Mr Smith's leadership must be judged a disappointment. The
unhappy consequences of Labour's pre-election decision to publish a
tax-raising 'shadow Budget' appeared to convince him that the party would in
future win most by saying least. At the same time, although he supported
efforts to modernise the party, he believed that more Kinnock-style,
high-profile internal reform would only provoke more politically damaging
internal feuds.
Positive response
In short, Mr Smith contended that Labour, without need for further varnish,
was ready for office, an idea which sat uneasily with the fact that the
party had just lost an election in the middle of the second longest
recession since the 1930s. Even in last week's local authority elections,
with the Tories in despised disarray, Labour's 41 per cent of the vote fell
short of the level needed for clear victory in a general election. There has
been no sense among Mr Major's sea of troubles that Labour is evoking a
positive response from the general public.
This must be in some measure because the party has been silent or
unconvincing on the most important issues. Its approach to the European
question was to seek tactical advantage during the Maastricht debate, whilst
avoiding re-examination or reaffirmation of the Europhile position of its
own 1992 manifesto. Who can say today where Labour stands on any important
aspect of the development of the European Union? On the economy, the
commitment to renationalise private utilities has been muted, but there is
no clear sense that the party understands how to work more effectively with
a flourishing private sector for its own broader social and political
objectives.
Opportunist attitude
Its ideas on unemployment are difficult to take seriously given the dogma on
minimum wages and labour market regulation. The party's attitude to
necessary reform in health, education and the civil service remains
opportunist and reactionary, tainted by alliance with the producer interest
of the public sector trade unions.
When it comes to party institutions and treasured nostalgias, Labour has
been too ready to compromise. As a result, the party remains
constitutionally committed to 'the common ownership of the means of
production, distribution and exchange', whatever that means. Another legacy
is an electoral college for selecting a leader in which the trade unions
still have one-third of the votes.
This last fact casts an extra pall of gloom onwards from yesterday's sad
news. Once again, trade union leaders will play a crucial role in appointing
a Labour leader. A satisfactory outcome therefore requires some of those
leaders to have the vision and the courage to look beyond the direct
interest of their members, which is not what they are paid to do.
This electoral college may thus prove incapable of electing the radical and
modernising leader Labour needs if it is to play a serious part in the
future of British politics. The most attractive standard-bearer for that
modernising cause looks like Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary. He
should be preparing himself for the political fight of his life.

After yesterday's story about the good life atop the African Development
Bank, a visitor to the recent Asian Development Bank annual meeting in Nice
has more reassuring news.
Apparently ADB officials were so keen to ensure that they weren't criticised
for having a good time at shareholders' expense that they shunned the
upmarket hostelries, such as the Negresco on the Promenade des Anglais.
Instead, they checked into a handy Novotel, a concrete block house
frequented by travelling salesmen and other second class citizens.
That's the spirit.

The thundering herd at Merrill Lynch seems desperate to differentiate itself
from the faceless workaholics at Goldman Sachs. Merrill has taken to
illustrating its research work with specially commissioned cartoons of its
star analysts.
Merrill's latest European Equity Monitor has a fancy cartoon of Frenchman
Edouard de Boisgelin, its foods analyst, in hunting fatigues and pith
helmet, armed with an elephant gun.
Merrill notes that 'pickings have been lean of late . . . but there will
surely be a time when the food analysts return, guns blazing'.
In the meantime, Merrill's clients will be comforted to learn that De
Boisgelin 'takes regular weekend sojourns in the ancestral home in Normandy
to tend the cellar with its ancient vats of Calvados.' And if you ever need
a recommendation for a restaurant in Paris, 'Edouard is your man', says
Merrill.
Great, but what are his stock recommendations like?

Apparently he's a middle-class investor who reads the Financial Times or

The mood at the Bank of Spain is distinctly glum these days. Ex-governor

The present governor, Luis Angel Rojo, placed investments with the same firm
as Rubio (although he has made clear he did so only for a short time and
declared everything). So did a previous deputy governor and another previous
governor.
Visitors will therefore not be surprised to find the bank hidden under a

When they have finished the familiar grey stone facade should be whiter than

Oh dear. The hot favourite to become director of the left-leaning Institute

Hewitt, 45, is off to be head of research at Andersen Consulting, the UK arm

Her experience as general secretary of the National Council for Civil
Liberties and policy co-ordinator for Neil Kinnock will now be deployed on
behalf of Andersen's capitalist clients such as Barclays Bank and BP.
That leaves the IPPR without a director or deputy director at a time when
the left's electoral chances look better than ever.
Whoever gets the job could expect to fill Sarah Hogg's seat, as head of the

One notable absentee from Bonn over the past two days, while Boris Yeltsin

Germany's normally gregarious defence minister.
Although his Russian opposite number, Pavel Grachov, was in the Yeltsin
entourage, Ruhe left town for a a meeting with the Danish and Polish defence
ministers at Rostock, on the Baltic coast.
It was left to his state secretary, Jorg Schonbohm, to play host, and take
part in the ticklish talks about how and when the Russian troops will exit
east Germany.
There was ugly talk of a diplomatic snub. Not so, says Ruhe: 'It's just that
I am not a man to break my prior engagements.' But Observer has heard an
alternative tale which might explain his absence. The wiry Grachov, an
ex-paratrooper, wanted to chall-enge his rival to a game of tennis. The wily
Ruhe left the court to Schonbohm, another tough soldier, rather than risk

FT  13 MAY 94 / Personal View: Don't cut and run in a crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM R. RHODES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite years of effort and restructuring, the international real estate
crisis which erupted in 1989 has strained the banking system and had a
negative effect on economic recovery in the US, Europe and Japan. Now,
however, solutions and ideas beckon from an unexpected quarter: the
international debt crisis. For more than a decade, bankers and public
officials have worked together to resolve the debt crisis which hit Latin
America in 1982. Last month, Brazil became the last of the big Latin
American economies to resolve its external debt problem by completing a
Dollars 49bn financing package.
The two crises were very different, but borrowers and lenders associated
with the international debt problem learnt some important lessons which may
now point the way out of the real estate slump.
The first is, don't cut and run. Many institutions which did just that are
clamouring to do business with developing countries again, now that they are
recovering. I see a similar response developing in the real estate market.
Lenders and other property holders should resist the temptation to sell
prematurely. Yet they should not be afraid to deal in the marketplace. In
order to assess the resources necessary to maximise the market value of
property and determine a reasonable time frame for realising that value,
proper analysis is required, avoiding the flawed assessments of economic and
market trends that occurred in the 1980s.
As lenders and property holders make such an analysis on each of their
properties, they will often find that time is on their side. Staying with
the business affords more opportunities for finding buyers of distressed
property. Those who remain for the long haul will stand a better chance of
realising the full value of assets and will be in the best position to
profit when the market turns.
The second lesson is to take each case on its merits. The debt crisis
highlighted that, from country to country, different economic policies were
needed to reflect different realities. A like-minded logic compels the same
strategy in real estate: each property is unique. In most cases, packaging
debt of varying quality tends to lessen the value of the most attractive
assets. As creditor banks and debtor property holders work towards
individual solutions they invariably hit upon financial innovations that
figure prominently in shaping the subsequent turnround.
One enduring legacy of the international debt crisis is the emergence of
secondary markets dealing in developing country debt. Non-existent 10 years
ago, these markets now do more than Dollars 2,000bn of business annually.
Liquidity adds value. The debtor does not change - the nature of the paper
does.
The first step toward securitisation of foreign debt was in 1984, when
Mexico and its creditor banks agreed, as part of a multi-year restructuring,
to allow the conversion of Mexican debt into equity. Chile, Argentina and
other countries later used this restructuring instrument in their
privatisation efforts. This heralded a market-based solution to the debt
problem. Banks and other institutions soon began making markets in debt.
This trend led to Brady bonds and, more recently, mutual funds of emerging
market debt.
Real estate can learn from this experience and, indeed, a variant of the
debt-equity swap is now emerging. A few real estate lenders are refinancing
debt in return for a substantial equity stake in the underlying property.
That way the lender does not just take the losses; if a property's value
bounces back, both lender and borrower reap gains.
The biggest beneficiary of the international debt experience, though, has
been the emerging field of commercial mortgage securitisation. In 1993,
Dollars 18bn of new commercial mortgage-backed securities was issued in the
US - three times the 1990 level. Securitisation is becoming a sure-fire way
of liquefying real estate portfolios and expanding the investor base.
Of course, banks will continue to be an important source of new mortgages,
but they will come to rely on securitisation as a means of diversifying real
estate portfolios and avoiding the interest rate squeeze that hurt bank
profits during the 1970s.
The experience of the last decade suggests that no crisis is intractable. As
institutions go about fixing these crises, they find that they are also
changing business fundamentals in a positive way. In a very real sense they
are creating the future from the wreckage of the past.
The author is vice-chairman of Citibank and Citicorp with responsibility for
North America commercial real estate. Since 1982, he has been chairman of
the industry-wide advisory committees for Brazil, Argentina, Peru and
Uruguay, and principal co-chairman of the committee for Mexico

FT  13 MAY 94 / Question mark over UK politics: The three main national
parties must look afresh at themselves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Smith brought a sense of decency and fair play to public life. He
embodied Labour's passion for social justice. He had the manner and the
bearing of a prime minister. In office, he would have been excellent. In
opposition, he followed his own instincts, which were not everyone's. When I
last saw him, a couple of weeks ago, he was good-humoured, confident that
his strategy of keeping Labour's options open would ensure victory at the
next general election. Many Conservatives thought the same.
His death leaves a huge question mark over British politics. All three
national parties must look afresh at themselves; all must re-determine the
basis on which they offer their services to the electorate. The Thatcherite
certainties of the 1980s have melted away. Ideology has vanished. Debates
that might have been concluded years ago remain to be settled. The
distinguishing feature of the political discourse of the 1990s is confusion.
This is apparent in north America, where in recent elections the Canadians
nearly obliterated their Conservatives and millions of Americans voted for
Ross Perot. It is evident in continental western Europe, where the old
Christian Democrat/Social Democrat consensus is visibly crumbling.
In short, the world has changed. The nations of the north Atlantic can no
longer aspire to economic self-sufficiency. They either join trading blocs,
or seek to open themselves to the global marketplace, or both. The social
structure of the 1950s, in which the archetype was a two-parent family with
the father earning the income and the mother minding the children, is being
replaced by many and varied forms of cohabitation.
Men have been losing permanent employment, while women have taken cheaper
part-time or temporary jobs. The relationship between capital and labour has
been subtly altered by the fall of communism. Trade unions must adapt or
fade away. Unemployment, or the fear of it, has touched most families. There
is a perception, not wholly supported by reality, that crime is increasing
at a relentless pace. In many cities people prefer not to walk alone in dark
streets. No wonder the voters are nervous.
Traditional parties of government cannot guarantee deliverance from such
apprehensions. It is not surprising that some Europeans are turning to the
far-right, or the Greens. In Britain they are not sure where to place their
crosses. Last week's local election results tell the story. The Tories are
not, in their current mood, attractive. The Liberal Democrats are once again
resurgent, but they will probably remain a repository for protest. Labour
did well, but not well enough. In spite of everything that has happened to
the government, the people's party scored a lower share of the popular vote
than the Conservatives did at the last general election.
What is likely to follow from Labour's search for a new leader is a tangle.
The behaviour of each of the three national parties will affect the fortunes
of the other two. Take Labour first. At bottom it is still the political
wing of the trade union movement. In choosing whether to break away from
that constraint, it starts from where it was in April 1992. Mr Neil Kinnock,
who resigned as leader after losing the election, had 'modernised,' the
party, but insufficiently so.
Voter-repellent policies such as unilateral disarmament, renationalisation,
a return to the pre-1979 trade union legislation, and anti-Europeanism were
jettisoned. What remained was still visibly the political wing of the
unions, offering a programme of red-rose regulation. Labour longed for a
return to big government, as its many undertakings indicated.
The promises made under Mr Kinnock enabled the Conservatives to warn of a
'tax bombshell' if he won. This dubious tactic succeeded. A shocked Labour
party quickly elected Mr Smith as its new leader. The vote was as good as
unanimous. In spite of the candidacy of Mr Bryan Gould, there was no serious
debate about how the world had changed. Party policy was taken as Mr Kinnock
had left it, preserved in aspic, and set aside. The exception was taxation,
in which an effort was made to dissociate Labour from its earlier stated
ambitions. This strategy seemed to Mr Smith to justify itself. The
Conservatives were tearing themselves apart. Why should Labour interfere?
Some progress was made. In October last year Mr Smith bravely gambled on a
single vote at the party conference. The union bloc vote was abolished, in
favour of one-person-one-vote. Yet Labour still depends on the unions for
financial support. It is still the parliamentary expression of the labour
movement. Members vote individually, but the danger remains that unions may
organise a powerful constituency for 'old Labour', the party pulled by a
carthorse, the gang of comrades associated in the public mind with queues,
levelling-down, the maximalist state, and shoddy council housing.
The new leader will have his or her work cut out to complete the
transformation initiated under Mr Kinnock. 'New Labour', if it came into
being, would seek market solutions to unemployment, radical policies on
crime, and 1990s - not 1950s - approaches to education, health and social
services. The party leader would value the intent behind 'back to basics' in
a world worried about the effect of sex 'n violence on family life. Only one
of the likely candidates fully understands what needs to be done, and has
the character necessary to convince former Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats that 'new Labour' could meet their aspirations. He is Mr Tony
Blair. Mr Gordon Brown is a 'moderniser,' but dolorous. Mr Robin Cook has
the intelligence to sound modern, but he comes across as too clever by half.
Mr John Prescott is wily, but looks 'old Labour'. There are other potential
candidates, but Mr Blair towers above them all.
If 'old Labour' prevails the Conservatives will feel reprieved. The British
polity would be the loser. For just as Labour failed to transmogrify itself
after April 1992, so the Tories trundled, if a little unsteadily, along the
same old tramlines after November 1990. Lady Thatcher left office, but
Thatcherism stayed behind. The party is now hopelessly divided. Mr John
Major added insult to injury by winning in April 1992 when, in the
Thatcherite view, the upstart was supposed to lose. He has strained himself
to please first the Europhiles, then the Eurosceptics, but the Conservatives
are beyond the tactics of one of nature's whips.
Europe is the largest problem, but not the only one. The application of
quasi-market principles to education and health has not worked well, yet no
re-thinking is being done. Local government has been all but destroyed.
Ministers are exhausted or complacent or both. Administration is sloppy.
Bills are hastily drafted and as hastily amended. Survival is the
predominant motivation for most cabinet decisions. What the Conservatives
need above all is a period of rest and recuperation in opposition. Whether
they get it depends in large part on what Labour does now.
The Liberal Democrats will also be affected by Labour's decision. They have
tried harder than the other two to understand the new world. Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the party leader, recently spent some time with 'ordinary people'
and wrote a book about his experiences. He proposes a less hierarchical
society, better education, reduced dependence on central government,
communities responsible for their own actions. Mr Blair's Labour would be
directly competitive with such a package; it would also embrace Mr Ashdown's
party if need be. The Liberal Democrats might flourish more if an 'old
Labour' leader emerges. An unreformed Tory party plus an unreconstructed
Labour must help the purveyors of the third choice.
That is the long-term outlook. The elections to the European parliament and
the fate of Mr Major will occupy us in the next few weeks. These are minor
matters. The choice by Labour of a leader to succeed Mr Smith is potentially
of far greater importance.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Leading Article: New concerns on development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The troubles of the African Development Bank that have emerged this week -
its mounting arrears, problem loans and poor management - reflect in part
the dire economic circumstances of the continent it serves. They also raise
fundamental doubts about the wisdom of encouraging the bank to lend
substantial sums at market interest rates to low-income countries, many of
which were already severely distressed by heavy debt burdens.
The bank's management bears a large part of the responsibility for the mess,
though shareholders from donor governments and other international financial
institutions cannot escape their share of the blame. These failures must be
comprehensively rectified. More than that, questions have to be asked about
the institution's future and the extent to which its non-concessional loans
are appropriate for Africa.
Questions also arise for other regional development banks. The latter are in
better shape than the African bank, but do share some of its problems. Most
suffer from internal politicisation. Lacking the technical strengths and the
diversity of membership of the World Bank, the regional banks have also been
more vulnerable to the ideological and political disputes between donors -
especially the US - and recipients.
An atmosphere of distrust has too often existed between borrowers and
non-borrowing members and also between shareholders and management. Battles
have raged among member governments over important positions within the
institutions. The banks have been encumbered by big and costly boards of
directors, which have interfered frequently - but often, as the African
bank's troubles suggest, to little effect. Meanwhile, managements have been
more influenced by quantity than by quality, in making loans.
Ideological baggage
With the dumping of the ideological baggage of the cold war, there is now an
important opportunity to rid the regional development banks of these
damaging disputes.
The US government, the most powerful shareholder of these institutions, has
recently emphasised their importance to the new world order, in the most
positive terms. According to US Treasury undersecretary, Mr Lawrence
Summers, the regional development banks are now 'as important to the new
world order as the regional security organisations were to the old one'. The
task of fighting communism had, he said, been replaced by that of sharing
prosperity.
Greater expertise
Despite past failures, there is much to commend Mr Summers's point of view.
Multilateral lenders are able to leverage large amounts of finance from
capital markets and banks, so stretching donor taxpayers' dollars further.
Multilateral assistance is almost always more effective than bilateral aid.
This is partly because multilateral institutions possess greater expertise
than most governments, but also because bilateral aid is often for
political, rather than developmental purposes. But concentrating
multilateral aid in one institution - the World Bank - would create an
undesirable monopoly. There is, in any case, a virtue in creating pools of
regional development expertise.
A new consensus between rich and poor countries puts the market at the
centre of the development agenda. The main role of the regional development
banks should become that of encouraging the development of markets, helping
correct market failures, and alleviating the hardship created by reform.
Since each continent faces specific problems, the regional development banks
need separate, if overlapping, agendas.
The US administration and other donor governments wish to give the regional
development banks a new set of lending conditions, covering 'good
governance' - the extent to which governments are democratic and free from
corruption. These new conditions are well-meant, but must be treated with
caution. Apart from being difficult to operate in a non-arbitrary fashion,
they will be viewed as another attempt by rich countries to impose their
will on poorer ones. The banks must not be politicised anew. They must also
not be deprived of the clear-cut objectives essential to effective
operation.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Refined taste for raw materials: FT writers examine the
factors behind the recent surge in world commodities prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE, KENNETH GOODING and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For much of the past five years, the coffee trading pit at the London
Commodity Exchange has been a quiet backwater away from the hurly-burly of
the bond futures and equity markets. But no more: with coffee futures prices
rising by up to Dollars 150 a tonne over the past week, financial investors
have proved eager to gain a foothold in a rapidly rising market.
Coffee is not alone in attracting increasing investment activity this year
as world commodity prices begin to recover from their recent depressed
levels.
Coffee has staged the most noticeable rise, with the futures price - at
which buyers contract to buy beans at a set price at a set time - increasing
by close to 60 per cent since the beginning of the year. But it is not
alone. Copper has risen nearly 20 per cent since January and crude oil by 25
per cent since mid-February. The surge in the sector has pulled up prices
for other commodities as diverse as aluminium and palm oil.
The commodity price index of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, which
tracks movements in 20 commodities, has risen by 6 percentage points so far
this year though, within the materials covered, there are wide fluctuations.
Soaring commodity prices indicate that demand is picking up for the basic
raw materials which are used in many industrial processes, from car panels
to beverages. The strength of the markets is an early pointer to an
improving world economy. But a jump in prices can often herald a return of
inflationary pressures.
However, it is too early to judge whether current price rises will
contribute to global inflation. It takes about a year for rises in commodity
prices to feed through into the underlying rate of retail price inflation as
manufacturers first use up stocks bought when prices were lower.
Further, prices are heading up from extremely low levels. Metals prices were
at their lowest in real terms last November. Coffee prices have been
depressed for five years and hit their lowest point since 1974 two years
ago; oil prices are still Dollars 3 lower than this time last year.
Price levels, particularly for oil, will thus have to go much higher before
they have any significant effect on inflation.
The likelihood of this happening is slim, according to observers. The surge
is patchy: not all commodity prices are rising for straightforward supply
and demand reasons and some are vulnerable to sharp price corrections
because they have risen so fast. Seasoned market watchers are wary of
drawing broad inferences from the upturn and concluding that raw materials
will soon be in short supply.
'People are seeing a few commodities go up and taking it as a sign of a
concerted bull market, but that's wrong: what we've got is a series of
coincidences,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity researcher at GNI, the
London broker.
Coincidences such as lack of available supply of coffee and oil, and rising
demand for industrial metals such as copper, have convinced some investors
that now is the time to buy all commodities. In addition, the increasing
presence of large-scale buyers such as private, speculative US hedge funds,
and pension funds can sometimes exaggerate price movements.
'Supply and demand fundamentals spark the initial rise and then you have all
this hot money looking for a home,' said Mr Neil Bresolin, executive
director of commodities at Goldman Sachs.
Much of the activity by pension and hedgefunds is triggered by computer
programmes which follow market trends. They often pay scant attention to
data such as stock levels which can reveal the underlying health of a
market, but are devised to generate short-term profits.
This is one reason why metals prices in general have risen by an average of
20 per cent since the beginning of the year, even though warehouses used by
the London Metal Exchange around the world are stacked with stock - and
aluminium can be seen stored outside in car parks and on docksides.
Generally, high stock levels of metals depress prices since they indicate
that supplies are abundant. Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the
world's biggest mining group, and a director of the LME, said hedge funds
too readily overlook the fact that prices 'are determined by the interplay
of supply and demand, rather than by either side of the equation alone'.
While such funds alone do not determine price rises, once markets are on the
move they can push prices higher and generate a spiral which affects other
commodities, Mr Eagles said.
To some extent crude oil prices have experienced this effect, after having
bucked the rising price trend in other commodities markets this year. Oil
prices fell late last year as Opec production exceeded demand. The overhang
of stocks was eventually reduced by exceptionally cold weather in the US
earlier this year. The latest price rebound partly reflects a sharp rise in
purchases by US refiners - and also the activity of hedge funds.
But in spite of a big percentage increase in the price, oil at about Dollars
16 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend is still well below the Dollars 19
level this time last year.
Many observers expect prices to firm gradually over the remainder of the
year, but in the absence of a big supply disruption there appears to be
little scope for further sharp surges upwards.
Overall, world oil inventories are relatively high, while oil companies are
uniformly cautious, with few executives expecting an early return to prices
above Dollars 20 a barrel.
Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum, indicated that BP
would be happy with prices in the Dollars 18 to Dollars 20 a barrel range
over the long term.
The story is different in the coffee market, where speculative trading is
not responsible for driving prices higher. Instead companies such as Nestle
are scrambling to snap up beans to rebuild supplies.
Five years of poor prices have seen a cycle of neglect set in on the world's
coffee plantations, where producers have regularly let beans rot in the
trees as it was not economic to harvest them. This practice has been coupled
with steadily rising demand so that, as production began to drop off,
consuming countries started to use up high stock levels.
Low production has been exacerbated by a retention scheme set up by
coffee-producing countries last October. The Association of Coffee Producing
Countries decided to withhold up to 20 per cent of exports from the world
market until the price rose to 85 US cents a pound. That level has now been
reached and countries are considering releasing the 4m bags they have in
store.
The release of stored coffee will help to alleviate current shortages, but
even with this extra coffee, supply is likely to remain constrained.
Producers are beginning to plant more trees to try to reverse the
deterioration in some of their plantations but it takes five years for a
newly planted tree to yield a crop.
The reason for the rise in coffee prices is, therefore, something of an
exception to the current trend. Other commodities are rising on more
speculative trading. When such temporary investors switch attention
elsewhere, prices could fall sharply.
'Some time later this decade, we are likely to get a significant commodity
bull run, but we're not there yet. We've got to see large drops in stock
levels of most commodities worldwide before that happens,' said Mr Eagles.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: The value in diversifying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Gapper's analysis of the Royal Bank of Scotland , 'Where diversity
helps balance the books' (May 11), only touches on the issue of the value
added by the bank to its diversifications. Why?
The only justification for making a diversification or retaining a
multi-business portfolio is that the bank can add value to the businesses it
owns. To be comfortable with chief executive George Mathewson's 'collection
of several' businesses, we need to know more about Gapper's claim that
'Royal Bank's capital backing and management expertise have helped develop
operations such as Citizens and Direct Line'.
Reducing the volatility of Royal Bank's earnings and providing a 'balanced'
chair for Mr Mathewson to sit in, creates no extra cash for shareholders and
so provides no argument for diversification.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: UN sees humanitarian successes in
Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM HARPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A month ago you reported some comments of mine ('UN's Somalia military
role attacked', April 7) about the miliary role of the United Nations in
Somalia, both during the American (non-UN) presence there and since its
departure at the end of March. Your article chose not to cover those parts
of my report which discussed the UN's humanitarian and legal programmes
there.
Somalia today bears little resemblance to the war-torn country of two years
ago. A number of international and a host of Somali organisations have
involved themselves in relief and reconstruction, and the UN has,
particularly through Unicef and its legal section in the UN operation in
Somalia (Unosom), played a key role in these processes.
Whereas, by late 1992, more than a quarter of a million children had died
from starvation caused by warfare, drought and poverty, now malnutrition is
no longer a major emergency; more than 750,000 children have been vaccinated
against a range of diseases; more than 80,000 have returned to school; some
3,000 water wells have been rehabilitated. Health services and food
production are being revitalised and Somali women's organisations are more
active than ever before.
Cholera was detected in Somalia in February. Unicef played the leading role
in structuring and resourcing a large campaign to educate people about the
causes, symptoms and correct treatment of the disease; and - more
importantly - how to prevent it. It also took action to chlorinate wells all
over the country. To date some 15,000 cases have been identified, with 500
deaths. When we remember that the capital, Mogadishu, alone has a population
of 900,000 people with very poor sanitation, to have kept the number of
cases so low is a considerable achievement.
The Unosom legal team is helping to re-establish district and regional
administrations and is insisting that women should be included in them. A
police force, a judiciary and a prison service are now being re-established.
The enormous problems of the population are by no means over. But our fears
that the withdrawal of the US and most of the European miliary contingents
would very possibly lead to renewed warfare have not materialised.
Somalia today remains a story of cautious optimism, as I said five weeks
ago. In this context, the military problems of Unosom should not be seen as
the beginning and the end of the UN story.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Sums don't add up: Dog days in Britain's independent schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These should be halcyon days for UK independent schools. In the past year
state schools have been engulfed by teachers' industrial action over the
national curriculum - compulsory in state, but not independent, schools. The
dispute has shown no sign of abating this week in spite of the government
revising its proposals. State schools are perceived as having lower
standards and as abandoning 'traditional' values - such as competition in
team games.
All this should help independent schools, which usually prosper when parents
want to avoid the state sector. During the last spasm of trade union action
in the late 1980s, for instance, the percentage of the school age population
at independent schools increased from 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent,
according to Department for Education figures.
So why did independent schools lose pupils this year? The Independent
Schools Information Service last month revealed that the number at private
schools this school year - 462,719 - is 1 per cent lower than last year -
the third annual fall in succession.
Day schools have fared best. This year saw a 0.1 per cent increase in the
number of day pupils (0.6 per cent in London) although falls occurred in the
two preceding years. But heads of boarding schools have been alarmed by the
5.2 per cent fall in boarders this year - roughly equivalent to four schools
the size of Eton College. Since 1989, the number of boarders has fallen by
about 20 per cent.
No wonder the Boarding Schools Association, which represents most UK
boarding schools and is usually zealous about its independence, has called
for an extension of the government's 'assisted places' programme. It wants
the scheme, which pays school fees of selected children from low-income
families, to cover the seven-to-11 age group.
If recent trends are not reversed, rationalisation in the boarding school
sector seems inevitable. Already this year several small boarding schools
have closed or merged. Others have seen pupil numbers reduced to a level
where they may no longer be viable; fears are greatest for the survival of
schools which have traditionally emphasised their small size as a virtue.
The decline in the independent sector is partly explained by the weakness of
the economy. In the late 1980s, the economy was growing fast and the number
of parents deciding to send their children to fee-charging schools rose
rapidly. Now many find that fees are too high for them to make that choice.
But the economic downturn would not have had such an impact on numbers if
fees had increased in line with average prices. They did not. The
Independent Schools Information Service's figures show fees have
consistently risen by more than the retail price index during the last
decade. The rise of 2.6 per cent for this school year is the first time
since records began in 1982 that school fees have increased by less than
average earnings.
The average boarding fee at the most prestigious public (independent)
schools - those which are members of their representative body, the
Headmasters' Conference - is Pounds 3,574 a term compared with Pounds 2,090
as recently as 1989.
The main upward pressure on fees has come from teachers' pay settlements.
Average salaries for teachers at independent schools rose by 10 per cent in
1991-92 and 9.5 per cent the following year, although the increase this year
was only 1.5 per cent. But independent schools admit that during the 1980s
they overspent on luxury capital projects such as swimming pools and sports
centres.
One result of higher fees has been a trend towards parents choosing the
cheaper day schools, rather than boarding schools - hence the steeper fall
in the number of pupils at the latter. Boarding schools charge on average
Pounds 6,000 more per year than day schools.
Independent schools offer other explanations for their decline. There is
some legitimacy in the argument that the state sector is becoming more
competitive. Miss Janet Harvey, headmistress of the Lawnside school in
Malvern, Worcestershire, which will close at the end of this year because
its governors believe it is no longer commercially viable, points to the
breadth and curriculum options at large state schools, particularly the new
breed of sixth-form colleges. 'Boarding schools with less than 200 pupils
are not going to be viable in the future,' she says.
But that only explains why some of the smaller schools are threatened: most
independent schools have facilities of a quality which far exceeds those in
the state sector.
Other teachers believe social trends are working to the disadvantage of
boarding schools.
Mr Ian Small, headmaster of Bootham School in York and also this year's
chairman of the Boarding Schools Association, believes the public's image of
boarding schools has been distorted and is 'at least 30 years out of date'.
He cites the recent publicity for a book which claimed that Eton sacked its
headmaster in 1970 because of his over-enthusiastic use of capital
punishment. 'We are hampered by this image of the past. The amount of column
inches for that book was typical, but it's so out-dated,' he says.
Boarding schools have belatedly taken steps to improve their image. For
example, Cheltenham College, a boys' boarding school, last month offered
prospective pupils a 'free sample', allowing them to spend a night in the
school's boarding house, and then undergo a standard daily timetable. It
claims to have boosted recruitment as a result.
But improving the image of independent schools can only go part of the way
towards compensating for their main problem: that in many cases they have
priced themselves out of the market.
The modest rise in the number of day pupils this year suggests that there is
still strong demand for education outside the state sector. Though smaller
schools may have to close, that demand should keep most large independent
schools in business. But their prosperity will depend crucially on them
charging fees that the market can afford.

Sir, John Murphy underestimates the wit of most shoppers. Most of them can

'Try this new Cola.'
If a product suits in terms of price and quality, the consumer will buy it
regardless of how it is presented.
As to the 'research' from the British Producers and Brand Owners in which it
claims that consumers are 'confused', in the immortal words, 'they would say
that wouldn't they?'

Sir, John Murphy (Letters, May 12) is quite right that supermarkets'
'look-alikes that assume the characteristics of market-leading brands are
parasites'. May I suggest some changes to J Sainsbury's Cola which would
avoid confusion?
Dyeing the liquid a different colour from dark brown (perhaps green?) and
serving the drink flat instead of sparkling would immediately differentiate
the own-brand from its legitimate competition.
Calling the drink 'Cola' is also objectionable. Extensive advertising by
Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola has associated both with the word. 'Artificially
flavoured sugar water' would be more descriptive and not usurp the
brand-leaders' expensively won market share.
Adopting these simple measures would prevent even the most sensorily
challenged customer confusing their purchases.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Hidden' tax deters employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A G K HART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader, 'Jobs agenda for Europe' (May 9), you write in the
penultimate paragraph: 'This can be done by radically reforming the subsidy
regime, to promote employment.'
It seems that employers are suffering a hidden payroll tax, because the cost
of hiring an employee has to include the unemployment subsidy that he would
have received - ie, in the UK an employer has to offer above Pounds 3,000.
In businesses which operate with low wages and low profit margins, this
hidden tax is a very high hurdle to surmount.
Therefore, rather than talking of subsidies, let us talk of refunding this
hidden tax to employers, so that they can start at a zero base. They may
then offer whatever is needed to attract unemployed workers back into work.
In effect, instead of paying benefits to the unemployed, let us pay them to
employers so that they can take on more workers. This could be done variably
so that employers would not recover the hidden tax for higher earners. This
would mean that all employers of low-wage workers would recover the tax.
Initially, therefore, we would pay out more 'benefit' but costs would reduce
dramatically (because competition would force employers to cut prices if
they continued to recover the tax without accepting lower profit margins)
and the situation would soon balance itself.
The great benefit to us would be this: instead of paying out benefit to the
unemployed and getting nothing back, we would pay the same to em-ployers and
get increased wealth.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: Shows Broadway forgot - Andrew St George talks to Ian
Marshall Fisher about lost American musicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Marshall Fisher is an archaeologist: he discovers lost American
musicals. Over the last few years he has unearthed fresh musicals from the
New World and put them on display in London. His latest series of Lost
Musicals, concert-studio versions of the shows Broadway forgot, has just
opened at the Barbican.
Six years ago, Fisher struck on the idea of reviving musical theatre
overlooked by Broadway: 'anyone interested in musical theatre should be
aware this stuff exists', he says. The great success of Lost Musicals, now
in its sixth season, lies in a mix of strangeness and familiarity. Past
revivals included Do I Hear a Waltz? (1965, Richard Rogers and Stephen
Sondheim) and Lovelife (1948, Kurt Weill and Alan J. Lerner) which perished
after 220 and 252 performances respectively.
But should forgotten musicals stay forgotten? Will Fisher's grandchildren be
reviving Carrie or Leonardo? Two arguments present themselves. First, Fisher
says, 'The people who invented the musical theatre . . . we'll never see the
stuff that died for them'; that is, the early songs, stagings and ideas
which made later masterpieces possible.
Second, Lost Musicals is a pure archaeology of the fashions and tastes which
produced the musical: 'the fashion is now over, but there's still an
appetite for the fashion.' And who says creaky shows cannot conceal one or
two great songs?
Fisher reviles English musicals, the 'cod-operetta Ivor Novello style', and
concentrates on American failures, which he finds more interesting. This
year, on a Pounds 36,000 budget (20 per cent up on 1993), the season begins
at the Barbican Cinema with Let's Face It, an unlikely 1941 collaboration
between Cole Porter and Herbert and Dorothy Fields; then Bloomer Girl (1944,
Harold Arlen and EY Harburg), New Girl in Town (1957, Bob Merrill and George
Abbott), Strike Up The Band (1927, George and Ira Gershwin and George S.
Kaufman) - and Cole Porter's 1936 Red, Hot and Blue, a riotous comedy about
a man searching for a childhood sweetheart identified by a waffle iron burn
on her bottom in which the cast included Bob Hope and Ethel Merman.
Since so little is known about the musicals, each show has a short
introduction. Fisher has three musical directors, 250 performers (paid in
'tea and biscuits'), but no costumes, no orchestra, no scenery, no
publicity, no advertising and no West End Sunday competition for the
Barbican Cinema's 280 seats (all tickets are a demotic Pounds 11). Lost
Musicals would make ideal radio; the shows should be recorded before they
slip from sight again. Fisher keeps the lights on so the audience can make
notes or follow the score.
Are these revivals worth doing? He responds by talking about modern
musicals, which are not to his taste: 'the style now seems to be give them
spectacle. All there is today is Sondheim and Lloyd Webber.' Has he seen
anything recently he likes? A rare pause. 'I'm thinking . . . that means no.
There's nothing.'
Fisher is drawn to the past by the 'vibrancy, excitement and daring' he
finds in old American musicals. The search for new material has put him on
terms with the Gershwin, Hart, Hammerstein, Porter and Kaufman estates and
families: 'they all help me, it's heartwarming, it happens all the time.' He
leans forward. 'Listen, in this project the stars are the writers.'
Discover the Lost Musicals, Barbican, Sundays until 9 October (071 638
8891).

Yet another Friday night when the best advice is to stay away from the
television ..unless your idea of a good time is watching Danny Baker ask
whether Arthur Lowe appeared in adverts for Trillions sweets or Hanky Panky
popcorn. That, we are promised (all right, threatened) is the sort of
question in which the new quiz Bygones will specialise. Is this part of the
BBC's drive towards the 'Himalayan option', the domination of the high
ground of broadcasting? (7.00 BBC1). You might have hoped that Europe
Express would be television's version of Christopher Booker's hair-raising
column in the Sunday Telegraph, detailing the demented bureaucratic
taradiddle which, week by week, reduces the quality of life in Britain, in
the name of a united Europe. But no. It is a series of tabloid interviews,
this week including singer Mari Boine who is 'set to' take Europe by storm
(8.00 Channel 4). The oddest billing of the night is on Radio 3 in the
'Friday Feature', L'Homme Arme, presented by Jeremy Beadle who traces the
history of a famous medieval song (10.45).

FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: The Glass blew in - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At her best, and it is a very good best, Siobhan Davies creates structures,
movement-installations, through which she guides us with unerring
sensitivity. We learn, without consciously doing so, certain physical laws
about these locations, are shown incidents that are insidiously revealing,
and we understand the mysterious boundaries and horizons of this world. This
has seemed to me a constant of Davies' truest work ever since that long-ago
Pilot with which she first told us of her talent.
Now on a small regional tour - I saw a performance at Worthing's Connaght
Theatre on Tuesday night - Davies' Dance Company is presenting her two
newest pieces: last season's Wanting to tell Stories and The Glass blew in,
made this year. Both show their choreographer at her best, and her troupe -
Amanda Britton, Sasha Roubichek, Deborah Saxon, Paul Douglas, Sean Feldman,
Jeremy James - as a grandly gifted ensemble.
The Glass blew in takes place inside a low perspex boundary, which is a
frame for the dance - any activity outside it acquiring a somehow
disquieting quality. The key to the piece is Gavin Bryars' Three elegies for
nine clarinets, a work whose luscious sonorities are a tribute to the
clarinettist Roger Heaton. Heaton is soloist with a multi-track recording of
himself playing bass and contra-bass clarinets. The ear is ravished - tone
and texture are dark, rich, Brahmsian - and Davies' has made dances that
look comparably dark and almost voluptuous in means. The movement coheres or
fragments, reflects off itself as ideas return or are mirrored from one
performer to another. Effects are beautifully judged - how satisfying each
dance-phrase seems - and beautifully brought off by Davies' artists.
Wanting to tell stories is no less rewarding, and secure - it is tempting to
write 'self-contained' - in structure. Two vast steely grilles by David
Buckland hang over the stage, and move to define areas (and no-go areas,
too). Telling stories allusively, hinting at incident and relationships, is
the declared theme. Characters - and we sense identities through the
movement - are confronted and briefly explored.
The piece is more febrile, more urban in its energies, than Davies usually
allows, and I think it slightly too long - the fault of Kevin Volans' gritty
score, well brought off by its four players. But the dance grips the
attention in its drive, in its sharp demotic accents: gesture is quick, bold
 -and how odd to see the flash of a waltz-step. It is given with absolute
conviction by its cast.
In these latest pieces, as in last year's exquisite White Bird Featherless,
we see the maturity of a rare, perceptive creator. Siobhan Davies' dance is
refined, sometimes oblique, always penetrating. And subtly, grippingly, hers
is a theatre of the human heart as well as of movement.
The Siobhan Davies Dance Company appears at the Crucible, Sheffield, on May
19; at Towngate Theatre, Basildon, on May 23.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: Bryn Terfel - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The figure who strode out on to the platform was as imposing as any Wotan,
as awesome as any Mephistopheles, his locks as long and shaggy as those of
John the Baptist. Bryn Terfel embodies any number of opera's
larger-than-life characters, but for the moment all thought of those had to
be set aside.
On Wednesday he was at the Wigmore Hall for his London debut as a
recitalist. Terfel came to prominence in the 1989 Cardiff Singer of the
World competition, when Dmitry Hvorostovsky took the first prize and he was
in effect a runner-up with the Lieder prize, but their careers out in the
real world have served to reverse the jury's judgment. Hvorostovsky,
faltering in opera, has increasingly found refuge in song recitals, while
Terfel has gone on to take the world's opera-houses by storm.
It was interesting to see Salzburg's Jokanaan, Vienna's Dr Miracle,
everybody's Figaro, return to the song repertoire with which he made that
striking first impression. At the Wigmore Terfel's baritone is undeniably a
big voice, requiring suitably big handling. There is plenty of room in it
for him to move around and the dynamic range between his loudest and his
quietest singing was vast.
There are a few big personalities in song as well, such as Schubert's 'Der
Atlas' bearing the anguish of the world on his shoulders, who looms on a
mighty scale in Terfel's singing. It took a while for him to find the
flexibility for the subtler songs in his Schumann and Schubert first half.
'Mondnacht', sung in a low bass key, did not live up to Malcolm Martineau's
hazy, moon-lit introduction; the consonants were too bumpy, the style short
on precision. and refinement. His enticing 'Fischermadchen' was better.
Power and tenderness, force and quietude, are all within Terfel's enormous
range, but not always the ability to hit a specific tone in the voice. In
the Heine settings of Schubert's Schwanengesang he missed the pain as the
poet's knife cuts the flesh. Faure's 'Automne' was turbulent, but was that
bitterness or melancholy swirling below the surface? It was difficult to
tell.
As a singer of his own two languages Terfel is without peer among his
generation. From top to bottom of his voice he can sing English words
without any distortion, making Vaughan Williams's Songs of Travel
marvellously engaging, even when the music is at its weakest. In Welsh, he
seems just as communicative, bringing vividly to life Meirion Williams's
'The Welshman' with his ready heart, his good sense, his love for his rugged
Wales, all sung with unabashed ebullience. 'I enjoyed that one', exclaimed
the patriotic Terfel proudly. So did we.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: Pinter reinterpreted - Alastair Macaulay visits a
festival in Dublin devoted to the playwright's work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pinter Festival: the words are proclaimed on banners around Dublin. For
three weeks this May, Dublin's Gate Theatre is presenting a festival of
Harold Pinter's plays. Each week, a pair of his plays (one long in the
evening, one short in the afternoon) is being given, in new productions; the
playwright will direct one of them himself; several distinguished actors
(including Ian Holm, Penelope Wilton, Michael Pennington) are involved.
But why Dublin? Pinter's plays are not well known there, and have not been
performed in recent years. The idea came from the Gate Theatre's director,
Michael Colgan, and probably developed as a sequel to the theatre's recent
Beckett festival. Pinter is the modern playwright who has learnt most from
Beckett. (Surely even the famous Pinter pause derives from Beckett.) Pinter
spent time in Ireland as an actor in the 1950s, working with the
actor-manager Anew McMaster, about whom he has written a memoir, Mac.
I believe that Pinter also picked up on the speech-patterns and poetic
refractions of Irish modernism: Yeats, Joyce, and, above all, Beckett. Hence
the alternations of lyricism and irony, the ambiguous meditations on time
past, the sudden non-sequiturs and waits and hesitations, the richly
suggestive use of ordinary parlance. John Gielgud once told Pinter that he
had thought that playing No Man's Land would be like playing Chekhov, 'where
you must ignore the audience', but that in fact he had discovered it needed
a consciousness of the audience, a manipulation of them, as in Congreve or
Wilde - yes, two other Dubliners.
Colgan has chosen and paced the festival's six plays well, so that each
week's pair shows contrasting facets of Pinter. The first week presented The
Dumb Waiter (1959, 50 minutes) and Betrayal (1978, 95 minutes, including
interval). The Dumb Waiter occurs in one of Pinter's most airless rooms, and
is just for two hired killers. Betrayal is about a triangle of relationships
between Robert, his best friend Jerry, and Robert's wife Emma; in ten
scenes, over nine years, set in both London and Venice, it retrospectively
surveys the love affair between Emma and Jerry.
The Dumb Waiter was directed by Joe O'Byrne, Betrayal by Kevin Billington.
Both realised the strong vein of humour in Pinter's writing, and the Dublin
audience responded with ready laughter. Because some of his playwright
contemporaries have been more overtly concerned with satirising various
forms of Englishness, it is easy not to notice, when watching his plays in
England, that Pinter is often satirising Englishness too. Seen abroad, his
characters reveal their nationality more plainly, and amusingly.
Even the pauses that occur between Robert and Jerry in Betrayal became funny
in Dublin, because they expressed the emotional constipation of these
upper-middle-class Londoners - their fatuous politeness, their
stuffed-shirted inability to refer to a spade as a spade. Jerry (Stephen
Brennan) in particular became more hilariously slow-witted; and, when Robert
at one point remarked 'Didn't she?', Brennan delivered a tiny but superb
triple-take, gradually and befuddledly adjusting to all the possible
implications.
English stupidity was also excellently evident in David Herlihy's account of
Gus in The Dumb Waiter, bringing out the dark pun in the title: dumbo Gus is
waiting for he knows not what - not until it is too late. Brief though it
be, The Dumb Waiter defies categorisation. (A sign of Pinter's early
mastery.) Here it is a black comedy about two killers who are pawns in
someone else's game, here an existential waiting-for-Godot tragedy about the
cruel pointlessness of existence (Gus: 'Who is it upstairs?'; Ben: 'What's
one thing to do with another?'). Now a surreal, Ionesco-like, sketch in
which nonsensical events become both disturbing and absurd; now a kind of
thriller in which events add up in a pattern virtually too grim to
contemplate.
Ian McElhinny - who in The Dumb Waiter was the dour and uninquisitive Ben -
also, in Betrayal played Robert: an astonishing double-act. He makes Robert
snide and urbane, as oblique about his emotional dealings as some character
in le Carre. His very tightness of manner actually makes him much more
touching in the one scene when he speaks with Emma of her infidelity with
his best friend. Emma was Jeananne Crowley, a tad too muted, but lightening
in looks and bearing to very telling effect as the play moves back in time.
The Pinter Festival continues at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, until May 21

FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: Elgar's Rondo - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Writing plays on the lives of great composers is a tempting but tricky
business. David Pownall makes a habit of it. He has put the predicaments of
Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Gesualdo on the boards, and devised both a stage
and a radio play on the later life of Elgar. Both of these focus on why such
a masterly and otherwise prolific composer should have completed only two
symphonies. Haydn managed 104.
It is a question genuinely worth pondering; but having seen Elgar's Rondo -
an RSC transfer from the Stratford Swan to the Barbican Pit - I am not sure
that Pownall is quite the man to ponder it. The very fact of Elgar's
existence, his arising out of the musical nothingness that was 19th century
England, is still startling. There is rich dramatic material in his social
and artistic discomfiture as a lower-class Catholic who lost both faith and
class, enduring the vapidities of the Philistines only to find himself
reduced to frozen melancholy by the atrocities of world war; while the
struggle with the symphonic ideal is a great emblematic 19th century theme.
To have failed with his third attempt must have seemed failure indeed to
Elgar: this is the subject of Pownall's radio play, Elgar's Third.
Elgar's Rondo probes the period in his life between what he perceived as the
public failure of his Symphony No 2 in 1911 and the beginnings of the Cello
Concerto in 1918. The title refers to the second symphony's scherzo, whose
pounding, dissonant climaxes apparently struck first audiences as bafflingly
avant-garde. Elgar's friend and publisher AJ Jaeger ('Nimrod') returns from
beyond the grave to urge him forwards in the stylistic direction of the
Rondo, and to write another symphony; but Elgar wants to throw in the towel.
The play depicts a battle for Elgar's soul between the depressed composer on
the one hand, and Jaeger and a young Jesuit priest on the other. Meantime,
his wife Alice is fading through terminal illness.
There are theatrical surprises verging on the surreal - the characters first
stream on in lurid fancy dress; a military band marches in and out; and a
casual King George V with a couple of dead fish calls on the Elgars - but
they are not perhaps surreal enough, just as the writing never sinks deeply
enough into Elgar's mind to convince one that the character really is a
great composer, not just Alec McCowen doing his fastidious pronunciation
act. Though furnished by Pownall with an authentic stock of Elgarian puns
and nursery talk, McCowen's Elgar is confusingly close to his impersonation
of Elgar's contemporary, Kipling.
Sheila Ballantine's Alice - giddy, snobbish, disaffected, weary and drawn -
is a rather striking portrayal. John Carlisle's Jaeger, Ian Hughes's Father
John and James Hayes's Bernard Shaw are sharply taken. But the only really
moving moment in this production (by Di Trevis) was when a fragment of the
gentle opening of Sospiri was allowed to play on the gramophone.

FT  13 MAY 94 / People: Environment and Home Office - UK civil service moves
for Wilson and Turnbull
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the UK's larger government departments will have new permanent
secretaries from the start of next month.
Richard Wilson, currently permanent secretary at the department of the
Environment, will be taking over the top job at the Home Office.
The vacancy was created by the premature retirement of Sir Clive Whitmore,
linked by the Whitehall gossip mill to friction between civil servants in
the department and Michael Howard, the abrasive Home Secretary.
Wilson, 51, should have no difficulty in dealing with his new master, having
worked with Howard when he was Environment Secretary. Before moving to
Environment, Wilson was deputy secretary (Industry) at the Treasury.
His place at the top of the Environment department will be filled by Andrew
Turnbull, who is currently second permanent secretary at the Treasury in
charge of public expenditure.
Turnbull, 49, has spent most of his working life at the Treasury and was
responsible for exchange rate policy at the time of sterling's departure
from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
He was principal private secretary to the prime minister between 1988 and
1992, serving both Margaret Thatcher and John Major.
In line with the prime minister's ending of automatic honours for top
mandarins, neither has yet been awarded the once traditional knighthood for
permanent secretaries.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Technology: From chalk to superhighways / A look at private
UK initiatives to bring software and curriculum packages into the classroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not much has changed in the typical British secondary school classroom since
the death of Queen Victoria. Whiteboards may have replaced blackboards, but
the notion of a personal computer on every desk is still largely the stuff
of science fiction.
At best, there will be a room of PCs for lessons in computing and possibly
information technology - very likely funded by a government initiative. At
worst, a school will boast a handful of outdated machines.
If education is supposed to be a preparation for future life, this state of
affairs beggars belief. Ever fewer of tomorrow's jobs will be manual or in
the primary industries; ever more will be in careers - professional,
clerical, sales, administration - where computer literacy is essential.
Nor are the benefits of a PC-based education to be measured in PC skills
alone. As material and courses become available via CD-Rom and networks,
chalk and textbooks should join the ink well and dunce's cap in the museum
of childhood.
Explaining the current malaise is easy enough. Money is scarce. Old habits
die hard. Teachers lack requisite training. Hardware, software and course
materials are expensive, and knowledge about what to buy is scarce.
There is also a serious market failure. In most countries the computing and
software industries have little incentive to develop products for
cash-starved public education systems ignorant of the benefits.
In Britain, private schools are not much better than their state
counterparts. While university entrance continues to be determined by
success at conventional A-levels, private schools' market niche is secure
without innovation - and they can carry on investing instead in sports
halls, music centres and private theatres, as they did in the 1980s.
The key to change lies in political and professional will and the
development of economic solutions. Tellingly, the places moving fastest in
PC-based education, notably Singapore and some US states, are doing so under
strong political leadership. But change can be led by the private sector if
it has the right products at the right price and markets them effectively.
In the UK, just such an exercise is about to start in earnest. Numerous
initiatives are under way, but two stand out because they tackle the most
immediate obstacles to change - the shortage of expertise and cash in the
schools themselves.
Alan Benjamin, a former director of corporate communications at ICL, is
masterminding a British version of the 'community learning utility' now to
be found in California and a dozen other US states.
The key to the utility is simple: schools - or learners - pay for material
on a usage basis, with software and curriculum packages selected and
supplied by a community-based utility through a not-for-profit foundation.
The scheme was unveiled at a recent seminar at London's South Bank
Technopark with a demonstration of a software system in use in California,
developed by Vistar Technologies, a US company.
The Vistar system fits course material - whether procured from CD-Rom or a
network - into an innovative Windows-based software teaching system, with an
integrated messaging facility, student 'prescription' and 'writing' units,
and lesson-planning programmes for teachers.
The networked system is geared to classroom management and school
administration as well as teaching. It includes attendance reporting,
assessment and 'cards' for pupil achievement and course enrolments. The
'community learning utility' will make software and course materials
available to learners from its own data repository and via its own network,
charging for them on a usage basis. The utility will negotiate licences with
software suppliers, 'sift' available course material, and commission
teachers and others to provide more - which, if used, will earn them royalty
income.
The utility will also negotiate special rates with British
Telecommunications and other telecoms operators to carry the networked
material. Its success will be an important commentary on the seriousness of
the operators in developing 'superhighway' services - both in their
readiness to install fibre links to schools as needed, and in their capacity
to make networked services affordable.
Benjamin's first utility is likely to cover five schools and two further
education colleges in inner south London, where the local South Thames
Training and Enterprise Council - a not-for-profit company contracting with
the government to provide training - has agreed to provide part of the
funding to install hardware and software.
He also hopes to gain support from telecoms companies and local businesses,
which could purchase training on a pay-by-use basis. 'This is a new form of
public utility,' says Benjamin. 'Its potential lies in the fact that digital
information and software can be treated like water and electricity, and made
available on a low-cost usage basis, breaking the capital barrier for
millions of users.'
If the south London utility is successful, others will be established.
Benjamin envisages the utilities as public-private partnerships - perhaps
between Tecs and leading technology or service companies - run as local
businesses at a profit. The critical goal is for them to become
self-financing, making the supply of software and materials sustainable.
The second pioneering initiative also comes from the private sector, in the
shape of CRT group, a Wirral-based training and recruitment company
established four years ago and now claiming to be among the country's
largest private training providers. Its chief executive, Karl Chapman, heads
a team dedicated to taking technology into schools as a commercial
proposition.
With the aid of partners in the IT sector, Chapman plans later this year to
equip a significant number of schools with a room of current-range PCs. CRT
will provide software, hardware and, where appropriate, personnel. At the
pilot stage, the schools will have only to provide the premises and pay for
the software on the basis of usage and output results.
In its initial guise, the scheme is both more and less ambitious than
Benjamin's, although the two may come together in south London. It is more
ambitious because of the number of schools likely to be included in the
pilot; but less so because Chapman envisages networking and integrated
teaching/administration software as a later stage in the process. He is
gearing his early efforts to courses - particularly the new national general
vocational qualifications in information technology - which are especially
well-suited to interactive PC formats.
Most of the pilot schools chosen by Chapman will be grant-maintained,
because their head teachers and governors are - he judges - readier to
innovate and less constrained by inherited attitudes and budgetary
limitations.
If the scheme fails, Chapman says he will simply leave the PCs in the
schools. If it succeeds, he is working on financing packages making it
possible for schools to secure more hardware without a large up-front
capital cost. As for software, CRT believes it can meet its early demands
for IT courses through its own multimedia subsidiary - formerly Convergence
Communications - which is developing a range of multimedia training
packages.
The fate of the two initiatives will be a commentary on the receptiveness of
schools to PC-based teaching methods. It will also demonstrate the ability
of new technology and the devolution of school budgets to foster
public-private partnerships in a field where the private sector has a
substantial contribution to make. If information superhighways are to amount
to anything by 2000, they will have to start laying tracks through the
education system - not just universities - early on.

Michael Kingshott, 47, is quitting his job as chief executive of Sally UK,
the cross-channel ferry operator that he founded, to take over at John I
Jacobs, an old-established firm of shipbrokers and shipowners.
Kingshott, an insurance broker by training, has been involved in the
shipping and transportation industry since 1964. He takes over from John
Jacobs, 74, who has headed the company since 1967. Jacobs is staying on as
chairman of the company until a successor is found.
Kingshott wants to develop Jacobs into a more broadly-based shipping,

FT  13 MAY 94 / People: Liverpool Victoria - new head
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roy Hurley, a former managing director of AA Insurance and Financial
services, is to become chief executive of Liverpool Victoria, the UK's
biggest friendly society. A formal announcement will be made on Monday.
The move departs from tradition at Liverpool Victoria, where the top job has
previously always gone to an insider during the society's 151 year history.
Hurley takes over in July, after the retirement of the current chief
executive John Lambeth, who leaves after 45 years with the society.
Hurley, below, is 52 and has worked in the insurance industry for more than
30 years. He was managing director of AA Insurance and Financial services
for 8 years until July 1993, whereupon he became chairman of the Service
Managing Agencies, a Lloyd's managing agent.
Liverpool Victoria, with funds under management in excess of Pounds 3.2bn,
has been regarded as something of a sleeping giant in the financial services
sector. The appointment of a new head of marketing in 1993 led to an image
and profile re-think, with this month the launch of the group's new
corporate image.
This year has also seen the incorporation of the society, allowing it to
expand the range of its products to include unit trusts, peps, mortgages and
general insurance.
Hurley hopes to continue the work of raising the public profile of the
society: 'What is important is that the industry recognises the social
values and benefits of services we provide, given that many of the people we
deal with are not catered for by other financial service providers.'

<TEXT>
Most computer users adjust their screen once and work regardless of light
conditions. ICL has launched a system called Autobrite which automatically
adjusts the screen to match surrounding levels.
'Visual ergonomics is a big problem,' says Bjorn Malmberg, technical
co-ordinator at ICL Personal Systems. 'People can get red-eyed, tired and
develop headaches when reading from the screen.' Two detectors in the
Autobrite module sense lighting conditions at the front and back of the
screen; these are compared with pre-set correction tables and brightness and
contrast are changed accordingly.
ICL (owned by Japan's Fujitsu) has linked up with Helvar, a Finnish lighting
company, to add an infra-red controlled office lighting system.

<TEXT>
An electronic chip that could significantly increase signal processing
speeds has been developed by Robomatix Technologies, writes Anna Kochan.
Tests to be completed by early summer on an initial production batch of 160
chips will prove whether Robomatix has succeeded where others have failed,
says Zami Aberman, president of the Israeli company.
He describes the Xium chip as massively parallel; it incorporates 1,024
processors. Simulations show a Xium chip could perform 1bn instructions per
second. It would function as a single chip or as part of a computer board.
If the tests prove successful, Robomatix plans to put the chip into
automated inspection systems. Its ability to perform real-time recognition
and processing of data could be useful in video-conferencing and air traffic
control systems.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Using 'idle' computer time to process other tasks in the background is an
old idea, writes Claire Gooding. This principle has been applied to PC
networks by Jetstream, 66 per cent owned by New Zealand Telecom.
Its Jetnet software shares out heavy processing workloads between networked
PCs while other users on the network are away or performing low-power tasks
such as word processing.
It claims Jetnet introduces genuine parallel processing across PC networks.
The 'unused' power - which Jetstream says might amount to 80 per cent in
some networks - can in theory be capitalised to support heavy transaction
processing loads, tasks previously limited to mid-range and mainframe
computers. The Jetnet applications development toolkit costs around Pounds
9,500 in the UK.

Satellites will soon come to the rescue of accident victims in the UK - by
pinpointing ambulances to within a few feet.
West Midlands Ambulance Service will use a new system based on satellite
navigation technology. 'The satellite system will talk to our existing
computerised control and command system in a way never previously
attempted,' says Ian Van Creveld, operations director.
Developed by Terrafix, a UK company, it works from radio signals transmitted
by at least three satellites. These are picked up by a receiver in the
ambulance which uses them to give a 'fix' on its position.
A data channel on the radio system is used to communicate its position to
the control room; it is translated into map co-ordinates of position,
direction and speed. The information is used to work out response times.

FT  13 MAY 94 / People: Kiosk merchant learnt business the hard way; the
customer is king
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new managing director of the UK's third-largest off-licence chain learnt
the art of retailing the hard way, through selling cigarettes, chocolates
and chewing gum on the streets of Iran.
Nader Haghighi, right, still just 35, has travelled far since then. He has
just been tempted away from the country's biggest off-licence chain,
Thresher (owned by the brewer Whitbread), where he was operations director
with responsibility for 1,000 stores and 5,000 staff, to join Cellar 5 (part
of the Greenalls group), where he will be managing 500 stores. He takes over
from Peter Lloyd, who is retiring early on medical grounds.
When his father died at the age of nine, Haghighi became the family
breadwinner, combining his small tobacconist/confectionery kiosk with his
schooling. He eventually graduated to running his own clothes boutique.
It was invaluable experience, he says: 'I learnt retailing at the sharp end,
learning how to behave with customers, discovering that you have to give
them the right service and treat them as king. If I didn't, then they would
just have walked past me on the street.'
He came to the UK in 1979 hoping to study medicine. First he had to learn
English. In the meantime, by 1980 he was also working as a part-time kitchen
porter for Pizzaland; in 1981 he joined Thresher, also on a part-time basis.
He moved fast through the ranks, proving himself in the mid-1980s by running
a variety of Thresher outlets where staffing and stock losses were proving
difficult.
By 1990 he was the company's operations director, steering the group's three
brand off-licences - Thresher Wine Shop, Wine Rack and Bottoms Up. It was,
he admits, frequently an 18 hour working day, though he popped a bottle of
Lanson on getting his latest job.
'I learned all the important skills in the bazaar, particularly the personal
determination to make a success of any job that we might do,' says Haghighi.
Not forgetting, of course, the importance of getting margins close to the
30-40 per cent he made back in his Iranian kiosk days.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Property: The reluctant house-hunter - ICI's search for new
headquarters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few London buildings exude as much corporate self-confidence as the
neo-classical monolith of Imperial Chemical House at Number Nine Millbank,
headquarters, since 1926, of one of Britain's biggest industrial companies.
The pomp of the stone and granite exterior is matched by the grandeur of its
ultra-modern interior.
A Pounds 30m refurbishment in 1988 replaced the original oak-panelled
corridors and rabbit-warren of offices with a set of wall-to-floor glass
offices arranged around a transparent atrium.
A sense of corporate identity is stamped on the building by a huge atrium
carpet made from ICI-produced fibres and the vibrant, modern oil paintings,
commissioned for ICI, which line the walls.
Given the strong sense of identity associated with the building, it is
poignant that ICI has now decided to move to smaller and cheaper premises.
ICI's headquarters staff numbered 2,000 two decades ago. Now, following
decentralisation, retrenchment and the demerger of Zeneca, ICI's bioscience
offshoot which has moved to new premises, there are only 240 people based at
Millbank. By the end of 1995, the figure will have been reduced to 150.
ICI's decision to rethink its occupancy of the Millbank site is being
mirrored by similar cost-cutting decisions on property at its subsidiaries
throughout the UK.
Since ICI has set itself targets on return on capital of at least 20 per
cent, it needs to make its assets work. In addition, restructuring, job cuts
and disposals of non-core and under-performing businesses have added to the
backlog of property problems to be solved.
The job of overhauling ICI's portfolio of 400 properties and 30,000 acres of
land has fallen to Mr Andrew Sturt, a former developer who became a
consultant to ICI in October 1991, following Mr Ronnie Hampel's appointment
as chief executive.
Mr Hampel's decision to appoint a property consultant reflects the view at
ICI that there was an insufficient awareness of the importance of property.
Mr Hampel believes property should be viewed as an asset, rather than as a
resource.
For the past decade ICI has operated without a group property manager and
decisions relating to property have inevitably been handled on an ad hoc
basis.
'There was a lack of a property dimension in decision-making,' says Mr
Sturt.
Such an approach had it drawbacks, principally a lack of flexibility. ICI
would build premises in locations which appeared to be cheap. However, the
premises were often unsuitable for occupation by another tenant, which made
them difficult to dispose of once ICI had ceased to require them. 'It is a
burden that was totally unnecessary,' says Mr Sturt.
Recession, the decline of manufacturing industry and, in some cases, the
contamination of land has exacerbated the problems of disposing of property
in difficult locations. In Harrogate, for example, ICI owns a large expanse
of vacant offices, laboratories and 70 acres of land on a site that was
formerly the headquarters of ICI Fibres.
The difficulty in cases such as these is in obtaining planning permission
for a change of use for the site. The scale of recent job losses in
Harrogate has made the local authority reluctant to allow a change of use
for land that was previously used for employment generating purposes.
Sometimes, circumstances change with time and a problematic property can
become valuable. Near Bristol, for instance, ICI owns 1,500 acres of surplus
land on a site acquired in 1957 to accommodate a petrochemicals plant. The
plant occupies 370 acres, while the remainder of the land, which was
originally earmarked for the expansion of the plant, has so far been unused.
But the construction nearby of the second Severn Crossing and the addition
of an intersection to the M49 motorway could make the site valuable.
ICI will seek planning permission later this month to build 2 1/4 m square
feet of warehouses on a third of the site. It intends to seek institutional
partners to build the warehouses, which will be up to 300,000 sq ft in size.
In other cases, it is hard to imagine anything that could add value to a
site. In Dumfries, Scotland, ICI owns a 100,000 sq ft office building, built
in the 1960s. Only a handful of people occupy the building and ICI has
little chance of finding new tenants given the poor local demand for
offices.
In the case of the Dumfries building, the decision to locate a business in
an out-of-the-way spot dates back to a decision taken during the second
world war to find a manufacturing location beyond the reach of German
bombers. But many of ICI's surplus premises stem from more recent decisions.
In Welwyn, for instance, ICI is trying to dispose of a four-year old,
120,000 sq ft building that was built to house the headquarters of its films
division. Following restructuring and relocation, only a handful of people
now occupy the building. 'As soon as the headquarters was completed, the
rationale for it had gone,' says Mr Sturt.
A similar situation, on a larger scale, has arisen with ICI's group
headquarters at Millbank. The building has several unused floors as a result
of ICI's restructuring and, in particular, the demerger of Zeneca.
However, sub-letting space at Millbank is not a viable solution. The
building's design offers insufficient privacy if shared by two companies.
company.
Instead of sub-letting the surplus space, ICI plans to find itself new
premises, obtain a new tenant for the existing premises and then sell its
Millbank building, together with two adjacent buildings it owns that are let
to the government.
Finding new premises is proving difficult, given ICI's intention to remain
close to the City and Westminster, its need for car parking spaces and its
insistence on easy access for visitors.
Mr Sturt has been unimpressed with the 100 buildings he seen so far. 'What
is in the market at the moment is disappointing,' he says.
The problem of property disposal highlights the question of whether
corporate buildings should be owned or leased. The case for owning
production plant is strong, for example, because of the necessity to invest
large amounts of capital in specialist equipment.
For other types of property, such as offices, however, there is a strong
case for renting, rather than owning property. 'With the pressure on the
businesses to achieve a 20-30 per cent return on capital, it is crazy to be
investing in a low-yielding property asset. It is putting a millstone around
the neck of businesses,' says Mr Sturt.
'Planning for business is relatively short term compared with even a decade
ago,' he argues. 'There is no point in investing in premises for ever.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / Management: Insead bears up to change pains - Competition,
recession and poaching / The challenges facing one of the world's best-known
business schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story goes that there were three reasons why Insead's founding fathers
chose Fontainebleau as the site for an international business school in
1959. The nearby Nato headquarters meant that the area had the sort of
infrastructure which would appeal to an international clientele; Orly
airport was within half an hour's drive; and the centre of Paris was a mere
70 kilometres away.
As it happened, Nato quickly moved to Brussels, Charles de Gaulle
subsequently became established as France's international airport, and
modern traffic conditions turned the journey from school gate to Arc de
Triomphe into a two-and-a-half hour rush-hour slog.
But none of this has seriously impeded Insead's progress. Helped by a period
of hectic expansion in the mid to late 1980s, the European Institute of
Business Administration, to give it its full title, is today one of the
best-known management education centres in the world, running the largest
MBA programme and one of the most extensive executive training facilities on
the Continent.
It is no small irony, however, that Insead itself is now undergoing some of
the change pains which its professors are so good at analysing in other
companies. In common with rival business schools it is grappling not only
with recession but with more fundamental challenges to the concept of
management education and the direction of an increasingly competitive market
place.
The MBA, for example, which not long ago almost guaranteed career and
financial advancement, appears for the moment to have ceased growing. The
executive education business, comprising both open and company-specific
programmes, must satisfy the increasingly short-term requirements of
corporate clients.
Most worrying of all, though, is a growing tendency for big companies to
organise in-house management development courses. The prospect of using
technology to 'deliver' education direct to the workplace rather than on
campus is being taken seriously in the industry.
Insead's very size - its more than 80 permanent faculty members and an
annual budget of FF284m (Pounds 33m) are large by European, if not US
standards - has exacerbated its vulnerability to change. Budget pressures
necessitated a salary freeze last year, while outside consultants were
brought in to advise on fund raising. By comparison with many well-endowed
US business schools - and even some European rivals - Insead suffers from a
relatively small capital base.
But it is Insead's response to the wider market challenge which will perhaps
be more eagerly watched, not least the actions of the school's recently
appointed co-dean Antonio Borges. Previously deputy governor of the Bank of
Portugal, Borges was director of Insead's MBA programme in the heady growth
days of the 1980s.
'As the management education industry matures we must do other things, and
faster,' says Borges, who shares the job with Ludo Van der Heyden. 'Insead
originally transported the US (business school) model to Europe, which was a
very successful story. But it is no longer enough.'
Internationalisation (of curriculum, students and faculty) is a fashionable
campus cry on both sides of the Atlantic - with Insead no exception. The
school has been in the vanguard from the start, though some French critics
deride the strong US influence (notable in the educational background, if
not the nationality, of much of the faculty).
'In Europe we must learn to rely more on our own leadership and here at
Insead, for example, we must shake off our dependence on American source
material,' says Borges.
For this reason, he adds, 'we need a stronger emphasis on research output,
but it must be strongly rooted in an interface with the business world. Our
aim is to achieve a synergy between the three aspects of teaching, research
and consulting'.
Borges' solution - that innovation holds the key to Insead's continuing
place in the top league of international business schools - may not be
original but is hard to dispute. Good ideas, like most good products, only
have a shortish shelf life and, as he admits, there are a growing number of
competitors claiming to offer to do the same sort of job for half the price.
Among the priority areas for Insead, says Borges, are the challenge of
corporate renewal and transformation, the new borderless Europe and
entrepreneurship (including how to keep big businesses innovative and
competitive).
'We are in close contact with many of the world's leading corporations. What
we can do is study why some fail to achieve their objectives, why some can
adapt and some can't. The differences have important implications for
managers. All areas (of the world) in rapid transition raise important
issues for western companies seeking to manufacture and trade across
intercontinental boundaries - we have to be there ahead of these trends
offering insights and analyses for businesses to apply.'
Business schools are increasingly affected by technology, not least by the
potential effect of the multi-media revolution on the delivery of management
education. 'We do invest in these things but that's normal for the age we
live in,' says Borges. 'But alone it's not enough. The important thing about
Insead is what goes on in the classroom. If you want to change and develop
people, which we do, then you have to have a strong message and give them a
unique experience.'
Borges is adamant that Insead's productivity must increase - 'like many
clients we must achieve more with fewer people', he explains, while
emphasising that faculty numbers will not be cut. He makes no apologies for
the 1980s expansion, which he says has produced 'a better school, the
'all-round' business school'. He cites Insead's PhD programme, which is
extremely expensive in terms of scholarships and faculty time but is
enhancing the school's reputation in the international market. 'We are in
the business of supplying human capital and our PhDs are perhaps the most
tangible evidence of this,' says Borges of recent academic appointments by
US institutions to three Insead participants.
That reputation - endorsed by alumni and corporate participants - is the
school's most precious asset. While MBA numbers have fallen in Europe over
the last couple of years, Insead says its courses remain oversubscribed:
this year there were 2,500 applicants for 466 places. 'Don't forget the
investment they make in themselves: almost all of the MBAs are paying their
own way,' Borges says.
Filling Insead's 'open' executive courses - used by about 1,400
international managers each year - has proved a more formidable challenge.
Numbers fell in 1992-93 - most dramatically in the last quarter - but they
have perked up again in the last 12 months when demand for 'tailor-made',
company-specific programmes has increased.
Insead's marketing - inevitably neglected in the good years - has been
organised more professionally on product rather than country lines. But
Borges is not complacent: 'We must pay attention to our relative weaknesses,
in Germany, for example, which we feel is common to others.'
Outsiders believe Borges has the right combination of academic flair and
financial discipline to reassert Insead's position.
Recent donations from Shell, Sandoz, Heineken and the Boston Consulting
Group are important votes of corporate confidence, but there is still work
to be done to establish a more viable capital base. 'Towards the end of this
academic year we will assess the level of capital we would be looking for
and whether we are to approach this process formally,' says Borges.
Further belt-tightening will almost certainly be necessary.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Management: Battle for star talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They were putting on a brave face this week. But Monday's announcement in
London that Insead's professor of business policy, Sumantra Ghoshal, has
been appointed to the new Robert P Bauman chair in strategic leadership at
the London Business School is undeniably a blow for top brass at the French
school.
Ghoshal's poaching is a sign of growing competition between European
institutions for the best academic talent, and raises the prospect of the
sort of red-toothed rivalry seen between US campuses crossing the Atlantic.
For eight years Ghoshal has been one of Insead's 'stars', raising its
profile with books and award-winning case studies on cross-border management
and international business.
The traffic, it has to be said, is not just one way. This year, Insead
pipped London to the post for two marketing professors from the Wharton
business school in the US (Hubert Gatignon and Erin Anderson), and has also
wooed Richard Rumelt, president of the strategic management society, away
from the University of California at Los Angeles.
Managing faculty members who can earn more from outside activities such as
consultancy and writing than they do from teaching and research is a
headache plaguing all deans at the moment.
'When someone says they want a change of scene, giving them a 10 or 20 per
cent pay rise is not the answer,' says Ludo Van der Heyden, Insead's
co-dean.
Van der Heyden has mixed feelings. He does not deny disappointment at
Ghoshal's departure and believes London may be targeting Insead (among
others) as part of a policy to recruit more faculty members from outside the
UK. On the other hand, he believes that European schools collectively still
lack credibility by comparison with the US and that a stronger LBS is to the
benefit of all.
As one of the top schools in Europe, Insead is particularly vulnerable -
'but it will make us sharper,' Van der Heyden adds philosophically.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Management: Keeping ahead of trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 3,000 managers participate in short management programmes at
Insead each year. So a big challenge for the school is to respond to changes
in the executive education market. Arnoud De Meyer, associate dean
responsible for executive education, identifies the following trends:
An enormous demand for internationalisation, or developing managers with an
international view. 'This doesn't just mean going on an international
assignment, but being aware that the world abroad is not the same as the one
you have at home.'
A shift of interest away from 'grooming the directors of the future,
improving individuals', towards programmes which 'transform the whole
organisation'. It is this trend which explains the popularity of tailor-made
or 'company specific' programmes at the expense of 'open programmes' (ie
open to all-comers). De Meyer believes this is not necessarily a permanent
change.
The growing sophistication - and seniority - of people in charge of human
resources in companies. One result is that companies 'are more demanding'.
The need for action-orientedness. 'Looking at the old brochures, executive
education used to be more about broadening the perspective. Participants
want that today too, but they also want teaching which is relevant to what
they will be doing next week.'
The impact of delayering, or the thinning out of management tiers. 'Business
schools have been preaching this, but in a way we are victims of our own
success.' As well as fewer managers to train, schools have to find ways of
helping managers who move horizontally across organisations.
Partnerships. Insead has run a course for Hewlett-Packard and its dealers,
and is exploring the idea of organising programmes for companies and their
suppliers (the idea being that there could be more impact if individuals
across the 'value chain' are involved).

FT  13 MAY 94 / Whitehall shake-up urged for jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Whitehall department should be set up to replace the employment and
education departments as part of a package of measures to focus education
more towards the job market, a report published by a Conservative pressure
group said yesterday.
The Tory Reform Group paper includes proposals to relaunch the training and
enterprise councils in England and Wales - the employer-led bodies which
deliver government training schemes.
It recommends almost halving the number of Tecs from 75 to 40 and allowing
them to replace local education authorities as a source of support for
schools.
Mr Julian Ayer, author of the paper, said: 'The idea is not to amalgamate
the employment and education departments but to let them wither gradually
after the formation of this new department.'
The other aim of the proposals was to stop the growth of an 'underclass' and
create a skilled workforce up to world standards.
Mr Ayer said that 20 per cent of the labour force was permanently excluded
from work or functionally illiterate and employed in low-skilled jobs which
were disappearing. The new Whitehall department, he said, would take in the
minister for sport from the National Heritage Department and the prison
education service.
The Commons trade and industry committee recently suggested that the
employment department's responsibilities should be transferred to the trade
department.
The Tecs, Mr Ayer said, had been given insufficient power to deliver the
local training and employment links hoped for when they were established in
1990.

FT  13 MAY 94 / European rivals pay more for telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses in the UK pay less for telecommunications than those in France,
Germany and Italy, with large business users considerably better off, says a
survey published today.
The survey also says that the price gap between British Telecommunications
and Mercury, the leading UK operators, is steadily narrowing, and shows
typical UK residential customers to be worse off than those in France.
The study by Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, is one of
the most comprehensive telecoms price comparisons to include the UK. It
makes allowance for Britain's comparatively large local-call zones, notably
in London.
Comparing prices for residential customers and different sizes of business
in the four countries, it reveals Italy to be consistently the most
expensive. Italian businesses with more than 100 lines pay almost twice as
much as UK counterparts per line in calls - Pounds 5,302 a year, at January
prices, against Pounds 2,847 for UK Mercury lines and Pounds 3,176 for BT.
Smaller businesses in the UK are similarly well placed. At January prices,
those with three lines pay Pounds 721 a year per line with Mercury and
Pounds 739 with BT, against Pounds 860 in France, Pounds 930 in Ger-many and
Pounds 1,277 in Italy.
However, taking into account line-rental charges, the typical residential
customer was found to pay Pounds 26 a year less in France than in Britain
with BT. This is explained by the introduction of value added tax on
telephone calls in France in 1989 without a corresponding increase in
tariffs.
The survey finds a steady convergence in the cost of international telephone
calls from the four countries in the past 10 years, with particularly steep
falls in Italy and France.
In Britain, large businesses with 100 lines have seen the average cost per
minute of an international call fall from 78p to 40p (BT) and 37p (Mercury)
since 1983 (at 1994 prices). In France the equivalent decline has been from
Pounds 1.06 to 47p, in Germany from 91p to 46p and in Italy from Pounds 1.44
to 60p.
The survey gives a mixed verdict on the impact of privatisation and
competition. While large businesses - until recently the main battleground
for UK competition - appear to have made substantial gains in the UK
compared with their continental counterparts, small businesses and
residential customers have not made notable gains on a comparative basis.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Venables company wound up in court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Terry Venables' insolvent company Edennote was wound up in the High Court
yesterday on a creditors' petition brought by his former club Tottenham
Hotspur and its chairman Mr Alan Sugar.
A judge rejected Edennote's argument that the wind-up move was an improper
attempt to 'stifle' a pending damages claim by the company and Mr Venables,
the England football coach.
The claim is over Mr Venables' allegedly unlawful removal as chief executive
and team manager of Spurs. Edennote argued that the wind-up should therefore
be dismissed or delayed until after the outcome of the damages claim.
The petition was based on an unpaid debt for at least Pounds 183,000 legal
costs awarded to Spurs and Mr Sugar last year after Edennote's unsuccessful
court attempt to secure Mr Venables' reinstatement at the club.
The full costs bill claimed ran to Pounds 460,000, but was later officially
assessed at Pounds 335,000. Both sides still dispute this figure. In the
meantime, an interim award of Pounds 183,715 has been made but remains
unpaid.
Mr Justice Rattee said Edennote's biggest creditor was Mr Venables himself,
with a claim for more than Pounds 1m. The company's only substantial assets
were the possibility of a successful damages action and a claim for
repayment of Pounds 100,000 tax from the Inland Revenue.
In view of the scale of its debts, the company would remain insolvent
whatever the result of its pending claims.
Spurs alleged that Mr Venables improperly transferred his Edennote shares to
another company he owned, possibly in an attempt to reorganise his affairs
and avoid personal liabilities that might arise if Edennote were liquidated.
The judge said the only way this allegation could be investigated was in the
context of a winding-up.
It would still be open to the liquidator to proceed with the wrongful
dismissal claim against Spurs, taking into account the wishes of Mr
Venables, who would have to fund the action personally in view of his
company's insolvency.
The judge ordered Edennote to pay the costs of the winding-up proceedings.
He also granted Spurs and Mr Sugar permission to apply, if necessary, for
the costs to be paid by Mr Venables.

Lord Justice Scott may call more witnesses to give evidence to the inquiry
into the exporting of defence-related equipment to Iraq, officials indicated
yesterday.
The scheduled public hearings, which have lasted just over a year, ended
yesterday when officials from Customs and Excise completed giving evidence.
Their presence had already caused the inquiry to extend its original April 1
deadline.
Even if more witnesses are called, Lord Justice Scott is expected to keep to
his original timetable and complete his draft report by July, with the final
report due to be published by December.
Provisional criticisms will be sent in August to those concerned.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Ford cuts price of most Mondeos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford has cut the prices of its best-selling Mondeo car range by Pounds 265
on most models, John Griffiths writes.
The company, however, is denying motor-trade reports that it plans to scrap
its dealers' 10 per cent profit margin on the cars in favour of a simple
handling charge.
'Such reports are nonsense,' Ford said yesterday. But it confirmed that it
had told its dealers to cut prices of all Mondeos by Pounds 265, except the
most basic version, backdated to May 1, and to more than halve the cost of
some options such as anti-lock braking.
The measures are equivalent to a price cut of about 2 per cent on the most
popular fleet model, the 1.8 litre LX.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Pirelli to stop making truck tyres at Burton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, is ending truck-tyre production
at its Burton on Trent headquarters in Staffordshire, with an expected loss
of 350 jobs.
The move is part of a Europe-wide restructuring of Pirelli's tyre
operations, prompted partly by the worst slump in continental Europe's
commercial vehicle markets since the second world war.
Truck tyres supplied by Burton will instead come from the group's main
manufacturing centre near Turin and from new facilities at its Izmit plant
in Turkey. Only about 40 per cent of Burton's truck-tyre output is sold in
the UK, the bulk going to European markets.
The move comes almost exactly a year after Pirelli, the world's
fifth-largest tyre maker, announced the closure of car-tyre production at
Burton and its transfer to its other large UK manufacturing facility at
Carlisle, Cumbria.
That move cost more than 600 jobs at Burton, where the group for many years
has been the largest employer.
After truck-tyre production ends - expected by August - about 450 employees
will remain. They will comprise headquarters staff and those engaged in
logistics, general rubber goods, compounding and retreading.
The restructuring means further expansion at the Carlisle plant, which
employs about 800. At least 30 Burton manufacturing employees are expected
to relocate to Carlisle, and this figure may be increased by Carlisle
workers taking up a voluntary-redundancy and early-retirement programme
being offered at both centres.
Pirelli is spending 'several million' pounds on increasing capacity at
Carlisle, where Burton's substantial technical and research and development
facilities are also being relocated. Mr John Tierney, personnel director,
said yesterday that Carlisle would play an expanded product-development role
in Pirelli's European operations.
During the next four years fabric and compounding activities, employing
about 80 people, are also to be transferred to Carlisle from Burton.

The measures are equivalent to a price cut of about 2 per cent on the most

This year the Mondeo has become the UK's single best-selling car. This
follows a troubled start to sales early last year when the company was
forced to cut prices by an average of 6 per cent only two weeks after the
range's launch.
The latest price cuts come against a background in the industry of much
lower dealer profit margins compared with the 15 per cent to 17 per cent
norm of 12 months ago.
Vauxhall recently launched its new Omega executive car with an official
dealers' margin of 5 per cent, and Ford has recently cut margins on its
Granada/Scorpio executive cars to a similar level.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Top Treasury job for plain speaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Whitehall reshuffle has resulted in the promotion of one of the Treasury's
least conventional senior officials to take charge of public expenditure.
Downing Street announced yesterday that Mr Robert Culpin, 47, would become
second permanent secretary, public expenditure, on June 1. He succeeds Mr
Andrew Turnbull, 49, who will leave the Treasury to become permanent
secretary at the Department of the Environment.
Mr Culpin is a no-nonsense official who speaks his mind. Apart from a spell
with the UK delegation to the European Community in the early 1970s, he has
been at the Treasury for his entire working life since 1968. A tall man,
with a fondness for brown brogues, one newspaper once described him as
looking more like a biblical prophet than a typical mandarin.
In his memoirs Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, says Mr Culpin had 'the
most luxuriant beard in a generally clean-shaven Treasury'.
Mr Culpin was promoted to be director of fiscal and monetary policy last
year after heading the Treasury's fiscal policy group from 1987.
Between 1984 and 1987 he was press secretary to the then Mr Nigel Lawson and
one of a select group of officials in the Treasury with whom the former
chancellor would exchange and discuss economic ideas.
In his book, Lord Lawson recalls that Mr Culpin was 'a controversial
appointment' as press secretary. 'He claimed that until I offered him the
job he had never the slightest desire to read the newspapers.'
The Treasury announced that Mr Chris Kelly, 47, would take over from Mr
Culpin as director of fiscal and monetary policy. Mr Kelly is head of the
general expenditure policy group.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Troubled shipyard breaks even in year
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder which went into receivership a year
ago today, has broken even on turnover of Pounds 46m in the past 12 months,
receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday.
Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said draft contracts for the sale of
Swans to French-based shipbuilder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie had
been discussed at meetings this week.
He hoped a deal, conditional on the award to Swans by the Ministry of
Defence of the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere, would be signed by
the end of this month.
He gave two reasons why it had not been possible to conclude the agreement
sooner. One was the detailed negotiations with the MoD that were necessary
for CMN to become an approved supplier if it bought Swan Hunter. The other
was the issue of the contract to complete the last frigate being built at
the yard. A meeting about that was held on Wednesday, and another is planned
for next Friday.
Swans' rivals for the Bedivere refit are Yarrow, Tees Dockyard and two
consortia, VSEL/Devonport and BAe/Semma/Rosyth. The tenders, said Mr
Horsfield, were within a 'fairly confined range'. A decision would be
announced in July.
Mr Horsfield said closure of Swans and piecemeal sale of its assets looked
likely if the yard did not win Bedivere. He hoped it would first finish the
last frigate, due for completion in November. The departure from the Tyne
next week of her sister ship Northumberland will trigger a further 148
redundancies plus 237 lay-offs, reducing the workforce from nearly 2,500 on
receivership to 650.

BBC journalists have voted to stage a series of 24-hour strikes in a dispute

A large majority of members of the National Union of Journalists voted in
favour of a stoppage although fewer than half the 2,274 journalists took
part in the ballot.
Members of Bectu, the main broadcasting union, voted at the weekend for a
series of 24-hour strikes and threatened to disrupt outside sports
programmes.
The unions are in dispute over the introduction of performance pay and plans
for new contract terms which they say will lead to longer working days and

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to 20 per cent of automotive components companies in the UK could
disappear in the next three years as the industry undergoes a far-reaching
restructuring, says the accountancy firm Price Waterhouse.
Mr Richard Gane, head of the Price Waterhouse automotive group, warned that
there could be substantial job losses, particularly in the Midlands.
The larger suppliers 'ought to survive', said Mr Gane, but many of the
smaller producers, which supply the large component makers, were at risk.
Mr Gane, who was speaking at an automotive conference in Gaydon,
Warwickshire, said: 'Already we are seeing a rationalisation in the supplier
market. For many smaller suppliers the only hope of survival is through
joint ventures and alliances.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / Local traders criticise charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federation of Small Busi-nesses called yesterday for an investigation by
the Office of Fair Trading into 'exploitative practices' by hospitals,
charities, schools and churches, Richard Gourlay writes.
The federation, which represents 50,000 small businesses, says established
enterprises are 'trading in a jungle of unfair competition'.
It adds that charity shops sell new goods while enjoying lower rates than
commercial businesses; churches have rate-exempt premises that they can let
to commercial businesses which then profit from subsidised rentals; and
schools compete directly with private-sector suppliers of accom-modation,
hotels and caterers.
The report also attacks the 'increasing abuse' of car boot sales and
itinerant markets. 'Legitimate local traders and licensed market traders are
being undercut and undermined,' the federation says.

FT  13 MAY 94 / GE jobs plan bolsters helicopter engines bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric of the US is expected today to announce details of its bid
to supply engines for the British army's new attack helicopter.
At an airshow in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, the US power equipment and engine
manufacturer will say it has teamed up with a UK partner to make the engines
and will spend the equivalent value of any contract by placing work in
Britain.
The helicopter order is one of the most significant army equipment purchases
for some years. Up to 100 new battlefield helicopters are due to be ordered
early next year in a contract worth about Pounds 2bn.
GE is using its alliance with European Gas Turbines, a subsidiary of GEC
Alsthom, to offer its engines for two of the potential six competitors - the
McDonnell Douglas Apache, which would be manufactured under licence by
Westland, and the Bell Cobra, which would be made under licence by
GEC-Marconi. EGT will act as prime contractor for the engines if either wins
the competition.
The engine contract alone could be worth Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m.
To make the proposal attractive to the Ministry of Defence, GE has said that
it will offset the full value of any contract placed with work in the UK.
About 75 per cent of the value of the offset will provide employment and the
balance would transfer technology to Britain.
The Apache helicopter, while expensive, is thought to be the army's favoured
choice. The estimated 1,000 Apaches and Super Cobras in service are fitted
with GE's T700 engine. It is understood that Westland's bid to the MoD also
specifies the T700 as the main choice.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Revised trade data add Pounds 300m to deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Statistical Office and Customs and Excise board yesterday
unveiled the results of a sweeping review of the European Union's
controversial system of collecting trade statistics. They concluded that, on
balance, little had changed.
The review of Intrastat, as the system is known, led to an upwards revision
in last year's visible trade deficit to Pounds 13.7bn from Pounds 13.4bn,
and numerous other changes in price and volume figures.
Detailed checks on more than 11,000 companies disclosed that on average
traders were under-recording the value of UK imports from the EU by 1 1/4
per cent and under-recording British exports to the EU by  1/4 per cent,
while late reporting by traders of some of their shipments had also been
substantial. But after taking into account the results of a big compliance
exercise carried out by Customs, the net effect was to increase last year's
UK deficit with the EU by only Pounds 309m.
The CSO says it is confident that the new statistical system, which was
introduced in January last year to cope with the elimination of border
controls in intra-EU trade, is now capturing most of the UK trade flows.
But this confidence is not shared by some in the City, who continue to
complain that the statistics are painting an overly rosy picture of the UK
trade balance - and at odds with other data, such as surveys by the
Confederation of British Industry.
Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS, for example, believes that even
after yesterday's revisions the CSO is still underestimating imports by some
Pounds 4bn a year. 'The CSO has tried very hard in this review, but I think
it still misses a lot of trade,' he said.
Before last year, UK trade flows used to be measured as they passed through
ports. However, because these 'trade posts' are illegal under the EU's
single-market, the CSO collects its statistical data directly from
companies.
Since Intrastat collects figures through value added tax returns and other
statistical inquiries, it had been assumed that it would underestimate
imports.
The CSO's review yesterday confirmed some of these fears. But the revision
to the trade deficit was far lower than most market expectations, and most
of the other revisions were minor and unlikely to seriously change the GDP
or output figures.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Watchdog clears FT's on-line database service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission announced yesterday that the monopoly
position of Profile, the Financial Times on-line database service, does not
operate against the public interest.
On-line financial and business database services deliver information,
including the text of newspaper articles, to subscribers' personal computers
or terminals via telecommunications links. Profile has a share of almost 40
per cent of the UK market in such services.
The year-long commission inquiry centred on the FT's copyright licensing
practices: the FT does not generally allow material from its publications to
be used by other database service providers. Some competitors argued that
this practice gave FT Profile an unfair advantage and some users, who needed
access to information from the FT, complained that they were unable to
choose their preferred service on the basis of cost and ease of use.
The commission found that the FT's licensing practice was 'a legitimate
competitive action intended to differentiate FT Profile from its
competitors'. It concluded that, while the FT enjoyed a special position as
a business and financial newspaper, almost all the factual information it
contained was also available elsewhere.
The inquiry also covered a second database provider, Data-Star Dialog, which
is owned by the US company Knight-Ridder and which has a one-third share of
the UK market. No complaints were received about Data-Star Dialog but the
commission was bound to investigate its practices because, under the terms
of the Fair Trading Act 1973, the company was also considered to hold a
monopoly position. The commission found the monopoly 'does not give cause
for concern'.
Mr Fred Perkins, the FT group's director of electronic publishing, said: 'It
is a well-established principle that ownership of copyright automatically
bestows a monopoly advantage which allows companies to recoup their
investment costs and generate income.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / Imports from EU fall to a three-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imports from the European Union into the UK fell to their lowest level for
almost three years in February, amid the continuing recession in western
Europe, seasonally adjusted trade figures from the Central Statistical
Office showed yesterday.
The value of imports from EU countries to the UK fell to Pounds 5.1bn during
February, down from Pounds 5.4bn the previous month.
Coupled with fairly flat levels of UK exports to the EU, the fall in imports
meant that the UK's trade deficit with the rest of the EU also fell in
February, down to Pounds 74m from Pounds 97m the previous month. This was
its lowest level for five months, and markedly lower than the UK's trade
deficit with the rest of the world.
Part of the reason for the improvement in the EU trade balance was that
imports from Germany fell for the fifth consecutive month in February,
dropping to Pounds 1.48bn - leaving the trade deficit with Germany narrower
at Pounds 226m.
The trade deficit with France was also lower in February, down to Pounds 91m
from one of Pounds 137m - again largely due to falling imports.
Meanwhile, yearly figures show that the UK ran a trade surplus with the
Benelux countries for the second year in succession.
The UK's trade deficit with non-EU countries slightly dipped in February,
after rising earlier in the year. The trade balance with the US fell to a
deficit of Pounds 12m, compared with a surplus of Pounds 38m in January.
On a three-monthly basis, however, the balance showed a growing trade
deficit with the US, with one of Pounds 145m during the three months to
February, compared with Pounds 4m during the previous three-month period.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Names allowed to borrow on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's Names are to be allowed to borrow against this year's expected
profits to help them meet losses of an expected Pounds 2.5bn for the 1991
year. Lloyd's will announce its fourth consecutive year of loss next week,
in line with its three-year accounting system.
'This is part of a package of measures to assist Names to trade through,'
explained Mr David Rowland, chairman. He said Names could take credit for up
to 3 per cent of their 1994 premium income limits - the amount of income
they are permitted to underwrite.
With Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the
market, supplying Pounds 9.3bn in capacity this year, the measure should
allow them to borrow up to Pounds 279m. But the facility will only be made
available where managing agents, who administer Lloyd's syndicates, consider
it 'appropriate'.
Last year Lloyd's allowed Names to borrow up to 5 per cent of premium limit,
an amount equivalent to about Pounds 440m. About Pounds 375m of the facility
was used.
Lloyd's is expected to post profits for the 1993 and 1994 years, after steep
increases in premium rates.
The special credit can be used by Names to help them through the solvency
test, an exercise conducted every year to assesses their ability to meet
liabilities. It should ease pressure on the Lloyd's central fund, which pays
claims when Names are unable to meet their obligations.
Mr Rowland stressed that these measures were designed to deal with
'exceptional circumstances' and should not be seen as a 'precedent for the
future'.
Chatset, the publisher which monitors Lloyd's results, estimated before
yesterday's announcement that Names would need to pay Pounds 1,788m of the
1991 loss by the end of July.
Chatset has also revised downwards its estimate of the 1991 result to Pounds
2,546m, after earlier suggesting that it could exceed Pounds 3bn.

FT  13 MAY 94 / SIB orders remedial action on pension sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance companies should begin at once to identify customers in the
categories most at risk of disadvantage from poor advice in the sale of
personal pensions, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog, said yesterday.
In guidance on how to compensate investors who are likely to have lost out,
SIB is telling companies to treat as high-priority cases those where the
customer has died; has already retired; or was over 50 when the lump sum was
transferred out of a former employer's pension into a private plan.
The aim in all the categories is that there should be some immediate
compensation where the ill effect of a decision to take out a personal
pension is already being felt - for example in a lower pension available to
someone who has retired, or in the lack of a pension for a dependant who
would have been entitled to one under the occupational scheme that was left.
Cases identified as where customers opted out of the pension scheme run by
their current employers in order to take out a personal pension should also
be treated as priorities, the regulator said.
SIB's full report on the remedial action companies should take to deal with
the effects of personal pension mis-selling is not due to be published until
the end of July.
It said yesterday, however, that where customers agreed and companies
accepted liability, if investors could be returned to the pension schemes
they had left this should be done as soon as possible.
If there is any dispute about what compensation should be paid, the guidance
said, then the question should be put on 'hold' until after the final
guidance had been published.
The final bill for the industry of compensating victims of poor advice is
expected to run into hundreds of million pounds.
Yesterday's guidance will be followed next week by publication of a
'checklist' from SIB, advising potential investors what issues they should
raise with sales agents and advisers when considering a personal pension.
But both publications are behind schedule, raising questions about whether
SIB can meet its planned deadline of the end of July for publishing the
final guidance.
SIB also published yesterday further guidance to companies on how they
should conduct future pension transfer business, expanding on earlier advice
which, for example, warned of the risks of opt-outs.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Bank rejects criticisms of share-settlement system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yesterday launched a strong defence against criticisms
of its proposed Crest paperless share-settlement system.
In a speech in Paris, Mr Pen Kent, executive director of the Bank, rejected
suggestions that the system had slipped behind deadlines and exceeded
predicted costs.
He conceded that the Bank had negotiated an 'absolute cap' on spending of
Pounds 35m, in excess of the estimates circulated last November of between
Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m.
Mr Kent added: 'Readers of some sections of the British press in the past
week have been regaled with stories that Crest will be late, over budget,
disappointingly under-subscribed and insensitive to small investors. None of
this is true.'
He stressed that he expected the costs of Crest to remain within the
original range, and that the figure of Pounds 35m was 'a backstop which is
not expected to be reached'.
He said the design phase had cost Pounds 2m and the estimate to build the
core processing system was Pounds 5m, a figure that had been independently
audited.
The figure reflected a reduction in costs as a result of negotiations and
was at the bottom of the estimated range of Pounds 5m to Pounds 7m. It
included a 40 per cent contingency figure.
Mr Kent said the cost of designing and building the system would be Pounds
12m, including Pounds 5m for the project's business team and professional
fees.
All deadlines had so far been met and Crest would be built by the end of
1995 and could be in operation by late 1996, he added.
The total costs after 1995 until the system was running depended on the
decisions taken by the future owners of the system, but they could be as low
as Pounds 10m.
Mr Kent stressed that the initial Pounds 12m was fully committed, with 48
firms willing to take stakes 'well ahead of what we had expected at this
stage'.
He admitted that the move to five-day rolling settlement was likely to take
place in the middle of next year rather than next January as previously
stated, but said this was not 'on the critical path of the project itself'.
He said much thought had been given to protecting the position of small
shareholders.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Debate and doubts over rosy trade figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Debates about price deflators do not usually leave markets buzzing. But as
the City yesterday analysed the latest UK trade statistics, there was a
question over whether the apparently upbeat figures could be believed.
The Central Statistical Office and Customs and Excise board, which yesterday
unveiled the results of a review into the new system of collecting trade
statistics and calculating price deflators, insist that they can be
believed.
Although the review led to a small revision in last year's trade deficit,
and numerous other changes in price and volumes figures, the CSO says it is
confident that the new statistical system is now capturing most of the UK
trade flows.
But this confidence is not shared by some in the City, who continue to
complain that the statistics are painting an overly rosy picture of the UK
trade balance - and at odds with other data, such as surveys by the
Confederation of British Industry. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS,
for example, believes that even after yesterday's revisions the CSO is still
underestimating imports by some Pounds 4bn a year.
'The CSO has tried very hard in this review, but I think it still misses a
lot of trade,' he said.
The debate centres over the switch-over last year towards a new EU-style
statistical system, known as Intrastat.
Prior to the single market, UK trade flows used to be measured as they
passed through ports. However, because these 'trade posts' are illegal under
the new single-market, the CSO collects its statistical data directly from
companies.
Since this system collects figures on imports and exports through value
added tax returns from companies, the assumption has been that this system
would underestimate imports.
The CSO's review yesterday confirmed some of these fears, revising its
figure for EU imports for 1993 up by Pounds 0.3bn.
But this revision was far lower than most market expectations, and most of
the other revisions were minimal and unlikely to seriously change the GDP or
output figures.
The CSO suggested that in some respects the new system might be more
accurate in recording trade passing through 'entrepot' ports such as
Rotterdam.
Under the old system, imports from non-EU countries arriving in the UK via
Rotterdam were often recorded, incorrectly, as EU imports.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Sizewell B ahead of budget target and on schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sizewell B in Suffolk, Britain's first pressurised water reactor nuclear
power station, is heading for completion more than Pounds 100m below the
budget set five years ago.
It is expected to be commissioned several months ahead of the February 1995
commitment given to government before construction began in 1987.
Completion of the plant on time and below its estimated Pounds 2.03bn budget
follows delays and large cost overruns during the 1970s and 1980s in the
building of advanced gas-cooled reactors.
The causes were late design changes and industrial disputes which led to a
loss of more than 11m man-hours.
Dungeness B in Kent took 18 years to complete - 13 more than scheduled  -
and at double the cost.
Sizewell B's budget was set in 1989. Previous estimates had been lower, but
Nuclear Electric, the plant owner, says the rise from the most recent figure
of Pounds 1.87bn was due to the government abandoning plans for four power
stations of the same design and the consequent loss in economies of scale.
Nuclear Electric hopes to start generating electricity by August or
September.
A further delay is possible because Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution
has yet to issue a licence for the plant to discharge radioactivity
routinely.
While construction is within the timetable given to the government, work is
several weeks behind the company's hopes of last year that it would
commission in May or June.
With only weeks to go before the scheduled completion of construction
contracts, officials expect the capital cost to be in the region of Pounds
1.9bn.
Final figures will be passed to the Department of Trade and Industry, which
is examining the company's planning application for a Pounds 3.5bn
twin-reactor, Sizewell C.
A go-ahead for this plant depends on the outcome of a public inquiry and
also the government's long-awaited nuclear power review. The timetable for
the review and its remit have yet to be announced.
Nuclear Electric already has planning permission for a single reactor at
Hinkley Point C in Somerset but construction there is also subject to a
favourable review out-come.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Energy Saving Trust seeks Pounds 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Energy Saving Trust, the government-created body to promote energy
efficiency, needs to raise nearly Pounds 2bn by the end of the decade to
meet government targets, according to its business plan, published today.
The 50-page plan, which will be sent to ministers this morning, will draw
attention to the government's growing embarrassment over the trust's lack of
finance. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has given it a central role in
the UK's strategy for meeting international targets on global warming.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator,
repeated yesterday that she would not allow the costs of the trust's
projects to be passed on to gas customers without new legislation. It would
be 'tantamount to taxation', she has said.
Her position, which conflicts with that of her predecessor Sir James
McKinnon, has stalled the trust's plans for subsidising home improvements.
Mr Eoin Lees, chief executive of the trust, said that 'virtually none' of
the main projects could proceed without Ofgas changing its position.
The parliamentary select committee on the environment has strongly
criticised the stance since Ms Spottiswoode took charge in November. It has
called her and Sir James to clarify the basis for the change on May 25.
The business plan says an important casualty of the stalemate is Homes 2000,
a proposed scheme to subsidise home improvements such as insulation for
lofts and external walls, and energy-efficient lights and boilers. The
project, which would pay up to half of the costs of these projects, would
need Pounds 8m next year and Pounds 120m by 2000.
The trust intends Homes 2000 to deliver half of its target of cutting annual
emissions of carbon dioxide - a gas implicated in global warming - by 2.5m
tonnes a year.
The plan also points to a further source of political controversy.
Households which do not benefit from the schemes could see annual fuel bills
rise by nearly 2 per cent on top of inflation by 1998, it estimates. It
emphasises, however, that most of the projects will pay for themselves
through energy savings within five years, and that as the schemes become
widespread, average household bills should fall.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Insurers warned of takeover threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has urged insurance
companies to do more to protect themselves against the threat of hostile
takeovers.
Merger and acquisition activity was likely to increase again as Europe came
out of the recession, Mr Heseltine told a dinner of the Association of
British Insurers.
'You should be taking steps now to protect yourselves, in the same way that
your competitors are already protected,' he said in a speech that examined
the international competitiveness of the UK insurance industry.
He said insurers faced new challenges, and moves were needed 'that will
enable you to stand against that cold wind which is blowing across the
globalised market'.
Mr Heseltine's remarks follow a recent 'Swot' (strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities and threats) analysis of the industry by the Department of
Trade and Industry.
Although the UK insurers had strong products and systems, and a well
regarded system of regulation, the quality of some of their underwriting had
been poor. Also, Mr Heseltine said insurers' costs were still too high in
some areas.
In addition, concerns about 'mis-selling' in life insurance and in some
other areas had created an 'image problem'.
Threats facing the industry included the trend towards self-insurance by
many buyers, technological and judicial inflation and the adequacy of
reinsurance.
In the life sector, insurers faced competition from unit trusts and
deposit-based products.
Mr Heseltine called for a dialogue with the industry but warned that the
department was not about to become 'a soft touch'.
He had been particularly disappointed that it had taken so long to persuade
the industry to come up with supporters for the DTI competitiveness
strategy, although he said that three individuals were about to join.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Tax hopes for staff insurance premiums: New Inland Revenue
proposals go to consultation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors and employees would no longer be taxed on insurance premiums paid
by their companies under proposals unveiled by the Inland Revenue yesterday.
Taxpayers would also be able to seek rulings from the Revenue on the tax
treatment of transactions before they submit their annual returns, according
to details in a separate wide-ranging consultation document issued
yesterday.
The first Revenue document considers extending tax relief on some or all
areas of risk covered by directors' and officers' (D &amp; O) insurance
policies.
The proposals are topical at a time when there is growing litigation against
directors and others in connection with corporate collapses in the wake of
the recession.
At present, any such premiums paid by companies are taxable as a benefit in
kind. The Revenue estimates that providing full relief would cost about
Pounds 5m a year.
The idea was raised by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, in the finance bill debate in March.
The Revenue said yesterday that if the consultation exercise suggested the
need for reform, the changes could be proposed in November in time for the
next finance bill.
The document questions whether all risks covered by D &amp; O policies - such as
breach of trust or duty, neglect, error and mis-statement - should be
eligible for relief.
It suggests tax relief might also be extended to cover the costs of the
defence of those charged and acquitted of fraud, dishonesty and malicious
conduct, which are not normally covered by insurance policies.
It proposes extending the tax reliefs to premiums paid by directors and
officers themselves, as well as those paid by their companies - which it
estimates as negligible.
It also suggests exemptions to meet uninsured liabilities by directors and
employees, which it says might very tentatively amount to Pounds 30m a year.
The second consultative document issued yesterday proposes details of a
system for 'pre-return rulings' for income, corporation and capital gains
tax.
It followed an announcement of the idea by Mr Dorrell at the annual dinner
the previous evening of the Association of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Taxes
and Senior Revenue Officials.
The Revenue said that taxpayers would be able to apply after a transaction
but before filing their tax return to obtain a ruling on how it should be
assessed for tax.
In exchange for a fee reflecting the cost of the service, they would also be
able to seek guidance on tax treatment before they undertook a transaction.
The idea ties in with the move towards self-assessment on personal income
tax and pay and file by companies.
Comments on the insurance document are due by June 23 this year and on the
pre-rulings document by July 18.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Chairman of Welsh agency resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WaleS and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of a government-funded Welsh development agency has resigned in
response to a critical report published yesterday by the Commons public
accounts committee.
In the latest embarrassment for Welsh quangos, the committee condemned a
housing policy and car leasing scheme run by the Development Board for Rural
Wales. Mr Glyn Davies, the agency's chairman, said in his resignation
letter: 'I hope this action will enable the DBRW to recover from any
damaging effect resulting from external criticisms.'
The board, which has 120 staff and a grant this year of nearly Pounds 17m,
had illegally allocated houses under two sets of rules, one published and
the other unpublished. Its housing officer and his ex-wife were housed under
the unpublished rules when they would not have otherwise qualified.
'It was wholly unacceptable,' the MPs said, 'for any public authority to
publish a policy for the information of the public and then operate on a
totally different basis.'
It reflected badly on all concerned that for 13 years no one appeared to
realise the DBRW was failing to comply with the housing acts. It was also
unacceptable that a car leasing scheme had been amended without consulting
the Welsh Office.
The MPs said they 'were very surprised that, given the nature and scale of
maladministration' the board had decided not to take disciplinary action.
Accepting Mr Davies' resignation, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said the
board had made a significant contribution to the economic and social
development of mid-Wales. 'I do, however, entirely understand your wish in
the light of recent events that public confidence in the board should be
quickly restored.' Mr Redwood is already reviewing the DBRW's future and it
is expected it may be subsumed into the Welsh Development Agency.
Mr Davies, who had been chairman for seven years, said he also resigned his
membership of the WDA, Wales Tourist Board and Welsh Economic Council.
The Commons committee last year strongly censured the WDA.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Power companies face gas sale curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity companies may face curbs in selling natural gas to 18m
households in the first two years of the phased de-regulation of the
domestic gas industry.
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, said yesterday some restrictions might be
needed because companies would be able to offer full energy packages to
households in 1996 and 1997. In those years, 5 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively of the domestic gas market will be opened to competition.
Gas companies, however, will not be able to offer electricity to their
customers until 1998, when the gas and electricity markets are due to be
fully opened to competition.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said there was 'no question
of regional electricity companies being forbidden' from entering the gas
market. But Ofgas had to ensure they did not have an unfair advantage by
offering energy packages in which gas sales could be subsidised by
electricity supply monopolies.
She denied that companies might be banned from entering the gas market until
1998, saying she did 'not plan to do anything that draconian'.
The 14 electricity distributors in mainland UK, which have invested heavily
for the opening of the market, said yesterday they would fight any proposals
to restrict their participation in the gas market. 'We see gas as a major
business,' said Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive of Yorkshire
Electricity. He denied electricity companies would have an unfair advantage.
'In terms of volume the percentages of the gas and electricity markets open
to competition in 1996 will be similar.'
Mr John Devaney, chief executive of Eastern Electricity, said he would be
surprised if power companies were restricted in the gas market: 'It would
seem foolish to restrict companies which are well equipped to take.'
Offer, the electricity regulator, is already looking at speeding up the
liberalisation of the power market as a result of the changes in the gas
industry.
Only consumers whose peak demand is 100kw or more have a choice from whom to
buy supplies. This choice is due to be extended to all consumers in 1998 but
Offer has asked companies for opinions on bringing forward competition in
some instances to 1996.

FT  13 MAY 94 / CrossRail decision defended by MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative chairman of the four-man committee of MPs which turned down
proposals for the Pounds 2bn London CrossRail proposal yesterday launched a
defence of its surprise decision.
Mr Tony Marlow said the main factors in the committee's thinking were the
decline in commuter travel since the line was planned in 1989, and competing
transport developments elsewhere in London such as the Jubilee Line.
'We were there for 30 detailed, meticulous days, cross-examining the
promoters more thoroughly than any previous committee had done,' Mr Marlow
said. 'I started out well disposed. It is an exciting, imaginative scheme
but we did listen to the detailed evidence.'
The committee concluded that no private-sector company would be willing to
take the risk of financing the pro-ject.
Mr Marlow doubted that the government would be able to ask the committee to
reconsider its verdict as had been suggested by the Labour party. This would
require the government to show that the committee had acted outside the
procedural rules or that there had been a material change in its
circumstances.
In a separate development, one expert close to the project said that in
spite of the political support for rescuing the project, transport officials
were secretly pleased it had been rejected.
The economic case for building CrossRail was 'farcical', he said, and would
require traffic growth during the next 15 years equivalent to the high rates
achieved for only 18 months during the 1980s boom to justify building it.

The tests, introduced in December 1992, had led to 16 convictions up to

The test record emerges in a study on alcohol and drug policies in the
workplace undertaken by Incomes Data Services, an independent research body.
The costs to employers of alcohol abuse is estimated at Pounds 960m a year
for long-term sickness absence, said the study which added that alcohol was
blamed for a fifth of workplace accidents.
An increasing number of employers were seeing a business case for weaning
employees off alcohol and other drugs, the report said.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Scott may call further witnesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Justice Scott may call more witnesses to give evidence to the inquiry
into the exporting of defence-related equipment to Iraq, officials indicated
yesterday, John Mason writes.
The scheduled public hearings, which have lasted just over a year, ended
yesterday when officials from Customs and Excise completed giving evidence.
Their presence had already caused the inquiry to extend its original April 1
deadline.
Even if more witnesses are called, Lord Justice Scott is expected to keep to
his original timetable and complete his draft report by July, with the final
report due to be published by December.
Provisional criticisms will be sent to those concerned in August.
Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the inquiry secretary, warned yesterday that
leaks of these criticisms 'would not be helpful' since the exercise was
intended to ensure the report was fair to witnesses.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Job creation shake-up proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Whitehall department should be set up to replace the departments of
employment and education as part of a package of measures to focus education
more towards the job market, a report published by a Conservative pressure
group said yesterday.
The Tory Reform Group paper includes proposals to relaunch the Training and
Enterprise Councils in England - the employer-led bodies which deliver
government training schemes - almost halving their number from 75 to 40 and
allowing them to replace Local Education Authorities as a source of support
for schools.
Mr Julian Ayer, author of the paper, said: 'The idea is not to amalgamate
the employment and education departments but to let them wither gradually
after the formation of this new department.'
The other aim of his proposals was to stop the growth of an 'underclass' and
create a skilled workforce up to world standards. He said that 20 per cent
of the labour force was permanently excluded from work or functionally
illiterate and employed in low skilled jobs which are disappearing.
The new Whitehall department, said Mr Ayer, would take in the minister for
sport from National Heritage and the prison education service.
The Commons select committee on trade and industry recently suggested that
the employment department's responsibilities should be transferred to the
trade department.
The Tecs, Mr Ayer said, had been given insufficient power to deliver the
local training and employment links hoped for when they were established in
1990.
They needed to be relaunched, the report said, as independent local
strategists freed from central government control and encouraged to merge
with chambers of commerce.
It also called for the development of a partnership between Tecs and
universities, partly to refocus the educational system on vocational
concerns rather than on academic elitism.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Ballot rules favour modernisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's modernisers - Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown - look likely to
benefit from the new system for electing the party leader.
The procedures which came into force last year replace a system under which
union barons wielded hundreds of thousands of block votes and constituency
activists fixed their choice in smoke-filled rooms.
Instead, Labour's elected representatives, party members and trade union
members who pay the political levy will vote by ballot in three sections,
each holding a third of the vote:
Labour's 264 MPs and 45 MEPs.
About 250,000 individual members of the party, who will vote in a postal
ballot.
The estimated 4.5m political levy-payers in the unions. Each union will
ballot levy-paying members under their own procedures and the result will be
aggregated into a national total at Labour party headquarters.
Union leaders will be able to recommend and campaign for a favoured
leadership candidate, but under the new system of secret ballots, they will
not be able to apply the kind of pressure they often exercised in the past.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's employment spokesman, is a clear favourite among
many union leaders, their officials and shop stewards. But they may not
speak for their members in expressing that preference.
Both Mr Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, and Mr Brown, shadow
chancellor, may have less support inside union organisations than Mr
Prescott but either of them could look more attractive as general election
winners to the wider party membership.
Opinion is divided over when the election should be held. Theoretically it
would be possible to hold the contest quickly. 'We could send out ballot
papers to our levy-payers tomorrow,' one senior union official said.
This means that Labour need not wait until its annual conference in the
autumn to elect a new leader, and the election does not require the calling
of a special conference.
The timing of the election will be decided at a meeting of the party's
national executive committee, probably after the European elections on June
9.
Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, will be the key figure in
the process. He will make a recommendation to the executive about the timing
of the election.
Some senior figures in the party believe the leadership contest should be
held as soon as possible after the European elections. 'We want to turn the
focus back on John Major and his government and not get involved in a
protracted election campaign all through the summer,' said one party source.
Lord Healey, the former deputy leader of the party, said yesterday only
Labour MPs should be entitled to vote in the leadership election - as was
the case before 1981.
As the system of electing the leader can be changed only by a party
conference, Lord Healey's suggestion could not be implemented in time for
this election. In any case, an election under the new system is designed to
ensure that the Labour leader can claim genuine popular support.
Each nomination for the party leadership requires the backing of 20 per cent
of Labour MPs to be valid.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader who will be acting leader until
an election, can choose to remain as deputy, as the first official
opportunity for a challenge to her position is the autumn party conference.
It was unclear last night whether she would remain as deputy leader or
decide to run for leader.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Clarke demands support for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday sought to rule out a challenge
to Mr John Major's leadership by warning that the Conservative party was
'finished' unless it rallied round the prime minister.
In a tough speech to the Scottish Conservative party conference in
Inverness, reinforced in comments to journalists, Mr Clarke tied the future
of the government firmly to the survival of the prime minister.
'We will be finished if we do not support the prime minister from now until
the next general election and beyond. The Conservative party has remained in
power for so long because it has a readily identifiable set of principles,
and because it has held together as a cohesive party of government,' he
said.
'The leader deserves loyalty and we will stay in office if we stay behind
him.'
Mr Clarke's warning, delivered before news filtered through to the
conference of the death of Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, follows similar
declarations of support for Mr Major from Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, and Mr Michael Forsyth, the rightwing employment minister.
The chancellor dismissed claims by Mr Henning Christopherson, vice-president
of the European Commission, that UK economic growth was likely to slow from
2.5 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in 1995-96 because of tax increases.
Mr Clarke said Mr Christopherson's analysis - delivered in the commission's
latest assesment of the economic prospects of the European Union's member
states - was 'out of date'. He said there were plenty of data to show that
tax increases were not slowing consumer demand.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Blair emerges as the candidate Tories fear most
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs acknowledged yesterday that there were at least six serious candidates
for the leadership of the Labour party, and that in such circumstances the
prospects of avoiding a damaging and public tussle between leading figures
from its modernising and traditionalist wings did not look good.
In the atmosphere of stunned disbelief pervading Westminster, few MPs were
ready to talk openly about the succession contest that will culminate this
autumn at the latest.
The front runner - and the one most feared by the Tories - is Mr Tony Blair,
the urbane, Oxford-educated lawyer who has made a good fist of shadowing Mr
Michael Howard in the high-profile home affairs portfolio.
Mr Blair, a leading moderniser, has succeeded in chipping away at the
Conservative party's traditionally unassailable position as the party of law
and order by portraying Labour as being tougher on crime and the causes of
crime.
His fluency and ready smile make him arguably the most impressive Labour
performer on the electronic media. There were suggestions yesterday that he
is also the moderniser with whom backbench traditionalists can most easily
live.
But Mr Blair must first convince supporters of Mr Gordon Brown, his
modernising colleague, that he and not the shadow chancellor has the better
chance of winning the race.
After years when the pair were virtually inseparable, Mr Brown has recently
fallen behind in the succession stakes, largely because of what some see as
a patchy performance as chief Treasury spokesman. Some MPs also see Mr
Blair, a family man, as a more rounded individual.
One leading traditionalist said that the strongest campaign at the moment
was a 'stop Gordon' campaign. Most Labour MPs think it inconceivable that
both Mr Brown and Mr Blair will decide to run.
But Mr Brown's closest advisers have yet to accept that their man has worse
prospects. Mr Brown outpolled Mr Blair by 18 votes in the last shadow
cabinet election.
The leading traditionalist candidate is expected to be Mr John Prescott, the
shadow employment secretary. His powerful speech at last year's party
conference played an important part in ensuring that Mr Smith won the tense
battle to inject greater democracy into Labour's links with the trade
unions.
The burly former transport spokesman would secure strong backing from the
union movement if he decided to run.
Many MPs are concerned however that a head-on clash between a leading
moderniser and a leading traditionalist would be extremely damaging for the
party. They hope that Mr Prescott could be persuaded to run only as deputy
leader.
Certainly, Mr Prescott's installation as deputy leader would be the minimum
price demanded by the Labour left in return for allowing a leading
moderniser an unhindered tilt at the leadership.
A strategy for such a balanced ticket would run aground if Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the deputy leader, decided not to run for leader. Many MPs believe
that she could secure her current post if she did this 'in the interests of
party unity'.
Many MPs expect that Mrs Beckett will run, however, in which case the
strength of her candidacy will largely depend on how she is seen to have
done as interim leader and on Labour's performance in the European
elections.
As a former stalwart of the left, Mrs Beckett could garner heavy support
from that wing and from women MPs.
Another potential candidate from the centre-left of the party is Mr Robin
Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, who topped the poll in the
most recent shadow cabinet election.
Mr Cook is widely regarded as the cleverest of Labour's leading politicians
and has shadowed Mr Michael Heseltine astutely and effectively. For some his
main disadvantage is his appearance, but he might emerge as a compromise
candidate with some appeal to both traditionalists and modernisers.
An outside bet to run is Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary,
who could construct a platform as the 'continuity' candidate  - the man who
would carry on Mr Smith's good work.
However, he came within an ace of being voted out of the shadow cabinet last
autumn.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Beckett will lead party into the Euro-campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The loss of such an effective and respected leader less than a month before
polling day can hardly fail to damage Labour's European election campaign.
It will dash the party's hopes of remaining out of the spotlight while the
media focuses on the Conservative party tearing itself apart over a subject
that splits it from top to bottom.
Much attention will now inevitably focus on Mrs Margaret Beckett's
performance as acting leader and the activities of the other personalities
most likely to play a prominent part in the forthcoming leadership race.
The main danger for Labour is that the minds of many of its leading figures
will be on their leadership prospects and not on securing the best possible
election result for their party.
The fact that a strong Labour performance could work in favour of Mrs
Beckett, assuming she entertains leadership ambitions of her own, will
ensure that she tries to maintain such discipline.
Labour's strategy was always going to be to play safe and quietly reap the
anti-Major protest vote in areas of the country that are relatively little
affected by the Liberal Democrat surge.
Mr Smith's death, though shattering for morale in the short term at least,
will do nothing to change that plan. And his abrupt removal from the scene
will not necessarily render the party incapable of executing such an
unambitious battle plan competently - even under an interim leader who is
respected rather than admired and who will be virtually unknown to many
voters. But will all the most prominent players pull together?
The party did all it could last night to insist that it would be as close as
possible to business as usual, after a period for paying its last respects.
One prominent MP said: 'After the funeral, John would have wanted us to
fight as hard as we can.'
After winning 45 out of 81 British seats in the European parliament in the
last elections in 1989, the party's ambitions this time around are
relatively modest. It would settle for an outcome similar to this month's
local elections, when it won a slight improvement to an unusually strong
position.
Even before Mr Smith's death, the party probably had the potential for no
more than about six gains - 87 seats will be at stake this time.
Constituencies in north-west England, the east Midlands and London are at
the top of its target list, although the waters have been muddied in some
cases by the impact of boundary changes.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Events hand PM a chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
History is made by accidents. Early this week, few MPs were willing to bet
on Mr John Major's leadership. Yesterday it was difficult to find any
parliamentarian who did not believe the prime minister would last the
course.
The death of John Smith appeared to wipe Mr Major's slate clean. True, there
were still one or two rightwing Euro-sceptics who warned that nothing, not
even the death of the opposition leader, would alter their determination to
replace the prime minister.
But they were in a minority. Most Tories felt that the positions of Mr Major
and the government might be strengthened.
A senior member of the 1922 backbench committee said: 'Luck appeared to be
running out for the prime minister until the news of today's tragedy swept
through the House.'
In part, the analysis of Mr Major's strengthened position is based on the
assumption that it would be folly to have a leadership election at the same
time as the Labour party.
Whether the race to succeed Mr Smith takes place at a special conference in
mid-summer or in the autumn, it would still be uncomfortably close to the
November deadline by which the Conservatives have to hold a leadership
election if there is a challenge. With the media's attention fixed on
Labour, Tories believe they ought not to create distractions. Many hope that
the Labour election will bring out the divisions that Mr Smith so
successfully masked over.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, a senior backbencher, asked: 'Will the face of moderation
outlive the sad death of Mr Smith?' Mr John Watts, another Tory backbencher,
readily conceded that Mr Smith's great achievement had been to make the
Labour party electable.
But Mr Major's improved standing also owes much to the sudden decrease in
support for Mr Michael Heseltine. Mr Smith's death was a vivid reminder of
human mortality. Unfortunately for Mr Heseltine, most Tories no longer
believe it prudent to elect someone who has already suffered a heart attack.
Mr Heseltine is said to have made a full recovery from the attack last
summer. But the same was said about Mr Smith after an attack in 1988.
It was not just Mr Heseltine's enemies who were signalling the end of his
ambitions. A significant number of his supporters were equally downcast.
'Regardless of Michael's fitness,' said one friend, 'I fear the party will
never elect him. John Smith's death has transformed the situation.'
Some supporters of Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, found it difficult to
conceal their relief that the chances of a leadership election had receded.
One parliamentary private secretary said: 'Labour's loss is John Major's
gain.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / Beckett praises ideal leader
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday paid tribute to John
Smith in the Commons. The following is an edited extract of her speech:
'On these benches we . . . mourn for our country's loss, but we grieve for
our own. There are few, the announcement of whose death would bring tears to
the eyes of everyone who knew them. John Smith was such a man.
He was . . . a man of formidable intellect, of the highest ethics and of
staunch integrity. Part of the conventional wisdom of British politics was
that he looked like a bank manager - something that caused him amusement and
some bank managers some resentment.
Perhaps in consequence he was often labelled as unduly sober or excessively
cautious, especially by those who judge readily and judged on the facade.
But though he certainly had a safe pair of hands, appearances were
deceptive. John was no sobersides.
He had a wicked sense of humour, often displayed . . . in this House. He
loved a good gossip and he liked nothing better than a convivial drink with
friends.
And one of his favourite sayings was that 'to succeed in politics, you have
to be prepared to take a risk'. In fact, I used to joke with him that he was
an ideal combination in a political leader - someone who looked the acme of
sober judgment, but was perfectly prepared to take a flyer when he thought
the occasion called for it.
Some months ago I saw a political profile of John that had a photograph of
him as a young boy. He had a wicked grin from ear to ear, his tie was up
round his ear, and in the text it mentioned that his shirt-tails were always
hanging out - it was a kind of a 'Just William' picture.
Those who saw John Smith every day had no difficulty in detecting that boy
in the statesman and the leader.
Not long ago, I observed to a colleague that I had never known a man like
John. He had such calm certainty, such natural strength and self-confidence
 -but while he had supreme confidence, he lacked any trace of cockiness or
of conceit . . . I have never known a man so at ease with him-self.
He adored his family, and our hearts go out to Elizabeth and to the girls.
He was at his most lovable when he was talking about his daughters.
But the love and support that John offered to and received from his family
was not only the core of his personal life - it was central to his political
life and beliefs. He wanted for others the richness he enjoyed . . . That
feeling for others, along with his hatred of injustice, were the forces that
drove him, the service to which he gave his life.
Last night he spoke at a gala dinner in London. He was in high fettle and in
high spirits. He spoke not from a text, but from notes. And when he sat down
I congratulated him, especially on his final sentence.
Spoken as it was, off the cuff and from the heart, they were almost the last
words I heard him say. He looked at the assembled gathering and he said:
'The opportunity to serve our country - that is all we ask.'
Let it stand as his epitaph.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / MPs of all sides unite in grief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons is not without its moments of drama. The disgrace, dramatic
resignation or death of a parliamentarian can bring a dignified hush to a
highly partisan chamber.
However, by common consent yesterday's mood, after the death of John Smith,
was of an altogether different intensity.
MPs with more than 20 years of service could not remember an event which had
left members on all sides of the House so despondent. Some Labour members
could hardly bring themselves to speak above a whisper; others were unable
to say anything.
Political differences were brushed aside. Instead of the usual cabals
forming along political lines, the corridors and lobbies of Westminster were
cluttered with groups of MPs of all political persuasions.
'It may sound glib or even a cliche to say this,' said one Tory backbencher,
'but I have never seen the House so united in its grief.'
Ministers who spotted their Labour shadows were quick to offer sympathy;
many Tories sought out their Labour pairs - MPs with whom they have agreed
to co-ordinate their Commons appearances for votes - to express sadness.
Although MPs on both sides were willing to talk of the implications for
respective parties, most did so by peppering their remarks with nostalgic
memories of Mr Smith.
He may have had something of a reputation for not suffering fools gladly,
but few MPs could claim to have made so many friends across the political
divide.
Every member had their own favourite story which they wanted to tell.
Mr John Evans, MP for St Helens North and a member of Labour's national
executive committee, appeared to sum up the mood of many when he said he
could think of nothing but Mr Smith. 'He recently came to St Helens to a
fundraising event and the public were literally lining up for his
autograph,' he said.
Another senior Labour MP, who served in the last Labour government, said he
had not seen such melancholy in the House since the death of Hugh Gaitskell
in 1963.
But those MPs who could remember the mood after the death of that Labour
leader said the big difference was that the whole Labour movement mourned Mr
Smith. 'Hugh was loved by the right and never forgiven by the left,' one
said. Yesterday there were plenty of leftwingers, such as Mr Dennis Skinner,
who appeared genuinely moved.

FT  13 MAY 94 / John Smith: a quiet climb to the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fundamental questions about John Smith as Labour leader will never be
answered. Would he have gone on in his quiet, patient way to become the
first Labour prime minister since 1979? Would he have launched a more
dramatic onslaught as the general election approached? And would he have won
either way?
His sudden death of a heart attack at the age of 55 yesterday immediately
revived memories of Hugh Gaitskell who died, almost as unexpectedly, in
1963.
Gaitskell, like Smith, seemed at the height of his powers. He had given the
opposition a new standing in British politics. The Conservative government
of the day was in disarray. Labour was consistently ahead in the opinion
polls: Gaitskell's own ratings as a leader far outstripped those of Harold
Macmillan, the prime minister, and it seemed only a matter of time before
Labour returned to office after 13 years of Tory rule.
The sense of shock at Smith's death is no less great than it was at the
death of Gaitskell. There is, however, a considerable difference between the
two leaders. Gaitskell tended to lead the Labour party by confrontation. He
challenged it on some of its most deeply held beliefs: for example, public
ownership and nuclear weapons. Smith rose to the top by a quieter, but no
less brave a route.
Plain John Smith was born on September 13 1938. Although his family lived on
the island of Islay off the west coast of Scotland, his mother moved to the
mainland for the birth. Two years later his father, Archibald, was made
headmaster of Ardrishaig Primary School, which meant the mainland for good.
But it was still a remote and conservative part of Scotland. The education
authority was Argyll County Council. Argyll has never had a Labour MP.
The young Smith moved on to Dunoon Grammar School and his father entered
parliament as a Labour member. Impressions of the boy do not seem to have
changed over the years. In the only biography of Smith, Playing the Long
Game, published last year, Andy McSmith wrote that he was seen as 'bookish,
but not a scholar'. The owl-like look that was to become familiar was there
from the start; occasionally the words 'slightly sanctimonious' were
attached, though in a fairly friendly fashion.
After Dunoon it was Glasgow University where Smith arrived in 1956, taking
an MA in history and an LLB in law. Here other budding politicians began to
emerge. Among his contemporaries were the Tory Teddy (now Sir Edward)
Taylor, Menzies Campbell, now the Liberal Democratic MP for Fife North East,
and, later, Donald Dewar, now shadow social security secretary.
During the Labour party splits of the late 1950s, Glasgow was a heavily
Gaitskellite place. 'If there were any Bevanites in the University Labour
Club,' Dewar recorded, 'I can't remember them.'
Smith's reputation as a public speaker began to spread and political
invitations came early. It was suggested that he stand for parliament in the
1959 general election, even before he had come of age. He stood in a
by-election in East Fife two years later. The Tories won easily, but Smith
came second, knocking the Liberals into third place. Smith tried the seat
again in 1964 and still lost.
It was by no means certain, however, that he was set on a political career.
There was also the law and the need to make money, not least to marry
Elizabeth Bennett, daughter of a Glasgow insurance manager. The couple met
at a university dance in 1961 and married in 1967. For someone interested in
politics it was unusual that he did not seek a constituency in the general
election of 1966, which Labour won easily.
Thereafter came a couple of strokes of luck. Smith was shortlisted for the
Hamilton by-election in 1967, but not chosen, and the seat went to Scottish
Nationalist Winnie Ewing. He then became friends with Peggy Herbison, the
longstanding Labour MP for North Lanarkshire who was retiring in 1970. It
was a safe seat and Smith won it. His political career never looked back.
There was one action very early on which, though it may not have seemed so
significant at the time, was to say a great deal about the future John
Smith. In 1971 he voted with prime minister Edward Heath in favour of
British membership of the European Community. True, there were other Labour
rebels, though many of them subsequently left the party. Smith said: 'It was
the biggest issue, I thought, that was likely to come up during the time I
was in parliament, and I felt strongly about it and I really had to do it.'
The commitment to Europe remained till the end.
Smith's rise through the party was steady, but not spectacular. More
attention might have been paid to it if the party had been in a better
state.
As trade secretary, he was the youngest member of the final cabinet of Mr
James (now Lord) Callaghan and thus the only member of Labour's current
frontbench team with cabinet experience. Yet such was the feeling that
Labour was on its way out that he had little opportunity to develop.
In opposition after 1979 he concentrated for several years on trade,
industry and energy, all subjects of which he had previous experience in
office. It was on the Westland affair in 1986, and the possible sale of
Austin Rover to a foreign buyer, that he really made his mark as a debater.
Being questioned by Smith in the Commons was something that even the most
senior ministers wished to avoid.
It was also probably then the idea began to emerge of Smith as a potential
leader. He became chief spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs in 1987
and at Labour party conferences would simply introduce himself as 'John
Smith, shadow chancellor'.
In the last general election he was sometimes criticised within the Labour
party for being too austere. David Hare's play The Absence of War has a
thinly veiled hint that he did not stand too closely by the party leader,
Neil Kinnock. Yet when the election was over and Labour had lost, there was
never much doubt that Smith would be the successor. He was also able to
claim that he was vindicated in saying that taxes would have to go up. On
the more socialist side he stuck strongly to his belief in the need for a
minimum wage.
To the end the adjective most commonly applied to him was 'decent', though
it was usually accompanied by 'clever'. He was also warm and convivial. The
habit of staying up late and emerging shipshape in the morning had developed
at Glasgow University. A heart attack in 1988 did not entirely calm him
down.
Yet the early, quiet Scottishness was still an essential part of him. Unlike
some other Scots MPs he was never wild. He behaved as if he came from a
classless society full of opportunities - which is what he did. He could be
very kind: he seldom made personal attacks and was the first Labour MP to
visit Norman Tebbit and his wife in hospital after the 1984 Brighton bomb.
Smith leaves his wife, Elizabeth, and three daughters.

<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday paid tribute to a 'formidable opponent' whom he
liked and respected.
The prime minister's praise came as scores of tributes to John Smith were
offered by politicians of all parties and by figures from many areas of
public life.
The Queen sent a personal message of condolence to Mr Smith's widow,
Elizabeth.
UK business figures issued tributes, recognising that Mr Smith had sought a
constructive relationship with the City and industry.
In Westminster there was widespread praise for the former Labour leader's
integrity, his strong political convictions and his keen wit. Labour MPs
expressed the certainty that, had he lived, Mr Smith would have led the
party to win the next general election.
In a crowded Commons chamber, Mr Major spoke of his 'deep shock and sadness'
at Mr Smith's death. He described him as 'one of the outstanding
parliamentarians of modern politics'.
He could 'shape and move' the Commons, and knew exactly how and when to move
from one mood to another for maximum effect.
'These are formidable skills, they are rare skills,' said Mr Major.
'And even for those against whom those skills were deployed, it is hard to
bear that we will never see or hear those skills in this House again.'
From the Labour benches, Mr Neil Kinnock, Mr Smith's predecessor as Labour
leader, said he was 'desolated' by news of his death. He said his grief was
mixed with anger: 'Anger that he has gone when his vitality and his value
were so clear, anger that he has been denied the chance to show the full
scope of his great talents in the highest office.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, also spoke of the 'injustice that
such a bright talent, so close to the point of fulfilment, has been so
cruelly lost to us all'. He added: 'We have lost today one of the foremost
parliamentary talents of our time.'
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, said Mr Smith had been an
outstanding leader of the opposition: 'His dignity, his mind, his solemnity
and his sense of humour made him ideal for the job.'
Several union leaders - with whom Mr Smith had not always enjoyed an easy
relationship - expressed deep sadness. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary
of Unison, the UK's biggest union, said: 'The Labour party and the country
have suffered a huge and devastating loss.' Mr John Monks, general secretary
of the Trades Union Congress, spoke of 'a tragic loss for the whole
country'.
Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said
the business community would be 'very sad' at the death of such a 'talented
parliamentarian with whom it has enjoyed a friendly and constructive working
relationship'.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'John
Smith was a very decent man and will be a loss to British politics.
'He recognised the key role which business had to play if his policies were
to be fulfilled.'
Mr Michel Rocard, the former French prime minister, was among European
socialist leaders who paid tribute.
'I am shocked and stunned,' he said. 'This man loved life, he was joyful. He
was a fervent European.'

FT  13 MAY 94 / Loss transforms the political landscape: The death of John
Smith will make the Labour party's character the focus of attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Suddenly nothing is clear. The tragic death of John Smith has left the
Labour party facing a choice which is critical to the outcome of the next
general election. Amid the sadness which enveloped Westminster, Mr Smith's
colleagues sensed both a risk and an opportunity.
The shock waves from Mr Smith's death were not confined to the Labour party.
His departure has transformed the political landscape.
The genuine sorrow among senior Conservatives was followed quickly by the
judgment that Mr John Major's position was much more secure.
The focus of much political attention would, during the summer at least,
switch to the battle for the Labour leadership. Labour's campaign for the
European elections would be badly damaged. Mr Michael Heseltine, the victim
last year of a heart attack, was all of a sudden a much less attractive
rival to Mr Major.
Only hours before his fatal heart attack Mr Smith had been celebrating with
his colleagues at a glittering fund-raising dinner in London. Friends said
he was in sparkling form. His party was looking forward to following a
strong performance in this month's local elections with a decisive victory
in the European poll.
Consistently 20 points ahead of a government seemingly intent on
self-destruction, Labour had begun to persuade itself that after almost 15
years in the wilderness, power was at last within its grasp.
Even those among the party's modernisers who were occasionally frustrated by
Mr Smith's careful, cautious approach to remaking policies, were impressed
by his growing appeal to the electorate. MPs on the unreconstructed left saw
him as more radical than he was perceived of in the outside world. They were
impressed by his ability to fight them without rancour.
In an opinion poll a few weeks back nearly two-thirds of those questioned
said he would make a good prime minister. A Tory cabinet minister yesterday
offered the same judgment. The minister was not just being polite about the
dead.
But Mr Smith left unfinished the task of returning the Labour party to
electability. Mr Neil Kinnock's legacy after the 1992 general election was a
party which had dumped most of the ideological baggage it had carried
through the political wilderness, but had yet to rediscover an identity.
After the 1992 general election Mr Smith pressed on with reform. Tax and
spending pledges were quietly dropped, the leadership confronted the unions
over one-member-one-vote (Omov) in the system of elections for Labour
parliamentary candidates.
Mr Smith sketched out plans for radical constitutional reform. Mr Tony Blair
has fundamentally reshaped the party's attitude to crime and punishment. Mr
Gordon Brown has begun the slow, painful task of building a credible
economic strategy.
But the process has been slowing. The disarray in the Conservative party
removed the sense of urgency. Mr Smith made the strategic decision to defer
detailed policy commitments until the second half of this parliament. His
perilously narrow victory over the unions on Omov reminded him that
factionalism had not been banished from the Labour party.
So until yesterday morning the prevailing mood in the party at Westminster
was that it was probably enough to sit tight and wait for the Tories to lose
the general election.
If that was ever a realistic prospect - and the astute on the party's front
benches at Westminster never really believed it - Mr Smith's departure has
removed it. Labour now has to make a choice. It is one between advance and
retrenchment: between continuing on the path mapped out by Mr Kinnock from
socialism to social democracy or deciding to reclaim some of the party's
radical roots.
The choice will be posed starkly in the forthcoming leadership contest. Mr
Smith's colleagues were understandably reluctant yesterday to talk openly
about the succession. The formal contest anyway will be deferred until after
the European elections next month. But no one doubted who the contenders
would be.
Mr Blair and Mr Brown represent the modernising tendency. They want to
accelerate the process of reform, to recast Labour in the mould of its
social democrat counterparts in the rest of Europe.
Mr Blair is the favourite among MPs. He is just 41, but has displayed
formidable political talents. A public school boy, he has middle-class voter
appeal in southern England. MPs on the left of the party are less
antagonistic towards him than might be expected.
Mr Blair is judged by professionals to be the politician most likely to
return the party to power. In the bars and lobbies of Westminster, parallels
are already being drawn with the death of the then Labour leader Hugh
Gaitskell in 1963. It was the young moderniser Mr Harold Wilson who won the
succession and the subsequent general election.
However, Mr Brown has worked hard to win friends in the constituencies. He
should secure the backing of the powerful Scottish contingent of Labour MPs.
He has run a strong campaign against the government's tax increases. He
wants to be prime minister.
Labour though, remains equivocal about its future. In spite of nearly 15
years out of power, many in the party cannot break with an emotional
attachment to the past. No one believes any more in wholesale public
ownership. But the virtues of the market have not permeated deep into
Labour's consciousness.
On the many committees shaping policy for the next general election, the
modernisers are frequently confounded by the proponents of a more radical
socialism.
Mr John Prescott and Mr Robin Cook represent this still powerful strand of
opinion. Both have strong followings among party activists and trade
unionists. Both have many friends on the left at Westminster. Either could
win.
But for now the intricacies of the electoral system and the labyrinthine
nature of Labour politics make for far more 'ifs' and 'buts' than for
certainties.
Labour is still an unpredictable party. It will be days if not weeks before
the shape of the leadership contest emerges. But the choice will not go
away. The party must decide if it wants to govern.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: European crackdown on computer software
theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local police have raided companies and markets in Spain, Portugal, Italy and
Poland as part of a Europe-wide crackdown on illegally copied computer
software.
The raids, in the past month, were ordered by the local courts after
representations by the Business Software Alliance, an organisation of
principally US-based computer companies dedicated to eliminating software
theft.
The companies investigated included the Spanish airports authority, AENA,
and the Portuguese financial services company Uniao de Bancos Portugueses.
Special software was used to test software on personal computers at AENA
which led, the BSA says, to 'a strong suspicion of the unauthorised copying
of a wide variety of software'.
The software companies involved included, among others Aldus, Autodesk,
Computer Associates and Microsoft. AENA was investigated after an anonymous
telephone tip-off.
Mr Javier Ribas, a BSA counsel, said rates of software piracy in Spain were
among the highest in Europe. 'The software industry in Spain lost more than
Pounds 330m in 1993 as a result of piracy,' he said.
The search team sent in to Uniao de Bancos Portugueses found about 300
suspected illegal copies of computer programs published by Lotus Development
and Microsoft. Many of the disks carried identical serial numbers, a common
indication of illegality.
In Italy some 10,000 illegal floppy disks were seized in an operation which
resulted in complaints being filed against eight owners of shops and
companies in the Milan area. Software experts estimate illegal copying is
costing software houses some L400bn (Pounds 166.5m) a year in Italy.
The operation in Poland centred on a computer software exchange and market
in Warsaw. Diskettes were seized, some of them containing illegally copied
programs.
Mr Evan Cox, the BSA's European counsel, said that since the passage in 1992
of an EU software directive designed to outlaw software piracy, European
countries had been amending their copyright laws to comply with the
directive.
In Italy, for example, which used to one of Europe's black spots, the rate
of software piracy dropped to 50 per cent in 1993 from 86 per cent in 1992
after legislation was passed.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: NEC and Bull discuss link

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics company, and Bull of France, are discussing
sharing the burden of developing a range of computers, the Japanese company
said.
The two companies are negotiating details of a deal through which they would
share the development of next generation computers, including mainframes and
middle-range machines, NEC said. Personal computers were not, however,
included among seven areas of co-operation that were under discussion, the
company noted.
The agreement, if finalised, would considerably reduce the burden of
development for both NEC and Bull, in which the Japanese company has a 4.43
per cent equity stake.
NEC has been supplying Bull with mainframes which the French company has
been marketing in Japan on an original equipment manufacturing basis, under
its own brand name.
If the latest talks bear fruit, NEC might draw on Bull's strengths in
manufacturing of computer boards and the central processing unit in making
next generation models, NEC said.
Such a step would help Bull to reduce the cost of buying mainframes from
NEC, while at the same time enable the company to utilise its resources more
effectively. It would also help NEC by reducing its development costs.
NEC and Bull are also in negotiation for Bull to sell NEC supercomputers in
Europe.

<TEXT>
The rise in the value of the yen is causing problems for Malaysia's second
national car project, due to start operations later this year.
Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua (Perodua), a consortium of Malaysian companies, is
due to begin manufacturing the Kancil, or Mouse Deer, 660cc car in
September. Daihatsu of Japan is partnering Perodua in the project.
The Kancil had been aimed at the lower end of the market with a cost of
about MDollars 24,000 (Pounds 5,900). However, rising import costs from
Japan could push up the price.
Since the Kancil project was announced two years ago the yen has appreciated
by more than 30 per cent against the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar. Mr Ho
Tet Kheong, Perodua's chief executive, said that up to 50 per cent of the
content of the Kancil will be sourced from Japan in the initial stages of
production.
'We are looking at ways of absorbing the cost but prices could rise,' said
Mr Ho. 'We are also seeking the government's assistance.'
Perodua plans to produce an initial 25,000 cars a year at its plant outside
Kuala Lumpur.
Malaysia already produces the Proton car in partnership with Mitsubishi.
Proton now has more than 70 per cent of the local market.
More than 17,000 Protons were exported last year, mostly to Britain.

Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia have concluded negotiations on a free trade
accord and agreed it should come into effect at the start of next year.
Mexico's trade ministry said the three countries reached agreement yesterday
after resolving differences over a legal revision of the original text.
Presidents of the three countries will sign the treaty next month at the
Ibero-American summit, and the accord will come into effect on January 1
next year.
The treaty between the so-called Group of Three follows last month's free
trade accord between Mexico and Costa Rica, and recent ones between Mexico,
the US and Canada, and Mexico and Chile. The G3 bloc will bring together
economies with a combined population of about 150m, and a gross domestic
product near Dollars 400bn.
The agreement will gradually eliminate tariff and most non-tariff barriers
and establish dispute mechanism panels to resolve differences arising from
the treaty's implementation. On January 1 about 40 per cent of Mexican
exports will enter Colombia free of duty, while Venezuela will dismantle
tariffs over ten years.

The Russian government has agreed to buy some 500 railway carriages worth
DM500m (Pounds 200m) from Deutsche Waggonbau, east Germany's leading railway
equipment manufacturer, in a deal which should save some 2,000 jobs.
Agreement to go ahead with the contract, in spite of the severe shortage of
hard currency in Russia, was reached by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German
economics minister, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, his Russian counterpart, in
the wings of President Boris Yeltsin's current official visit to Germany.
The deal is still for rather less than the DM910m outstanding from an
original Russian order, placed in 1991, but suspended because of the
payments problems.
The new order will have full cover from Germany's Hermes export credit

can finally breathe easily,' Mr Rexrodt said in Bonn.
He said the Russians were also considering taking a shareholding in the east
German enterprise, one of those which has yet to be successfully sold by the
Treuhand privatisation agency.
The future of Deutsche Waggonbau is particularly sensitive for the German
government, because of state elections to be held next month in
Saxony-Anhalt, where the Ammendorf plant is situated.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Fear of China cap on power profits -
Rumours of investment return limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign companies and investors with an interest in China's capital-hungry
power industry have been thrown by reports Beijing is planning an
unacceptable limit to the profits they can earn from electric power.
China will spend more than Dollars 120bn over the next decade if it is to
realise its planned power expansion. Foreign companies and large investors
are lining up.
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish power engineering group, plans to
invest Dollars 500m over the next four years. Mr George Soros, the US
investor and speculator, has set up funds totalling Dollars 3.5bn with both
GE Capital and Peregrine Capital, the Hong Kong based brokerage and
corporate financier, to tap such opportunities in Asia, especially China.
ABB has built four power stations in China and operates there through 11
joint ventures. But earlier this week Mr Percy Barnevik, its chairman, said
attempts to limit returns to foreigners would deter investment.
For the past few weeks rumours have been circulating among project
financiers that Beijing will limit to 12 per cent the return investors can
earn on power projects on the mainland. It is not clear whether the rate of
return referred to is on equity or capital employed.
Mr Nick Hann, manager with Wardley Capital, says: 'If the project internal
rate of return is 12 per cent (assuming it is funded with 100 per cent
equity), then you have an option to increase your return to shareholders by
gearing the project up. Our understanding is that the 12 per cent return is
on the whole project, which gives the possibility of getting up to around a
16 per cent internal rate of return to the shareholder.'
Some investors, however, see the rumoured change as no more than part of a
rational redesign of the electric power industry.
Executives at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, say there may have
been a misunderstanding and investors and their advisers have got the wrong
end of the stick. This week Salomon Brothers is taking representatives of 40
of America's biggest fixed-income investors on an Asian tour, including
China and its power industry.
Mr Lindley G. DeGarmo, head of Salomon's global independent power group,
says he has been told by Chinese officials that the 12 per cent figure
refers to the return on assets which is deemed appropriate for already
established power generation facilities in China.
Earning a positive investment return is part of the government's attempt to
reduce subsidies to industry which come from the under-pricing of
electricity to consumers. To achieve this the authorities want to push ahead
with tariff increases so that within three to four years these purely
state-owned power plants will earn 12 per cent on assets employed.
Mr DeGarmo says that for foreign joint venture power plants the Chinese
government appears prepared to allow returns of 15 to 20 per cent on capital
employed. Allowing for a large slice of debt financing this would push up
the returns available to equity investors. He believes foreign-funded
ventures will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
Other advisers report a variety of financing methods which various regional
governments and agencies have suggested to would-be investors to control
profits. One example is offering guaranteed rates of return on foreign
investment by indexing the price paid for the electricity. Alternatively,
Chinese authorities can set an electricity price which will in effect cap
the return at desired levels.
At present there are just two examples of limited recourse to power project
financing in China, both installed by Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell Holdings and
now operated by its spin-off, Consolidated Electric Power Asia. For the
rest, foreign interests have generally played a minority role and the
lending has been fully guaranteed, normally by Beijing.
Mr Wu secured a two-pronged financing package for Shajiao C, located in
Guangdong's Pearl River delta, in December 1992 which provided for an early
completion bonus, and thereafter a standard operating rate, where any
increase in the cost of raw materials, such as fuel, will be countered by a
rise in the cost of electricity.
For investors, says Mr Hann, the risks of projects such as these are largely
to do with construction and, to a limited extent, the level of output.
'We have been approached on at least 60 large-scale power projects, all with
substantial companies interested in them,' he says. 'Unfortunately, only a
fraction of these will get foreign financing: there is a great deal of
difficulty in putting in place a structure that is sufficiently robust to
achieve foreign project financing, and that difficulty has been compounded
by the foreign exchange changes introduced earlier this year.'
On January 1, Beijing abolished the official exchange rate and announced
plans to do away with the swap centres around the country and replace them
with a centralised electronic network.
For lenders looking for reliable revenues in foreign exchange, this switch
changed the game in three significant ways:
It prevents electricity prices being denominated in foreign exchange.
Guarantees can only be provided in yuan, which makes them worth less than
hard currency guarantees.
People no longer have easy access to the swap markets to convert money
following the restructuring of the foreign exchange markets.
In the absence of a government or joint venture partner guarantee, investors
must ensure firm off-take obligations by a creditworthy company and a firm
fuel supply if they are to sleep easily at nights. But China is not yet a
country where such obligations are easily won.
Mr Hann believes the obstacles which have been put in the way of foreign
investors this year will push projects into the hands of the sovereign
backed credit agencies, which are less concerned about the convertibility
risks of the yuan, such as the US Eximbank.
In the meantime investors may look elsewhere. As Mr Wu points out, there is
no shortage of opportunities for investors interested in power projects in
the rest of Asia and Beijing officials may come round to the realisation
that it is better to have the lights on, even if it means foreigners earning
higher profits than officials would like.

Electricidade de Portugal, the state-owned power producer and distributor,
has awarded a Es15.7bn (Pounds 61.28m) contract to build the country's
biggest hydro-electric dam to a consortium of French, Spanish and Portuguese
companies.
The 136m-high dam at Vila Nova de Foz Coa in north-eastern Portugal is to
form part of an Es52bn (Pounds 201m) hydro-electric power plant comprising
two 72 MW reversible turbine units. They are due to begin production of 330
GWh a year in 1999.
The winning consortium comprises Dumez of France, Agroman of Spain and the
Portuguese companies Somague and Moniz da Maia Serra e Fortunato. A total of
16 Portuguese and 13 companies competed for the contract.
The dam will form an 18 sq km artificial lake of 700m cubic metres. The
plant will provide a strategic reserve in case of breakdown or low capacity
of EDP's other hydro-electric plants on the Douro river, which flows into
northern Portugal from Spain.
Installing reversible turbine units will enable EDP to transfer waters from
the Douro to the Foz Coa lake for subsequent use by power plants along the
river.

FT  13 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US-Japan business chiefs in trade talks -
Private group seeks to break impasse

<TEXT>
US and Japanese business leaders, frustrated by the lack of progress in the
two countries' trade talks, are taking it upon themselves to try to break
the impasse.
The Japan-US Business Council, a private sector group representing leading
businesses in the two countries, is planning to put together its own
proposals on how access to Japan's market can be measured and increased.
They will also consider how the country's perenially high trade surplus can
be reduced to more internationally acceptable levels.
Mr Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan-US Business Council and chairman
of Fuji Xerox, the office equipment maker, said yesterday he expected that
the compilation of a list of ways to measure market access would be a prime
candidate for a special task force expected to be set up by the council in
July.
Mr Kobayashi, who was highly critical of the Japanese government's
resistance to US proposals on measuring market access, said foreign access
to Japanese markets should be evaluated by 'objective criteria' which would
not need to be a specific number of sales or market share figures.
'If the private sector can really use this process to monitor what is
happening we can really do much better than the governments,' Mr Kobayashi
said. Deregulation was 50 per cent a private sector issue.
'During the past few months (the private sector has) managed to discuss very
delicate issues such as insurance and auto parts,' he said. Business people
have also started to express more loudly their own views and 'of the need to
change gear in order to be more productive.'
The precarious state of the Japanese government also calls for the private
sector to step in, Mr Kobayashi indicated.
The government is aware of the short time left before the Naples G7 summit
at which the two sides were supposed to reach some agreement on the stalled
framework trade talks and has begun its own lobbying to resume negotiations
with the US.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Budget goes through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Clinton administration's Dollars 1,500bn (Pounds 1,027bn) budget for the
fiscal year starting in October emerged virtually unscathed from its first
run through Congress when the Senate approved it by a 53-46 vote, Jurek
Martin writes.
Early passage by both houses stands in sharp contrast to last summer's
dramas, when it squeaked through by one vote in each chamber. Senator Jim
Sasser, budget committee chairman, attributed this to the public perception
that real economic progress was being achieved.
The budget, with a projected deficit of Dollars 175bn, sets broad spending
limits but leaves Congress free to change the mix.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Senate acts over abortion blockades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Senate yesterday followed the House of Representatives in passing, by
69 votes to 30, a bill making it a federal crime to conduct violent or
intimidatory blockades against clinics performing abortions.
The legislation, which President Bill Clinton strongly supports and will
sign, was prompted by actions taken against abortion clinics in recent
years, including cases of arson, bombing and, last year, the murder of a
doctor in Florida and the shooting of another in Kansas.
The bill, laying out penalties for offenders, was vigorously opposed by the
right-to-life movement on the grounds that it infringed lawful civil
disobedience. But the only concession was to grant similar protection to
houses of worship.
Opponents of abortion suffered a second, if less decisive, defeat yesterday
when a House subcommittee voted against excluding abortion coverage from the
healthcare bill.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Mexico invites UN to observe elections
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government has formally invited the United Nations to
participate in the observation of presidential and congressional elections
in August, in a move designed to convince international and domestic opinion
that the voting process will be fair.
Mr Jorge Carpizo, the interior minister, asked the UN to issue a technical
report on the electoral system, and to offer assistance to the network of
Mexican electoral observers, and help ensure their 'professionalism,
independence and impartiality'.
The UN role will be more limited than many had hoped, as the organisation
will not directly observe the electoral process, nor assess the legitimacy
of the electoral result. Mr Carpizo said that the country's constitution and
laws gave such authority exclusively to Mexicans.
The decision to invite the UN came after internal debate in the Mexican
government, with some nationalist ministers unhappy about allowing an
international organisation a role in the observation of the elections. The
compromise worked out has allayed fears of those who opposed UN presence,
according to one official.
President Carlos Salinas and other ministers believe the presence of the UN
will help assure a credible electoral outcome. The belief is that as long as
the election is fair, the creation of an impartial group of Mexican
observers backed by the UN will make it more difficult for the opposition to
discredit the vote by claiming fraud.
The US has also put increasing pressure on the Mexican government to take
steps to assure a legitimate election, and strongly supported the presence
of foreign observers.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Argentine economy shows 6% growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's economy expanded by 6 per cent in 1993, its third consecutive
year of strong growth since Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, made
the peso convertible and began his market-oriented reforms in early 1991.
Gross domestic product expanded to Dollars 255.33bn, making Argentina the
region's wealthiest country, with income per head of Dollars 7,800 (Pounds
5,340), according to figures this week.
However, private economists expect growth to decelerate to about 3.5-4 per
cent this year, thanks mainly to a reduction in the foreign capital inflows
that have driven the economy ahead since 1991. Capital inflows are expected
to fall to Dollars 10bn from Dollars 17.61bn last year.
Argentina's low investment rate is alarming private economists. Although
investment rose by one-eighth over the previous year, at 18.4 per cent of
GDP it is still low by international standards. Investment at the height of
Argentina's hyperinflation crisis in 1989-90 averaged 15 per cent of GDP.
A European banker commented: 'Investors and businessmen have been burnt so
often in the past that they are unwilling to take risks now.'
Growth came mainly from privatised utilities, the construction industry and
the financial sector. Manufacturing industry rose 4.5 per cent, while
agriculture - which produces two-thirds of Argentina's exports - fell 1 per
cent.
Concern continues to grow over Argentina's poor savings rate and its heavy
reliance on foreign capital. Last year's savings rate edged up to 16 per
cent of GDP; consumption rose by one-fifth, to 83.5 per cent.
Argentina's trade deficit is also deteriorating rapidly. The 1993 deficit of
Dollars 3.7bn is expected to rise by one-third this year to Dollars 5bn.

FT  13 MAY 94 / No such thing as free lunch for senators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The spectre of Mr Ross Perot strode through the halls of Congress this week
as the Senate, in a mood of uncomfortable self-flagellation, voted 95-4 to
ban its members from accepting presents, meals, free travel and sports and
arts tickets from anybody who might remotely resemble a lobbyist.
The Senate bill now must be reconciled with one already passed by the House.
Congressmen, on average much less wealthy than senators, were also less
firmly into self-denial, banning most meals and gifts but permitting
paid-for travel and other freebies.
Sponsors of the Senate bill, sounding just like the populist billionaire
from Texas and 1992 independent presidential candidate, said action was
necessary to dispel the popular image of a Congress stuffed with freeloading
junketeers and deeply in hock to 'Gucci gulch' lobbyists, including, most
darkly, those representing foreign interests.
The bill permits gifts only from family members, unquestioned close friends
and home state interests, with any present worth more than Dollars 250
(Pounds 170) subject to approval by the ethics committee.
In debate last week several senators said the bill was unnecessary and would
harm the Washington restaurant trade and charities willing to pay the
expenses of politicians involved in fundraising events, such as galas and
golf tournaments.
But the final vote showed how few senators were willing to go on record as
opposing a populist demand.
A similar nervousness was shown last month when the Senate only narrowly
defeated a bill that would have taken away free parking places at
Washington's airports. Almost every senator up for re-election this year
voted to remove this 'perk'.
Cynics also believe that by focusing on freebies Congress is creating cover
for ducking action on campaign finance reform, reasonably seen as the root
problem of the relationship between elected representatives and special
interests.
It emerged this week, for example, that the medical and insurance industries
had contributed, perfectly legally, no less than Dollars 600,000 this year
to the campaign coffers of the 11 congressmen sitting on the House ways and
means subcommittee with jurisdiction over healthcare reform.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Klimt brings top price at auction: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sotheby's sale of top quality Impressionist and modern art in New York on
Wednesday evening was a success, in sharp contrast to Christie's
disappointing auction on Tuesday. Some 69 paintings and sculptures were
offered and 50 of them sold, for a total of Dollars 51.5m (Pounds 35.2m).
The highlight was the Dollars 11.6m paid for an exceedingly decorative
painting by Gustav Klimt, 'Lady with a fan'. The price was a record for the
Austrian artist and way ahead of estimate. It was sold by the estate of the
late Mr Wendell Cherry, founder of Humana, the healthcare company.
'Composition No 8' by Mondrian also did well, making Dollars 5.6m. The
artist took this strictly linear work to New York when escaping from the
London Blitz in 1942 and it was acquired by the late Mr Gates Lloyd, the
Philadelphia banker who later became deputy head of the Central Intelligence
Agency. His estate sold it yesterday for comfortably more than its Dollars
3m estimate.
Another good price was the Dollars 2,092,500 paid for 'Peniche sur la Seine'
by the Fauve artist Maurice de Vlaminck, and the same sum acquired a pastel
by Degas 'La toilette', one of his many compositions of women bathing.
Another work from the Gates Lloyd collection, Henry Moore's bronze,
'Festival reclining figure', one of five created for the Festival of Britain
in 1951, sold at its high estimate, Dollars 2m.
There was even keen bidding for some of the unsold lots. 'Bird', a marble
sculpture by Brancusi, was bought in at Dollars 6m, and bids for a Monet
view of Venice went as high as Dollars 5.7m, which must be close to the
reserves fixed by the vendors.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Chrysler protests over electric cars: Detroit says battery
technology can not yet meet Californian requirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, North America's third largest car maker, yesterday called on
California to drop legislation requiring minimum numbers of electric cars to
be sold in the state from 1998, claiming that battery technology is
insufficiently advanced for such cars to be viable.
In doing so, it has formed a united front with General Motors and Ford,
which have become increasingly hostile to the legislation as hopes of a
battery technology breakthrough in time for the legislation to be met have
faded.
During testimony to the Californian Air Resources Board, which is
responsible for setting air quality standards in the state, Chrysler asked
for consultants to be brought in to undertake an independent review of
battery technology and consider whether the Californian legislation could be
complied with.
Under the current legislative programme, from 1998 onwards 'zero emission
vehicles' must make up a minimum of 2 per cent of total sales of each
manufacturer selling its vehicles in California, rising to 10 per cent by
the year 2007.
While other technologies, such as hydrogen fuels, are also being
investigated, battery-powered cars currently are seen as the only means of
complying with the legislation. However, all 'big three' car makers have
encountered serious difficulties in building cars with the 100 miles-plus
range regarded as the minimum viable for sprawling Los Angeles - and at a
cost even remotely competitive with conventional vehicles.
'We believe California cannot achieve its clean air goals in a
cost-effective manner by mandating any technology,' Chrysler's manager of
environmental regulatory planning, Mr Gordon Allardyce, said yesterday in a
statement.
While stressing that Chrysler - like GM and Ford - is not opposed in
principle to producing battery-powered cars, the company said in its
testimony that the price and range limitations involved meant that it
seriously questioned its ability to meet the sales obligations.
Despite the increasingly strident lobbying campaign from Detroit, the air
resources board has so far shown no real willingness either to ease or
postpone the legislation, given the severe air quality problems facing the
Los Angeles basin in particular.
The issue is of great importance to the vehicle industry. This is not only
because non-compliance by any manufacturer could theoretically lead to its
exclusion from the Californian market, amounting to 1m-plus units a year,
but because other states are seeking to enact similar legislation.

The African Development Bank sank further into chaos and political intrigue
yesterday as the bank's African and First World owners failed to agree on an

Donor countries are threatening to hold back the replenishment of the AfDB's

countries, who own two-thirds of the bank, clear arrears totalling Dollars
700m and agree to tighter lending policies.
Donors also want to place limits on the terms of the president and executive
directors to avoid the personality clashes which have paralysed
decision-making at the bank.
Mr Babacar Ndiaye, the bank's Senegalese President, is serving the final
year of his second five-year term, while the longest serving member of the
executive board, Mr Pierre Moussa of Chad, has been there for 19 years.
But a week of negotiations has been unable to produce even a common agenda
for discussion at the AfDB's annual general meeting in Nairobi. As a result,
bank governors, finance ministers and aid officials from more than 70
countries will be leaving the Kenyan capital today without having discussed
matters which impinge on the very survival of the bank.
'The problem of mounting arrears has grown to such proportions that it is
now threatening the financial viability of the institution as a whole,' Mr
Ruud Treffers, the Dutch co-ordinator for the ADF replenishment
negotiations, wrote to the board of governors.
'Some borrowing countries feel that because it is their regional bank, they
can afford to fall back on payments. This cannot be allowed to continue,' Mr
Ismail Mohammed, Egypt's central bank governor, said yesterday.
However, most African governors oppose a resolution presented by
industrialised countries, which own one-third of the AfDB, that would
restrict the bank's lending to Africa's wealthiest governments. A
concessionary window would be made available to the continent's growing list
of impoverished nations.
Mr J Mtonga, Zambia's representative, is against a proposal tabled by
industrialised countries that would rank borrowers by their per capita
incomes and limit access to AfDB loans to the wealthiest countries which
could afford to repay the bank's commerc-ial lending rates. 'I do not want
to see the Balkanisation of Africa,' Mr Mtonga explains.
Perhaps the stricter credit ratings would be more palatable to African
governors if donor countries were prepared to beef up the soft loan fund.
But all indications are that the funds available will be substantially lower
than the Dollars 3.4bn pledged three years ago.
'Donor countries are imposing more conditions for less money. Frankly, we
find this offensive,' said a senior AfDB official, reflecting the African
hurt.
Intimately linked to the problem of arrears, are the poor management and
politically determined lending policies that have damaged the bank's
portfolio. A report conducted by external consultants, chaired by Mr David
Knox, a former vice-president of the World Bank, said staff had been unable
to keep up with the pace of growth in project lending.
Little attention was paid to the quality of loans as opposed to quantity.
Nobody assumed responsibility for overall project management. The
consultants were unable to find a central file on a single project, and the
proliferation of bureaucratic divisions in the bank was 'fertile ground for
buck passing by bank staff,' when problems arose.
The report noted the unequal distribution of credit among Africa's 51
borrowing members. Almost half of the loans, it said, had been awarded to
seven members: Nigeria, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Ivory Coast and
Zaire.
Zaire has defaulted on its AfDB debts. It owes Dollars 250m to the bank. The
Ivory Coast is Dollars 42m in arrears. Nigeria also owes Dollars 35m.
Industrial countries want to see a 'time-bound and monitorable' action plan
to improve the lending policies of the bank and other recommendations
contained in the Knox report.
The most intangible problem to be tackled is the question of governance.
Mr Ndiaye is on the warpath with certain north African members of the
executive board, accusing them of interfering with the day-to-day management
of the bank.
Mr Moussa alleges that Mr Ndiaye is an emotional man who takes any criticism
over the running of the bank as a personal insult.
The six non-African executive directors are, for the moment, backing Mr
Ndiaye, hoping he will clear up the administrative mess at the bank before
he completes his second five-year term in 1995.
There will be few supporters, however, for his re-election.

<TEXT>
Human Rights Watch, the Washington-based organisation, has written a strong
letter of condemnation to Mr Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president,
following the death during police detention of a 32-year-old lawyer, Mr
Adbel Harith Madani, who was a member of the Egyptian Organisation of Human
Rights (EOHR).
The US organisation called on Mr Mubarak to take 'immediate action to
discover the circumstances and reasons for Mr Madani's death' and prosecute
those responsible.
Mr Hassan al-Alfie, Egypt's interior minister, said Mr Madani 'died of an
attack of asthma' and it had 'nothing to do with torture'.
The Egyptian bar association has accused the police of killing Mr Madani,
saying police subjected him to electric shocks and whipping and set fire to
his body. The EOHR said Mr Madani was arrested on April 26 and held
incommunicado. They say his family was later informed on May 6 of his death,
and that his body had been prepared for burial three days before they were
told.
Mr Madani was apparently detained for his contacts with Islamic militants,
some of whom he had defended in court. Thousands of fellow lawyers met at
the bar association's offices earlier this week to protest at his death.
In its letter, Human Rights Watch says government denials of the use of
torture 'ring increasingly hollow' in the face of 'the accumulated weight of
evidence, including scores of forensic medical reports prepared by
government-employed physicians who have examined torture victims'.
The EOHR says it believes 16 people have died from torture in Egyptian
prisons since the start of 1993. It claims that up to 14,000 people at any
time are in detention for alleged contact with or membership of militant
groups and that torture of such detainees is 'methodical'.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Rao tries to build bridge to Washington: But India and US
still find it hard to make progress on links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's prime minister PV Narasima Rao is due to start a six-day visit to
the US tomorrow which will include a meeting with President Bill Clinton and
an address to a joint session of Congress.
Both countries want to improve relations, blighted for decades by the Cold
War, but are still finding it difficult to make progress despite growing
economic ties.
It is a measure of the political distance between Delhi and Washington that
this is the first trip to the US by an Indian prime minister since Rajiv
Gandhi went in 1987.
The last US president to visit India was Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. The
collapse of the Soviet Union, once India's greatest ally, has forced Delhi
into a radical reassessment of its place in the world.
So has the decline of socialism, which has led India to abandon economic
autarky and open its economy to global trade and investment. India in the
1990s wants good relations with the west, especially the US, as never
before. The US is India's biggest export market and largest source of
foreign investment, accounting for 42 per cent of the 1993 inflow of Dollars
2.4bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
But Indians do not embrace the US with open arms. Uncle Sam is still
regularly burnt in effigy by protesters ranging from farmers to Hindu
nationalists. Many Indians suspect the US means to get the better of India,
whether in business or politics.
Indians are particularly concerned about Washington's relations with their
sworn enemy Pakistan. They argue the US is biased towards Islamabad and
against Delhi, citing the military aid given to Pakistan throughout the
1980s and, in the past year, Washington's controversial plan to deliver F-16
jets to Islamabad in return for a pledge from Pakistan to cap its nuclear
weapons programme.
There is also a widely-held belief that perhaps the US does not treat India
seriously enough. A 5,000-year-old history, leadership in the anti-colonial
struggle and primacy among developing countries has convinced many Indians
they deserve more attention in the US than they receive.
Some Indians find it hard to accept that a country accounting for less than
2 per cent of world trade may not merit much international attention in the
hard-nosed 1990s.
President Clinton has inadvertently rubbed salt into this wound by failing
to appoint an ambassador to Delhi in his 16 months in office. His first
nominee, former Congressman Stephen Solarz, failed to pass the confirmation
tests; his second, Mr Frank Wisner, a career diplomat, was nominated only
yesterday.
The snub was compounded by a gaffe earlier this year when Ms Robin Raphel,
an under-secretary of state, commented about the troubled north Indian
region of Kashmir in a way suggesting to many Indians she was questioning
India's territorial integrity. She later visited Delhi to clear up the
'misunderstanding'.
In the past month, nuclear non-proliferation has replaced Kashmir at the top
of the agenda. As well as pressing Pakistan, Washington is asking India to
cap its nuclear programme. US officials have revived proposals for a
regional non-proliferation conference.
But India does not see non-proliferation as a regional issue; if talks are
to be held, they must at least include China if not all nuclear countries,
including the US, it says.
Mr Rao's trip to Washington will not resolve differences over
non-proliferation or other controversial issues. But Indian and American
officials hope it will contribute to better ties by focusing on areas where
there are fewer arguments such as the need for more bilateral trade and
investment.
Mr Rao is being accompanied by Mr Manmohan Singh, the reform-minded finance
minister, and a business delegation. Among the Americans they will meet will
be many of Indian origin. As one of the businessmen going on the trip says:
'It's not as if we have nothing in common with the US. We even have
thousands of people who belong to both countries. But when we talk politics
we stupidly ignore these things.'

<TEXT>
Hundreds of foreign nationals awaiting immediate evacuation from Yemen
gathered at Sanaa airport yesterday as fears grew that the civil war would
soon engulf the entire country.
Many Yemenis were fleeing the capital, loading up their possessions and
heading for the comparative safety of the countryside. Northern leaders
broadcast assurances that they had no intention of bombing the south.
Military observers in Sanaa said yesterday that advances towards Aden from
the north and east had been repelled by southern forces, but they could give
no precise details of troop locations or of any further military movements.
British, Chinese, French, Indian, Syrian and US citizens were among those
flocking to Sanaa airport, while other groups were reported to be travelling
by road to the Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Mocha for evacuation by sea.
British embassy officials, who are co-ordinating flights for their citizens,
expected nearly 160 people of various nationalities to board two RAF
Hercules. Earlier plans to send evacuees to Djibouti had to be cancelled
because of growing congestion there, the officials said.
Many shops in Sanaa were closed and queues of up to 200 vehicles waited at
filling stations for the increasingly scarce supplies of petrol. Yemenis
normally use some 65,000 barrels a day, mostly produced at the refinery in
Aden.
Fears among the northern population rose sharply following the explosion on
Wednesday of a Scud missile launched by southern forces east of Sanaa. Some
23 people have been reported killed in the blast and many others injured.
The target of the attack was apparently a nearby palace belonging to the
northern leader, Gen Ali Abdullah Saleh.
Officials in Sanaa claim that the south has now launched some 20 Scuds
against targets in the north. Meeting defence officials, President Saleh
accused his southern rivals of targeting civilians and vowed retaliation. He
repeated his earlier calls for the southern leader, Mr Ali Salem al-Biedh,
to surrender, saying that Mr al-Biedh and other southern leaders would
receive fair trials.

<TEXT>
China yesterday denounced Vietnam's contract with US oil company Mobil as a
violation of Beijing's sovereignty in the South China Sea, but has pledged
to settle all disputes peacefully, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The foreign ministry reiterated Beijing's claim to the entire area around
the Spratly Islands, including an area where Mobil has said it would press
on with offshore oil exploration work.
'China possesses irrevocable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and the
adjacent waters,' Mr Wu Jianmin said, using China's name for the disputed
group.
He said the Blue Dragon plot where Mobil wants to explore comes into the
area of China's control in the waters 'adjacent' to the Spratlys. Vietnam
says the plot is part of its continental shelf.
The offshore row heated up last month when Crestone Energy of Denver said it
had begun seismic surveys in an area immediately east of the Blue Dragon
field. Beijing awarded the contract to Crestone in 1992.

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank plans greater emphasis on environmental projects and
education and less on infrastructure, in its lending to China, its largest
borrower, Mr Ernest Stern, managing director, said in Beijing yesterday.
The bank would seek to encourage increased private involvement in power
generation and other infrastructure projects. Mr Stern told an international
business seminar. This would involve more co-financing arrangements.
'Private involvement in infrastructure can bring additional benefits that go
beyond finance, including management expertise and new technology. In the
globalised economy, those benefits are of increasing importance.'
About 40 per cent of the World Bank's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 7.6bn) lending
programme in China has been earmarked for infrastructure. Lending to China
is now running at about Dollars 3bn annually.
Mr Stern said the bank's first big co-financing operation in China for a
large power project in Jiangsu province, west of Shanghai, could serve as a
model for other such ventures.
The Bank provided a Dollars 350m loan and guarantees for a Dollars 120m
syndicated loan facility denominated in eurodollars and yen.
But he warned that much greater attention to the costs of environmental
degradation was required not only in China but throughout East Asia.
'Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in East Asia are three times those
of Latin America,' he said. 'China alone accounts for almost half of total
carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries.'
Air pollution in some Chinese cities was 'chronically bad', less than a
third of wastewater was subject to treatment, and an estimated 7m hectares
of farmland had been degraded by excessive use of pesticides and
fertilisers, he noted.
World Bank concern about the impact of China's rapid economic growth on the
environment was reflected in the fact that environmental operations were the
fastest-growing element of the bank's lending programme.
Recent loans included Dollars 150m to improve Shanghai's environment and
water supply, and Dollars 250m to support pollution control and waste
management in Jiangsu Province.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Test of independence for Bank of Italy: Will the bank or
government prevail in choosing a new director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the second time in a year the Bank of Italy has to appoint a new member
to its four-man governing directorate.
The departure of Mr Lamberto Dini to the treasury ministry yesterday opens
up a delicate contest for his replacement as the director general, the
bank's number two job.
At issue is whether his replacement will be sought from inside the Bank of
Italy or whether the new Berlusconi government will seek to impose an
outsider.
The latter solution would tend to undermine the Bank's hard won independent
status, no matter the quality of the person chosen. An outsider would also
risk having differences of view with Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor.
Mr Fazio himself was chosen a year ago over Mr Dini to replace Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, who had agreed to become prime minister. This then required
appointment of a new director, the choice falling on the chief banking
supervisor, Mr Vincenzo Desario.
Any appointment has to be decided by the bank's 16-strong governing council,
presided over by the governor, and then ratified in agreement with the
treasury, the prime minister and the president of the republic. This complex
mechanism allows a considerable variety of views and political pressures to
enter into the choice, although the governor should have a major role.
Within the bank, the post by tradition of seniority should go to Mr Tommaso
Padoa Schioppa, a brilliant and eclectic economist strongly wedded to the
idea of European monetary union. He was also seen at one stage as Mr
Ciampi's natural heir.
But those close to the new Berlusconi government have let it be known that
his nomination would not be to their liking.
The populist Northern League would also like to use the occasion of Mr
Dini's departure to introduce a fixed term of office for the governor.
Of the outsiders, the name most heavily canvassed is Mr Rainer Masera, who
formerly worked in the bank and is currently chief executive of IMI, the
finance institution. Another name suggested is that of Mr Mario Draghi, the
director general of the treasury; but Mr Dini is expected to want to keep
him at the treasury to help with privatisation and debt management.
The bank would prefer that the decision be taken without haste and not
before the end of the month when Mr Fazio presents the governor's annual
economic statement, the Bank of Italy's keynote assessment of the state of
the economy and the task in the year ahead for the government. Milan
magistrates yesterday filed papers requesting the passport be withdrawn from
Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist prime minister, who faces a string of
charges of alleged corruption.
Mr Craxi has been living outside Italy for more than a month.
When the new parliament was sworn in two weeks ago, all members of the
outgoing parliament automatically lost their immunity. At least 16 members
of the last parliament have had their passports withdrawn.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Greek socialists in new privatisation U-turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's socialist government, which has already abruptly reversed its stand
against privatisation by announcing the partial flotation of OTE, the state
telecoms company, now plans to re-appoint the same international investment
bankers it accused a few months ago of demanding excessive fees.
The decision to bring back Credit Suisse First Boston and J Henry Schroder
Wagg to handle the sale of 30 per cent of OTE through the Athens stock
exchange is due to be announced in the next few days.
The government's choice is all the more surprising as senior socialist
officials had earlier dismissed the possibility that CSFB would be recalled.
CSFB had been openly attacked over the high fees it commanded as a leading
adviser on privatisation to the previous conservative government,
One government adviser said that to members of the governing Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (Pasok) CSFB 'appears an arrogant outfit that represents
the unacceptable face of capitalism.'
But he added: 'On the other hand, bringing back the old team is the
pragmatic solution. They worked on the listing for several months last year,
so we can be more certain of getting the flotation done on time.'
The government hopes to realise about Dr300bn (Pounds 814m) from the sale of
30 per cent of OTE. The offering would include an international tranche
amounting to 12-15 per cent, to be sold to investors in Europe, the US and
Japan.
The economy ministry is anxious for the deal to be completed this autumn, so
that a portion of the funds raised can go towards covering a projected
Dr500bn shortfall in budget revenue. The remainder would be used to upgrade
OTE's fixed wire network.
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou cancelled Greece's privatisation programme
immediately after the socialists returned to power at last October's general
election. The conservatives' overall adviser on privatisation, N M
Rothschild, was sacked, while separate agreements with CSFB and Schroders
were frozen.
The widening revenue gap and the need to raise funds to modernise Greece's
public utilities forced the government to change its policy two months ago.
Since then, confusion has surrounded procedures for appointing an adviser
and lead underwriters for the sale. While bids were not formally invited,
the economy ministry solicited offers from several international investment
banks. Another half-dozen banks are understood to have submitted bids
without waiting to be asked.
The ministry's plans for a 'beauty contest' to assess bids from a shortlist
of contenders, including Paribas, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Salomon
Brothers and S J Warburg, were dropped last month without any explanation.
The government was understood to be looking for a bank that could replace
CSFB in selling the international tranche, while retaining Schroders to
structure the issue.
Under the conservatives' plan to sell 49 per cent of the company, CSFB was
advising the government on the sale of a 35 per cent strategic stake to an
international telecoms operator. CSFB and Schroders were appointed joint
global co-ordinators and lead managers for the flotation of another 14 per
cent of the company.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Recovery in car sales falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fragile recovery in west European new car demand was halted last month
as sales fell by 1.6 per cent year-on-year to 1.08m, according to industry
estimates.
New car sales were higher than a year ago in each of the first three months,
but the market was hit last month by a sharp fall in demand in Germany as
well as by lower sales in several of the smaller European markets.
In the first four months new car sales have risen by 3.8 per cent to an
estimated 4.33m. Sales in the whole of 1993 plunged by more than 15 per
cent, the steepest decline of the post-war period.
In Germany, the biggest single market in Europe, new car sales fell last
month by an estimated 13 per cent to 295,000 and have declined by around 1.7
per cent to 1.16m in the first four months.
Sales fell last month in 10 of 17 markets across west Europe in contrast to
the improvement of the first quarter. In the first four months of the year
sales were higher than a year ago in 11 west European markets.
Last month new car demand remained strong in the four main Nordic countries
and most importantly in France, where sales rose by 17.2 per cent
year-on-year. The rate of growth slowed, however, in Spain, as well as in
the UK, where consumer confidence has been dented by tax increases.
PSA Peugeot Citroen of France has drawn level with General Motors of the US
(Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK), in second place in the
west European market.
Helped by the strong recovery in new car sales in France and in Spain - it
is the market leader in both countries - the Peugeot Citroen group has
increased its sales volume by an estimated 11.3 per cent in the first four
months this year. It has raised its market share to 12.7 per cent from 11.8
per cent a year ago.
Japanese new car sales in west Europe have fallen by an estimated 6.3 per
cent to 486,000 in the first four months, as Japanese carmakers struggle to
keep their prices competitive under the impact of the rising yen.
Japanese carmakers without production in Europe have been hardest hit, with
Mitsubishi sales falling by 18.9 per cent and Mazda sales declining by 8 per
cent.
Mercedes-Benz increased sales volume by 39 per cent in the first four months
of the year, helped by the launch last year of its C-Class executive range,
overtaking arch-rival BMW.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Lubbers throws hat into Euro ring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, yesterday entered the
campaign to become the next president of the European Commission with a call
for a crackdown on organised crime and illegal immigration in the European
Union.
Mr Lubbers made his pitch to succeed Mr Jacques Delors in a speech in
Aachen, Germany, on the future of Europe. His twin themes of law and order,
as well as the need to tackle public insecurity over jobs, crime and drugs
appeared aimed at coaxing Chancellor Helmut Kohl into backing his candidacy.
Chancellor Kohl is reported to have reservations about Mr Lubbers, who faces
rival bids for the top executive post in Brussels from Sir Leon Brittan, the
chief EU trade commissioner, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime
minister.
Until yesterday, Mr Lubbers has remained silent about his political
ambitions. But in his speech - delivered in honour of Mrs Gro Harlem
Brundt-land, the Norwegian prime minister and this year's winner of the
Charlemagne prize, he managed to pay tribute to or mention almost all EU
member states or prime ministers - with the exception of the UK.
The German presidency of the EU, which takes over from Greece on July 1, has
pledged to give high priority to such issues as crime, joblessness and
illegal immigration.
The 12 EU heads of government are expected to choose a successor to Mr
Delors at the European summit in Corfu next month. A stand-off between Mr
Dehaene and Mr Lubbers, both Christian Democrats, might delay a decision.
However, Mr Dehaene, whose candidacy remains undeclared despite
encouragement from France and Germany, may withdraw to avoid a public
contest.

FT  13 MAY 94 / France threatens to pull out Bosnia troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign ministers from the US, Russia and the European Union will meet in
Geneva today in a desperate effort to prevent a serious escalation of the
war in Bosnia.
The European and US policies have been increasingly divergent at a time when
Croat, Moslem and Serb forces, which appeared close to a settlement last
month, are turning back from the negotiating table to the battlefield.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, has disturbed US officials with
talk of imposing a settlement on Bosnia. The sense that France, along with
other countries with troops in the region, is losing its patience was
heightened by Mr Juppe's threat to withdraw French troops from the UN
peacekeeping operation.
Mr Juppe warned that France already viewed its position in the United
Nations force in Bosnia as impossible, and would have to pull its 6,000
soldiers out if there were no 'swift diplomatic breakthrough'.
'I think that people should realise that certain troop-contributing
countries, like France, will not be able to wait for months and months,
because we are in an impossible situation,' he said.
A similar mood of frustrution prevailed in Washington, where the Clinton
administration came under increasing domestic pressure yesterday to arm the
Bosnian Moslems. The US Senate debated a resolution calling for a unilateral
lifting of the UN embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia, which has been more
disadvantaged by the ban than the other republics of the former Yugoslavia.
Other countries with significant numbers of troops in the region, such as
Britain, would find it difficult to stay in the area were the French to pull
out. However, a senior G7 official said that unilateral French action was
unlikely and that any troop pull-out would involve consultation with UN
partners.
Mr Juppe insisted that there was no serious rift between the American and
French positions. He said the Geneva talks offered an opportunity for the
contact group countries to say clearly what they want in Bosnia and to
increase pressure on the warring parties. 'It's not a question of imposing
on the parties a peace plan that they don't want. The question is whether we
are ready to exert pressure on the parties to accept a reasonable plan,' Mr
Juppe said.
France has put forward a 'non-paper' for the Geneva meeting which proposes
that the contact group should demand an immediate ceasefire, reaffirm the
existence of Bosnia-Hercegovina as an independent state and recognise the
reality that it can only exist as a confederation of different communities.
The US has been unwilling to press the Bosnian government to accept a
territorial division that it believes to be unjust, but Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, told Mr Juppe the US backed a
division giving 51 per cent to the Moslems and Croats, and the remainder to
the Serbs.
That ratio came close to winning acceptance before the siege of Gorazde
torpedoed peace talks, but the Serbs have now reasserted their claim to the
70 per cent they hold, while Moslem and Croat negotiators claim 58 per cent.

Romania has signed a European convention giving its citizens the right of
final redress at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Mr Teodor
Melescanu, the foreign minister, described the signing of the 11th protocol
of the European Convention on Human Rights as an important step in Romania's
moves towards European standards of democracy. Romania has a controversial
human rights record, becoming the last of central Europe's former communist
countries to join the Council of Europe last October. The country's
treatment of its 1.7m ethnic Hungarian and 2m gypsy minorities, as well as
its ban on homosexuality, delayed the restoration of most favoured nation
trading status by the US until last autumn.

plant, he said that it showed special incentives were not necessary for
foreign investment to enter the country. AVX, the British subsidiary of a US
electronics component maker which is part of the Japanese Kyocera Group,

Financially troubled national airline TAP-Air Portugal will reduce US-based

official said yesterday. TAP will offer retirement packages to 39 employees
in the first phase of a wider cost-cutting programme. The company will also
study the possibility of ending service to Boston, Montreal and Toronto and
flying only to Newark. The staff reductions and possible route changes would
not go into effect before the end of the 1994 summer season, the official
said. In January the airline accepted a government bailout plan that would
inject some Dollars 1bn over the next three years. The plan is being
examined by the European Union.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bulgaria's National Electricity Company is to invest a further Dollars 200m
(Pounds 134m) to upgrade and increase the safety of four Soviet-designed
440MW reactors at the troubled Kozloduy nuclear power complex. Kozloduy
provides 40 per cent of the country's power output and cannot be phased out
until alternative power sources are secured.
The National Electricity Company has already spent Dollars 50m on upgrading
the ageing power plants, which suffered from decades of poor maintenance and
from an exodus of skilled workers after the collapse of the communist
regime. Two of the four older reactors, dating from the 1960s, were declared
unsafe by international inspectors in 1991 and closed down for essential
repairs before they were re-opened last year.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is managing and
co-ordinating an international fund for improving safety at Soviet-era
plants like Kozloduy, which is one of several nuclear power plants on the
Danube River. But western companies have been unwilling to play a full role
in upgrading such plants until complex legal issues are resolved in a way
which absolves them from responsibility for radiation and other inherited
environmental problems.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A crackdown on illegal workers and tax evasion in the German construction
industry found that almost 25 per cent of contractors were operating
illegally. Raids by almost 3,000 police and customs officers in late April
found that foreign workers were paid a fraction of German wages.
In all, 20,000 employers and workers - including some in catering and
transport - were questioned in the biggest action of its kind so far,
according to the German finance ministry. The raids were launched after
complaints from trade unions and employers' organisations about low-paid
foreign workers.
Employers can be fined up to DM100,000 (Pounds 40,140) for using illegal
workers and over 120 have been taken to court, the ministry said. An Irish
construction worker in Bonn said foreign workers were badly treated by
middlemen who often disappear with their earnings. The middlemen receive
about DM55 an hour for each worker they supply but the workers see only DM30
in the best cases.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Russia hopes to rein in inflation
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sergei Dubinin, Russia's finance minister, yesterday predicted that the
inflation rate would be brought down to between 5 and 7 per cent a month by
the end of the year. His comment follows Wednesday's parliamentary approval
of a budget which goes some way to meeting the government commitment to the
International Monetary Fund that it would rein in spending and curb
inflation. Inflation has already come down to between 8 and 9 per cent a
month from a high last year of nearly 30 per cent.
The Russian parliament has now approved the main budget indicators -
including a deficit of Rbs70,000bn (Pounds 25.2bn), which, Mr Dubinin said,
was within the target agreed with the IMF of 10 per cent of gross national
product. Mr Dubinin saw this as 'a vote of confidence in the economic
policies of the government'. The finance minister predicted that the fall in
the value of the rouble would be significantly less than forecast when the
budget was drawn up, coming at an average of Rbs2,600 to the dollar for the
year against the forecast of Rbs3,000. The rouble stood yesterday at
Rbs1,869 to the dollar. Russia should press for inclusion of China in the
group of leading industrialised countries, expanding it from a G7 to a G9 to
include Russia and China, according to Mr Anatoly Adamishin, first deputy
foreign minister. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, will
pay an official visit to China later this month.

Spain's GDP rose at a year-on-year rate of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter
of 1994, the first such increase in five quarters, the Bank of Spain's
latest economic bulletin said yesterday. It said GDP rose about 1 per cent
in the quarter compared with the last three months of 1993.
The Bank of Portugal yesterday lowered its injection rate to 10.75 per cent
from 11.0 per cent and its absorption rate to 9.75 per cent from 10.0 per
cent. The Bank also cut its overnight standby facility rate for resident
banks to 11.75 per cent from 12.0 per cent.

FT  13 MAY 94 / TV news with a European identity crisis: The outlook for
Europe's answer to CNN of the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up a country lane in the village of Ecully near the south eastern French
city of Lyons are 150 people with high ambition struggling to match their
high-tech.
As Euronews, Europe's first multilingual satellite TV news channel, set up
16 months ago, their ambition is to be Europe's equivalent to CNN of the US.
However, despite a subsidy from the European Union, Euronews overran its
budget last year by FFr50m, (Pounds 5.85m) and the deficit this year will be
bigger. RAI and RTVE, the Italian and Spanish state TV networks which are
two of Euronews's four main shareholders, are dragging their feet on a
much-needed capital increase.
Euronews claims to reach an audience of 13.9m households through cable and
57m through terrestrial re-broadcast of its programmes, throughout the
continent of Europe and north Africa. It does now, however, face something
of an identity crisis, akin to that of Europe itself.
Is there enough of a common European consciousness for its future to lie in
continuing to pump out programming - identical in everything but the
soundtracks in five languages - 20 hours a day to the whole of its potential
market? Or, as another main shareholder, France Television, now argues,
would it not be better for Euronews to take on more national colouring to
suit the big individual European markets?
Certainly, Euronews has no shortage of national material to draw on.
Conceived by the public television members of the European Broadcasting
Union, the Geneva-based grouping of 67 broadcasters, it is hooked into the
EBU's daily Eurovision auction of programmes, as well as subscribing to the
Reuters and WTN television services.
In addition, it can take material directly from its four big shareholders -
the fourth is SSR of Switzerland - and 11 smaller ones that now include
networks in three north African countries and one from Slovenia, the
ex-Yugoslav republic.
But the very breadth of this material makes it hard for Euronews to
establish a distinctive personality. Mr Jean-Claude Silvain, Euronews's
administrative and financial director, wonders whether 'there is such a
thing as a European point of view on news' in the way that CNN, even CNN
International, often seems to be 'the view from Atlanta'.
To a far lesser extent, Euronews is the view from Brussels or Strasbourg,
home cities respectively of Europe's Commission and Parliament. Euronews
broadcasts news on the EU and has a regular magazine programme on EU
institutions.
Much Strasbourg coverage has been less than compulsive viewing, and has more
to do with the subsidy to Euronews which the EU just doubled to FFr30m for
this year. Mr Silvain would like to alter the nature of Euronews's
relationship with the EU so that 'instead of us getting automatically
rewarded by Brussels simply for broadcasting in five Community languages, we
would be paid for offering a genuine service'.
That, however, raises the question of whether, or when, Euronews would have
the resources to offer original programming. Mr Peter Vickers, Euronews's
English language editor and the man responsible for news and current
affairs, says the station will offer its own special programmes on the
European Parliament election campaign this month and next.
But Euronews is uncertain whether to try to rise to the challenge of
offering pan-European coverage of Euro-election results on the day. 'It's
obviously a big opportunity for us,' says a journalist at Ecully, 'but
equally, we could fall flat on our faces.'
There is a technical cause for Euronews's relative lack of personality. None
of its journalists can appear on camera, for the obvious reason that they
cannot speak five languages at the same time. Nor is dubbing possible; as
one of the Ecully journalists says, 'it takes 15 seconds to say in German
what can be said in English in 10 seconds'.
Without 'talking heads' to fill in inevitable gaps, Euronews has had to make
far greater use of graphics than, say, CNN. 'Some 20-30 per cent of total
output is taken up with tables, charts, maps, election results, or just
credits,' says Mr Patrick Lefko, its art director.
To fill the gaps in its finances as well as its programmes, Euronews would
like more advertising. The company gives no figures on this, but Mr Richard
White, Euronews advertising director, claims that advertising revenue for
pan-European satellite stations is currently only between Dollars 120 and
Dollars 150m a year, and even that is inflated by business booked in the US
by CNN for its international service.
Advertising revenues in national European markets are, of course, much
greater, and better adaptation to national markets is precisely what France
Television, under its new boss, Mr Jean-Pierre Elkabbach, is now urging on
Euronews. His particular interest is to use France Television's stake in
Euronews to match plans by the dominant French private station, TF1, to
start up an all-news channel this summer.
France Television has no intention of increasing the one hour of straight
Euronews it carries on its FR3 regular channel already, says a spokesman,
but rather to take the Euronews cable service and to adapt it 'by mixing in
more of our own national programming and news to attract more French
viewers'.
France Television has dubbed this hybrid plan 'Euronews France', and sees no
reason why similar hybrids of 'Euronews Deutschland' or even 'Euronews
Britain' could not one day induce German TV stations and the BBC to drop
their stand-offish attitude to Euronews.
The latter would then, says France Television, become just another 'banque
d'images' (picture bank) for Europe's national networks. That would hardly
satisfy the ambitions of those at Ecully. But for the near future, they may
find they have to choose survival rather than satisfaction.

Turkey has received bids from 18 foreign consortia to prepare studies for
the country's first nuclear power plant. The US companies include Bechtel
Power and Southern Electric. Among other bidders are Belgatom of Belgium,
Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute in partnership with Hyundai
Engineering, and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India.
The invitation to tender last month coincided with Turkey's worst financial
crisis in a decade. However, without more plant capacity, energy officials
predict Turkey will face power shortfalls as early as 1996. John Murray

FT  13 MAY 94 / IBM claims breakthrough in use of CDs to store data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists in the US are claiming a breakthrough in recording technology
which makes it possible to store several movies, 12 hours of music or 1m
pages of printed text on a single compact disc.
The breakthrough could markedly influence the development of the
'multimedia' revolution which promises to deliver new, interactive varieties
of entertainment and information to television screens in the home and
office.
It could also revolutionise the storage and retrieval of business
information. At present, companies store regularly used information in
magnetic disc drives or 'jukeboxes' of optical compact discs.
The new technique, developed by researchers at International Business
Machines' Almaden research centre in San Jose, California, will multiply
tenfold the amount of data that can be stored in a given space. Any item can
be retrieved within 10 seconds, the researchers say.
Video games, training programmes and other multimedia applications should
benefit from the enhanced quality of image and sound made possible by the
IBM technique.
The essence of multimedia technology is the transformation of information of
all kinds - video images, music, text and so on - into the digital computer
language of bits and bytes in which it can be manipulated by computer and
transmitted over telecommunications lines.
Storage of bits is expensive. Optical disc technology, in which lasers
'read' marks on the metallised surface of a compact disc, has so far proved
the most cost-effective solution.
The IBM breakthrough has been to glue together individual discs without the
metal coating to form layered, three-dimensional stacks. Information
anywhere in the stack can be read by focusing the laser beam on the
appropriate layer. A 10-layer disc could store more than 1m pages of text.
One application could be the storage of millions of movies in digital form
for video-on-demand services. The new disc will not work in today's compact
disc drives, and multi-layer CDs will inevitably be more expensive to make
than single-layer discs.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Fall in producer prices boosts US bonds and shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US bond and share prices rebounded yesterday following reports of an
unexpected decline in producer prices last month - a sign that the strong
economic recovery is not yet putting much upward pressure on inflation.
Bond traders also reacted positively to news of an unexpected dip in retail
sales. The decline, however, did not appear to indicate any loss of
underlying economic momentum because sales figures for March were revised up
substantially.
Most Wall Street analysts still expect the Federal Reserve to signal another
increase in short-term interest rates next week in order to bolster the
dollar on foreign exchange markets and prevent rapid economic growth
eventually translating into higher inflation.
Bond prices rallied sharply in New York early yesterday but later shed some
of their gains. The benchmark 30-year long bond was up about half a point in
late trading, to yield 7.552 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
closed 23.8 points higher at 3,652.84.
The producer price index fell 0.1 per cent last month and by 0.4 per cent in
the year to April, indicating that the recovery is, as yet, putting little
upward pressure on wholesale prices. Most forecasters had expected an
increase of about 0.2 per cent last month.
The Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.8 per cent in cash terms
last month, against Wall Street projections of an increase of about 0.3 per
cent. However, the level of sales was higher than expected last month
because figures for March were revised up substantially to show a gain of
1.7 per cent rather than the 0.4 per cent reported earlier.
In the three months to April, retail sales were 8.6 per cent higher than in
the same period last year.
Many analysts expect the Fed to signal a half-point increase in short-term
rates to 4.25 per cent next Tuesday following a meeting of its policymaking
open market committee.
Some, however, predict an increase of only a quarter point, in line with the
previous three tightening moves. If the Fedopts to send a strong signal, it
may announce an increase in the discount rate, the notional rate at which it
lends to banks.
Increases in the discount rate, known as 'ringing the gong', have a stronger
psychological impact than increases in the federal funds rate, which serves
as a floor for money market rates.
In foreign exchange markets, an increase in US rates is widely seen as a
logical counterpart to the cut in German rates announced on Wednesday and
the concerted intervention in support of the dollar last week.
Private sector economists believe that further increases in short-term rates
are also required to slow the rate of US economic expansion and prevent the
economy hitting capacity constraints.

FT  13 MAY 94 / Labour mourns its lost leader: Tributes to John Smith span
political divide - Shadow cabinet suspends Euro-campaign / Stunned party
faces prolonged struggle to choose a successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sudden death of Mr John Smith yesterday transformed Britain's political
landscape, opening up the prospect of a protracted struggle for the Labour
leadership and easing the pressure on Mr John Major's premiership.
The news of his death, after a heart attack at his London flat, stunned
Westminster. It brought grief and confusion as it quickly became clear that
the political implications spread far beyond the opposition.
The 55-year-old Mr Smith had suffered an earlier serious heart attack in
1988 but recovered fully after by-pass surgery. He was the overwhelming
choice of the party when Mr Neil Kinnock stood down as leader after Labour's
defeat in the 1992 general election. Mr Major led a chorus of tributes that
spanned the political divide. Many of Mr Smith's shadow cabinet colleagues
were unable to contain their grief at the loss of one of the most respected
politicians of his generation.
As the government suspended all parliamentary business in deference to Mr
Smith's family, Mr Major described Mr Smith as an 'outstanding
parliamentarian'. His death was 'the waste of a remarkable political
talent'.
Praising his honesty, integrity and his brilliant House of Commons' style,
Mr Major added: 'I shall think of him as an opponent, not an enemy, and when
I remember him I shall do so with respect and with affection.' The Queen
sent a personal message of sympathy to Mrs Elizabeth Smith, his widow, and
her three daughters. Mr Kinnock spoke of the 'massive injustice' that Mr
Smith had been deprived of the chance to lead his country. Mr Paddy Ashdown,
the Liberal Democrat leader, spoke of Mr Smith's 'sharp wit and deep
personal warmth'.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy Labour leader, who took over as acting
party leader, was heard in stunned silence by hundreds of MPs as she offered
an emotional tribute from the Commons despatch box.
Mr Smith was pronounced dead at St Bartholomew's hospital yesterday morning
after being rushed by ambulance from his flat in London's Barbican complex.
He had suffered at least one and perhaps two heart attacks. Only 12 hours
before he appeared buoyant at a party fund-raising dinner.
After an emergency meeting of the shadow cabinet, Mrs Beckett announced that
the party would halt all campaigning for next month's European elections
until after Mr Smith's funeral next week. Labour hopes the Conservatives and
the Liberal Democrats will do the same.
It also deferred until later this month any move to begin the complicated
electoral procedures to choose a successor. But at Westminster last night
four of the leading figures in the shadow cabinet were potential contenders
in a struggle which will decide the party's future direction and be critical
to the outcome of the next general election.
Mr Tony Blair, the 41-year-old shadow home secretary and one of the most
prominent leaders of the so-called 'modernisers', was quickly tipped by MPs
on both the right and left of the party as the most likely successor.
Several members of the shadow cabinet said Mr Blair, who has a strong appeal
among the middle-class voters in the south needed by Labour if it is to win
a general election, was the obvious choice.
Some backbench MPs were suggesting a 'dream ticket' under which Mr John
Prescott, the leftwing shadow employment secretary, would take the deputy
leadership.
But Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor and a close friend of Mr Blair
and a fellow moderniser, is also a strong contender. Friends said they would
agree on a single candidacy for advocates of reform rather than fight each
other in a contest.
On the left of the party, Mr Prescott and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and
industry secretary, could expect powerful support from the constituency and
trades union sections of the electoral college which chooses the party
leader. Mrs Beckett and Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, might
also join the contest.
The party made it clear last night that the protracted process of choosing a
new leader would not start until after the June 9 European election. Because
of Labour's complicated electoral system - involving individual ballots of
party activists and supporters in the union movement - the process could
take months. Senior party figures suggested the outcome might not be known
until the annual party conference at the end of September.
As senior Labour figures contemplated the succession, the judgment of
Conservative ministers was that Mr Smith's tragic death had greatly reduced
the threat to Mr Major's position from the European elections.
A protracted struggle for the Labour leadership would shift much of the
political focus from internal divisions in the Tory party over Europe to the
Labour succession, in turn easing the immediate pressure on Mr Major.
Conservative MPs said that Mr Smith's death had also severely dented the
chances of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, capturing
the Tory leadership. Mr Heseltine suffered a minor heart attack last year.
Leading critics of the prime minister on the Tory back benches acknowledged
that they now saw virtually no chance of a move to oust him in the summer if
the government suffered a massive defeat in the European poll.
The prospect of a challenge in the autumn would also depend to a significant
degree on which candidate Labour chose to succeed Mr Smith.

FT  12 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei back over 20,000
as region reviews its appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Further strength in the dollar against the yen took the Nikkei 225 average
above the 20,000 level for the first time since April 19, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index advanced 232.35, or 1.2 per cent, to 20,150.13. It opened at the
day's low of 20,001.10 and reached a high of 20,219.84 just before
midsession on active buying by foreign investors and arbitrageurs.
Overnight gains on the US stock and bond markets, and the dollar's rise
above the Y104 level against the yen, heartened investors. Rumours of credit
tightening in the US and a cut in interest rates in Germany prompted buying
of the dollar, while active dollar purchase intervention by the Bank of
Japan also helped the yen to weaken.
The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 17.21 at 1,635.04 and the
Nikkei 300 rose 3.29 to 299.59. Advances led declines by 795 to 226, with
158 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.44 at
1,341.98.
Some analysts said that yesterday's easing of the yen was not enough to
boost prices further. Mr Rod Smyth, strategist at Baring Securities, said
that the Nikkei would remain within a range of 18,500 to 21,000 in the short
term. 'We need something more significant for the Nikkei to break that
range,' he said, adding that evidence of a sustainable economic recovery in
mid to late summer would support equities.
High-tech stocks firmed on the lower yen, with Hitachi moving up Y16 to Y974
and Sony Y250 to Y5,890. Car issues were also higher: Toyota Motor rose Y40
to Y2,010 and Nissan Motor Y13 to Y863.
Fuji Bank advanced Y60 to Y2,380 and Bank of Tokyo added Y30 at Y1,640 on
arbitrage purchases.
Non-life companies gained ground on reports that they would lift rates later
this year: Tokio Marine and Fire appreciated Y40 to Y1,330 and Sumitomo
Marine and Fire firmed Y20 to Y1,000.
Some retailers encountered profit-taking. Daiei, the largest supermarket
chain, lost Y20 at Y1,740 and Ito-Yokado declined Y20 to Y5,410.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 248.99 to 22,327.56 in volume of 33m
shares.
Roundup
Overnight recovery in the US equity market allowed most of the region's
stock markets to look at their attractions, rather than their drawbacks.
HONG KONG recalled that it was on a market price/earnings ratio of only 12
when it touched a recent low of 8,300. Institutional buying intensified and
the Hang Seng index accelerated its recovery with a rise of 366.07, or 4.3
per cent, to 8,906.16.
Brokers said activity in futures contributed to the rise as overseas fund
managers snapped up key index components such as Hong Kong Telecom, which
climbed 60 cents to HKDollars 14.70 and HSBC, up HKDollars 2.50 at HKDollars
85.
Heavy futures turnover was echoed by a preliminary advance from HKDollars
3.09bn to HKDollars 5.06bn in the cash market. Cheung Kong, whose p/e ratio
was as low as seven times recently, topped the active list as it
strengthened HKDollars 2.25, or 6.4 per cent, to HKDollars 37.25.
SYDNEY liked the lack of surprises in the federal budget and the All
Ordinaries index closed 26.4 higher at 2,034.6 in turnover of ADollars
696.4m. News Corp improved 10 cents to ADollars 8.91 after a fall of 24
cents on Tuesday.
CRA soared 52 cents to ADollars 17.14 and BHP 40 cents to ADollars 16.68 as
firmer commodity prices continued to push the resource sector higher. MIM
climbed by 21 cents to ADollars 3.07 and topped the volume charts with
11.16m shares changing hands; yesterday's price on the opposing page was in
error.
SEOUL scraped its way to a sixth successive gain, the composite index
closing 1.51 ahead at 948.91 after a day's peak of 955.59. TAIPEI ended
above the 6,000 resistance level on late buying in industrials, the weighted
index adding 87.10, or 1.5 per cent, at 6,024.47 as turnover expanded from
TDollars 57.05bn to TDollars 61.96bn.
MANILA was led higher by the US-quoted telephone stock PLDT, and while
profit-taking pared its gains the composite index ended 38.82 stronger at
2,952.27. PLDT finished 30 pesos up at 1,860 pesos, after a high of 1,880.
WELLINGTON put in a notable rally in line with other world equity markets,
gains in US treasuries, and Australasian debt markets after the Australian
budget. The NZSE-40 index closed 33.26 ahead at 2,063.84.
KARACHI dropped sharply, down for the fourth straight session on nervous
selling by short-term players. The KSE 100 index finished 55.65, or 2.5 per
cent, lower at 2,182.37.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Forecasters get together in
European venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commodity traders and agribusinesses in Europe are the target customers of a
new company called CropSense, which plans to market crop forecasts using
satellite imagery and economic models.
The company is a joint venture between the National Remote Sensing Centre of
the UK, a leading supplier of agricultural information from satellites, and
Cropcast of Maryland, which provides commodity forecasts to over 100,000
customers worldwide.
'The new company will provide a similar service to Cropcast but targeted on
Europe,' said Mr Neil Pattie, marketing communications manager of NRSC,
which is 56 per cent-owned by British Aerospace.
'Reforms to the common agricultural policy limiting planted acreage, the
prospect of increased production from some east European countries, and now
the passage of Gatt reforms will expose Europe to world market pricing. This
is likely to result in more volatile commodity prices, so accurate and
timely forecast information will be of particular value.'
The company, located at Farnborough, southern England, is 51 per cent owned
by NRSC and 49 per cent by Cropcast. NRSC, whose turnover last year was
Pounds 5.8m, has just been awarded a contract by the UK agriculture ministry
for satellite imagery to check farmers' claims for support payments for
their arable crops and set-aside land.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Enso firm on Berghuizer bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish forest products group, said yesterday it had no
plans to raise its bid for the outstanding shares in Berghuizer
Papierfabriek, its loss-making Dutch paper subsidiary.
The news came in spite of criticism from some shareholders that its offer of
Fl 50 per share was too low.
The Finnish company said the takeover was the best way to safeguard
Berghuizer's future. Berghuizer was expected to post further losses in 1994
and 1995, and there was no likelihood of a resumption of dividend payments
in the 'foreseeable' future, it said.
'Enso believes that it is offering a generous strategic premium over the net
present value of the underlying cashflow potential of the shares, and is not
prepared to improve its offer,' it said.
Mr Magnus Diesen, Enso's vice-president of corporate planning, said in
Amsterdam that the Fl 50 per share on offer was 'substantially' higher than
Berghuizer's expected cash flow potential, but he declined to give details
of Enso's calculations.
The offer expires in mid-June. Criticism of the bid has centred on
Berghuizer's book value, which is estimated at Fl 86 per share. Some
shareholders, including US pension funds, have called for the bid to be
raised above book value. Yesterday Mr Diesen said: 'Book value is not an
adequate measure of the value of the company.'
Berghuizer was trading at Fl 47 when Enso unveiled its bid plans on April
18, but expectations of a possible increase in the offer have lifted the
shares to just below Fl 55. Yesterday, however, they fell by more than 5 per
cent to close at Fl 52.00 from Fl 54.90 on Tuesday.
Mr Diesen said Enso had not set any minimum acceptance level and would pay
Fl 50 for any shares tendered. The illiquidity of Berghuizer's shares in
Amsterdam meant that Fl 50 was the best possible exit price for large
shareholders, he said.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Aegon net advances 13.2% to Fl
260m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aegon, the second-largest Dutch insurer, said net profit rose by 13.2 per
cent to Fl 260.3m (Dollars 139m) in the first quarter from Fl 229.9m in the
same quarter of last year.
Premium revenues jumped by nearly 50 per cent to Fl 4.59bn from Fl 3.13bn,
reflecting the first-time inclusion of results from Scottish Equitable of
the UK and from Diversified Investment Advisors of the US.
Total revenue, which includes realised and unrealised gains and losses from
investments, rose by a more modest 3.1 per cent to Fl 5.09bn. 'Investment
income for the risk of policy holders is lower than last year due to
unrealised losses in line with the downward trend of international financial
markets,' the company said.
Aegon said results in the Netherlands showed a 'clear' rise while those in
the US, the group's second biggest market, saw strong growth.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UN ponders Rwanda troop airlift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations is considering airlifting at least 5,500 troops to Rwanda
to ensure the safety of refugees and delivery of humanitarian aid, AP
reports from New York.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, announced that Nigeria,
Ghana and Tanzania had offered the troops and the 15-nation Security Council
was beginning discussions of the plan yesterday evening. A final decision
was not expected until the end of the week.
Despite the urgency, the troops will be able to do nothing to stop the
genocidal slaughter, which has already claimed up to 200,000 lives in a
month. In making recommendations to the Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali
said the UN troops would not be authorised to use force to stop the
fighting, only to defend themselves. And under the best-case plan, the
troops would not begin arriving for a month.
The UN withdrew all but a token force of about 400 peacekeepers from Rwanda
last month when fighting made their mission  - monitoring a cease-fire and
peace accord  - futile.
Mr Boutros Ghali said the new troops would put the airport at Kigali,
Rwanda's capital and lifeline for supplies, under exclusive UN control and
would concentrate on protecting civilians and guarding relief workers and
their deliveries.
The UN chief warned the 15 Security Council members that time was of the
essence. 'The longer the delay in the deployment of the force,' he wrote,
'the greater the prospect of the mission not achieving its purpose.'
The US is already on record as supporting such a force and might help
airlift the troops, although none of its own. But it will likely take a
while for the operation to get off the ground.
The United Nations is already running 17 other peacekeeping operations
around the world, with more than 70,000 troops. It has unending problems
persuading member states to contribute properly trained and equipped troops.
One element that might help in the case of Rwanda is the support of Mr
Nelson Mandela, South Africa's new president. Mr Mandela declared his
support on Tuesday for a UN peacekeeping operation for Rwanda.

FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Standard strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decline in Standard Chartered shares was arrested yesterday as
the stock outpaced the rest of the bank sector and the FT-SE 100 Index
following presentations to Scottish institutions.
Standard shares, which reached a peak of 359p in February, fell to 232p on
Monday, but accelerated yesterday to post a 21 1/2 gain at 259 1/2 p, a rise
of 9 per cent on the session. Turnover of 5.6m shares was well above recent
levels of activity.
Dealers said the shares began to move ahead at the outset of trading, helped
by the 4 per cent jump by the Hong Kong stock market. And the presentations
by Mr Malcolm Williamson, Standard's chief executive, to the Scottish
institutions, hosted by Cazenove, Standard's broker, coupled with a general
feeling that the stock had been oversold, triggered the big surge.
There were mixed fortunes for J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest supermarket
operator, the shares enduring a rollercoaster session. At the unveiling of
its full-year results, the stock moved smartly forward as analysts
interpreted the company's statement on steady margins positively.
But at the post-results meeting, analysts complained that the margin issue -
a crucial test of financial well-being in the food retail sector - was not
clarified by the company's management. There was also said to be confusion
over a number of other matters, the result being that Sainsbury shares slid
as analysts returned to their desks.
More positive consideration towards the close helped the shares steady but
still left them adrift 2 1/2 at 389p. Turnover came to a hefty 17m. But the
figures contained enough to lift other retailers, Tesco adding 7 at 235 1/2
p on 16m traded and Asda firming 2 1/2 to 59p with 23m turned over.
Takeover target Lasmo moved higher by 2 1/2 to 154p as the market picked up
hints that a cash alternative to the all-paper offer from Enterprise Oil or
a straightforward counter-bid from elsewhere could be imminent.
The rise in the Lasmo share price took place in the face of a fall in
Enterprise shares of 7 to 440p, amid hints that Philips &amp; Drew Fund
Management, which has been increasing its stake in Lasmo in recent weeks,
has been reducing its holding in Enterprise.
Rumours of an impending cash bid for Lasmo swept the London market in
midsession yesterday, with dealers reporting the 'same old names' as being
about to swoop. These names include Atlantic Richfield, the US group, and
France's Total.
BPB, the plasterboard manufacturer, and RMC, the cement/aggregrates group,
both fell heavily as dealers pondered the prospect of a move by Lafarge
Coppee, the French plasterboard and building materials group, into the East
German market. BPB shares plunged 19 to 304p and RMC 22 to 852p.
Bank shares, among the market's worst performers this year, came in for
strong support from two areas. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said
the sector offered good value at current levels, while Collins Stewart, the
UK broker, was said to be recommending HSBC. The latter edged up 7 to 731p.
Royal Bank of Scotland receded 12 1/2 to 428p on exceptionally heavy
turnover of 11m, as short-term speculators took profits after the interim
figures.
Royal Insurance retreated 10 to 258p amid worries that the companies
first-quarter numbers, due this morning, could prove a big disappointment to
the market following some big bad weather losses.
Carlton Communications eased a penny to 912p, with Nomura International
reiterating a cautious stance.
Chemicals group Croda International and electronics concern Eurotherm
softened a penny apiece to 450p and 372p respectively, with some dealers
saying they were overvalued.
USM-quoted Phonelink shed a further 28 to 370p as scrappy selling drove down
the price of the tightly traded stock.
Reuters Holdings climbed 14 1/2 to 499 1/2 p, reflecting the easing of
pressure imposed by the recent Abu Dhabi Investment Authority stake sale.
RTZ rose 12 to 849p after the annual meeting. Shares in precision components
manufacturer Linread jumped 63 to 216p after the bid from McKechnie, 13 off
at 474p.

FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in high street retailer Kingfisher fell sharply as rumours circulated
of a large derivatives trade, said to have been undertaken by Swiss Bank,
and possibly linked to a potentially large sale of Kingfisher shares next
month.
The possibility of a sale arises because, according to dealers, one third of
the 68m Kingfisher shares used last year to purchase Darty, the French
electrical retailer, can be sold by the holders from June 3.
However, stores analysts said the chances of the French institutions that
are among the holders of the shares - which include the company's family and
workforce, as well as some institutional investors - all deciding to sell
the stock at the same time must be highly unlikely. But the Swiss Bank story
unnerved the stock, which ended 17 off at 572p, albeit in modest trade of
2.4m.

FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tornado hints lift BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defence and industrial giant British Aerospace (BAe) rose strongly on
reports that it was about to announce a lucrative Tornado fighter aircraft
order. There were also positive reports from an analysts' visit to the
company's defence operations. The shares closed 23 ahead at 499p after
volume of 6m.
Rumours that BAe was about to sign a contract with the UK Ministry of
Defence to upgrade the Tornado aircraft swept through the market in the last
hour of trading, further strengthening an already impressive performance by
the shares.
Earlier, the stock had moved against the trend as favourable reports
filtered back to London from a two-day tour of the group's defence
operations by City analysts. One specialist said: 'It has become clear that
profits from the defence division will rise significantly over the next few
years.'
Confidence was further boosted by Tuesday's confirmation that Canada is to
buy 35 Airbus aircraft worth Pounds 950m. BAe is a 20 per cent stakeholder
in the Airbus consortium and builds the wings for the aircraft.

FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears over UK inflation dampened enthusiasm in stock index futures, although
expiry in traded options led to active trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,147,
in line with underlying cash. Early buying saw it move slowly forward, with
sentiment encouraged by favourable trading in other European markets.
However, a cautious Bank of England report on inflation checked a sharp move
ahead.
The announcement of a reduction in German interest rates led to a flurry of
buying activity and June rose to the day's peak of 3,154. But the buying
soon faded, leaving the contract to drift lower, as dealers once again
focused attention on the prospect of an increase in UK interest rates
following the report on inflation.
June closed at 3,133, down 11 on its previous close and just ahead of its
fair value premium to cash of about 3 points. Volume fell to 13,872.
The expiry of the May stock options brought a sharp rise in turnover in the
traded options. The closing total stood at 55,430 with a mere 9,631 dealt in
the FT-SE 100 volume and 3,444 in the Euro FT-SE contract.
Among the stock options, bid target Lasmo traded 5,936 and was followed by
British Steel at 5,256 contracts. BAT Industries saw business of 3,963 lots
and Tesco 2,619.

FT  12 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares unsettled by the Bank's
inflation report - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any benefit from the Bundesbank's reduction in both its key interest rates
yesterday was counterbalanced, as far as the London stock market was
concerned, by the Bank of England's warning on inflation pressures in the
UK. Share prices opened higher as London tried to follow other European
bourses in anticipating the Bundesbank rate cuts. But London had already
turned off before the Bundesbank announcement and recovered only part of its
fall by the close of business.
With most European centres now closed until Friday for the Ascension Day
break, London drifted in late trading, wary of a move by the Federal Reserve
to tighten credit policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was looking weak
when London closed for the day.
The continued nervousness of the London market was reflected in a near
26-point swing in leading indices. The FT-SE 100 Index, up 11.4 initially
and down 14.2 later, ended at 3,130.5 for a net loss of 5.8.
The Bank of England's inflation report was seen by some commentators as a
warning that the next move in domestic interest rates could be upwards and
might not be long delayed. Equities soon reversed their early advance,
shrugging off gains in UK government bonds and sterling, both of which
responded favourably to the Bank's comments.
Also discouraging for the stock market was the disclosure of sharp, and
wholly unexpected, falls in UK industrial and manufacturing output in March.
While analysts hastened to stress that one month's data can be unreliable
and that the underlying trend of output remains upwards, the announcement
sat badly with the Bank's warning on inflation and interest rates. Any
combination of a faltering economy and renewed inflation would be sad news
for the stock market.
Company news was mostly positive for the market, although the individual
shares concerned could not shrug off the market trend. Higher dividend
payments from J. Sainsbury and Royal Bank of Scotland sustained optimism on
dividend growth among UK companies. Speculative activity was also seen, with
the Lasmo/Enterprise Oil situation attracting attention again.
The broader range of the market followed the trend in the blue chip stocks,
leaving the FT-SE Mid 250 Index with a decline on the day of 10.8 at
3,742.5.
Seaq volume increased slightly to 744.2m shares from Tuesday's 728.9m, worth
Pounds 1.34bn in retail business. Retail, or genuine investment business,
has remained good in spite of recent uncertainties.
There were sharp losses among the building and construction issues, regarded
as particularly vulnerable to any threat of higher UK interest rates. Some
dollar stocks were helped by the strength of the US currency. Oil shares,
however, turned dull, with Shell Transport unable to make progress after
disclosing trading figures much in line with expectations.
The London market is likely to remain in slack water today, waiting for the
rest of Europe to reopen on Friday morning, and fearful that the US data on
retail sales, producer prices and jobless claims, may provoke a move today
from the Federal Reserve. Friday will bring further important figures on the
US economy and the following Tuesday sees the next meeting of the Federal
Reserve Open Market Committee - another danger point for global interest
rates.

FT  12 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities fall in wake of weak
bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks fell across the board yesterday in the wake of another big decline
in government bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.37 at 3,629.04.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 retreated 4.52 to 441.49, while
the American Stock Exchange composite ended 2.02 off at 433.17 and the
Nasdaq composite 8.00 lower at 717.00. Trading volume on the New York SE was
277.4m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 1,535 to 658.
After Tuesday's solid gains, the stock market failed to maintain its upward
momentum, primarily because the bond market - the main driving force behind
share prices this year - suffered early losses. The selling of bonds was
mostly due to nervousness ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 12bn in
10-year notes.
The nerves proved well justified, because the auction subsequently passed
off disappointingly, having attracted little demand from retail investors.
The poor auction hit bond prices hard, and by late afternoon the 30-year
bond was down more than a point, and the yield above 7.6 per cent once more.
That rise in long-term interest rates unsettled equity investors, and shares
dropped sharply after 1.30pm. Prices also fell because Tuesday's advance was
judged to have been little more than a technical rally following earlier
weakness. Analysts noted that sentiment in the stock market remained
subdued, with most investors bracing themselves for another interest rate
increase from the Federal Reserve.
Not every Dow stock took a tumble. Caterpillar bucked the trend, rising
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 107 1/8 after the brokerage house Merrill Lynch
raised its intermediate-term rating on the stock from 'above average' to
'buy'.
Another stock aided by a Merrill buy recommendation was Tenneco, which
firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 47.
Two sectors which led the market higher on Tuesday, computer and car shares,
ran into concerted selling.
Conner Peripherals fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 1/4 in volume of almost
3m shares on news that Iomega Corp had filed a patent infringement lawsuit
against the company, challenging its new back-up tape drive. Iomega, quoted
on the Nasdaq market, eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 2 1/4 .
Also on the Nasdaq, Micro Focus soared Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 16 1/2 on
reporting improved first-quarter net income and forecasting continued growth
in earnings.
Canada
The Toronto market declined in relatively light trading as North American
bond markets turned down in the afternoon.
The TSE 300 composite index finished 21.7 off at 4,168.2 and falls outscored
advances by 402 to 308 after turnover of 72.7m shares. Today's volume was
inflated by three large block trades of PWA Corp 'A' totalling more than
19.7m shares.
Mexico
Mexican shares closed sharply lower, pressured by falling American
Depositary Receipts of Mexican stocks on Wall Street and fears of further
increases in US interest rates.
The 37-share IPC index fell 33.52 points, or 1.51 per cent, to 2,179.57.
This followed an initial improvement as investors were encouraged by a cut
in interest rates - the 28-day Cetes, or treasury bill, being trimmed by 47
basis points to 16.02 per cent.
Traders said many foreign investors took profits ahead of today's televised
debate among candidates for the presidential election, which takes place
later this year.

FT  12 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Taking the pioneer trail to Cambodia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The attention of the global investor in emerging markets is turning more and
more to the exotic. As some of the established markets - such as Turkey and
India - have failed, so far, to sustain in 1994 the sort of returns that
made them glittering successes last year, such an attitude might appear
reasonable. In the case of Morgan Stanley's Mr Barton Biggs it is more like
being a pioneer.
In a research note published recently on Cambodia, Mr Biggs, the US
investment bank's director of global strategy, suggests that investors 'have
one chance in three of making no money or losing their entire investment in
the next five years, because the country's survival is still at risk; one
chance in three of making 500 per cent; and one chance in three of realising
a 1,000 per cent gain'.
Of course, there are certain barriers at present to any sort of foreign
investment - to begin with the country does not yet have a stock exchange.
This is not a problem, says Mr Biggs. 'The adventurous can acquire real
estate, or approach companies directly and buy stakes. The Ministry of
Finance and central bank (have) plans to privatise power and
telecommunications in the near future and a stock exchange is clearly on the
drawing board.'
For the moment, fundamentals are improving: a new government has reduced
inflation from 200 per cent to virtually nil, the currency has been
stabilised and 1993 GDP growth was 6 per cent.

FT  12 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank cuts make some
strategists happy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank made a number of strategists happy yesterday, with its cuts
of 50 basis points in the German discount and Lombard rates, writes Our
Markets Staff.
Mr James Cornish, European market strategist at NatWest Securities, said the
Bundesbank had helped to create conditions in which the US Federal Reserve
could increase US short-term interest rates, and ease the global pressure on
bond prices.
Bourses thought the same way, initially, extending Tuesday's gains; but the
lack of immediate action from the Fed, and the approach of the Ascension Day
holiday today, led them into more cautious attitudes by the end of the day.
FRANKFURT, where the Buba cuts came closest to home, had little time to
respond during the session. The Dax index moved up 8.48 to 2,243.63 on the
official day, but it held its gains and improved on them slightly in the
post-bourse, where the Ibis-indicated Dax ended at 2,248.02.
Metallgesellschaft rose DM17, or 7.5 per cent to DM243 on a few small buy
orders, and talk that a major Swiss bank had upgraded its recommendation on
the stock.
In shipbuilding, Bremer Vulkan shares closed DM4.30, or 4.5 per cent higher
at DM100.50 after news that the company expected a swing to profit in 1994
after a loss last year.
Turnover rose from DM7.95bn to DM8.6bn. The big energy and chemicals group,
Veba, which lifted the market with its first quarter results on Tuesday,
climbed another DM9.70 to DM537.
PARIS trimmed its intervention rate early in the day, before the news from
Germany. The combination of events, along with expectations that a further
rate cut will come next week, helped the CAC-40 index to a rise of 11.76 at
2,176.74.
Turnover was nearly FFr4bn.
Positive economic data - a rise in industrial productivity - was an added
bonus, according to James Capel: 'The manufacturing recovery is getting
under way', said the broker, 'and, given the buoyant optimism of surveys for
March and April, the recovery has almost certainly gained further momentum
since February'.
BSN continued to rise following its statement on Tuesday that it was
planning a series on international acquisitions, a gain of up FFr16 to
FFr885 bringing its rise to 4 per cent on the week so far.
AMSTERDAM rose following the German rate cut, with the AEX index up 2.58 at
412.57.
But there were other matters on investors' minds. Royal Dutch slightly
disappointed the market with its first quarter results and the shares shed
30 cents to Fl 205.70. Aegon, the insurer, was one of the session's best
performers, adding Fl 2.50 at Fl 101.00 as it reported a 13 per cent
increase in first-quarter profits.
ZURICH closed early ahead of today's holiday, and was unable to reflect the
German cuts. The blue chip, SMI index held Tuesday's recovery and rose
another 5.4 to 2,634.4, but it closed well below the day's high of 2,659.7.
Banks closed steady. Insurers were firm after Winterthur and Zurich
Insurance reported surprisingly strong 1993 earnings growth earlier this
week, the companies in question rising SFr19 to SFr689, and SFr22 to
SFr1,255 respectively.
In chemicals, Roche certificates recovered SFr5 to SFr6,335; but their
recent weakness continued after hours, with a fall to SFr6,310 in London.
Nestle registered, meanwhile, fell SFr12 to SFr1,102.
MADRID saw Mr Felipe Gonzalez face parliament again to address the
corruption cases which have bedevilled the socialist government. But unlike
last week, when a confident prime ministerial performance lifted the market,
yesterday closed with little response.
The general index closed just 0.49 higher at 321.48 in turnover of Pta32bn.
Construction stocks did best, Urallita rising Pta90, or 6.7 per cent to
Pta1,430, and Cubiertas Pta520, or 4.8 per cent to Pta11,432.
MILAN decided that the time had come to take profits after the prime
minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, finally announced the members of his
cabinet. The market was not swayed by an easing in interest rates by the
central bank, and the Comit index ended down 7.10 at 810.07.
Mr John Stewart of Inter-Europa in Milan commented that the new
administration still had to clear one hurdle - ratification of the cabinet
by the senate on Monday.
Morgan Stanley said that the Bank of Italy was expected to maintain its
policy and forecast that short-term rates could decline by up to 75 basis
points by the end of September.
Ahead of its results due out today, Fiat slipped L230 to L7,010, while
Fondiaria was off L880 or 5 per cent at L16,870 in reaction to Tuesday's
disappointing figures.
STOCKHOLM, which closed early ahead of today's holiday, strengthened
moderately in trading dominated by Ericsson and Volvo. The Affarsvarlden
general index added 5.4 to 1,505.1.
Turnover rose to SKr3bn from Tuesday's SKr1.6bn.
Ericsson, which disapponted analysts with its first quarter results,
announced on Tuesday, traded ex a dividend of SKr4.50 and closed the day off
SKr4.00 at Skr336.00.
Volvo jumped SKr12 to SKr732 on rising expectations ahead of its first
quarter earnings which are due next week.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Germany lowers rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank surprised the market yesterday by lowering both the discount
and Lombard rates by 50 basis points, but the move failed to help the weak
dollar, writes Philip Gawith.
The discount rate was cut to 4.5 per cent and the Lombard rate to 6 per
cent. This sparked a host of cuts in other European countries, with Italy,
Belgium, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands reducing rates. France cut
rates before the German announcement.
The rate reduction was well received in the short sterling and Euromark
futures markets. But the failure of the dollar to respond was taken by
analysts as a signal that the US currency would not recover without a
decisive tightening of policy from the Federal Reserve. The dollar declined
to a DM1.6682 close in New York.
The fall in European rates coincided with a decline in Japan's core
overnight rate, which fell to an historic low of 2 1/16 per cent amid
speculation that the Bank of Japan was trying to weaken the yen.
The Bundesbank's decision to lower rates caught the market offside. While
many thought there was at least an even chance of a cut, almost none were
predicting more than a 25 basis-point cut in official rates.
This, said analysts, added weight to the view that the German rate cut was
part of concerted central bank support for the dollar. Although the
Bundesbank said the move reflected improved inflation prospects, Mr Robin
Aspinall, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said a 50 basis-point cut could not be
explained in domestic terms alone. This suggested that the Bundesbank was
'playing to a wider audience'.
In so far as the German central bank was trying to help the dollar, it
failed. The US currency slipped steadily lower against the D-Mark. Mr
Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan, said the message to
the mar-ket was that 'the Fed is the gatekeeper to the dollar'. A 'step and
stop' Fed, with rates being moved decisively higher and then kept there, was
needed to support the dollar.
Mr Persaud said that with the Fed likely to raise rates by 50 basis points,
the prospect of a 100 basis-point swing in favour of the dollar meant 'it
would be a brave investor who bet against the dollar'.
But Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, noted that the last two
occasions when the Fed and Bundesbank moved rates in close unison, back in
1991 when US rates were falling and German rates rising, this had the
perverse effect of boosting the dollar. In the second case, said Mr Turner,
the result was to push the dollar from DM1.45 to above DM1.80 in the space
of only five months.
Mr Turner said the message was that markets punished a currency when the
central bank was perceived to be 'behind the game' on inflation. Depending
on the size of the Fed's next move, this could yet be the fate which awaits
the dollar.
The Bundesbank's move contributed to a very active day on the futures
markets. The June, September and December short sterling contracts each
traded more than 25,000 lots, while the equivalent Euromark contracts traded
50,000 to 70,000 lots.
The June short sterling contract closed at 94.69, nine basis points up from
Tuesday, while the December contract finished 12 basis points higher at
93.84.
Mr Peter Osler, economist at brokers GNI, said there was a general feeling
in the market that 'we are not going to have higher UK rates this year,
bolstered by the aggressive German easing'.
He said short sterling was continuing a 'sensible correction', prompted by a
discussion in the Bank of England's quarterly report which explained that
recent short sterling weakness was essentially a technical phenomenon,
flowing from building societies hedging their exposure to fixed rate
mortgages.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England dispatched with ease a Pounds
450m shortage. The overnight rate moved in the 3 7/8 to 4 3/4 per cent
range.
The Euromark futures also finished firmer, the June contract gaining 7 basis
points at 95.09 and the December contract up at 95.24 from 95.19.
Helped by the weak dollar, the D-Mark finished in Europe generally firmer.
Against the French franc it closed in London at FFr3.430 from FFr3.424 after
the Bank of France trimmed its intervention rate to 5.50 per cent from 5.60
per cent. It was the seventh such cut since February 24. Although the timing
surprised analysts, they said the BOF was continuing to track the German
repo.
The Spanish peseta slipped to finish at Pta82.54 against the D-Mark from
Pta82.14, after newspaper reports of another scandal potentially damaging to
the government.
Sterling traded in a fairly narrow range, closing virtually unchanged at
DM2.4911 from DM2.4907. It was buffeted back and forth by the combination of
a supportive Bank of England report, soft UK manufacturing output data, and
the larger than expected German rate cut.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: No bids for Peruvian mining
giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The drawbacks associated with Peru's huge state-owned mining and refining
concern Centromin outweigh its attractions, potential buyers decided on
Tuesday, when no bids were presented at the first attempt to auction the
company.
Centromin's privatisation committee had set a minimum price of Dollars 280m
in cash plus secondary debt paper with face value of Dollars 60m. In
addition, the buyer was to commit at least Dollars 240m in new investment to
replace run-down machinery and equipment and make basic environmental
improvements.
Although company officials claimed it was only one of several possible
deterrents, long-term pollution seems to have been what decided at least
front-runner RTZ to pull out. Centromin's central Andean mining and refining
operations - in the hands of the private, US-owned Cerro de Pasco
Corporation until 1974 - has been a notorious polluter for decades.
RTZ is reported to have sent, some six weeks ago, a long letter to
Centromin's privatisers explaining in detail why it could not bid. That
letter has not been made public but the British-based company is believed to
have balked at the open-ended litigation problems that assumption of
Centromin's 'environmental debt' might involve in the future.
That unknown factor aside, RTZ was believed to have been extremely keen to
take on the giant operation, which comprises seven production units and the
largest refining complex in South America. Annual sales of minerals top
Dollars 400m and private sector mining executives believe Centromin could be
made 'hugely profitable'.
Tuesday's flop poses a major problem for the Peruvian state. Centromin is
the life-line for almost 12,000 workers and literally hundreds of thousands
more Peruvians in the mining-dependent central Andes.
La Oroya is also the only refinery willing and able to turn the region's
typically 'dirty' minerals into a world-class product. Many smaller,
privately-owned mines in the depressed central Andean region depend on La
Oroya to turn their minerals into saleable metals and by-products.
Mines minister Mr Daniel Hokama, who also heads Copri, the government's
privatisation office, says he and Centromin officials will now reassess sale
possibilities. Potential buyers - including two Mexican companies and
UK-based Waverley Investment, all thought to be still interested - are to be
sounded out. The base price could be reduced or the debt paper element
raised.
Another alternative, previously rejected, would be to split Centromin into
smaller packages. The hydro-electric plants and the Cerro de Pasco and
Antamina mines would certainly find ready buyers. But the 'social problem'
would remain.
What nothing can be done about, at least in the short-term, is the
environmental damage, acceptable even to US companies two decades ago but,
for today's multinational corporations, the kiss of death.

FT  12 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures consolidate after
spectacular gains - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London COFFEE futures were consolidating yesterday after Tuesday's
spectacular rise. The July robustas position at the London Commodity
Exchange closed at Dollars 1,905 a tonne, down Dollars 31 on the day Dollars
45 above the day's low. 'There was a bit of a panic this morning, but it
looks as though we might consolidate here for a while,' one trader said.
COCOA prices remained under pressure but were helped later in the day by a
steadier New York market. The July contract closed at Pounds 921 a tonne,
down Pounds 9, after slipping earlier to Pounds 912.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels uncorks wine reform
plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday adopted a regulation aimed at draining
Europe's 'wine lake' once and for all, through measures to eliminate surplus
output now running at about 35m hectolitres, nearly a fifth of EU
production.
The new wine regime will inaugurate a second phase of the 1992 reform of the
common agricultural policy, from which Mediterranean products were largely
excluded.
The measures, which Brussels wants in force for the 1995-96 wine year, will
offer member states a range of financial incentives designed not only to
'grub up' or permanently abandon wine production, but to increase the
quality of wine.
Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, said yesterday 'we have to
act quickly and we have to spend a lot of money' to get the wine market back
into balance.
Without reform, he said, the EU would spend Ecu1.5bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in
1995-96, more than half of it on distilling surplus wine. The revamped
regime, he claimed, would by contrast cost Ecu1.2bn, with the bulk going on
regional programmes to support permanent structural reform.
EU wine output in 1992-93 totalled 195.5m hectolitres, against a new
reference target for output of 154m. The main countries affected would be
Italy, dropping from 68.1m in 1992-93 to 49.7m; France, from 64.9m to 51.8m;
and Spain, from 36.9m to 29.2m.
The reform offers wine producers a one-off payment of Ecu7,000 a hectare -
where the average yield is 50hl a hectare - for grubbing up vineyards.
Less radical measures, ranging from the harvesting of unripe grapes to
commercial and quality improvements in the sector, would attract smaller
amounts, co-financed by the EU budget and member states. Where quotas were
exceeded incentives would diminish proportionately.
Member states and regions within them will be able to choose how to spread
the burden and what form of production control best suits them. 'Member
states may make a regional distribution of their national reference
programme,' the Commission said, but 'they must do so in the case of regions
which submit a programme' to Brussels.
Mr Steichen refused to be drawn on whether the financial impact of the 1992
CAP reform, plus the new changes in the pipeline, will break the farm budget
in the three years from 1995 to 1997. He acknowledged that the EU was
heading for an Ecu1.3bn deficit on farm spending next year, largely as a
result of agri-monetary adjustments - costing Ecu1.8bn - to compensate
farmers for the strength of the D-Mark and Dutch guilder.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany wrestles with energy
puzzle - The problems posed by deregulation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After introducing virtual monopoly structures in eastern Germany's gas and
electricity sector, western Germany's utilities are now embarking on another
task: finding ways to protect their position against plans by the federal
government in Bonn and the European Union to deregulate the energy sector.
Yesterday the EU's working party on energy met to prepare a draft paper on
deregulation of the energy sector, which is expected to be presented on May
25. At the same time, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics ministry, is
planning to use the German presidency, starting on July 1, to open up
Germany's energy sector to more competition.
Mr Rexrodt has already outlined his proposals for the revision of energy
policy and cartel legislation. They include the abolition of voluntary
demarcation agreements and franchise agreements with utilities and local
authorities; the introduction of third party access to gas grids; and cost
transparency.
One of his aims is to make Germany more attractive to investors. But this
would also mean eventually phasing out the Kohlpfennig, a levy paid by
western German customers to the electricity companies to subsidise the coal
industry. At the moment, the Kohlpfennig subsidises German coal by about
DM200 (Pounds 80) a tonne to keep out coal imports, which cost about DM80 a
tonne. As a result electricity prices for German industry are among the
highest in Europe. Yet Mr Rexrodt, especially in an election year, cannot
scrap the Kohlpfennig, which would threaten 100,000 mining jobs.
So far, Mr Rexrodt's proposals for deregulation have been sharply criticised
by the opposition Social Democrats and the country's powerful energy sector.
Mr Martin Weyand, head of the energy department at BGW, Germany's
association for Gas and Water, says they are flawed for several reasons.
'There is no reciprocity,' he argues, adding that foreign companies would be
able to supply the German market but German suppliers would not have access
to foreign markets.
The BGW also believes that long-term supply contracts with high take-or-pay
obligations would be replaced by short-term contracts, which would not
guarantee secure supplies. It argues too that the obligation to connect
customers and guarantee supply would no longer be met. And finally, the BGW
says it is not clear how private investors, who built the grids in the first
place, would be compensated for the use of their property and services.
Yet the BGW and the German utilities, including RWE and PreussenElektra,
recognise that the debate over de-regulation of the energy sector is now
firmly on the agenda in Bonn, and in Brussels. The question is how the
utilities will be able to maintain a position giving them exclusive
demarcation rights on distribution and supply.
'The Rexrodt paper could backfire,' says one energy expert. 'If a company
wanted to switch to another electricity supplier, in most cases the new
supplier would have to supply through the network owned by the regional
distributor and original supplier. The fees would be high. The company might
end up even paying more.'
Yet recent examples in eastern Germany have shown that foreign competitors
can co-exist with domestic distributors without disrupting supplies, and at
the same time give the consumer more price flexibility.
A case in point is the Anglo-American consortium headed by Britain's
PowerGen and NRG of the US, which recently bought a 44 per cent stake in a
power generating plant owned by VKR, a subsidiary of PreussenElektra in
Schkopau, near Leipzig. Another example is Wintershall, the gas division of
BASF, the chemicals group, which is investing DM5bn in building new
pipelines across Germany.
'We are in here for the long term,' says Mr Herbert Detharding, chairman of
Wintershall. 'We are slowly denting the monopoly and introducing
competition. And everybody knows there's room for competition in this
country.' But Germany's established utilities still don't see the reason to
compete. 'If we have to compete, then make the playing fields level. But why
change the system when the present one works.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Resumed bull run pushes copper
price above Dollars 2,100
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The copper market's bull run got back into gear yesterday, lifting the three
months delivery price at the London Metal Exchange above Dollars 2,100 a
tonne, for the first time in 13 months.
Tuesday afternoon's shake-out continued in early trading, with the three
months price dipping Dollars 15 to Dollars 1,957 a tonne. But then the
recent heavy speculative buying was resumed and the price quickly climbed to
Dollars 2,117. The move was helped by continued tightness of nearby
supplies, which was reflected in the elimination of the discount, or
'contango', on nearby positions. At the close of the afternoon ring the cash
price had moved to a 50 cents premium over that for delivery in three
months; and the three months position's premium over December 1995 had
widened to Dollars 50 from Dollars 25 on Tuesday.
By the end of after hours 'kerb' trading the three months price had been
trimmed by profit-taking to Dollars 2,109 a tonne, but that still
represented a gain of Dollars 36 on the day.
Dealers remained convinced, however, that a sizeable downward correction was
overdue following an almost uninterrupted upward run of nearly Dollars 200
over the past two weeks.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate cuts spark rallies across
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank cut its key interest rates by a generous 50 basis points,
prompting a wave of interest rate cuts across the continent by other
European central banks and triggering rallies in the European government
bond markets.
The German central bank lowered its discount rate, which provides the
effective floor for money market rates, to 4.5 per cent from 5.0 per cent
while the Lombard rate was cut from 6.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent.
The central banks of France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and
Denmark all eased interest rates during the day, sparking gains particularly
among shorter-dated issues with the result that many of the European yield
curves steepened.
But while bond markets rallied initially, profit-taking later eradicated
some of the gains, and towards the end of the session, dealers noted that
European markets were once again focusing on the US Treasury bond market,
awaiting a move by the US Federal Reserve.
German government bonds ended the day mixed with the short and ultra-long
dated issues closing higher on the day, while 10-year bonds were either
unchanged or slightly lower. The bund market rallied ahead of the Bundesbank
council meeting, then dropped back on profit-taking before recovering again
in the afternoon.
The Liffe June bund future contract ended down 0.04 at 95.02 while the DTB's
June medium-dated Bobl future ended up 0.17 at 100.50.
The Bank of France cut its intervention rate by 10 basis points to 5.5 per
cent first thing yesterday morning, following Tuesday's cut in the German
repo rate and pre-empting the Bundesbank's discount and Lombard cuts.
French government bonds rallied, and dealers said the market could now
expect to see a further snip in the intervention rate early next week. The
Matif's notional bond futures contract settled up 0.50 at 120.20.
Italian government bonds opened on a firm note, pleased with the
announcement of the new cabinet on Tuesday evening and more significantly
with yesterday's half-point cut in the discount rate from 7.5 per cent to
7.0 per cent.
Short-dated issues showed the strongest gains while the Liffe BTP future
ended down 0.20 at 111.85 after profit-taking by traders and investors.
Of all the European markets, Spain continued to under-perform as political
worries and scandals dogged the bond market. The bond futures contract ended
half a point lower, and analysts predicted that the shake-out was likely to
be prolonged.
The gilt market closed firmer as the market kicked off on a strong note, and
then made further gains on the back of the interest rate cuts in Europe. As
on the continent, the short-dated issues were the main beneficiaries,
gaining  3/8 of a point on the day.
Japanese government bond prices rallied as money market interest rates
declined further and the bond market saw strong domestic demand.
The overnight call rate fell to a historic low of 2 1/16 per cent,
encouraging talk in the market of an official discount rate cut. The JGB
futures contract opened at 112.60 and reached a high of 113.06, ending Tokyo
trading at 112.95 and trading at 113.00 in London.
US Treasuries continued their rollercoaster ride, falling sharply following
a disappointing 10-year note auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 7/32 at 84
3/32 , to yield 7.607 per cent. Prices were also weaker at the short end of
the market, where the two-year note was down  1/8 at 98 23/32 , yielding
6.184 per cent.
At the opening of trading, the market was temporarily lifted by a higher
dollar, which rose after the Bundesbank cut German interest rates by 50
basis points. Prices at the long end eased later in the morning, however, as
traders and investors struggled to digest the implications of the
Bundesbank's action.
Some analysts said the cut, designed to aid the struggling German economy,
would take the pressure off the need for the Federal Reserve to raise US
interest rates to support the ailing dollar, while others argued that a rate
increase from the Fed was still likely because of the need to slow the US
economy.
Later in the day, prices began to drop quickly after the sale of Dollars
12bn in new 10-year notes was poorly received in the market.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange yesterday announced it is forming a new
market that will allow investors to customise currency options contracts to
their particular needs.
The PHILX, the world's busiest exchange-based market for currency options,
is hoping that its new forum - called the United Currency Options Market -
will bridge the gap between listed currency options markets and the much
larger over-the-counter options market.
The bulk of the currency options business is conducted away from exchanges
where banks and securities firms design contracts to customers'
specifications. The UCOM is the PHILX's attempt to win some of that business
from the over-the-counter market.
The PHILX described the UCOM as a 'flexible trading environment' that will
allow users to employ tailor-made trading and hedging tools in a regulated
environment.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: India takes tough line on
companies seeking capital
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India yesterday announced tough new guidelines for Indian companies tapping
the international capital markets in an effort to channel funds into
priority areas such as power, high technology and industrial modernisation.
The guidelines codify and extend ad hoc decisions the finance ministry has
made since Indian companies were first permitted to launch international
issues in late 1992 as part of economic reforms.
In the most significant measure, the ministry will permit companies to
borrow only for three specific purposes - the financing of capital goods
imports, the financing of domestic plant purchases and its installation, and
the repayment of earlier foreign loans.
Companies will therefore not be allowed to raise money simply to increase
cash holdings or to repay domestic borrowings, as some companies which have
raised funds in the past 18 months have done.
The ministry has been concerned about reports of companies using the
proceeds of Euroissues to invest in the domestic stock market. Companies
will be permitted to retain Euroissue proceeds abroad only for specific
purposes.
Companies in low-priority industries such as consumer goods and financial
services will need Foreign Investment Promotion Board approval for
Euroissues. Companies in power and other high-priority sectors will not
require such approval.
To avoid increasing India's external debts, companies will not normally be
permitted to issue convertible bonds unless the proceeds are used to
restructure existing debts.
Companies will be permitted only one issue for every financial year and the
large groupings which dominate Indian industry will be allowed only two
issues per grouping. There will also be a minimum gap of 12 months between
two issues by the same company.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Bonds: EIB launches L300bn offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweeping interest rate cuts across Europe encouraged several top-quality
borrowers to tap the international bond market in a variety of currencies
yesterday.
The European Investment Bank launched its expected Eurolira offering,
raising L300bn through 10-year Eurobonds callable at par after five years.
Joint lead manager Credito Italiano said the bonds sold quickly to domestic
retail investors. When they were freed to trade, the bonds were quoted at
98.80, 20 basis points within fees.
SNCF, the French state railway, also tapped the Eurolira sector but
syndicate managers said its deal proved less popular because of the 12-year
maturity, even though the bonds are callable at par after five years and
annually thereafter. In the late afternoon, the bonds were trading at 98.80,
10 basis points within fees.
Credito Italiano said persistent demand from Italian investors for callable
bonds was likely to attract more borrowers to raise funds through this type
of instrument.
After absorbing a steady flow of issues in recent days, the Euroyen sector
saw a Y50bn offering of five-year bonds from Baden Wurttemberg L-Finance, a
financing subsidiary of Germany's L-Bank. Lead manager Merrill Lynch said
the deal met good demand from European, US and Japanese investors.
Exim Bank became the first Japanese government-guaranteed issuer to do a
fungible transaction when it raised Y30bn by reopening its outstanding Y75bn
offering of 10-year Eurobonds launched last September. Lead manager Nomura
said half the bonds went to investors in non-Japan Asia and the rest to
European investors.
Sweden also reopened its benchmark Dollars 2bn offering of Eurobonds due
December 1995 to raise a further Dollars 500m. Lead manager J. P. Morgan
said the maturity of the bonds coincided with that of a large
Ecu-denominated syndicated loan which Sweden took out in 1992 and which it
was in the process of repaying.
KfW, Germany's triple-A rated reconstruction agency, issued CDollars 150m of
5 1/2 -year bonds which lead manager ABN Amro said were largely targeted at
continental European retail investors who are likely to want to roll over
their Canadian dollar bonds when they mature. Redemptions are likely to be
particularly heavy in June.
However, other syndicate managers said the pricing of the bonds should have
been at least five basis points wider and added that the timing was poor,
coming before today's Ascension Day holiday which will close many parts of
continental Europe until Monday.
Few new issues are expected today or tomorrow due to the holiday. Up to 40
syndicate managers are also due to fly to Marbella tomorrow for a weekend of
golf and tennis, organised by Lehman Brothers.
The Province of British Columbia yesterday signed a Dollars 2bn
multi-currency Euro-debt issuance programme arranged by Lehman Brothers.
Notes to be issued have been rated double-A one by Moody's and double-A plus
by Standard &amp; Poor's.

<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and insurance group, has dropped the idea of
raising its stake in ITC, its Indian affiliate, from 31.5 to 51 per cent,
which would make it a BAT subsidiary.
Instead, BAT will support ITC in its aim of becoming an Indian
multinational.
During a recent visit to London, Mr K. L. Chugh, ITC chairman, received an
assurance from BAT that the UK group would maintain its stake at 31.5 per
cent.
The assurance appears to be the central element of an agreement designed to
defuse tensions between BAT and ITC. Managers in the Indian group had feared
that after many years of independence, their freedom might be curbed by a
re-imposition of control from London.
BAT also seems to have taken account of concerns in the Indian government
that a leading Indian company with the potential to become a multinational
should lose some of its independence.
'Discussions are at an early stage', BAT said. 'What we are trying to do is
look for a way that helps ITC develop as an Indian multinational, but helps
us develop our interests in tobacco and financial services in India'.
Increasing its stakes in the financial services businesses would be an
obvious first step for BAT. The negotiations are being handled personally by
Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive.
ITC Classic, an ITC affiliate, has applied for a licence to start a banking
business. ITC is also seeking to break into insurance through an independent
company, as soon as participation of the private sector in insurance is
allowed.
'BAT is most welcome to have as much shareholding in the bank and insurance
companies as it wants,' said Mr Chugh.
Mr Chugh also said he had an assurance from BAT that it would add value to
ITC's tobacco and financial services businesses which are BAT's core
activities.
At the same time, ITC, which has a significant presence in paper,
agri-business, hotels and global trading, will develop these areas further.
According to Mr Chugh, ITC Bhadrachalam and ITC Hotels, the two group
companies, will be making Euroissues of Dollars 50m each to develop further
the paper and hotel businesses.
While BAT has agreed to maintain the status quo, ITC will not be adding any
new business to its already large portfolio.
Mr Chugh said: 'Our objective is to become a multinational company. We are
happy that BAT is supportive of our ambition. Dr Manmohan Singh (Indian
finance minister) wants 100 multinationals by the turn of the century. We
want to be among the first.'

<TEXT>
Aoyama Trading, the Japanese men's apparel retailer, reported record profits
for the year ended last March after expanding its sales network.
The company, which started the discount boom in men's suits, said
non-consolidated pre-tax profits rose 1.6 per cent to Y30.68bn (Dollars
298m), on a 20.8 per cent rise in sales to Y182.3bn. After-tax profits rose
4.1 per cent to Y15.9bn. The annual dividend will rise by Y10 to Y40.
In spite of the record figure, it was the first time since 1987 that Aoyama
had seen only single-digit profit growth. Increasing competition and
saturation of the discount men's suit market has affected business.

South African Breweries, the country's largest consumer industries company,
increased attributable earnings by 14 per cent to R943m (Dollars 190.5m)
from R825m in the year to March.
A solid performance from the group's beer interests, which together make SAB
the seventh largest brewing company in the world, provided most of the
profit. Net earnings were R707m, an improvement of 14 per cent over last
year's figure of R541m.
The group's other large industries, including retail group Edgars and
industrial interests Lion Match and Plate Glass Shatterprufe Industries,
contributed R236m to attributable earnings, a rise of 15 per cent on last
year.
Turnover increased to R25.45bn, a rise of 12 per cent from last year's
R21.78bn. A final dividend of 116 cents was announced, bringing the full
year dividend to 155 cents, a rise of 13 per cent.
Cash utilised in expanding operations and net acquisitions rose to R921m
from R574m, reflecting the company's growing operations in Hungary and
Tanzania.
Mr Malcolm Wyman, group corporate finance director, said SAB would continue
to investigate offshore expansion in 'mass market developing countries'
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Europe.
A decline in net working capital of R230m compared with last year's increase
of R17m, but Mr Wyman said this was largely a result of last year's very
favourable year end position and was unlikely to be repeated.
Mr Wyman said that continued weak consumer spending, combined with
widespread pre-election violence, had dampened growth over the past year,
but that SAB was confident, given the success of the elections and the new
economic upturn, further real growth in earnings and dividends would be
achieved over the next year.
He pointed to a record R1.9bn in investment spending as a good indication of
the company's commitment to local development and said that a further R2bn
had already been allocated for the next financial year.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Parker &amp; Parsley bids for Bridge
Oil
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texas-based oil independent which last year acquired
Prudential Securities' troubled energy partnerships in the US, yesterday
launched an uninvited ADollars 294m (USDollars 211.5m) bid for Bridge Oil,
the Sydney-based oil and gas company.
P&amp;P said it would offer 70 cents a share in cash for Bridge. It claimed that
this was a 'fair price', representing a 35 per cent premium over the 30-day
average trading price for Bridge shares before P&amp;P started to amass a stake
in late April.
P&amp;P said yesterday that its stake now amounted to 4.2 per cent of its
target's equity.
Bridge issued a brief statement, advising investors not to sell their
shares, and promising further advice later.
Earlier this month, Mr Robert Strauss, Bridge's chairman, told shareholders
at the annual meeting that 'recognition of (the) proper value' of Bridge's
US operations would take the group's net asset backing to more than ADollars
1 a share.
Some analysts suggested that the current price offered for Bridge shares was
likely to be an opening shot.
However, P&amp;P's chairman, Mr Scott Sheffield, maintained yesterday that: 'It
is our intention that this is a final price - we have no intention of
increasing our offer.' Bridge shares closed at 72 cents in Sydney.
Bridge's exploration and production operations are split between Australia
and south-east Asia, and the US - with the Australian activities centred on
the Cooper, Surat and Carnavon Basins, and the US interests spanning five
states.
Bridge had planned to float its US business on the stock market there at the
beginning of this year, but temporarily abandoned the plan because of weak
crude oil prices. It has said the scheme would be re-examined later this
year.
Net profits in 1993 fell from ADollars 39.4m to ADollars 27.6m.
Parker &amp; Parsley, meanwhile, has been growing rapidly through acquisitions -
often of troubled assets - during the past seven years. However, the bid for
Bridge represents its first major move outside the US.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: President of Sanyo Securities to
step down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sanyo Securities, the financially-troubled Japanese broker, yesterday said
Mr Yoichi Tsuchiya, president, was likely to step down next month to take an
advisory post.
The move comes as the broker is struggling to finalise its restructuring
programme with its creditor banks and Nomura Securities, its largest
shareholder, due to mounting debts and bad loans held by the broker's
non-bank financial affiliates.
While the company denied that Mr Tsuchiya, the thrust behind Sanyo's
aggressive expansion during the late 1980s, was resigning to take
responsibility for the financial problems, its creditors and shareholders
had anticipated such a move.
The burst of the asset 'bubble' in the 1980s led to mounting bad loans at
Sanyo's financial subsidiaries, and it had to borrow large amounts. After
months of negotiations with its leading creditors - Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa
Bank, Nippon Credit Bank and Nomura - officials were forced last March to
announce a restructuring plan.
The plan, expected to be finalised in the next few weeks, includes an Y80bn
(Dollars 769m) write-off over the next nine years, a reduction of interest
rates from its main creditors to 1.25 per cent, and a third-party share
allotment of Y20bn to the three creditors and Nomura.

<TEXT>
Japan's fire and marine insurance groups, faced with higher insurance
payments due to an increase in typhoon damages, are likely to raise fire
insurance premiums this year. It will be the first increase in this sector
since 1948.
The Fire and Marine Insurance Rating Association of Japan, an insurance
industry group, has applied for finance ministry approval to raise fire
insurance premiums by an average 7.74 per cent for houses and 5.86 per cent
for offices.
After the spate of typhoons in 1991, insurance payments rose three-fold to
Y650bn (Dollars 6.3bn).

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Sydney to trade share futures
 -Contracts on NAB, News Corp and BHP offered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual share futures will start trading on the Sydney Futures Exchange
on Monday, following a decision yesterday by Mr Michael Lavarch, Australia's
attorney-general.
The SFE will be the first significant futures market to trade futures
contracts on individual stocks - in this case, National Australia Bank
(NAB), Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and Broken Hill Proprietary,
the steel and resources group.
At present, the only existing individual share futures involve a handful of
Swedish stocks which are traded in London. Such contracts are specifically
prohibited in the US, largely because of price manipulation concerns.
But even in Australia, the SFE's move is not without controversy. Some of
the companies, whose equity is involved in the new contracts, are expressing
reservations about the scheme, and a local war is brewing between the SFE
and the Australian Stock Exchange over who should run this type of
derivatives market.
Stung by the SFE's move, the ASX says it plans to announce its own
equity-derivatives initiative next week - and that, unlike the SFE, it is
considering a product which could be settled into scrip, not cash. This
would mean an investor could acquire the underlying physical stock via the
futures market, something which the SFE contract structure specifically
rules out.
The shares involved in the SFE contracts belong to the nation's three
largest quoted companies in terms of market capitalisation, and are among
the most actively traded on the physical market.
The SFE claims that the new contracts will provide professional investors
with a convenient, low-cost means of gaining exposure to Australia's
benchmark stocks, as well as increasing trading opportunities through the
leverage involved in share futures.
It points out that brokerage costs will be significantly lower for the same
underlying bundle of shares, and that the futures can be traded for 18 hours
a day - well into US and European time-zones, when when the ASX is closed.
If all goes well, the SFE adds that a range of other stocks could be
introduced in the near future. However, Mr Les Hosking, SFE chief executive,
suggests that liquidity considerations will probably limit the eventual
number to around ten. Western Mining Corporation, whose shares tend to be
influenced by metal price movements, is a favoured early possibility.
But not all companies are keen on the new moves. BHP, for example,
acknowledges that the cash settlement arrangements mean that the new
contracts do not pose takeover-related concerns. However, the resource group
points out that its own investor relations efforts are directed at
attracting an informed shareholder base, and says that the future contracts
'won't do us a lot of good'.
While reluctant to invoke the 'market manipulation' spectre, BHP cites two
potential problems.
First, there is the potential increase in the volatility of BHP shares
(assuming the futures contracts are well-used) and the difficulty of
explaining share price movements to management and shareholders.
Second, some professional investors may prefer a leveraged play on the BHP
share price via the futures market, and be less likely to support the
physical stock. That said, the company acknowledges that many futures
strategies will also require some ownership of the underlying stock.
If companies have qualms, the ASX is even more doubtful. In the 1980s,
before the country's regional exchanges were melded into one national
entity, the Melbourne exchange introduced equity futures. Traded on the
Australian Financial Futures Market, these also involved cash settlement,
but eventually the AFFM petered out.
Now the ASX's derivatives division faces the galling sight of the SFE
stealing the march. In riposte, it says its competing initiative will have
some significantly differences - notably in terms of clearing arrangements,
and offering settlement into scrip rather than cash. 'The product we are
looking at would have the potential for delivery of the underlying
security,' the ASX says.
Finally, there is the question of how much interest will be shown by the
investment community generally in the new products. Mr Hosking says the
SFE's marketing efforts have had a good reception, and claims 'strong
interest' from London.
BHP has found considerable diversity in its shareholders' views. Regulators,
meanwhile, are watching with some scepticism - perhaps hopeful that the new
contracts will not put their mettle to the test.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Federated Stores 48% ahead

<TEXT>
Federated Department Stores, the US retailer trying to gain control of the
bankrupt R. H. Macy group, yesterday reported a 48 per cent jump in net
profits from Dollars 21.7m before extraordinary items to Dollars 32.2m for
the first quarter, ended April.
Some of the rise came from a 4 per cent increase in sales from Dollars
1.59bn to Dollars 1.65bn, but most resulted from efficiency improvements.
Selling, general and administrative expenses fell from 34.9 per cent of
sales last time to 32.8 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 17 cents before extraordinary items to 25
cents.
Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said the
profits increase was largely due to progress in reducing expenses, derived
in part from investments in technology that had brought improvements in
productivity.
'We are pleased with our ability to continue to get more productivity out of
the business, which is integral to our efforts to drive sales by offering
better assortments, selections and value to our customers,' Mr Questrom
said.
Federated operates 220 stores in the US. including the Bloomingdale's and
Abraham &amp; Strauss (A&amp;S) chains. It believes a takeover of rival R. H. Macy
would provide long-term profits growth because merging the two empires would
provide opportunities for productivity gains.
R. H. Macy is currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and Federated
has filed a rescue plan that would give it control of the company. But its
plan has to compete with others submitted by Macy's existing management and
the official bondholders' committee, and it is not yet clear which will
succeed.
Mr Cyrus Vance, the court-appointed mediator between Macy's creditors and
those putting forward the rescue plans, is holding discussions between the
parties in the hope of lining up support for a single reorganisation plan
that can then be put to a vote.

A new international fund which aims to raise up to Dollars 100m for
investment in Vietnam will be launched at a Japan roadshow next week before
being offered to investors in the US and Europe, the managers said
yesterday.
The management company of the Vietnam Frontier Fund, which is to be listed
in Dublin, is 70 per cent controlled by Finansa Thai, a Bangkok-based
merchant banking group, 20 per cent by stockbrokers HG Asia, and 10 per cent
by NX Oanh Associates of Vietnam.
Among the directors are Mr William Colby, former head of the US Central
Intelligence Agency, and Mr Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a former minister in the South
Vietnamese regime and adviser to the present Vietnamese communist
government.
If successful, the new 10-year fund will be the fourth such group targeting
Vietnam; the other three have raised some Dollars 170m, but finding viable
investments in Vietnam has proved a slow process and investors in the latest
fund will pay out only 50 per cent of their commitment at the start.
The fund, which is to be marketed by Nomura in Japan and by HG Asia
elsewhere in the world, will invest in Vietnamese property,industrial,
mining, infrastructural and other projects.

<TEXT>
Valmet, the Finnish paper machinery and engineering group, yesterday
announced plans for an international offering of up to 7m new shares.
The move, which could raise around FM700m (Dollars 129.6m), continues the
government's privatisation programme and would cut state ownership in the
group from 73 to 61 per cent.
The size of the issue and pricing will be finalised after an international
roadshow later this month. If demand exceeds 7m shares, the state has agreed
to sell 1m Valmet shares, reducing its holding further to 59 per cent. The
shares have recently been trading at FM100.
Valmet is one of the world's leading suppliers of paper machinery. Last year
profits after financial items amounted to FM100m on sales of FM10.7bn. A
further improvement is expected this year.
Valmet's share capital will rise to FM851m from FM711m if the share offer is
fully subscribed. Merrill Lynch International is global co-ordinator to the
offering and Mandatum &amp; Co is domestic lead manager.

America Online, a fast-growing US provider of telecommunications-based

Communications, a privately-owned multimedia services company, for around
Dollars 28m in stock.
Mr Steve Case, president of America Online, said modem-based on-line
services and CD-Rom based multimedia were both growing rapidly, but so far
they had been separate. As a result, on-line services were unexciting and
CD-Rom titles were not connected to a telecommunications network.
'The combination of America Online and Redgate enables us to create hybrid
offerings that marry the best attributes of each,' he added.
Redgate is based in Vero Beach, Florida, employs around 100 and had 1993
revenues of around Dollars 13m. Its shareholders will receive 444,184 shares
of America Online stock, which closed last night at Dollars 64, down Dollars

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Southwest Air stays cool in
ticket war - Three of the top four US reservation systems have said they
will no longer handle bookings for the airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year Southwest Airlines was the most profitable airline in the US. In
the first quarter of the current year, it looked like staying that way: net
profits shot up 68 per cent to Dollars 41m. But has its luck turned?
In the last few days, three of the four computer reservation systems that
dominate airline ticketing in the US have announced that they will no longer
handle Southwest bookings. Investors fear passengers will give up trying to
buy Southwest tickets and turn to competing airlines instead. The shares
have lost about 10 per cent of their value over the past week.
At first sight, the incident looks like a nasty case of bullying. Southwest
has grown big and successful by offering ultra-low air fares, heavily
undercutting its competitors on short-haul routes.
It is surely no coincidence that the reservation systems now ejecting
Southwest are owned, or at least part-owned, by its rivals.
System One is owned by Continental Airlines; Apollo is owned by Galileo, a
consortium of 11 carriers including United Airlines and USAir; and Worldspan
is owned by a consortium of four companies including Northwest Airlines,
Delta Air Lines and Trans World Airlines.
Yet the reservation companies have a point. Other airlines pay them a fee of
Dollars 2.50 per ticket for using their computer booking systems. Southwest,
as part of its policy of paring costs to the bone, has steadfastly declined
to make any contribution. The reservation companies say it is time to end
the freeloading.
Southwest's argument is simple: it says it does not pay the reservation
companies because it never asked to join their systems in the first place.
They only started including Southwest's flights to help promote their
systems to US travel agents. So although both sides may be irritated over
the course of events, neither side seems to have been wronged.
But will Southwest be hurt by the outcome? Perhaps not as badly as the stock
market fears. Although more than 80 per cent of airline tickets in the US
are sold through computer reservation systems, only 55 per cent of
Southwest's are sold in this way: and a large proportion of those are sold
through American Airline's Sabre computer reservation system, the one system
to which Southwest subscribes.
As for the rest, Southwest's consolation is that travel agents do not need
computer reservation systems to make airline bookings: they can look up the
schedule in a timetable, make a reservation over the telephone, and write
out a ticket by hand.
A potential difficulty is that, because travel agents make their money by
charging a 10 per cent commission on tickets sold, their rake-off on a
Southwest ticket is much smaller than it would be on a higher-priced ticket.
If the work has to be done manually, it is unlikely that they will be able
to cover their costs.
Yet travel agents dare not stop issuing Southwest tickets because the
airline's low fares are so popular. Faced with the choice of losing
customers to rivals still offering Southwest tickets, most agents will feel
compelled to keep offering Southwest's tickets whatever the cost. Oddly,
then, they rather than Southwest are in danger of emerging as the real
losers.
Southwest has taken some steps to ease the agents' plight. It is equipping
its busiest agents with personal computers and ticket printers hooked up to
its internal reservation system. It says it is studying other technological
solutions to the problem, the details of which it refuses to discuss.
Meanwhile, it has set up a telephone hotline that passengers can use to
order tickets by mail. It says ticket sales have not missed a beat since the
affair began.
But this is not likely to be the end of the matter. American Airlines' Sabre
system is already reported to have started trying to poach the other
systems' customers. The travel agents are furious and pressing for some sort
of accommodation.
Meanwhile, many in the industry are asking why anybody should need a ticket
to fly in any case, given that a confirmation number is all that is needed
to rent a car or book a hotel room.

<TEXT>
The world of public relations and corporate sponsored videos is joining the
multimedia revolution. Medialink, the international video public relations
company and the Multimedia Division of Dow Jones will announce today plans
to deliver sponsored videos to the desktop computers of professional
investors.
Under the deal, business organisations will be able to transmit information
on new products, corporate announcements or annual meetings to subscribers
of the new Dow Jones Investor Network.
The video network launched last September is aimed mainly at research
analysts and portfolio managers and according to Dow Jones is already
available to 'more than 300 professionals'.
Reuters, the news and information group is launching a similar service in
Europe next month aimed at the foreign exchange and debt markets.
Like the Reuters service, the Dow Jones Network only offers a burst of video
when there are events that are potential market movers.
Medialink is paying Dow Jones Investor Network to broadcast its video
information, subject to the normal rules of decency and legality.
'This is a way for companies to get specific messages to the investment
community without any outside editorial control,' said Mr Simon Langdon,
director of business operations for the DJIN.
The president of Medialink, Mr Laurence Moskowitz, yesterday described the
exclusive deal as 'an historic event for the public relations and investor
relations industries.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Taiwan group files actions
against Intel chip patent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
United Microelectronics, a Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer backed by
the Taiwan government, has filed actions in Taiwan and France disputing a
critical microprocessor patent held by Intel, the world's largest chip maker
and the dominant supplier of microprocessors to the personal computer
industry.
The UMC actions coincide with the long-delayed introduction by the Taiwanese
company of a 'clone' of one of Intel's top-selling microprocessors, the
Intel 486.
Intel makes about 80 per cent of microprocessors that go into PCs and has
vigorously defended its property rights against other chip makers.
Facing a likely legal challenge from Intel, UMC took pre-emptive action,
said Robert Tsao, UMC chairman, applying in France and Taiwan to have one of
Intel's patents invalidated in those countries.
Mr Tsao said UMC intends to file similar actions in other countries.
'Anywhere they have 338 patent registered, we will invalidate it,' he said.
Intel officials in the US said they have had no official contact with UMC.
But the US company plans to obtain samples of the UMC chips and will analyse
them to determine if there is any infringement of patents or trade secrets.
Intel said it has broad international patent protection on its
microprocessors and that UMC is not licensed to use any Intel technology.
In interviews last September, UMC officials said they would not sell in the
US market when they introduced their microprocessor chip, in order to avoid
legal challenges from Intel.
The primary target of UMC's efforts is Taiwan's large personal computer
'motherboard' industry. Dozens of Taiwanese companies produce the main
circuit boards that go inside personal computers for US and European
computer companies.
The UMC chip, called the U5S 'Green Chip', is a relatively slow version of a
486 microprocessor, suitable for low-end personal computers. UMC said that
it expects sales of its new chip to reach TDollars 800m (Dollars 30m) this
year and TDollars 2bn next year.

Credit Lyonnais yesterday announced that Mr Francois Gille would relinquish
his duties as one of its two managing directors to focus on the bank's legal
problems over a Swiss bankruptcy inquiry into Sasea.
The Swiss group is a holding used by Italian clients of the state-owned
Credit Lyonnais to buy MGM, the Hollywood studio.
A Swiss magistrate has singled out Mr Gille - together with Mr Jean-Yves
Haberer who ran up huge losses as Credit Lyonnais's president in 1988-93 -
in his inquiry into whether the French bank was partly to blame for the
Sasea bankruptcy.
But Mr Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais' new president, made clear that Mr
Gille was neither being pushed aside nor was to blame for the 'origin' of
the bank's Sasea/MGM problems.
When he announced Credit Lyonnais' radical restructuring last month, Mr
Peyrelevade shielded Mr Gille from press questions about the latter's
responsibility under Mr regime. A parliamentary inquiry into Credit Lyonnais
is due to start this month.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank refuses to exonerate
lenders to Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank has refused to exonerate formally the directors of the
mortgage banking subsidiary which conducted the bulk of its lending to the
Jurgen Schneider property group. Schneider collapsed last month with debts
of more than DM5bn (Dollars 2.1bn), owing DM1.16bn to Deutsche Bank alone.
The process of what, under German law, is known as 'entlastung' - approval
or exoneration of individual directors - is normally a formality by which
shareholders signal their approval for the conduct of directors during the
previous year. It is only under extreme circumstances that approval is not
granted.
Deutsche Bank, which owns more than 90 per cent of the shares in Deutsche
Centralbodenkreditbank, a mortgage subsidiary which lent DM998m to
Schneider, said yesterday it was inappropriate to grant approval to board
directors while investigations into the bank's role in the Schneider affair
were continuing.
The bank is subject to three separate investigations to assess how it came
to be allegedly defrauded by Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property entrepreneur
who fled Germany last month and is believed to have taken hundreds of
millions of D-Marks from his company's resources.
A warrant has been issued for Mr Schneider's arrest, but his whereabouts are
unknown.
One external investigation is being carried out by the BAK, the federal
banking authority. It is examining the lending procedures of Deutsche and
other German banks which lent money to the Schneider group.
Separately, Deutsche's credit department is conducting its own internal
investigation into the lending, and the bank has employed a firm of
chartered accountants to conduct an independent enquiry.
The refusal to grant approval to Centralbodenkredit directors affects both
the subsidiary's management and boards.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Standing tall in a mini-market -
Retailer Fotex is hard to ignore in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fotex, Hungary's biggest retail group, will next week begin drawing on cash
from eastern Europe's largest international equity offering.
With investor enthusiasm for emerging markets dampened, the company and CS
First Boston, its advisers, could only raise Dollars 70m, Dollars 30m short
of the planned sum. This is, nevertheless, sufficient to fuel Fotex's rapid
expansion for up to two years.
Fotex, a home-grown private enterprise, retails household goods, cosmetics,
furniture, optical products and photographic services. The capital increase
will finance its entry into yet another segment.
The group has agreed to pay Dollars 30m to acquire 99.5 per cent of
Keravill, Hungary's largest consumer electronics and appliance chain. Fotex
is also making a tentative expansion of its its cash-and-carry DAK chain,
with a plan to increase the number of stores from 11 to 40, at a cost of up
to Dollars 15m.
Acquisitions like that of Keravill, and organic growth, are expected to
double turnover and net profits, which in 1993 were Ft15.8bn (Dollars 154m)
and Ft945m respectively. By international standards, it is not much, but
Fotex will account for some 4 per cent of non-food retail sales in Hungary
this year.
The domination by one conglomerate in five retail segments would run into
problems in a western economy. However, Mr Gabor Varszegi, chief executive
and principal shareholder of Fotex, plays down his strength in the
marketplace. But he does admit, with more than a touch of pride: 'At the end
of the day, if Max Factor and Revlon want to be successful (in Hungary) they
have to deal with us.'
Fotex's growth, however, raises the question: how long before the group
bumps its head against the ceiling?
Hungary's competition office can stop acquisitions with potential to give a
combined market share of 30 per cent or more. However, the monopoly watchdog
has proved toothless. Fotex's latest prospectus to investors says the
competition office has, legally, left it too late to challenge any of the
group's acquisitions.
In any case, there remain virgin retail sectors for Fotex to breach. Mr
Varszegi expects turnover of Ft10bn over three years from its role as
exclusive distributor of mobile telecommunications services provided by
Westel 900, the joint venture with US West, the regional Bell operating
company.
Fotex is thinking of introducing non-perishable food to its DAK stores, and
Mr Varszegi also mentions stationery as another retail possibility.
The privatisation authorities may be increasingly reluctant to feed Fotex's
retail weight, but plenty of other openings for acquisition remain.
Excessive reliance on debt financing and economic recession have combined to
put many private companies into receivership, and on to the market.
And Mr Varszegi is a natural stop for sellers. 'You wouldn't believe some of
the things that he's been offered,' says an investment banker close to the
group.
Fotex has edged out of retailing to acquire manufacturers and wholesalers
with the aim of vertical integration. The group has, for instance, taken
over Balaton Butorgyar, a furniture producer, to ensure security of supply
for Domus, Fotex's chain of furniture stores.
However, diversification has its limits. Institutional investors hold most
of the 76 per cent of Fotex not in Mr Varszegi's hands, and they constantly
advertise the virtues of focus. Mr Varszegi, who is widely believed to be
eastern Europe's richest individual, has invested in property, a brokerage
house and other areas. But this dabbling has gone, not through Fotex, but
via his private Panama-registered company, Blackburn International.
Although expansion into neighbouring countries would be one outlet for Mr
Varszegi's acquisitive drive, the Fotex chief executive says he has
investigated the possibilities and remains sceptical. '(The rest of) eastern
Europe is underdeveloped compared with Hungary. Fotex is too sophisticated a
company.'
He makes an exception for the Czech Republic, but says the policy of
privatising retail outlets one by one has complicated matters. He believes
it will be between five and eight years before other eastern European
countries are sufficiently well-regulated to allow a serious commitment.
Even if Fotex is cramped in Hungary, economic recovery offers room for
growth. Fotex has prospered in spite of a four-year recession that has
driven gross domestic product down by more than 20 per cent. The group is
now better-placed than anyone to benefit from a revival in Hungarian
consumer spending, says an investment banker.
He compares Mr Varszegi to the retail entrepreneurs who rose on the back of
the UK's consumer spending expansion in the 1980s. Most failed when boom
turned to bust. Mr Varszegi must hope that the parallel does not extend so
far.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Investors clear way for Finnish
pulp mill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finland's Metsa-Rauma yesterday gave the go-ahead for the construction of a
FM3bn (Dollars 524m) pulp mill at Rauma in the west of the country. It will
be one of the biggest investments in the country's pulp and paper sector.
The plant, which will have a capacity to produce 500,000 tonnes a year of
chlorine-free softwood pulp, is expected to start production in the spring
of 1996.
United Paper Mills (UPM) and Metsa-Serla, two of Finland's leading pulp and
paper groups, are the biggest shareholders in Metsa-Rauma, with stakes of
45.6 per cent and 27.8 per cent respectively. A further 20.6 per cent stake
will be held by Metsaliitto, a wood procurement co-operative.
Metsa-Rauma's owners will finance one-third of the project. The balance will
funded through a loan, for which the Finnish Guarantee Board has provided a
FM1.2bn guarantee. The lead manager is Postipankki, the Finnish state-owned
bank.
Optimism about the pulp market has risen rapidly since the start of the
year, with softwood pulp prices surging from Dollars 380 a tonne last
November to Dollars 560. Some commentators believe the price could reach
Dollars 650 a tonne by the year-end.
Mr Juhani Ahava, Metsa-Rauma chairman, said the mill's main owners would
take about half the plant's output. UPM will use most of its share at its
Rauma paper mill, while Metsa-Serla will supply its Kirkniemi magazine paper
plant. Much of the remaining production is expected to be sold in Europe as
a reinforcing agent in recycled paper production.
The mill is also being built because Metsaliitto wants to have an outlet for
its members' wood in the Rauma region, where two pulp mills have been
closed.

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Allianz reports robust premium
income growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Premium income at Allianz rose nearly 20 per cent to DM65.5bn (Dollars
39.2bn) last year, and is likely to continue growing at a double-digit rate
in the current year, the Munich-based insurance group said yesterday.
The rise was attributed mainly to strong growth in the group's activities
outside Germany. However, it also reflected the consolidation of Deutsche
Krankenversicherung, the healthcare insurance subsidiary, for the first
time.
The increase in premium income will be matched by a robust increase in net
earnings for 1993, Allianz disclosed in documentation published yesterday in
connection with its planned DM1.56bn rights issue.
Earnings for 1994 were also likely to increase, Allianz revealed, although
it was too early to make detailed predictions. This was on the assumption
that there was no upsurge in the number of natural catastrophes for the rest
of the year, Allianz explained. The Los Angeles earthquake, which struck the
city in January, is likely to cost the group DM140m.
Although full 1993 profits details will not be disclosed until later this
year, analysts suggest net earnings will climb well above DM1bn - perhaps as
high as DM1.1bn, according to some predictions - against net earnings of
DM858m in the previous year. The 1994 results will reflect the impact of
rationalisation measures implemented at Allianz subsidiaries in Germany and
abroad during previous years.
Losses from so-called 'technical insurance' are also expected to fall in
1993, Allianz said. These losses, which amounted to DM1.68bn in 1992, arise
on core insurance business - premium income netted off against payments to
settle insurance claims - before taking into account investment and other
income.
The figures, contained in advertisements placed yesterday in a number of
German newspapers, are better than Allianz's earlier estimates of a 14 per
cent increase in 1993 premium income for the group. Premium income outside
Germany grew by 21.3 per cent to DM31.1bn, while domestic income climbed
18.2 per cent to DM34.4bn.
Allianz said a number of factors influenced the improved income and
earnings, including higher premium rates in the industrial sector and
reduced losses at Deutsche Kreditversicherung, the former state-owned
insurance monopoly in eastern Germany which Allianz acquired in 1990.
Favourable currency movements also played a role, and Allianz also
highlighted a surge of sales of annuity policies in the north American
market.

venture

<TEXT>
General Motors, the US carmaker, and Hindustan Motors, an Indian motor
manufacturer, yesterday announced a Dollars 100m joint venture to make cars
in India.
The 50-50 venture is a boost for the Indian government, which is
liberalising the economy and trying to attract foreign trade and investment.
The announcement comes as Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, is
preparing to set off on a visit to the US aimed partly at promoting inward
investment.
GM will bring to India its Astra hatchback saloon, produced by Adam Opel,
the group's German subsidiary. The partners plan to build 20,000 Astras a
year, starting in the third quarter of 1995, at a Hindustan Motors plant at
Baroda, in the western state of Gujarat. The proportion of local content in
the vehicle is set to rise to 70 per cent over three years.
Mr Greg De Yonker, executive vice-president of GM Overseas Distribution,
said GM had been drawn to India by the government's economic liberalisation
policies. 'We hope they will continue carrying them out, as they have said
they will,' he said.
Mr CK Birla, chairman of the joint venture, said it was 'a very positive
sign of the world's confidence in India' that GM had decided to invest.
GM produced vehicles in India between 1928 and 1954, when it pulled out
because of the country's poor economic prospects. It developed ties with
Hindustan Motors through licensing agreements to make Bedford lorries and
Vauxhall cars. Hindustan Motors is best-known as the manufacturer of the
Ambassador, a model based on the 1950s Morris Oxford.
The joint venture was first proposed in 1990, but delayed by changes in the
Indian government, shifts in economic policy, and the uncertainty caused by
the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in December 1992.
The announcement follows the recent signing of a joint venture between
Telco, the vehicle manufacturing affiliate of the Tata industrial grouping,
and Daimler-Benz of Germany, to assemble up to 10,000 Mercedes-Benz cars a
year. Sipani Automobiles, a Bangalore-based engineering company, earlier
this year started assembling Montego cars from kits supplied by Rover Group
of the UK.
In Bombay, Premier Automobiles, which has long-standing links with Fiat of
Italy, is discussing a joint venture with Peugeot of France to make
Peugeot's 309 model.

Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish forest products group, said yesterday it had no
plans to raise its bid for the outstanding shares in Berghuizer
Papierfabriek, its loss-making Dutch paper subsidiary. This is in spite of
criticism from some shareholders that its offer of Fl 50 a share is too low.
The Finnish company said the takeover was the best way to safeguard
Berghuizer's future. Berghuizer was expected to post further losses in 1994
and 1995, and there was no likelihood of a resumption of dividend payments
in the 'foreseeable' future, it said.
'Enso believes that it is offering a generous strategic premium over the net
present value of the underlying cashflow potential of the shares, and is not
prepared to improve its offer,' it said.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bigger is not necessarily better -
Enterprise's bid for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Graham Hearne, chief executive of Enterprise Oil, justified his
hostile bid for fellow explorer Lasmo by describing oil exploration as a big
boys game which required critical mass, he triggered off a chorus of
criticism.
Analysts accused him of seeking size for its own sake, and pointed to the
many big discoveries made by small oil companies. Many industry executives
said what mattered most was the way in which companies handled their
existing assets.
However Mr Hearne's comments have brought to the surface an issue which
bedevils an industry in which corporate minnows co-exist alongside the big
integrated majors.
'There is a very great debate on whether size is an important issue,' said
Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum.
Mr Hearne said he never intended to convey the impression that Enterprise
was interested in size for its own sake. But he stands by the argument that
critical mass makes good industrial sense and that Enterprise, the largest
UK independent, needs to be of a 'size we feel necessary to deliver
shareholder value'.
Lasmo's defence document rebutting this argument has to be published by
Monday but it is widely expected to be out before the weekend.
The size argument has not found many supporters among Mr Hearne's industry
colleagues. 'I think that aspect of Enterprise's argument is total rubbish,'
said one executive. 'There have always been niches for different sizes of
players and different skills.'
Many in the industry believe the proposed deal is driven more by financial
issues than industrial logic. They point out that neither company operates
many of their main projects, so there is little scope for greater production
efficiency.
The commercial argument, that cash-rich Enterprise is short of medium-term
development prospects while cash-strapped Lasmo may not be able to fund all
its potential projects, is somewhat stronger, according to analysts.
They note that revenues from Lasmo developments such as the Liverpool Bay
gas project would smooth out an expected dip in Enterprise's production and
cash flow later this decade as output falls from the Nelson and Scott
fields.
Many industry observers believe, however, that Enterprise's need to keep
growing its dividend is one of the most compelling reasons for the deal.
Smaller independents are relieved of that pressure. They have always been
seen as North Sea-based capital growth stocks, the price of which could soar
on the back of just one strike.
Enterprise, however, is 'too large to be regarded as an asset play,' said
one independent executive. He added that it was judged more on its dividend
paying capacity in much the same way as an integrated oil major.
In fact, a combined Lasmo and Enterprise would rival in size the exploration
and production arms of some of the integrated oil majors but without the
benefits of being a diversified group with downstream activities.
'There is a lot of pressure to pay dividends, and investors want it to go up
each year,' the head of a rival independent company said. But to carry on
paying, companies need to find oil fields, either through exploration or
acquisition, or have the support of diversified downstream operations.
Some in the industry feel that Mr Hearne has compounded his problems by
choosing to focus on upstream exploration and production. 'Most other large
companies have some sort of vertical integration so they can ride out the
storms of the oil price by making money at the petrol pump,' said the
managing director of a UK independent.
Some analysts also argue that Enterprise could have realised its upstream
ambitions by simply buying packages of assets, thus avoiding a costly
takeover battle. Completed asset disposals in the UK North Sea alone have
totalled Dollars 1bn since the beginning of 1993, according to analysts at
Kleinwort Benson, and brokers say there is no shortage of assets for sale.
Buying packages of assets might have been more warmly greeted in the City,
but it would also have taken Enterprise much longer to achieve a similar
spread of business. In addition Enterprise says the Lasmo portfolio fits
particularly well with its own.
Many in the industry understand the pressures which have forced the hostile
bid. Yet they still question the wisdom of a move which would force a whole
new range of problems, such as the fact that big oil companies need to make
big discoveries. The chances of making discoveries adequate to replenish
reserves fall dramatically as the companies get bigger, as the graph shows.
'Lasmo might make Enterprise a stronger company . . . but it does not answer
the fundamental question of what to do afterwards. The challenge to replace
such large reserves with reserves of equal quality is an even greater one,'
said one sceptical executive.
The only way off the dividend treadmill is to shrink the company by selling
assets. 'Every oil exploration company has to shrink at times,' says one
executive.
Companies such as Exxon and BP have succeeded in downsizing, but the task of
persuading shareholders that such a move can be in their interests is not
easy, he added. 'Investors don't understand downsizing, even though the only
time you make money is when you sell.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Devenish purchase helps Greenalls improve
to Pounds 29m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year's acquisition of Devenish helped Greenalls Group, the pubs, drinks
and hotel operator, to a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 29m
in the six months to March 25, or 28 per cent before exceptionals.
Mr Peter Greenall, managing director, said 'not only have we delivered
synergies from the acquisition, but trading is above our expectations'.
Beer volume through the enlarged pub estate was down 4.8 per cent. However,
margins were helped by the renegotiation of brewing supply contracts, some
of which took effect within the half year. Profits from pubs, including the
effect of the acquisition, were up 47 per cent at Pounds 32.7m.
Profits from the Premier House range of pub restaurants, which Greenalls
plans as its main target for capital investment, were up 73 per cent at
Pounds 6m while those from UK hotels, the chief investment target in recent
years, were up 15 per cent at Pounds 8m.
Off-licence profits were down 11 per cent at Pounds 2m, as a result of
competition from supermarkets and cross-channel imports. However,
off-licence turnover had risen by 3 per cent since Christmas. Profits from
drinks and leisure were down 5 per cent at Pounds 2.4m.
On group sales up 21 per cent at Pounds 337m, operating profits rose 39 per
cent to Pounds 49.1m. Interest charges rose sharply to Pounds 16.5m (Pounds
9.6m). There were exceptional charges of Pounds 3.8m, consisting mainly of
Pounds 3.2m reorganisation costs in the drinks and leisure division,
involving 60 redundancies.
Earnings per share were up 3.6 per cent at 11.66p before exceptional items
and property profits, and down 7.8 per cent at 10.43p after them. The
interim dividend is raised 5 per cent to 5.334p.
Greenalls' shares closed 13p lower at 462p.
COMMENT
The market found these results slightly opaque, due to lack of information
on the Devenish contribution and uncertainty on the real progress in hotels.
In addition, the cash outflow of Pounds 45m in the half is slightly
unsettling. However, the pre-Devenish performance is claimed by the company
to be broadly represented by the 3.6 per cent rise in earnings per share. In
addition, the cash outflow should fall next year as investment on hotels
passes its peak. Assuming perhaps Pounds 84m pre-tax this year, the shares
are on some 15 times earnings. While this does not seem unduly expensive,
there is a discount due to uncertainty in a period of transition.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Airsprung sees static outcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Airsprung Furniture, Britain's second largest bed maker, said
yesterday that they were expecting profits for the 12 months to end-March to
be similar to the previous year's record Pounds 6m pre-tax.
That figure, however, was below average market expectations and the
company's shares fell 10p to 235p. Directors blamed the expected standstill
on a poor performance by the main offshoot in the upholstery division.
Nevertheless, they intend a 6 per cent increase in the total dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REA Holdings, the plantation company, turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.05m on turnover of Pounds 90.6m for the year to end-December.
The outcome compared with a deficit - restated for FRS 3 - of Pounds 326,000
from sales of Pounds 80.8m last time. Earnings per share emerged at 3.2p
(7.6p losses).
The directors propose, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to pay
a second interim dividend of 2p in lieu of a final for the year to
end-December 1992 - making 4p for the year - and an interim dividend of 4p
in lieu of a final for 1993.
If confirmed, the dividends for both years will be paid on August 31.
Shareholders may elect - subject to the necessary approval - to receive an
enhanced scrip issue of new ordinary shares, credited as fully paid, to a
value of 9p for every 6p to which they would be entitled were they to take
the dividends in cash.

Courtaulds, the chemicals company, is adding two more manufacturing joint
ventures to its list of deals in the Asia Pacific region. Yesterday it
announced it would be making coatings in two sites in China - Suzhou, in
Jiangsu province, 80km west of Shanghai, and Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.
The company already has ventures in Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
Indonesia. Further investments are being considered for Vietnam.
The new factory at Suzhou will make packaging coatings. Courtaulds will
invest Pounds 7m in the joint venture company, Courtaulds Polymers of
Suzhou. It has a 70 per cent stake with the balance held by a local company,
Suzhou Resin Factory.
The factory is scheduled to be completed within one year and will supply
local canners which currently buy imports.
The second joint venture is an extension of an existing arrangement in
Taiwan for powder coatings between Courtaulds and Chang Cheng Chemical.
Courtaulds will be investing Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) in a manufacturing
site to sell the products to the expanding industries of southern China.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Micro Focus shares surge on news of 25%
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Micro Focus, the Berkshire-based software house, rose 242p to
close at Pounds 10.65 following an encouraging first quarter which suggests
the company may be successfully moving from slow growing mainframe products
to fast developing networked systems.
Over the past year the share price had fallen steeply following anxieties,
especially in the US, about its trading prospects in the light of a shift
among customers away from mainframes.
The company made a profit before tax of Pounds 2.9m in the quarter ended
April 30, a 25 per cent advance on the Pounds 2.31m recorded last time.
Revenues rose from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 20.2m, a 24 per cent improvement.
Growth in costs and expenses was held to 22 per cent. Earnings per share
were 23 per cent ahead at 13.8p (11.2p).
Although Micro Focus shares are traded extensively in the US as ADRs, the
company does not usually issue quarterly reports.
It said it was considering stock incentive plans for its staff; the
quarterly state-ment complied with Stock Exchange regulations on price
sensitive information in order to be able to implement these plans.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said it was an encouraging start to the year. The
company had prevented further erosion in its earnings and he believed
profits before tax for the second half of 1994 would be greater than the
first half.
Micro Focus develops software tools which make it easier for programmers to
write programs for large scale systems. Revenues from the company's core
mainframe products grew only 4 per cent, but represented 39 per cent of the
total, down from 47 per cent in the previous year.
There was healthy growth in networking products, where revenues grew 36 per
cent to reach 37 per cent of total revenues.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Commercial Union rises to Pounds 64m in
first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union yesterday reported it had shed 10 per cent of its motor
insurance exposures over the past 12 months, providing further evidence that
rate competition is returning to the UK motor insurance market.
The figures emerged when CU, the largest of the UK's composite insurance
companies, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 64m for the first three months
of 1994, an increase of Pounds 48m on the same period of 1993.
Mr Cees Schrauwers, UK general manager, said the decision on motor business
reflected 'our reluctance to write business purely to defend market share'.
CU now insures 595,000 motorists.
The group is also reducing its exposure in parts of the London market, such
as the specialist market for excess of loss reinsurance, 'where premium
rates are being affected by additional capacity'.
Like General Accident, which reported a rise in pre-tax profits on Tuesday,
CU's results were adversely affected by severe weather claims in the US,
while falls in the value of equity and bond investments dented its balance
sheet. Shareholders' funds amounted to Pounds 2.25bn at the end of March,
compared with Pounds 2.53bn at the end of last year.
Mr John Carter, chief executive, singled out a strong performance in the UK
'reflecting favourable market and weather conditions' and improved results
in continental Europe as features contributing to the significantly better
results in general insurance.
Overall life premiums fell to Pounds 508m (Pounds 518m). General insurance
premiums rose marginally to Pounds 1.11bn (Pounds 1.09bn). Underwriting
losses fell to Pounds 60m (compared with a deficit of Pounds 100m), despite
a high level of weather and catastrophe claims in North America which cost
Pounds 16m more than last year.
Investment income increased to Pounds 87m (Pounds 84m), after a charge for
external loan interest of Pounds 5m (Pounds 7m).

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: London Clubs for USM with expected price
tag of Pounds 150m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Clubs International, owner of the Ritz Club and five other London
casinos, is seeking a quotation on the USM.
The group is expected to be valued at up to Pounds 150m. It will be making a
Pounds 30m placing, of which Pounds 25m will be placed firm with
institutions. The balance will be subject to a clawback to meet retail
demand through intermediaries.
Mr Alan Goodenough, chief executive, said yesterday the group would seek a
full listing next year. It was going through the USM because the management
had only two years' experience of the company, and Stock Exchange rules
require three years.
The change of management followed a police raid in 1991 under the Gaming
Act, just days before the group's planned flotation. The Gaming Board issued
new licences in autumn 1992.
The flotation later this month is expected to raise Pounds 27.5m of new
money, which will be used to pay down debt incurred under the 1989
management buy-out from Grand Metropolitan.
The pathfinder prospectus shows that in the 51 weeks to March 27 the group
made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14m, compared with Pounds 9.1m in the 53
weeks to April 6 last year. Pro forma pre-tax profits for the latest period
are shown as Pounds 23.1m. Turnover was Pounds 146.4m (Pounds 143.7m).
The six London casinos accounted for Pounds 123m of the turnover. The group,
which also owns casinos in Europe, Egypt and operates on cruise ships, wants
to use its management skills to expand overseas.
Principal shareholders include Ellerman Investments, Legal and General and
Standard Chartered. The management have about 8 per cent of the equity,
which will fall to about 3 per cent after the flotation.
Sponsor to the placing is Samuel Montagu and James Capel is broker.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Further realignment in Midlands -
McKechnie's Pounds 28m takeover of Linread continues consolidation process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McKechnie, the plastics and metal components group, yesterday made an agreed
offer worth Pounds 27.8m for Linread, the fasteners and precision components
manufacturer, in a move which marks further realignment in Midlands
industry.
Although neither company touches the emotional chords of the Midlands in the
fashion of Rover, the carmaker, their merger continues a process of
consolidation among manufacturing companies.
The pressures for consolidation have been particularly acute in the
automotive components sector. 'The process has been going along for the last
five years and accelerating for the last year or so,' commented Mr Chris
Tillett, chief economist at Cooper &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, in
Birmingham.
The vehicle assemblers have both reduced the number of their component
suppliers and sought to enter new relations with those which remain. Now the
suppliers are expected to play a larger design and research role; they are
expected continually to reduce prices and they face progressively higher
quality demands.
This is not a game which the small can easily play. 'Linread is not large
enough to compete on the European market and the PSM (a McKechnie
subsidiary) range needs to be broadened,' said Mr Michael Ost, McKechnie's
chief executive.
Indeed, it was the cosy fit of the two companies which McKechnie stressed
yesterday. 'Linread's range of engineering bolts and fasteners are
complementary to the PSM range and there is a large customer base in the
automotive industry,' Mr Ost said.
The other side of this, as Mr Martin Booth, chief economist at the West
Midlands Enterprise Board, suggested, is that McKechnie is 'taking out a
competitor to gather expertise from it and consolidate its own position'.
Midlands manufacturers in any case have been forced to see their role as
increasingly international. The vagaries of the UK economy is simply too
fragile a base. So the search has been for greater strength.
Linread, its 1980s growth hampered by stock losses in the early 1990s and
only now recovering its financial and manufacturing poise, has been a tiny
force. 'We were somewhat constrained by size,' said Mr Peter Harrison,
managing director. 'With McKechnie, Linread's fortunes should be able to
develop that much faster.'
The pressures on suppliers in the automotive and aerospace industries and
the growing need to view the future in international terms has created a
harsher environment in a region where the bedrock of business has been the
family company.
McKechnie long since moved away from that status to become a medium-sized
group with, locally, a solid but low key reputation: reliable but not
exciting, nor, indeed, excitable. Linread, on the other hand, still looks
like a family business which happens to have a market quotation.
The Lynall and Tahany families own 22 per cent of the equity, while
institutions with more than 3 per cent each hold another 40 per cent.
The need to persuade the families to sell, coupled with the tightly held
equity help to explain the heavy premium above the market price which
McKechnie is paying for Linread. Another factor is the McKechnie belief that
Linread's recovery is taking place much faster than the market has realised.
Mr Ost assured shareholders: 'We believe there will be no earnings dilution
in the first full year of ownership.'
The terms are 17 new McKechnie shares for every 36 Linread. This values
Linread at 228p, which is not only 49 per cent more than their closing price
on Tuesday but also marks a substantial uplift on their lowest price this
year of 95p.
Yesterday Linread shares moved up 63p to 216p, while McKechnie shares dipped
14p to 473p.

automotive engineering group, has become one of the first UK companies to
begin manufacturing in Vietnam.
BRC Weldmesh, the joint venture with BHP Steel International of Australia,
has set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Ho Chi Minh City, Hall said.
The move is an important element in Hall's Asian strategy - it is already
strongly represented in south-east Asia through associated companies in
Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia.
Initially, BRC Weldmesh (Vietnam) is taking over production of reinforcement
spacers for poured concrete from its parent plant in Singapore.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: RTZ puts mining on par with air and water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, was in good shape to benefit from
signs of improvement in the economic outlook, Sir Derek Birkin, chairman,
told the annual meeting yesterday.
Sir Derek was presenting his last AGM as executive chairman, although he
will remain as chairman. He prepared for the onslaught of questions and
protests from action and interest groups about RTZ activities by suggesting
that 'mining remains as important to every day life as the air we breathe
and the water we drink'.
This year the group faced a series of questions about exploration in Norway
and Finland, home of the Sami people, as well as questions on South Africa,
Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cuba.
Sir Derek said the emerging economic consensus was that mainland Europe and
Japan were set to follow the US and UK out of recession. The former
countries were more important markets for RTZ, and recovery should lead to
an improved trading environment.
Metal prices remained volatile, but most appeared to have stemmed their
decline. In the first quarter, the Economist index of non-ferrous metals
prices was about 8 per cent up on its average in the second half of last
year and only 2 per cent below the average in the first half.
Earnings last year had proved resilient against a background of dismally low
prices, he said, although this was to some extent mitigated by exchange rate
factors. Nevertheless, he asked, how many other companies could withstand a
15 per cent decline in average dollar prices and emerge stronger?
The group had also achieved its target of about Pounds 900m from the
completion of the disposal of its remaining industrial products following
last year's sale of most of Pillar.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Power advances 18% - Opportunities
seen for expanding non-core activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Power, the electricity company, indicated it saw significant
opportunities for expanding non-core businesses, possibly through
acquisition, as it launched the electricity sector's preliminary results
season.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 were up 18 per cent, at the top end
of expectations, to Pounds 351.1m (Pounds 297.1m) on turnover of Pounds
1.57bn (Pounds 1.5bn).
It announced an 11 per cent rise in dividend to 12.4p (11.15p) with a
proposed final of 8.27p. Earnings per share rose 17.5 per cent to 31.6p
(26.9p).
Market speculation on acquisitions was fuelled after the company said it
would not be following the lead of other electricity companies which are
seeking to buy back their shares.
Gearing fell over the year from 12.2 per cent to 0.4 per cent. Mr Ian
Preston, chief executive, said the company began with gearing of 50 per cent
at privatisation and would not feel uncomfortable with that in the future.
He said the company would invest to widen its business horizons in the next
few years.
Analysts yesterday speculated that Scottish Power may seek to increase its
interests in the gas and telecommunications businesses.
Another possibility was a bid for a regional electricity company in England
and Wales after the government's golden share in those companies expired
next April. The company is not, however, looking to expand outside the UK.
The company is already increasing sales of electricity in England and Wales.
Capital expenditure last year of Pounds 158.1m included Pounds 36m on the
construction of a 40MW generating station in Knapton and completion of
improvements in transmission links with England and Wales.
Full utilisation of the 1600MW links awaits the granting of planning
permission for National Grid to upgrade its England and Wales system.
Scottish Power is also considering the possibilities of increasing the
capacity to 2000MW. In the long term a 2000MW capacity together with a
planned link with Northern Ireland could help it to increase its sales of
electricity outside Scotland to 40 per cent of the total, compared with
about 10 per cent last year.
Mr Duncan Whyte, chief operating officer, said the company may look at
installing equipment to generate power from gas at Longannet, Fife, if
limits on emissions of nitrous oxide were lowered beyond a certain level.
Highlights of the year included a Pounds 7m profit in retailing, against
Pounds 4m the previous year and a Pounds 5m loss in 1990. Mr Whyte said he
expected a profitable contribution this year from the 50 Clydesdale
superstores, which had been bought from the receiver.
The number of people employed in the core electricity business fell by 619
during the year to 5,740.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chiroscience poised for anaesthetic link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chiroscience Group, the biotechnology company which floated in February,
said yesterday that it was likely to sign collaborations with large
pharmaceuticals companies within the next few months.
The deal would be to sell levobupivacaine, Chiroscience's local anaesthetic,
which has shown improved safety over standard bupivacaine in clinical trials
just completed.
'The deals would probably consist of an upfront payment and a royalty
arrangement,' said Mr Nowell Stebbing, deputy chairman.
The company is understood to be likely to sign a deal with one of the few
specialist companies in anaesthetics. They could include Sweden's Astra and
Zeneca and BOC of the UK.
A product could be on sale within three years which would be initially aimed
at taking a proportion of the existing bupivacaine market, worth Dollars
100m (Pounds 68m) a year. The improvements shown so far by the new drug
suggest it would find customers in the wider anaesthetic market, worth
Dollars 1.2bn a year in global sales, said Mr John Padfield, chief
executive.
The probability of the deal was outlined at the company's annual results
presentation. There were only 17 days of trading between the flotation and
the end of the company's financial year, so the figures were close to what
had been forecast.
The infusion of cash from the flotation took net assets to Pounds 45m, or
66p per share.
Spending on research and development more than doubled from Pounds 1.6bn to
Pounds 3.7bn as the number of staff rose from 48 to 103.
Turnover, a relatively unimportant figure for young biotechnology companies,
improved from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 2m. Pre-tax losses widened to Pounds
4.27m (Pounds 1.25m); losses per share were 11.9p (6p).

<TEXT>
Johnson Fry is hoping to raise up to Pounds 100m with a split capital
investment trust specialising in European utility companies.
There will be two classes of share. The zero dividend preference, with an
equivalent gross annual rate of 9.46 per cent, will account for 29 per cent
of the capital at launch.
Ordinary income shares will account for 71 per cent and aim to provide an
initial yield of 6 per cent.
They will also have some entitlement to capital gains at the end of the
trust's planned 10-year life, after the zeros' entitlement has been met.
The public offer for the income shares closes on June 7, and that for the
zeros on June 9.
First dealings are expected on June 20.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals trim Avon Rubber 2% to Pounds
4.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avon Rubber yesterday sought to offer shareholders the tantalising prospect
of a dividend increase for the first time in four years as it revealed lower
interim profits due to further restructuring charges.
Mr Tony Mitchard, the chief executive who retires in December, said a
dividend increase would be 'a very live consideration in December. We are
more optimistic than we have been for a long time'.
The decline in pre-tax profits for the six months to April 2 was from Pounds
5m to Pounds 4.9m after taking account of Pounds 1.3m in charges due to
restructuring and the loss on disposal of a subsidiary. Sales were 3 per
cent ahead to Pounds 137.2m. The interim dividend is maintained at 5p,
payable from earnings down from 15.1p to 10.6p.
Mr Mitchard was optimistic about the full year, saying underlying trading
was improving in all but the inflatables business and France.
Although he refused to comment on the future of the inflatables business -
which lost Pounds 544,000 in the first half - he has described it as
non-core. Avon is widely expected to sell it this year.
The automotive components business more than doubled operating profits to
Pounds 3.8m on sales ahead 24 per cent to Pounds 60m. Mr Mitchard said Avon
had 'learned to live' with the price pressures imposed by larger US
manufacturers such as General Motors. Cadillac Automotive, the US
subsidiary, improved profits by 40 per cent.
Europe had also been more lucrative than was expected, with the exception of
France which continued to incur losses.
The tyre business had suffered in the first quarter, due to lower new
vehicle production and price increases in October. Operating profits fell 42
per cent to Pounds 1.6m, on sales 10 per cent lower at Pounds 37.1m.
Technical products operating profits fell by 22 per cent to Pounds 2.3m,
against a good first half in 1993, on a 9 per cent decline in sales to
Pounds 33.8m.
COMMENT
Investors who have backed Avon's struggle over recent years will have
greeted the news of yet more exceptional charges with a certain weariness.
Yet even those looking to sell have been forced to a holding position by a
better than expected performance from Europe and prospects of a sale of the
inflatables business. Forecasts were upgraded from Pounds 13m to Pounds
14.5m for this year, leaving the shares on a prospective p/e of 14. In the
shorter term, the shares are up with events. On an 18-month view, they
become more attractive - assuming, that is, there are no more hefty charges.

<TEXT>
Chemex International, the USM-traded chemical analysis company, swung from
losses of Pounds 94,199 to profits of Pounds 49,046 pre-tax for the half
year ended March 31.
The turnround reflected both a 28 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds
780,052 (Pounds 610,607) and the cost benefits of moving to new premises.
The improved turnover figure was largely due to introducing products to a
wider marketplace. Some 40 per cent of samples came from overseas,
principally from Europe, Africa and east Asia.
Earnings per share of 0.12p compared with previous losses of 0.24p.
Comparative pre-tax losses took account of exceptional provisions of Pounds
43,038.

Lynx Holdings, the acquisitive computer services and leisure products
company, reported pre-tax profits more than quadrupled from Pounds 105,000
to Pounds 460,000 for the six months to March 31.
Mr Roger Pinnington, chairman of this USM-quoted company, said that
acquisitions contributed Pounds 312,000 to profits, including a strong

Turnover improved to Pounds 7.26m (Pounds 4.72m). Overall operating margins
were 8.8 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent last time. Earnings per share
were 1.15p (0.83p) reflecting the increase in shares issued for the
purchases.
The interim dividend is raised to 0.36p (0.3p).
Mr Pinnington said the balance sheet had been strengthened since the year
end and net assets at March 31 stood at Pounds 2.1m, including net cash of
Pounds 1.4m.

Two men linked to the loss of Pounds 2.3m from the pension fund of Belling,
the cooker manufacturer which collapsed two years ago, were yesterday
charged with defrauding or attempting to defraud companies and private
individuals in the UK and abroad of more than Pounds 20m.
The charges follow a 15-month joint investigation by the Staffordshire
police and the Serious Fraud Office into an advance fee fraud which is
thought to cover the US and Europe.
Mr Charles Deacon, a solicitor from Newcastle-under-Lyme, and Mr Keith
Fuller, a business consultant, were charged with 16 and eight counts of
fraud and attempt to defraud respectively.
The charges date from 1986 to 1992 and range from claims as small as Pounds
100,000 to allegations that Mr Deacon and Mr Fuller conspired to obtain
Dollars 5m from a Finnish food producer.
The case was transferred to the Nottingham Crown Court.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Aiming to increase coverage - Richard
Lapper and Alison Smith report on a new challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The challenge facing the UK's traditional insurance industry by the
emergence of new telephone-based companies was yesterday highlighted when
Direct Line disclosed the extent of its recent growth in the Pounds 4bn a
year home insurance market.
Already 'direct writers', which sell direct to the public, using a
combination of telephone sales, advertising and sophisticated computer
software, control about 20 per cent of the motor insurance market, with
Direct Line now established as the biggest insurer in that sector.
Since launching its attack on the home market last September Direct Line has
added more than 100,000 policies to its books and now counts itself among
the country's top 10 home insurers.
'If growth continues at its present rate we will be the biggest home insurer
in the country within two to three years,' warns Mr Peter Wood, chief
executive.
Other direct writers are also beginning to eye the home insurance market, at
least 50 per cent of which is controlled by the large composite insurers,
selling mainly through their bank and building society connections.
Intensified competition in this area could spill over into other parts of
the financial services sector, eroding the profits of those insurance
companies which either refuse or are slow to adapt, and increasing the
pressure on those building societies which are heavily dependent on
commission income earned from insurance sales.
The direct writers have ample leeway to compete, especially on pricing. For
one thing, customers have recently become much more likely to 'shop around'
for home insurance following steep price increases in the wake of wind and
subsidence losses.
With insurers also changing the way they underwrite, rating buildings
insurance risk in line with the perceived risk of subsidence or storm, for
example, some customers have faced even higher rate rises.
And the commission rates in the home insurance market have traditionally
been much higher than those paid to brokers in the motor market. Some banks
and building societies still earn the equivalent of 30 per cent or more of
the premium on sales of home policies, compared with the 10 per cent to 15
per cent commissions charged in the motor insurance market. 'The margins are
so big. There is much more for us to have a go at,' says the chief executive
of one direct writer.
Direct Line is selective about the risks it underwrites, but still claims
that it can offer nine out of 10 customers for building policies rates that
are 20 per cent cheaper than those they would pay elsewhere.
Analysts and other observers believe that the direct writers could begin to
take market share from their competitors.
'People are looking for ways to reduce their insurance costs and getting
used to the telephone. There seems to be very little reason why the home
market shouldn't be penetrated in the same way as the motor market,'
commented Mr Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the securities
house.
Mr Mark Wood, managing director of AA Insurance, the UK's biggest chain of
insurance shops, believes direct writers and a number of new telephone-based
brokers will increase their share of the home insurance market.
Building societies, however, are already alert to the danger of losing what
some consider a significant source of income. At Chelsea Building Society,
for example, it contributed more than Pounds 4m in 1993: a broadly similar
figure seems about right for Derbyshire Building Society.
But in protecting their business, societies are not falling over themselves
to reduce their commission rates in order to compete. Mr Roger Tucker, head
of mortgage services at North of England, admits that Direct Line's success
has made it re-address its pricing policy, but emphasises also that the
society is considering the range of facilities it provides to include,
perhaps, offers such as 'money-off' vouchers.
At Chelsea, Mr Geoffrey Divito says that in many areas the prices the
society can offer already compare well with Direct Line, because of the
direct writer's selectivity.
He argues that the level of customer service is also an important factor,
and talks about the advantages of dealing with an organisation which has
long-standing experience of dealing with claims.
Derbyshire highlights the convenience factor for customers of having
mortgage and home insurance payments handled through a single organisation
and with a single direct debit.
Here, as in other areas of personal financial services, customer inertia may
play a significant role in enabling the established organisations to hold on
to much of their customer base, if increases in charges or premiums are not
sufficient to shock people into shopping around.
At Direct Line though, Mr Wood is confident that far reaching change is on
the cards. 'There is going to be a re-engineering of the market,' he says.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Direct Line surges to Pounds 40.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct Line, the UK's leading motor insurer, has nearly doubled its share of
the household insurance market since March last year and expanded
particularly rapidly in the six months to March 31.
Details emerged yesterday when the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary
reported a nearly threefold increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 40.5m
(Pounds 15m).
The company said it had experienced a surge in growth following the
introduction of a new rating structure and a marketing campaign in September
1993, underwriting 139,000 new policies in the half year to bring its total
to 381,000.
Premium income from household policies increased by 92 per cent to Pounds
41.8m.
Meanwhile, Direct Line is consolidating its position in the motor market,
issuing 445,000 new policies in the half year and reaching 1.56m policies in
force by March 31, against 903,500 a year earlier. Motor premium income rose
by 66 per cent to Pounds 219.4m (Pounds 132.4m).
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said that 'despite increasing competition in
the motor and household insurance markets during the half year, Direct Line
has achieved rapid growth in both'.
Overall including income from creditor insurance, premium income rose by 67
per cent to Pounds 267.7m (Pounds 160.6m).
The company's operating ratio, an efficiency indicator which measures claims
and expenses as a percentage of premiums, improved by four percentage points
to 84 per cent.
In household business, Direct Line's loss ratio - which measures claims as a
percentage of premiums - fell to 52.4 per cent in the last six months,
against 71.8 per cent a year earlier. As the size of the company's portfolio
expands, the expense ratio - expenses as a percentage of premiums - has
dropped to 21.9 per cent (29.2 per cent).
Further injections of capital of Pounds 35m were made by Royal Bank of
Scotland 'to support the company's continued expansion'.
As well as maintaining the pace of its advance in the household area, Direct
Line aims to underwrite 2m motor policies by the end of the year. The
company plans to spend Pounds 16m on marketing this year, of which Pounds 9m
will be earmarked for advertising, against Pounds 9.5m last time.
Mr Wood said that he was considering a range of new services and products. A
new initiative to improve the management and reduce the cost of motor
insurance claims is near fruition.
The company is already issuing personal loans, through Direct Line Financial
Services, and plans to run a pilot scheme to offer mortgages in the summer.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ex-Celsis chief to sue for wrongful
dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Martin, who was dismissed as chief executive of Celsis, the
biotechnology company, on March 31, is suing the company for wrongful
dismissal and defamation.
A statement issued on his behalf said that 'although his lawyers had tried
to negotiate terms with the company, he was afraid that discussions had made
little headway'.
Mr Martin said: 'I have no alternative now but to defend my reputation and
to demonstrate that there were no grounds on which my employment contract
could be terminated without notice.'
'Unless some of the founding shareholders allow executive management to
manage, I fear my head will not be the last to roll,' he said.
The founding shareholders are Mr Chris Evans and Mr John Morris. Both are
non-executive directors with 26 per cent and 17 per cent stakes
respectively.
Celsis said that it was 'disappointed' in Mr Martin's statements which would
'intensify the dispute'.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Dollars 3m first quarter loss at SeaCon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based leisure, ferry and container leasing
group, incurred net losses of Dollars 3.17m (Pounds 2.17m) in the three
months to March 31, against profits of Dollars 7.47m last time.
The company pointed out that the previous figure had been boosted by a
Dollars 10.4m exceptional gain from foreign exchange and the sale of a
factory. It added that underlying earnings from container leasing had grown
by Dollars 1.5m.
The ferries and ports division incurred increased losses of Dollars 7.25m
(Dollars 6.18m).
Finance costs rose by Dollars 9.66m to Dollars 16.2m, and losses per share
came through at 71 cents (earnings of 34 cents).

FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: J Smurfit falls 27% to IPounds
48m but sees upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging group, yesterday reported a
further decline in full year profits but expressed confidence that a recent
upturn in demand for cardboard boxes in the US and Europe signalled the end
of the paper industry's worst recession for 50 years.
Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 fell by 27 per cent to IPounds
47.8m (Pounds 46.6m), against IPounds 65.8m restated for FRS 3.
Sales increased by 16.5 per cent to IPounds 1.47bn (IPounds 1.26bn), mainly
reflecting the inclusion of UK Corrugated, Cundell and Irish Paper Products
for the first time.
Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman, said the results reflected 'a further decline
in our already low prices which was mainly the result of continuing
overcapacity'.
The pre-tax figure was struck after IPounds 37.6m (IPounds 29.7m) of
exceptional costs relating to the group's share of its US associate's
Dollars 150m (Pounds 103m) pre-tax charge for restructuring.
Earnings per share slipped to 7.2p (7.8p) but the proposed final dividend is
raised to 2.7694p, making a total for the year up 7 per cent at 4p, against
3.74p.
Operating profit fell from IPounds 104.2m to IPounds 75m, of which IPounds
4.71m was from acquisitions.
Net interest receipts dropped to IPounds 9.77m (IPounds 16.2m) as net cash
declined from IPounds 149.5m to IPounds 38.4m partly reflecting currency
devaluation.
With the exception of Ireland, sales volumes declined in all countries.
The combined Ireland/UK region reported an 11 per cent increase in profits
to IPounds 28.2m on sales which grew by 50 per cent to IPounds 557.7m.
In continental Europe profits fell by 63 per cent to IPounds 7.95m (IPounds
21.5m) on sales down by 7 per cent to IPounds 380m, but Mr Ray Curran, chief
financial officer, said European price trends were now looking 'much more
positive'.
The Latin American operations continued to generate the lion's share of
trading profits although their contribution fell by 14 per cent to IPounds
54.2m.
In North America JSC/CCA, the associate set up through a leveraged buy-out
in 1989, reported increased losses of IPounds 14.7m (IPounds 1.08m).
JSC completed the first stage of a two-part refinancing aimed at raising
Dollars 2.45bn yesterday including a Dollars 250m public equity offering.
COMMENT
Smurfit's management gave an upbeat assessment of prospects in both the US
and Europe yesterday. In the US, the group's most important market, the
recovery has already eaten up spare capacity and price increases appear to
be sticking - every Dollars 10 price rise adds Dollars 20m to Smurfit's
bottom line. This year pre-tax profits of about IPounds 98m and earnings of
14p look possible but the real advance should come next year when profits
could reach IPounds 165m producing earnings of 23p. The shares are trading
on a prospective multiple of 13.6 against next year's earnings and should be
bought or held.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Provisions leave Bibby Pounds 12m in the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Bibby and Sons, the South African-controlled conglomerate, plunged into
the red in the 26 weeks to March 26 with pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.4m,
against profits of Pounds 4.8m last time.
The deficit was due to a decision to withdraw from the agricultural feeds
business. Bibby last month agreed the Pounds 35m sale of this business to
Associated British Foods.
The company suffered a Pounds 12.6m loss on disposal and was forced to write
off the Pounds 2.5m costs of its aborted plan to float the division.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, had previously said the company would
have had to take a Pounds 35m loss on disposal if the business had been
floated.
Excluding these charges, and a further Pounds 5.2m write-back of goodwill,
profits after interest were ahead 65 per cent at Pounds 7.9m. Sales declined
from Pounds 416m to Pounds 409.1m.
The group benefited from a Pounds 2.4m drop in interest charges to Pounds
5.8m. Bibby's debt, incurred after the ill-fated Pounds 82m acquisition of
Finanzauto, the Spanish Caterpillar dealer, fell from Pounds 155m to Pounds
117m. This was largely due to disposals in the Caterpillar division.
Mr Mansell-Jones said trading in Spain and Portugal remained weak in the
first half. Since February, however, there had been 'a small but significant
improvement in the order book level for new equipment'. The chairman said
cost-cutting had helped the capital equipment division to reduce first half
losses.
As forecast the interim dividend is halved to 1p. There is also a special
pay-out of 2p following the disposal of the agricultural feeds business.
Barlow Rand, which owns 79 per cent of Bibby, has waived its entitlement.
Losses emerged at 10.79p (1.43p earnings).

FT  12 MAY 94 / General Motors to inject Dollars 10bn into pension fund
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors yesterday took a significant step towards the reduction of
its serious pension fund deficit - by far the largest of any US corporation
 -when it agreed with government regulators that it would inject some
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.8bn) of cash and stock into the scheme.
Investor concern about GM's unfunded pension liabilities, some Dollars
22.3bn at the end of 1993, has hung over the group's stock in spite of a
sharp improvement in operating profits.
The group announced last November that it was considering ameliorating its
pensions problem by contributing to its plans some Dollars 6bn-worth of GM
class E stock held by its treasury. The E stock represents a claim on the
dividend stream of Electronic Data Systems, GM's information technology
subsidiary.
GM said it had agreed with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the
government agency which insures private-sector benefit plans, to contribute
177m Class E shares, worth Dollars 6.2bn at current market prices, and a
further Dollars 4bn in cash.
The recent rise in US interest rates - if sustained - will also sharply
reduce GM's deficit, as bond rates are used to calculate the company's
pension liabilities, and each 1 percentage point rise in bond yields cuts
the liability by some Dollars 5bn. US 30-year Treasury bond yields have
risen by well over 1 percentage point since the start of the year.
GM said yesterday that the Dollars 4bn cash contribution would come out of
cash flow. Under the deal with the PBGC, still subject to the approval of
the US Department of Labor, it must contribute at least Dollars 2bn at the
same time as the E shares and the balance no later than September 30, 1995.
When a company contributes to its pension fund above the annual minimum it
normally creates a credit balance which the company can use to reduce
pension contributions. GM has agreed to defer the use of these credits for
several years and will not be entirely free of the restraints until 2003.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Shell first quarter steady at Pounds 949m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shell Transport and Trading, the world's largest integrated oil company,
yesterday reported a slight dip in first-quarter net profits to Pounds 949m
from Pounds 971m, as improvements in refining and marketing offset a steep
fall in exploration and production profits.
The results, calculated on a replacement cost of supplies basis, were
mid-range of analysts' forecasts. Shell shares closed down a penny at 741p.
Earnings per share were 10.3p, compared with 10.1p last time.
The Pounds 2.1bn cash flow from operations was flat compared with last year.
The financial strength of Shell was underscored by its low gearing of 17.6
per cent.
A 13 per cent rise in downstream profits to Pounds 488m (Pounds 431m) was
attributed to higher sales volumes and lower costs. The company said world
demand for oil products is stronger than last year. Oil product sales rose
worldwide, although downstream margins in Asia and Europe deteriorated
compared with the same period last year.
A 23 per cent fall in the crude oil price caused profits from exploration
and production to drop by 27 per cent, to Pounds 425m (Pounds 584m). But
average production of 1.83m barrels a day was 5.5 per cent up, as a result
of new fields coming onstream in the UK North Sea.
Shell's first-quarter profits are usually bolstered by high seasonal demand
for natural gas, a market segment in which the company has a strong
position. First-quarter sales volumes rose by 3.3 per cent to 7.17bn cubic
feet a day.
Chemicals returned to profit after three years of losses. First-quarter
profits were Pounds 56m, compared with a Pounds 22m loss last time.
The company attributed much of the improvement to restructuring initiatives,
but it also confirmed that demand for chemicals is recovering as growth
returns to western economies.
Shell has about 13 per cent of its capital employed in the chemical sector,
according to London brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, and would
there-fore benefit significantly from any strong upturn in demand.
But the company said the outlook for the sector was dependent on the pace of
economic recovery in Europe, where there is chronic over-capacity.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Growth in mortgage lending helps Royal Bank double to Pounds
201m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rapid growth in mortgage lending and sales of household insurance policies
by its subsidiary Direct Line helped Royal Bank of Scotland to double
interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 201m, against Pounds 89m.
The bank tripled earnings per share to 13.5p, from 4.2p, and raised its
interim dividend 33 per cent to 4p. However, its shares closed 12.5p down at
428p after it said that the rise was partly to rebalance interim and final
dividends.
Mr George Mathewson, chief executive, confirmed that the bank was interested
in acquiring a building society. 'If a suitable opportunity were to arise,
we would look at it positively, but the price would have to be
satisfactory.'
Mr Mathewson said that the bank wanted to build on the Pounds 900m rise in
its mortgage book to Pounds 4.5bn, which had given it a 4 per cent share of
net new mortgage lending in the UK.
The rise in mortgage lending was funded by a 21 per cent growth in personal
savings to Pounds 840m, as the bank offered new savings products. Mr
Mathewson said mortgages had been 'a very profitable business' but margins
were likely to narrow.
Profits before bad debt provisions rose to Pounds 312m, against Pounds 258m,
and provisions fell to Pounds 111m, from Pounds 182m. Net interest income
rose 11 per cent to Pounds 469m, against Pounds 270m, and other income rose
24 per cent to Pounds 334m. Costs rose 16 per cent to Pounds 537m, but the
underlying increase was only 3 per cent because expansion at Direct Line,
and the cost of acquisitions by Citizens, its US subsidiary, increased the
overall figure.
Mr Mathewson said that its alliance with Banco Santander of Spain was
strengthening. A joint purchase of another financial services company by the
two banks was 'always a possibility'.
The bank's treasury had 'only a moderate level of position-taking' on its
own account, and had not made any significant losses as a result of turmoil
in financial markets following the tightening of US monetary policy.
Citizens increased profits to Pounds 27m, from Pounds 21m, while the UK
branch banking division contributed Pounds 66m, against Pounds 6m. The
corporate and institutional banking division raised profits to Pounds 82m,
against Pounds 58m.
Capital ratios were weakened by a 9 per cent rise in risk-weighted assets to
Pounds 28.3bn, against Pounds 25.9bn on September 30. The tier 1 ratio of
core capital to risk-weighted assets fell to 6.5 per cent (6.9 per cent in
September).

FT  12 MAY 94 / Sainsbury posts rise in underlying profits: Charges and
reorganisation at UK's largest grocery retailer halve reported figure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, shrugged off the gloom that
beset its January trading statement to announce an increase in underlying
profits, and a stabilisation of gross margins after the price skirmishing of
recent months.
Its reported pre-tax profit, on an FRS 3 basis, was halved from Pounds
732.8m to Pounds 368.8m, after charges of Pounds 38.7m following its
decision to begin depreciating buildings; a Pounds 341.5m property
write-down; and Pounds 28m reorganisation and redundancy costs at head
office.
Stripping out those items, however, pre-tax profits would have increased 6
per cent to Pounds 777m - including a Pounds 7m property gain - beating
Sainsbury's forecast in January of a 'small increase'.
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said gross margins fell 0.4 percentage points
in the second half - a result of the 'Essential for essentials' campaign,
involving price cuts on 300 own-label products.
He added: 'Although the competitive environment is still very tough, we
currently expect gross margins to be maintained at around their present
level.'
His comments failed to convince the stockmarket, however, with Sainsbury's
shares falling 3p to 388 1/2 p.
Mr Sainsbury said the price competition had been triggered not by surplus
space in the grocery market but by rivals Asda and Gateway cutting prices.
That had led to a repositioning of margins, but would not escalate into an
all-out price war.
After a slow start, he added, the 'Essentials' campaign had delivered volume
increases averaging 20 per cent on featured products.
Group sales for the year to March 12 rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 11.2bn.
Sales in Sainsbury's supermarkets increased 7.1 per cent, with new space
contributing 6.5 percentage points. After inflation of 1.5 per cent,
like-for-like sales fell 0.9 per cent overall. Operating profits grew only
2.3 per cent to Pounds 732.2m, reflecting the lower margins.
The Savacentre hypermarkets lifted sales 8.1 per cent to Pounds 659m, and
trading profits 11.8 per cent to Pounds 40.6m. Sainsbury's Homebase, the DIY
chain, saw total sales increase 16 per cent to Pounds 328m, with operating
profits up 34.3 per cent to Pounds 23.9m.
In the US, sales at Shaws supermarkets grew 6.7 per cent to Dollars 1.9bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) and profits almost 50 per cent to Dollars 46.5m.
Mr Sainsbury said the group would consider further acquisitions in the US,
and would reduce the proportion of capital spending on its UK supermarket
chain in favour of the other businesses.
Earnings per share, after exceptionals, fell from 28.5p to 8p, but the final
dividend increased from 7.3p to 7.6p, lifting the total 6 per cent to 10.6p.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Lens flexes to focus on UK's underperformers: A 'predator'
with a difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies be warned: Mr Robert Monks, a prominent member of the US
shareholder rights movement and scourge of poorly performing American
businesses, may cross the Atlantic in search of UK targets.
Mr Monks runs Lens Inc, a fund management group he set up two years ago,
which takes stakes in US companies with bad financial track records and then
agitates for change, hoping the improvement will lift the company's share
price.
Mr Monks hopes to do the same in the UK, in the first significant expansion
of this type of fund outside the US. But he says he needs to find a British
investment partner who can give him a good feel for local conditions. 'A lot
of our comfort here (in the US) is that we really do understand the idiom .
. . which in the UK we patently do not,' says Mr Monks, a Harvard-educated
lawyer who also studied at Oxford and helped foundthe US corporate
governance movement.
He is analysing UK companies, plans a reconnaissance trip in July, and may
take a stake in a British group by the year's end.
The US corporate governance movement, dominated by large US public pension
plans such as California's Calpers, pressures companies to establish
structures to make managements more accountable to shareholders - for
example, by ensuring that a majority of directors are from outside the
business. Some funds also try to establish a dialogue with poorly performing
companies on possible strategic change.
Lens is unlike other governance activists. First, it actively seeks out
underperforming companies. Many of the large public pension funds acquire
stakes in underperformers passively, as they are indexed funds whose
investments replicate the components of important stock market indices.
Second, whereas the public pension funds tend to be discreet, Lens is
confrontational if dialogue attempts are rebuffed. 'We are willing to be
loud,' says Ms Nell Minow, a partner in Lens who is also a force in the
corporate governance movement. Lens may spearhead campaigns against
companies which conservative US funds shy away from.
Lens consequently has an influence disproportionate to its tiny size. The
fund has only Dollars 15m of money under management, mostly belonging to Mr
Monks and Ms Minow, having failed to attract large institutional investors
when first established. Even Calpers, a long-time ally in the corporate
governance movement, turned Lens down, arguing that it was itself pursuing
Lens' strategy. Mr Monks argues that public pension funds like Calpers,
which ultimately report to political masters, are wary of Lens'
confrontational reputation. 'The risk-reward ratio for public servants
inhibits them from doing something that involves the possibility of
political embarrassment.'
Mr Monks nevertheless has a strong track record at fomenting corporate
change. He rocked the board of Sears, Roebuck by running as an independent
director - a campaign which crystallised investor unhappiness with the
company and led to a shake-up of its retailing side and the spin-off of
financial services.
Sears was one of four companies comprising Lens' initial portfolio. The
others - American Express, Eastman Kodak and Westinghouse Electric - have
all ousted their chief executives and begun strategy changes.
The rise in most of these companies' shares meant that, in its first year,
Lens had a return on its portfolio of 26.1 per cent, some 18.9 per cent
better than the Standard &amp; Poors 500. Mr Monks says that so far this year
fund's total return is about 10 per cent.
Mr Monks is focussing his energies on Stone &amp; Webster, where he holds 1 per
cent of the stock. He argues the company's sharp decline in profits during
the past five years relates to poor management and corporate governance
structure.
The company's own employee benefit plan holds about 37 per cent of the stock
and a further 12 per cent of its capital is in restricted stock in the hands
of employees. The result, Mr Monks argues, is a business being being run as
a private company despite its public shareholders. He suggests management
should consider buying out shareholders and taking it fully private.
Stone &amp; Webster acknowledges its results have not been satisfactory, but
says no helpful ideas have come from Lens.
Mr Monks uses Lens as an agenda-setter, highlighting corporate governance
issues which he considers of general importance. In the Stone &amp; Webster
campaign he wants to point up the role of employee share schemes in
protecting under-performing companies and what he calls 'an appalling
unspoken conflict of interest' among Wall Street firms.
He argues that large US banks and security houses which act as fund trustees
are unlikely to act as proper fiduciaries of these shares - for example, by
voting against poor managements - as they, or other members of the Wall
Street investment banking club, are likely to have business links with the
underperforming companies. 'The great and the good (of Wall Street) are
simply not going to ever put themselves in a position where they become
unclubbable,' he says.
If he finds the right British partner, the City of London might soon be
listening to equally forthright judgements.

FT  12 MAY 94 / High price for Tokyo's high-rise rice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Shoko Sato would not look out of place in rural Japan. But this property
developer was yesterday planting rice deep in the heart of Tokyo, in Ginza,
one of the world's most urbanised and expensive real estate markets. Mr
Sato's 850 sq metre plot, a former car park surrounded by towering office
blocks, is worth about Y10bn (Pounds 65.78m).
The price of Japanese rice might have soared after the failure of two
harvests, and land values in the city may have collapsed following the end
of the 'bubble economy', but downtown Tokyo is an unlikely location for rice
culture. For one thing, Mr Sato's site will not produce rice profits. When
harvested in September, the paddy will yield just 20kg. Each grain will cost
about Y600 to produce; one 80g bowl will cost more than Y2m (Pounds 13,100).
Mr Sato, who is also a director of an industrial incinerator business,
explains: 'I originally planned to build a karaoke bar complex with a small
strip for growing vegetables to supply an adjoining pub. But when I went to
the financial institutions I was turned down. The economy was going badly
and the bottom had fallen out of the karaoke market.'
He was unable to lease the land and was unwilling to sell given the state of
the market. He was then approached by a charity intrigued by his idea of
growing vegetables in central Tokyo.
The Japan Welfare Education Scholarship Foundation, which promotes
healthcare for the aged, had become concerned about the impact of
agrochemicals on health. Mr Hitoi Sato, the charity's managing director who
is no relation to the owner, explains: 'We're concerned about the decline of
Japanese agriculture and also want to promote the consumption of organic
rice and vegetables that haven't been over-processed.
'By planting the rice here it allows us to remind people of the importance
of rice in Japanese society.' Next to the paddy, the foundation has set up
stalls to sell organic vegetables and free-range eggs. The charity has also
arranged for children to visit the site.
The foundation's charitable status allows the venture and the owner to avoid
incurring taxes on the site.
The owner, Mr Sato, says he will decide after the September rice harvest
what to do with the site. 'It depends on the economy. I doubt it'll be a
permanent agricultural field. But I know I won't build a karaoke bar, that's
for sure.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct Line's dazzling growth obscures a less satisfactory aspect to the
results of Royal Bank of Scotland. Its tier 1 capital ratio has fallen
steadily from 7 per cent to 6.5 per cent over the past year. That is still
perfectly comfortable. Yet it does raise the question of whether the bank
can generate enough earnings to finance growth and pay the dividend
increases the market expects. Royal's instinctive response is that excessive
capital dilutes return. The truth could be a bit more complicated.
Direct Line currently absorbs only Pounds 155m of Royal Bank's capital,
which is small in relation to shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.95bn. But
while it continues to grow so fast it will almost certainly need to plough
back its earnings to maintain its solvency margin. Direct Line will take
time to provide the group with distributable earnings. First-half growth
elsewhere was heavily dependent on three factors: falling provisions which
will not last indefinitely, mortgage lending where margins may come under
pressure as competition develops, and acquisitions by its Citizens
subsidiary in the US.
This is not to deny the validity of Royal's strategy of diversification
designed to reduce volatility in its earnings while putting them on a fast
upward track. It is simply that its dividend is more constrained than might
appear from last year's 25 per cent increase. Market disappointment with
yesterday's statement that the full year's payment would be at least 12p -
an increase of 9 per cent - is an indication that expectations were running
away with themselves.

FT  12 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Scottish Power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Power was anxious yesterday to stress that it has no intention of
accumulating a cash mountain. Yet the figures speak for themselves. Gearing
at end-March was a minuscule 0.4 per cent, while 1993-94 net cash inflow
before financing was Pounds 118m. Unless something changes pretty soon, the
group will have piled up a cash molehill by next March if not a mountain.
But chief executive Mr Ian Preston made clear he has no plans to hand back
cash to shareholders through bumper dividends or share buy-backs. He thinks
it will be possible to add greater value by investing cash in the business.
Moreover, he would be comfortable with a 50 per cent gearing ratio -
implying a willingness to take on extra debt of roughly Pounds 500m.
So how will the money be deployed? Some will be spent on building up the
group's gas and telecommunications interests in Scotland. Its ambition to
become an integrated utility operator has merit; gas and telecoms could to
some extent piggy-back on the group's well-run electricity business. But it
is hard to see such organic growth mopping up the cash inflow, let alone
raising gearing.
The suspicion must be that Mr Preston and his team of hungry managers are
eyeing acquisitions. Since an acquisition in the gas exploration business is
not on the cards, the most obvious target would be a regional electricity
company. Shareholders would be sceptical about such a move, particularly if
it involved a hefty bid premium. But, given the strong management, such use
of their cash might just be in their interests.

FT  12 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The natural assumption is that yesterday's German rate cut must be driven by
developments on the foreign exchanges. It is difficult to see anything on
the domestic horizon which would have suggested any particular urgency. The
Bundesbank still had leeway to continue cutting its repurchase rate; M3
money supply is growing at an annualised rate of 15.4 per cent; inflation is
above 3 per cent and there is a whiff of recovery in the air. Curiously the
Bundesbank is now adopting an argument, which it ignored last year, that
high short-term interest rates are deterring investors from moving out along
the yield curve and so keeping bond yields up.
A desire to underpin the dollar after last week's intervention looks an
altogether more plausible motivation. That has some relevance to the
domestic scene. The strength of the D-mark and rise in bond yields since the
start of the year amount to an effective monetary tightening, while a weak
dollar could choke off an export-led recovery. It is less clear whether the
markets will be convinced, or that investors will be keen to buy German
bonds while the uncertainty in the US market continues. Perhaps a generous
German rate cut will hasten the return of calm by reducing the scope of US
monetary tightening required to stabilise the dollar. But that is a pretty
tenuous argument, and not necessarily one for the Bundesbank to risk its
anti-inflation credibility on.

FT  12 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Sainsbury stacks up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The food retailers' nightmare of ever-decreasing margins has been at least
postponed. Although J Sainsbury's margins were shaved last year as it
responded to discounting elsewhere in the sector, the position has now
stabilised. That adds weight to the argument that supermarkets have
experienced a one-off downward adjustment rather than the start of a
relentless squeeze. But it is too early to say the pain is over. If a
competitor breaches the uneasy truce on margins, Sainsbury will have little
option but to respond.
By promising Pounds 65m annual cost savings - equivalent to 0.75 percentage
points of net margin in supermarkets - the group has created some breathing
space. It has also arrested the decline in sales which sent the shares into
a spin following January's trading statement. Still, like for like sales
growth of 0.5 per cent in the final eight weeks of the financial year is
hardly a huge reward considering the cost of the essential-for-essentials
campaign. Even allowing that new store openings are performing well, the
market has good reasons for not chasing the shares higher.
With its non-supermarket businesses performing well and its formidable
capacity to generate cash, Sainsbury has the scope to look for growth
elsewhere. If margins do indeed stabilise and capital spending continues to
fall, it will soon look under-geared. Adding to Shaw's in the US would make
good sense, as would building on the success of Homebase. Given its critical
mass in UK supermarkets, though, it will take more than piecemeal expansion
to re-establish Sainsbury as a growth stock.

FT  12 MAY 94 / BA ready to defy French ban on flights to Orly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday set the stage for a clash with British
airlines after declaring that flights from London to Orly airport in Paris
could not start on Monday, the date set by British Airways and Air UK for
the launch of their services.
The announcement follows last month's European Commission ruling ordering
France to open the London-Orly route immediately and is likely to fuel the
dispute over the liberalisation of the French airline market.
BA rejected the statement from the French government and said it planned to
go ahead with services to Orly. 'The French authorities have no right to
prevent us from going there. We have the landing rights and we are preparing
to operate to and from Orly from Monday,' said a BA spokesman.
Air UK said it also intended to operate services from Monday.
Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, said the route would be
opened as quickly as possible but that certain problems had to be resolved
before services could start. 'For now . . . the flights announced for May 16
do not respect the regulations and therefore cannot take place,' Mr Bosson
said.
He said there were three problems to be resolved. They were the overcrowding
of Orly airport; the need to assure adequate access to Heathrow airport for
companies wishing to serve the Orly-Heathrow route; and the need for
airlines to adapt their schedules to include the new routes.
BA said it did not recognise the basis of the problems. It said there had
been no difficulty in obtaining slots at Orly and that it had already made
arrangements for handling passengers. With regard to landing rights at
Heathrow, BA said there were established procedures for applying for slots.
Orly airport, in southern Paris, offers better connections for internal
French flights than Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport and is more convenient
for many business and residential areas of the capital.
BA is planning two flights a day between Heathrow and Orly, with two other
flights being operated by TAT, its French affiliate. Air UK, in which KLM of
the Netherlands has a 14.9 per cent stake, is planning to operate between
London Stansted and Orly. The issue represents a dilemma for the French
government which is seeking approval from the European Commission for a
FFr20bn (Pounds 2.34bn) capital injection for Air France, the loss-making
state-owned airline. Brussels has linked approval of the capital injection
to the liberalisation of the French airline market.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Brussels seeks faster removal of curbs on telecom services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is preparing plans to accelerate the liberalisation
of the telecommunications market in Europe, including proposals to allow
cable television companies to compete with state telecoms monopolies.
The deregulation drive reflects the view in Brussels that the timetable for
the 12 EU member states to dismantle barriers in the European telecoms
market by January 1 1998 is being overtaken by market forces.
Acceleration would be selective, but would still amount to a minor
revolution, a senior Commission official said, adding: 'Certain people will
lose some of their privileges.'
According to drafts circulating in Brussels, the proposals fall short of
allowing operators to set up alternative voice networks. This is in line
with the agreement to delay full liberalisation of telecom services until
1998.
Plans to allow cable television networks in Europe to introduce services,
such as telebanking or closed user networks, would nevertheless give a
fillip to the manufacturing and software sectors.
It would also offer an enticing market for British companies which, alone in
Europe, have been allowed to operate freely in this sector for the past two
years.
But a Commission-led push to introduce alternative networks risks running
into opposition from state monopoly operators, such as France Telecom and
Telefonica of Spain, which view the deadline as sacrosanct.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EU industry commissioner, is leading the debate on
liberalisation. He is chairing a group of industrialists reporting on how
Europe can exploit new information technologies in health, banking and
telecoms. The group will submit recommendations to the 12 heads of
government at the European summit in Corfu next month.
Mr Bangemann is said to be reluctant to scrap the deadline outright because
it was based on a 'fragile consensus' between a UK-led liberalising lobby
and the traditionalists grouped around France, Spain and Greece. But, along
with Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, he believes there are
ways of working round the deadline and speeding liberalisation.
One EU official said there was a consensus in Brussels that deregulation was
inevitable, but the Bangemann group had to recognise political constraints.
'The message must be clear, credible and operational,' he said.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Paradise too good to be true: Hong Kong banks are enjoying
bumper profits. But will they last?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seen at night from the Star Ferry as it makes its way across Victoria
Harbour towards Kowloon on the mainland, Hong Kong's banks gleam brighter
than ever. The political uncertainty afflicting the colony in the last years
of British rule has not damaged the ability of the 175 banks to earn money
in what is now the most profitable banking market in the world.
Banks in the colony commonly make post-tax returns on equity of more than 20
per cent - twice that of banks in many European countries. But such profits
may not last forever. Banks are already mulling the likely effects of
Chinese rule after July 1997; some wonder if earnings will deteriorate
before then.
'We live in a fool's paradise, and they never last long,' says Mr Werner
Makowski, managing director of Dao Heng Bank, one of the biggest banks in
Hong Kong. 'We've had 10 years of growth, and bad debts are ridiculously
low,' says Mr Tony Nicolle, Hong Kong general manager at Standard Chartered,
the UK-listed international bank with roots in the colony.
The fool's paradise might yet end with a painful correction similar to that
in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries at
the end of the 1980s, when bad debts cut heavily into profits. But most
local bankers think it is more likely to give way to a gradual squeeze on
earnings. 'You cannot rule out the risk of collapse (in profits), but it is
not my best guess,' says Mr David Carse, the chief banking supervisor for
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Earnings will come under pressure because Hong Kong will find it hard to
maintain the exceptional combination of factors which have boosted bank
profits in the past three years: The Hong Kong economy has been expanding
rapidly, achieving growth of more than 5 per cent in each of the past two
years. It has been boosted by free-market reforms in China, which have led
to buoyant economic growth in the Pearl River delta adjacent to Hong Kong.
Fast growth in surrounding Asia Pacific economies - averaging more than 6
per cent over the past decade - has also led to strong demand for loans and
trade finance.
Despite the recent growth in bond issues, Hong Kong companies have
traditionally sought debt finance from banks rather than capital markets.
This has underpinned a steady expansion in balance sheets - bank loans in
Hong Kong grew by 15.4 per cent in the year to last September. Borrowing has
been encouraged by negative real interest rates forced on the colony by the
exchange rate 'peg' between the Hong Kong and US dollars. Hong Kong has been
obliged to keep interest rates low despite inflation of 8.5 per cent last
year. 'There is a huge demand for credit. Borrowing money is the cheapest
thing you can do here,' says Mr Makowski.
Banks have managed to sustain the so-called 'cartel' - or interest rate
agreement - under which the Hong Kong Association of Banks formally sets
interest rates paid on Hong Kong dollar deposits of less than HKDollars
500,000. By keeping rates artificially low, the arrangement has bolstered
the net interest margin (the gap between interest rates paid on deposits and
charged on loans).
The level of bad debts has been extremely low, at less than 0.2 per cent of
loans, compared with 10 times that in some OECD countries. Hong Kong bankers
say that this is not only because of rapid growth and full employment, but
local culture. 'People just do not default on loans here,' says Mr Stephen
Li, a banking analyst at Jardine Fleming, the securities house.
These factors have sustained Hong Kong's banks at a time when many elsewhere
have been in crisis. Yet although no calamity has yet struck the colony,
investors have lost much of last year's confidence in its banks: share
prices of Hong Kong banks have fallen by an average of 35 per cent from a
peak in February. In part this drop reflects the 27 per cent fall in the
Hang Seng index over the same period, as international fund managers'
euphoria about Asian markets has dissipated. Yet there is also unease over
whether Hong Kong banks' profits can be sustained. There are three main
pressures:
First, Hong Kong banks do not want to continue making new property loans at
a rate that might create an asset price bubble. 'It will remain a very
profitable market, but it cannot continue to grow at the same rate. That
would be dangerous,' says Mr Paul Selway-Swift, executive director of
Hongkong Bank.
Banks also face pressure from regulators. The prime example is in the
domestic mortgage market. There has been strong demand for loans in the past
three years as prices of flats have escalated, and the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority has set limits on borrowings and warned banks of the risk of
mounting bad debts. The maximum ratio of mortgage loan to value of property
is now 70 per cent, and it is hard to get more than a 50 per cent mortgage
on luxury flats. 'We are getting to the stage where banks' huge increases in
mortgage lending will be constrained,' says Mr Carse of the monetary
authority.
Second, margins will erode as banks use accumulated capital to compete. The
interest rate agreement has restrained competition but there is pressure for
its abolition from the Hong Kong Consumer Council, which estimates that it
boosted bank profits by HKDollars 5.2bn in 1991. The council argues this was
largely at the expense of small consumers. The banks maintain that the
cartel reinforces stability and avoids the need for them to impose fees and
charges that could cost consumers HKDollars 4bn a year. Yet few bankers are
optimistic that margins can be sustained indefinitely. 'I do not foresee
dramatic change, but over time profitability will be gradually chipped
away,' says Mr Nicolle of Standard Chartered.
Third, banks' costs are rising. Hong Kong has traditionally been a cheap
place to operate. Because the colony is so compact, banks have been able to
use technology and staff efficiently. However, salaries are rising fast
because of stiff competition for employees, and banks that rent branches and
offices face a sharp escalation in rental costs.
A gradual deterioration in the banking conditions of the past three years
would not constitute a disaster. The possibility remains, however, of banks
being hit more severely if investors lost confidence in China's commitment
to economic reform. A policy shift by China could badly disrupt Hong Kong's
economy and undermine local property prices.
Prices for the residential property market are thought to have fallen by
about 10 per cent since Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, warned in
March that the government might have to take 'exceptional' measures to curb
speculation. But they remain vulnerable to a further correction as Hong
Kong's interest rates rise in response to the tightening of US monetary
policy.
Banks in the colony depend strongly on property - 39 per cent of their
profits are estimated to be linked to the sector. For the moment, most
bankers believe they are unlikely to be hit by a wave of defaults on
mortgages: the average proportion of income spent on repayments is only
two-thirds of the peak level in 1981.
That cushion might be insufficient if an economic downturn led to large
falls in property prices and higher unemployment. But for most bankers, this
seems an unlikely prospect. Though the windfall profits of the early 1990s
may not be repeated, even those who acknowledge the risks ahead cannot bring
themselves to worry too much. 'It is all too good to be true,' says Mr
Makowski of Dao Heng Bank. 'But while it lasts, why not enjoy it?'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Leading Article: CrossRail debacle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to build CrossRail, a new east-west rail line across London, have been
thrown into disarray by a small committee of MPs. It has blocked the passage
of the bill needed to allow the line to be built, to the horror of the
project's backers and London businesses. The future of CrossRail is now in
doubt, with substantial delay inevitable even if the government introduces a
fresh bill.
The case for building CrossRail was convincingly demonstrated in the Central
London Rail Study five years ago. The study identified the line as the most
effective option for relieving congestion on the existing rail network and
catering for future growth. Yet it is the much less cost-effective Jubilee
line extension to London's Docklands that is now being built. It was given
the go-ahead largely, it appears, as a political gesture to bail out the
Canary Wharf development.
Those who oppose CrossRail - including the Treasury - point to the drop in
central London traffic since 1989. Because of the recession, they forecast
that the new rail link will not be needed until well into the next century.
This short-sighted approach is sadly typical of UK transport planning:
almost every major project from the M25 to the Manchester Metro has found
use growing much faster than forecast. On the basis of a short-term economic
fluctuation, a project has been blocked that would serve London for decades.
This debacle is the latest in a long line of transport planning failures in
the UK's recent history. Like the Channel tunnel rail link and the
Birmingham north orbital road, CrossRail will be completed long after it is
needed - if ever. It need not be so, as the experience of other European
countries indicates. The contrast with France is painful: its high-speed
rail network was extended to the mouth of the Channel tunnel months before
it opened.
A more effective approach is needed to setting transport priorities.
Ministers should make decisions on the basis of transport criteria, not
political expediency. Once agreed, funds should be committed and not
withdrawn at the whim of the Treasury. Planning transport infrastructure is
something that only government has the power to do: the present procedures
are hopelessly inadequate.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Bundesbank cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The timing and size, though not the direction, of the Bundesbank's latest
interest rate cuts were a surprise. A cut of half a percentage point in the
discount rate, to 4.5 per cent, is an aggressive move, particularly when the
repurchase (or 'repo') rate remained well above its previous discount rate
floor. Combined with the torrid growth of the money supply, this cut must be
deemed risky. The Bundesbank's traditional monetarism is in question. If the
risk it is taking does not prove justified in the medium term, Germany's
reputation for monetary stability may be endangered as well.
The last time the discount rate was this low was in June 1989, though prior
to that it had been at, or below, this level for more than six years. But
German consumer price inflation, though declining, is still running at an
annual rate of over 3 per cent and, more important for Bundesbank
credibility, the annualised increase of broad money (M3) between the last
quarter of 1993 and March 1994 was 15.4 per cent.
How then does the Bundesbank justify the latest of this series of interest
rate cuts, which have lowered the discount rate by 1 1/4 percentage points
and the repurchase rate by 65 basis points (0.65 percentage points) since
February? It points to the improved prospects for inflation and the need to
loosen a 'liquidity blockage', by which it means the willingness of
investors to hold liquid deposits, included in M3, rather than less liquid
assets. An additional factor will have been the strength of the D-Mark. Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, argued only a week ago that too strong
an appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar was not in the interests of
the German economy.
The current performance of the German economy can justify this latest series
of cuts. Industrial output has been bumping along the bottom since the end
of 1992, while gross domestic product, though recovering, remains well below
the peak in early 1992. The declining rate of inflation and the low level of
wage settlements also justify expansionary moves.
Against this are not only the money supply, but also the performance of
German bonds: the yield on 10-year bonds rose by 109 basis points, to 6.63
per cent between the beginning of January and Tuesday of this week. While
less than in the US or the UK, this increase demonstrates that inflationary
fears have not been slain. At the same time, the special factors that are
used to explain the rapid growth of M3 are less than convincing. It is also
not true that M3 growth would necessarily decline if people were prepared to
shift into less liquid deposits. The principal determinant of broad money is
credit growth, which may even be increased by the lower interest rates and
recovering economy.
It was easier to justify rapid cuts in German interest rates a year ago than
it is now, which suggests that the Tietmeyer Bundesbank is different from
that of his predecessor, Mr Helmut Schlesinger. This is not the first time
policymakers have decided to explain away inconvenient monetary numbers, one
particularly sad example being the UK in the second half of the 1980s. It is
to be hoped that the Bundesbank is not making a comparable mistake.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Italy's new government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the swearing-in yesterday of Mr Silvio Berlusconi at the head of its
53rd postwar government, Italy has truly entered uncharted waters. Not only
is the new government uncomfortably low on political experience, as was only
to be expected after a general election in which voters decisively threw out
representatives of the old political order. It is also led by a man who has
yet to resolve the conflicts of interest between his business empire and his
political role, and comprises bedfellows whose heterogeneity and distaste
for one another were underlined by the opera buffa of coalition haggling
over the past six weeks.
Most eye-catchingly, perhaps, it is the first government since the war to
contain representatives of a party, the MSI, that has not repudiated links
with Italy's fascist past and that is not committed to all Italy's
international treaties. Another coalition member, the Northern League, has
in the past come close to advocating the break-up of the country. Small
wonder that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro took the unprecedented step of
publicly warning the new prime minister to respect Italy's international
obligations and alliances and to maintain its national unity.
Yet the real reason to worry about Mr Berlusconi's creation is not that it
summons echos of a relatively distant past. It is that it may prove
incapable of dealing with the challenges of the present - paramount among
them the economy, still in the early stages of a fragile recovery and
burdened by a mountainous public debt.
On the face of it, the new government offers some reassurance on this score
in the shape of Mr Lamberto Dini, plucked from the Bank of Italy to run the
Treasury. But even he is something of a political novice - and his is but
one voice in a coalition dominated by competing power-brokers. Moreover, he
will be only too well aware of how the most powerful broker of all won
election: on the basis of tax-cutting and job-creating promises that were,
to put it charitably, over-optimistic.
Were Mr Dini to be forced into trying to deliver Mr Berlusconi's false dawn,
he would be putting at risk the project of economic renewal painfully
initiated by the Amato and Ciampi governments of the past two years - and
with it, Italy's financial credibility.
Their brave battle against swelling budget deficits merely contained the
problem rather than resolving it: already there has been disturbing slippage
in spending and receipts, with the result that the deficit this year will be
close to 10 per cent of GDP notwithstanding the relief afforded by falling
interest rates. Similarly, the two previous governments may have begun the
lengthy process of privatising state enterprises, but the really difficult
parts of that task still lie ahead, and the new coalition is beset by
confusion as to how to proceed.
Mr Berlusconi should use his first speech to parliament to junk his campaign
rhetoric in favour of a firm statement of economic intent, with discipline
in public finances and rapid privatisation as top priorities. As a newcomer
to politics with a strong mandate, he can afford to be radical in this
direction. If he instead tries to please those who believed his election
promises, Italians will discover that the new order for which they thought
they voted is no better than the old.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Personal View: Why London should be a zone alone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PARMITER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opinion polls show overwhelming support for doing something about London.
Something to promote the capital's cause, to co-ordinate the myriad public
agencies responsible for its facilities - something or someone to shout for
London.
There is much less agreement on what that something should be. The left
argues for a powerful London-wide body, probably an upper tier of local
government. The right questions whether there is a problem at all, and looks
for ways of getting business and community leaders talking to one another.
The business community has a particular perspective and contribution to make
to this debate. It is primarily concerned with London as a business
location. The key to making London the most successful European business
location is the central area where economic and business activities are
concentrated. This covers the area within the Circle line of the
underground, Zone 1 on the London underground map.
As well as businesses, Zone 1 contains residential communities, government
offices and cultural activities. Most of Zone 1 is in the City of London and
City of Westminster. But parts are governed by other boroughs: Camden, Tower
Hamlets, Hackney, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Wandsworth, Lambeth and
Southwark.
The centres of Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo, by contrast, are under single
local authorities. Even chaotic New York has only four boroughs - and they
are overseen by a dominant city-wide government.
London needs a single local authority for its central business district, a
Zone 1 authority. It would take responsibility for functions such as
promotion, planning, transport, education and housing. Last week's local
elections have emphasised the need for such an authority, given that nine of
the 10 local authorities are, at best, ambivalent towards business
development and, at worst, hostile.
The Zone 1 authority would be charged with delivering quality services and
managing change through the planning system. It could also take over some
additional functions from government (or quangos) such as conservation,
policing and traffic management. The new Zone 1 authority would concentrate
on those functions which it can do best. Debate over London's strategic
planning and regional development should be left to other bodies, whether
national or regional, in view of the complexities and geographical influence
of the capital.
The Zone 1 local authority should adopt the best practices and the most
attractive features of the City of Westminster and the City of London. The
City Corporation, which administers the City of London, is largely
controlled by business representatives. It has been able to reflect the
interests of the businesses that dominate the Square Mile and ensure its
continuation as one of the world's leading financial centres.
The City Corporation's business franchise would be inappropriate for a
larger area that included the substantial residential areas of Westminster.
But it should not be completely eliminated: responsiveness to businesses'
wishes will be an essential attribute of the Zone 1 authority. An electoral
system needs to be found that reflects business voters' wishes and local
democratic interests - a blend of the two cities' practices. Indeed, a body
promoting central London's wider interests might well have been able to help
get approval for the CrossRail underground railway link, which was blocked
by a Commons committee on Tuesday.
The historic position of Lord Mayor of London should be maintained as a
figurehead for the new authority with enormous promotional value. The title
of Mayor of Westminster could be given to the leader of the council, who
actually wields political control.
The stewardship exercised by the City of London over the capital's bridges,
parks, heaths and other public facilities could be maintained and extended
to Hyde Park and St James's. The Corporation's patronage of the arts could
embrace the West End, the South Bank complex and many other facilities.
Central London is divided. The two cities upon which its wealth is built
continue as separate entities at the expense of London's business community
as a whole. Blending the best of both, and accepting that London is larger
than both, is the essence of the Zone 1 plan.
It challenges the City of London and its strong local traditions to reach
forward to support a solution that can ensure London's status as a world
city into the 21st century. It challenges the City of Westminster to widen
its promotional concerns to embrace fully business as a wider London
interest.

What's this? Mark Wood, new managing director of AA Insurance Services - the
UK's biggest chain of insurance shops - regularly holds business breakfasts
and lunches at the RAC Club. But surely the Automobile Association and the
Royal Automobile Club are bitter rivals?
'It is out of habit really,' he says, quickly displaying evidence of his
membership of both the AA and the RAC. And Wood, currently spearheading a
big cost-cutting exercise at AA Insurance, says he is happy to see the rival
RAC bear the cost of upkeeping its lavish Pall Mall premises.
Devilish cunning, eh?

Roll up, roll up, anyone want to buy a theatre?
It's not a bad time to own a slice of London's West End. Ticket sales rose 6
per cent last year to a record 11.5m.
The theatre now in the limelight is the spankingly refurbished Playhouse,
down by the Embankment, which Ray Cooney bought two years ago for Pounds
2.4m after Lord Archer couldn't make a go of it.
'I'll take Pounds 2.7m,' says Cooney, who found that owning a theatre
interfered with his preferred occupation of comedy writing. He is fairly
relaxed about the small loss he made running it: 'Theatres are not
investments which make a return of 10 or 20 per cent a year. They are just a
delight to own.'
With just 786 seats, The Playhouse is too small for the money-spinning,
long-running musicals. But the lure of the footlights, the thrill of the
first nights, should tempt some optimistic angel, perhaps in New York - or
even Hong Kong, where Cooney is pitching hard.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So who was the senior US official who shook Fidel Castro's hand in Pretoria
at Nelson Mandela's swearing-in and extracted from the Cuban president a
compliment for being 'a brave man' for so doing?
The Washington Post, which reported the incident, would not say. But the Los
Angeles Times pointed the finger at Mike Espy, the agriculture secretary.
It also said that Espy was far from alone and that several White House aides
had their pictures taken with Castro in a reception maelstrom. 'Can't you
even play tourist?' asked one. 'I mean, I turned around and there he was.'
Disciplinary action for consorting with the enemy is unlikely. Bill Clinton
is not about to sacrifice a black cabinet member for a handshake and he
hardly needs to have more vacancies on the White House staff.
Mind you, if Hillary had extended her hand, the Wall Street Journal would
already have written an editorial and Castrogate would be in full swing.

With less than a month to go, reverberations from the D-Day fiasco continue
to rumble in the UK. But it's a very touchy subject.
Latest offering is purported to derive from Michael Baldwin, keeper of
weapons at the National Army Museum in Chelsea: 'It's a good job those
organising the D-Day celebrations didn't organise the actual invasion - they
wouldn't have got beyond the beach.'
Not at all, says Baldwin, who runs the MoD-sponsored museum. 'It would be
most improper to suggest I originated that,' he says. So he didn't say it?
'Well, everybody is saying it, aren't they - but I am not the originator.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Observer: Gravy train in the air
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'Me, travel business class?' Chad's Pierre Moussa, not to be confused with
the former Paribas chairman, is the longest-serving executive director at
the African Development Bank and scoffs at the very suggestion. He has
always travelled first class; his reputation depends on it.
Absolutely.
Unfazed by last year's fuss over Jacques Attali's free-spending ways at the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the AfDB is the only
multilateral development bank which still flies all its big cheeses in the
very best seats.
Downgrading to business class is a pretty feeble symbolic gesture, reckons
Moussa, even for a bank ministering to the the world's poorest continent.
Never mind the AfDB's mounting arrears - owed by bankrupt African
governments - and suspected internal mismanagement.
Still, the AfDB gravy train could be endangered. In the kind of radical
gesture loved by indolent bureaucracies, some of the bank's richer donor
nations may try to prevent AfDB directors flying to Paris for dental
appointments on the bank's expenses.
Moussa - on the board for 19 years - is rather irritated by proposals to
limit board membership to two years. Such ideas, he says, are typical of the
'small civil servants' from western countries who occupy six of the 18 seats
on the AfDB's executive board.
'He's a dinosaur,' responds one of the 'small civil servants'.

One Man's Environmental Crusade
By Pete Wilkinson with Julia Schofield
Lutterworth Press, Pounds 17.50, 142 pages
'You can't sink a rainbow', their lapel badges proclaimed. But on the
morning of July 10 1985, Pete Wilkinson and other board members of
Greenpeace International, planning an anti-whaling campaign from a hotel
room in Bournemouth, Dorset, received a reverse-charge call from New Zealand
telling them that their flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, had been sunk by two
explosions. One crew member died.
It emerged that the blasts were caused by explosives deliberately attached
to the hull, and that French secret agents were responsible. The
international condemnation that followed brought Greenpeace, already one of
the world's best-known environmental pressure groups, greater prominence.
For Wilkinson, a leading campaigner for Greenpeace in the UK since its early
days in the 1970s, the evidence of the violence which their protests could
provoke was a turning point, which 'forced me to make the transition from
the idealism of the '70s into the harsh reality of the '80s'.
But Wilkinson also makes clear that the sinking coincided with - and may
have accelerated - a change in Greenpeace's character. From a small band of
penniless conservationists in the 1970s, it now spans 30 countries with an
annual worldwide income from donations of Dollars 150m.
In this entertaining chronicle, Wilkinson makes the charge that, during this
transformation, Greenpeace has 'lost direction'. It has become bureaucratic,
he claims, staffed with lawyers and well-paid administrators with
briefcases, who are unwilling to don rubber suits to stop up the outlet
pipes of industrial plants.
This metamorphosis is characteristic of many 'green' pressure groups, he
alleges. In his view, 'the green movement has faced a difficult time since
(the mid-1980s). Some would say it has been neutered. It is certainly less
radical'.
He bases his case on a comparison of present sophistication with the
enthusiasm of campaigns in the early 1970s, even though methods then were
sometimes amateurish. In one campaign for Friends of the Earth, he and his
colleagues set out to collect non-returnable soft drinks bottles from
streets to deliver to Schweppes, the manufacturer, in protest at the litter.
Failing to find enough, they were forced to buy hundreds of bottles and
poured the fizzy drink into vats. (Friends of the Earth says this manoeuvre
would be unthinkable now.)
Despite the group's rapid growth, the hippy element remained strong for
years. Wilkinson describes campaigners dancing naked under the Antarctic
sun.
But the group's interest in attracting media attention developed rapidly. A
1985 BBC documentary 'netted Greenpeace a cool Pounds 100,000 in boosted
donations and membership', he says. When an assault on the Department of the
Environment's tower block failed to attract immediate publicity, Wilkinson
urged a colleague to call the police. His anxiety subsided only when 'a
squad car came screaming up and I heard the familiar words: 'Wilkinson,
you're nicked' '.
Despite those self-conscious heroics, Wilkinson is an engagingly
self-deprecating narrator. He notes he 'never quite seemed to be given
responsibility': he is not, he makes clear, one of the natural stars of the
green movement.
But beyond the details of Greenpeace's evolution, his account illustrates
how the green movement built up public support and how the nature of
campaigning has changed.
'When Greenpeace had grown to be a sought-after prize, control of the
organisation was to preoccupy the time of many people,' he says. From 1981
Greenpeace began to build a formal structure, linking all the national
branches, which Wilkinson found claustrophobic. It led, he says, to
'computer and communications technology as could be found in the offices of
Rio Tinto Zinc or ICI'.
Wilkinson himself, with the sound of Jimi Hendrix blaring in the background,
finally drafted his resignation letter in 1987. Since then, there is
evidence that green groups have tried to address some of the flaws he
identifies. In 1990 Greenpeace began to trim some of its internal hierarchy.
Chris Rose, campaigns director of Greenpeace UK, says: 'We are trying to put
more of our resources into the front line - though I know that sounds like
the reform of the National Health Service.'
But he contests many of Wilkinson's charges. According to Rose, 'we are as
keen to engage in direct actions as ever, but effectiveness is now the main
question'. He points out that when Greenpeace blocked British Nuclear Fuels'
discharge pipe off the Cumbrian coast in 1987, 'two people went to jail and
the plant carried on'. Instead, last year, in trying to stop BNF's Thorp
reprocessing plant, Greenpeace took BNF and the government to court.
Although in the end Greenpeace lost, it delayed the start of operations for
a year.
Rose also points out that targets have become more difficult to find: some
of the worst cases of pollution - such as sewage, or dumping highly coloured
titanium oxide waste - have been addressed. The group now needs lawyers and
researchers because, frequently, the cause of pollution 'is not clear cut',
he says.
Greenpeace will now also talk to big business: it recently helped
manufacturers develop a fridge that does not harm the ozone layer.
Rose, one of the green movement's more thoughtful strategists, is surely
right that the pressure groups needed to change in these ways. While
Wilkinson can be accused of nostalgia on many counts, he raises an important
question: whether Greenpeace's supporters are reconciled to this change. If
they are not, and if their donations are still inspired by the images of
heroic campaigns, then Greenpeace's income and influence may eventually be
threatened by its growing sophistication.

   From Mr DENIS MACSHANE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have just finished a by-election campaign in Rotherham. The number
one issue for local people, businessmen, and executives of steel and
engineering companies was the parlous state of the UK manufacturing sector.
At a time when every ounce of talent, co-operation and partnership is needed
to save British manufacturing from its 'friends' in the City and their
friends in government, it was sad to read the attack by the director-general
of the Engineering Employers' Federation upon the proposals for European
employee consultation (Letters, May 9).
To return after 15 years working in Europe to hear this age-old hostility to
partnership is depressing and bad news for UK manufacturing, face to face
with competitor nations which seek to harness the efforts of workers and the
commitment of unions to the common good of the enterprise.
You also reported an appeal by multinationals for new international
regulation, in the form of a treaty, so that companies are not discriminated
against as they invest in different countries ('Multinationals seek
investment treaty', May 9). The growing internationalisation of investment,
production and marketing is leading to more and more calls for such
trans-frontier regulation. It is illogical to assume that there can be
common supra-national rules for companies and for capital and expect, on the
other hand, that the human beings and citizens who work for these companies
are denied common rights of consultation across frontiers.
Until the UK's manufacturers agree to make common cause with their employees
and their representative organisations, the long-term future for UK industry
will remain bleak.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consultants: the alibi for indecision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS STACEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As you reported ('Whitehall waste over consultancy projects attacked',
April 26), more than half a billion pounds has been spent by the government
and its agencies on consultancy contracts; but all of this expenditure saved
only Pounds 10m, a derisory return. However, the total expenditure incurred
on consultants is likely to be immeasurably greater in real terms - though
unquantifiable - when including the tens, if not hundreds of thousands of
man hours spent by well-paid civil service employees in the ministries,
quangos etc explaining the problems to the consultants.
The importance of qualified professional consultants should not be
underrated - and in this instance I have management consultants in mind.
Their effectiveness in 'the firm' hinges substantially on the support and
co-operation of the insiders. Hence, the derisory government savings reflect
some inadequacies in communicating with and in using consultants.
A cult has grown up in the past decade or two, enlisting an increasing
number of outside professional consultants in government, and in the
National Health Service (counsellors). Judged by the government's propensity
for paid outside advice and the cost incurred, has this trend gone too far?
Could it be that consultants often provide the alibi for decisions
managements know they have to take? A director of one of the big banks not
so long ago asked shareholders at the annual meeting for a hike in the
non-executives' honorarium in a year of massive losses and redundancies.
When asked from the floor to justify his proposition, he replied: the
consultants suggested it]
Such and similar examples are an expensive way of passing on
responsibilities for action taken or contemplated. I wrote a book about
'Living in an alibi society' a few years ago; I am now watching it being
realised.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Own brand look-alikes are 'parasites'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MURPHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On Tuesday, the British Producers and Brand Owners Group published
research which shows that consumers feel that distinctive brands are
important and that they are confused by look-alike products.
There is a world of difference between a retailer's own-label and its
look-alike products. Own-label products represent fair competition.
Look-alikes that deliberately assume the characteristics of market-leading
brands are parasites and represent unfair competition.
Retailers operate in a competitive marketplace. They know the value of a
distinctive brand name as well as anyone else. So why do they produce
look-alikes?
Have things become so dire for retailers that they have had to resort to
deception for their sales? The challenge now to retailers is to listen to
the voice of the consumer and package their own products as distinctive
brands in their own right. The question is: will they?

Sir, Your statement that the new IoD director-general's salary is to
increase from Peter Morgan's Pounds 148,000 to Pounds 180,000 ('Nationwide
chief to head IoD', May 5) is not correct.
The present director-general receives a salary of Pounds 148,000, plus a
pension contribution of Pounds 30,000 - a total remuneration package of
Pounds 178,000.
The new director-general will receive a salary of Pounds 160,000 and a
pension contribution of approximately Pounds 20,000 - a total remuneration
package of Pounds 180,000, and this salary will be frozen for three years.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Single currency rises again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most UK proponents of a European Union referendum are stu-diously vague on
what should be asked and when. The merger of sterling into a common European
currency would, on the other hand, be the type of constitutional change
justifying a referendum, not now, but at the time it was proposed. UK
ministers are, moreover, deceiving themselves if they believe that the issue
has conveniently gone away, as it seemed it might have done a few months
ago.
At the beginning of August 1993, the old 2 1/4 per cent exchange rate
mechanism grid succumbed to a speculative attack. An emergency meeting of
finance ministers widened the grid to 15 per cent on either side of the
central parities. This was so broad as to constitute virtually freely
floating rates. The Euro-sceptics could hardly restrain their joy. The
derailment of the ERM would, they hoped, put paid to the more ambitious
European Monetary Union project.
But then a strange thing happened. The French government did not take
advantage of its freedom from ERM constraints to slash interest rates, but
continued to follow the Bundesbank lead. And the franc, instead of diving
like sterling and the lira after they left the ERM, recovered. It re-entered
the old grid at the beginning of last December and has not strayed far from
it since. The fundamentals of a better-than-German inflation performance
reasserted themselves over the instant cynicism of the currency markets.
A similar story with minor variations applies to the other 'core' members of
the ERM, including the Belgian-Luxembourg franc and the Danish krone. The
Netherlands guilder has remained within even narrower limits. And the
Austrian schilling - technically outside the ERM - has remained close to the
D-Mark.
There is room for argument about whether the French and other governments
were right to stick so long within the narrow ERM bands without a
re-alignment in view of the long period of high German interest rates. But
having kept to the policy during the most difficult period, it would be an
unnecessary sacrifice of counter-inflationary credibility - as well as of
wider political aims - to abandon the D-Mark related policy now, just when
German interest rates are approaching levels with which neighbours can live.
It is worth noting that, although the UK was able to cut interest rates
early as a result of leaving the ERM, British short-term rates are now no
lower than French or German ones; and long-term rates are 1-1 1/2 percentage
points higher - the market's verdict on the credibility of a go-it-alone
policy without an independently accountable central bank.
Where do we go from here? An EU summit has to decide not later than December
31 1996 whether a majority of member states fulfil the necessary conditions
for the adoption of a single currency.
The summit can fix a date for Emu at any time during 1997 and 1998. If,
however, a date has not been set by the end of 1997, 'the third stage (ie,
Emu) shall start on January 1 1999'. Another summit, voting by qualified
majority, will decide which members fulfil the necessary conditions. There
is no minimum number. Conditions which Emu participants must satisfy are:
A rate of inflation 'close to that of the three best performing states';
Convergence of long-term interest rates;
A 'sustainable government financial position';
The observance of 'the normal fluctuation margins' of the ERM 'for at least
two years without devaluing against the currency of any other member state'.
The two EU countries with the lowest inflation rate are France and Ireland
with a rate of less than 2 per cent a year. The UK, Belgium and Luxembourg
tie for third position with 2.3 per cent, followed by Germany with 3.2 per
cent and the Netherlands with 3.9 per cent. The convergence of long-term
bond yields has gone even further for the core countries, where they stand
at about 6 1/2 -7 per cent.
The fiscal guidelines appear the most troublesome. A Maastricht protocol
mentions a budget deficit limit of 3 per cent of gross domestic product and
a debt ratio not exceeding 60 per cent. Only Luxembourg and Ireland
fulfilled the deficit criteria last year. The Bundesbank is particularly
keen on these criteria, and would be unlikely to recommend giving up the
D-Mark if they were too obviously flouted. Nevertheless the Maastricht
treaty itself provides (Article 104c) escape provisions if the excess
deficit is 'exceptional and temporary' or if the excess is declining.
The central condition remains the final one about exchange rate behaviour.
The treaty says nothing about the narrow 2 1/4 per cent band. Thus,
theoretically, members could declare the present 15 per cent margins to be
the normal ones. But it is inconceivable they will move to Emu if market
exchange rates are fluctuating throughout the wide band.
The French and the other governments are not disposed to tempt fate by
re-entering a narrow official ERM grid in the foreseeable future. What they
are doing is to commit an even greater crime in Euro-sceptic eyes - namely
shadowing the D-Mark. This means that in the face of a determined currency
attack there will be no firm floor for the speculators to aim at, and there
could be temporary dips, such as that in the last few months of 1993. But
monetary policy will be conducted with the aim of keeping currencies near to
the D-Mark.
If the inner group currencies remain de facto close to their central rates,
the governments concerned may move directly to monetary union, bypassing the
narrow ERM stage. This route has been envisaged for these countries by,
among others, Eddie George, Bank of England governor.
The crucial step provided for in the Maastricht treaty is for the
participating governments to declare their parities 'irrevocably fixed'.
After that - and a good deal of preparation - existing currencies would be
replaced by the Ecu.
Such developments would not be entertained until the European Union is
clearly out of recession and German unification no longer distorts policy.
Some governments might then want to move quickly while conditions remain
right, and before too many other countries had joined Italy in acquiring
Euro-sceptics in important government posts.
To those who are neither federalists nor nationalists the relevant questions
are clear enough. A single currency means a single monetary policy tailored
to the average needs of the EU as a whole, just as Federal Reserve policy is
designed for average US conditions rather than the particular needs of
California or New England. Would the advantages in reduced uncertainty and
transaction costs outweigh the disadvantages of not being able to follow a
monetary policy adapted (within limits) to the needs of particular parts of
Europe? And what would be the gain for countries of doubtful
counter-inflationary credibility - as the UK still is - from substituting a
European currency under a European Central Bank modelled on the Bundesbank
for its own? It would also be necessary to cast a weather eye on the
likelihood of the new ECB being just as vigilant to avoid contractionary
movements of nominal demand as of rising inflation.
And finally, if Emu is going to go ahead in any case, what would be the
downside risk to the UK of staying outside? Not necessarily the same as it
would be for Switzerland or small south-east Asian economies without a
currency anchor. These are the questions which need to replace the futile UK
debate on the Conservative leadership.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Dead money' costs of EU translation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From DS LORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Hilary Chapman (Letters, May 7/8) did not give you details of the
high cost of interpretation and translation in the European Union.
The Swiss Professor Claude Piron, an interpreter and translator, said in a
lecture given in Esperanto in 1993 to an international audience: 'The
European Community makes use of the services of 2,500 translators and 570
permanent interpreters, plus 2,500 interpreters on temporary contracts. In
1989 it spent on language services Ecu1.4bn - Pounds 1.2bn; I am not
mistaken, it does in fact concern a milliard: 1,200 million pounds (both
items of information - number of language functionaries and costs - are from
Mario von Baratta and Jan Ulrich Clauss, Internationale Organisationen,
Frankfurt am Rhein: Fischer, 1991).'
He went on to say: 'In 1992, transferring documents between Brussels and
Strasbourg for the European Parliament cost 3 milliard Belgian francs
(Pounds 50m). This sum does not include the documents which pass through
Luxembourg to be translated and reprinted there. Twice a month the firm of
Danzas transports 80 metric tonnes of archives in nine languages.
'If one of the chests is lost, which happens from time to time, the
parliamentary session is interrupted until it has been recovered, so that
every language group may have at its disposal the texts in its own language
(Laurent Fontaine, Le Cout de la Bougeotte, L'Instant, October 24-30 1992).
These sums may be termed 'dead money' in that they produce nothing of value.

In America Four Weddings And A Funeral, a British comedy about love and
death, is the 'Have you seen?' film of the season. Standing Woody Allen-like
in cinema queues, all I heard during my recent visit - forget the latest
Dollars 100m Hollywood action films - was 'Such a delight],' 'Best British
film in years]', 'It did make me laugh,' 'Shall we take Aunt Millie?' and
'Isn't Hugh Grant wonderful]'
Let us have a memory check. Mr Grant was the young deb's delight in Maurice
and the spineless lover in A Handful Of Dust: performances that seemed to
mark him out for a short forgettable career, except perhaps as a matinee
idol version of Griff Rhys Jones. Then he was funnier and more interesting
in Polanski's Bitter Moon. Now with Four Weddings he begins to look the
drollest, most appealingly scatterbrained hero in Western cinema.
Charles (Grant) is the eternal best man. Always late for weddings, he is
inclined to lose the ring, but will solicit last-minute substitutes from his
chunky-jewelled Hampstead friends in the church run by the Rev Rowan
Atkinson. Our hero also has an infectious smile, a laugh that sounds like
steam escaping and the blissful assurance of a man who will 'never marry'.
Then he falls in love with visiting beauty Andie McDowell, the movie's
American box office insurance.
That is it plotwise. But the script by Blackadder's Richard Curtis and
direction by Mike (Dance With A Stranger) Newell give this comical-romantic
froth such an eager whisk that it stands up and assaults the taste buds. The
visuals are modest and the sound somewhat semi-detached, as if glued on in a
hurry in the dubbing room. But technical deficiencies bother us surprisingly
little and probably helped to charm an America bored with hi-tech,
low-content hellraisers - that and the movie's ability to mix drops of
darker emotion into the mirth. When Grant's pal Simon Callow dies of Aids,
Callow's gay lover delivers a funeral speech at once blithely disrespectful
 -'His recipe for duck a la banana fortunately goes with him to the grave' -
and powerfully moving. A lot of giggling people around me at the AMC cinema,
Century City, were also clutching surreptitious Kleenexes.
The supporting cast - James Fleet, John Hannah, Charlotte Coleman - is
almost frighteningly assured, as if fresh from a crash course of watching
Noel Coward plays. But it is Grant's show. He seems to be taking over the
'silly ass' franchise and making it vibrant and human: he is a Hugh Laurie
or Richard Briers (Good Life vintage) with large-screen charisma. Even his
language - many an F-word in scene one, many a 'Bugger]' in the last scene
when he Samson-wrestles with a church pew to steady his own pre-wedding
nerves - seems part of this tousled ego exploding with banked-up
Britishness.
France's Germinal and Taiwan's The Puppetmaster are two contrasting ways to
present the sweep of history. I felt swept up by neither. The first is
Claude Berri's film of Emile Zola's mining saga, pouring mud, coal-dust and
music over us for 2 3/4 hours. The second film is so minimalist that the
truth-based tale of an ageing puppeteer, his family and his perspective on
Pacific history seems like education by audiovisual drip-feed.
The best thing about Germinal is Gerard Depardieu. It is now impossible to
imagine a French film, and probably impossible to finance one, without the
presence of this human whale soaring and spouting all over the script. Watch
Depardieu take a miner's bath and you have a Portable Theatre version of
Moby Dick. Watch him stomp through the streets with his striking army of
workers crying 'Bread]' and you see a sight at once absurd - this man needs
bread? - and wonderful.
When Depardieu's character dies, so does the film. Everyone else is merely
human. They recite the lines while the vast mining sets wait for the next
crowd-stirring stunt by fire, water or Zola-esque sermon on humanity.
The Puppetmaster takes an admired technique, Hou Hsiao-Hsien's
jewelled-tableau style as seen in A Time To Love And A Time To Die and City
Of Sadness, and turns it into an instrument of torture. Almost every
interior scene is shot through a doorway by a scarce-moving camera, as if by
an eavesdropper paralysed by a blow-dart. Years of Sino-Japanese history are
microdotted into vignettes of social or domestic miniaturism. And when the
'puppeteer' himself makes a late personal appearance, adding a wacky,
wizened face to his singsong voice-over, we recognise a favourite old actor
of Mr Hou's. It is Li Tianlu, here playing master of ceremonies to his very
own pre-movie life story, but not tempting one to rush out for the tie-in
biography.
For light relief you may turn to Stacy Cochrane's My New Gun, a lithe black
comedy about a young New Jersey housewife (Diane Lane) whose life is
transformed when she is given a gun by her security-conscious yuppie husband
(Stephen Collins). She does not want it, so what will she do with it? More
to the point, what will the attractive, mad boy next door (James LeGros) do
with it when he 'borrows' it one fateful night?
'We live in a very sick world,' the husband points out in a self-fulfilling
prognosis. Soon there are two woundings, one near-fatal case of food
poisoning, the discovery of a lost Country and Western singer in hiding
(Tess Harper), an adulterous romance and a wedding modelled on one of those
bloodbath nuptials once beloved of TV's Dynasty.
The film is sly, wise, funny: a first feature that makes us vigilant for
Cochrane's second.
A Dangerous Woman and M. Butterfly are earnest meditations on sex, passion
and identity. If a smile crossed the faces of either of these films, they
would crack like a mirror. In Woman Debra Winger gives an 'Oscar, please'
performance as a gauche, mentally troubled woman who falls in love with
handyman Gabriel Byrne, despite the steely resentment of her 'aunt' and
guardian Barbara Hershey.
Since Hershey's real age is 46 and Winger's 38 this takes some swallowing:
but no more than other toxic hyperboles and whimsicalities in Stephen
(Waterland) Gyllenhaal's direction or his wife Naomi Finer's script, based
on a novel by Mary McGarry Norris.
During M. Butterfly I kept hearing the ghostly voice of Henry Higgins,
re-scripted for the age of PC: 'Why can't a man be more like a woman?'
Jeremy Irons dons his distraught prune expression as the French diplomat who
falls for a Peking Opera star without realising that 'she' is a man. But
surely the rugger player shoulders and off-blue jawline of John Lone were
hint enough? David (Naked Lunch) Cronenberg brings David Henry Hwang's
truth-based play to the screen without allowing for the camera's greater
power in microscopically sexing actors. A story impossible to resist on
stage is impossible to believe on screen.

The thought of Joanna Lumley in the character of Kate Swift from Class Act
working as the world's bolshiest waitress in order to get the low-down in a
war between rival chefs is an attractive one. Having seen scorn and
super-ciliousness from Lumley in AbFab we know just how effective she can be
(9.00 ITV).
Anyone who has worked in a hospital knows that there really does seem to be
an odd association between the incidence of death and the sex drive of the
staff. An instinct to keep population figures steady? Who knows, but Cardiac
Arrest is the first hospital series I have seen which captures the frenetic
atmosphere (9.30 BBC1). The BBC2 series True Brits tells 'The Ambassador's
Story'. David Gore-Booth leaves the Foreign Office to take up his new post
as ambassador to Saudi Arabia and the programme records his meetings with
Salman Rushdie and the Queen (9.30). Crimewatch UK screens its 100th
edition, its proponents still arguing that its help in solving certain
crimes somehow justifies thoroughly nasty re-enactments of often violent
incidents (10.00 BBC1).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Shakespeare Company is giving itself a large transfusion of new
blood this season. For its first new production in Stratford's big Royal
Shakespeare Theatre, Henry V, the director (Matthew Warchus), designer (Neil
Warmington) and lead actor (Iain Glen) are all new to the company; so are
over half the cast.
Warchus, who staged last summer's odd and fresh West End Much Ado, gives us
a Henry V less odd and just as fresh. The opening image is a study in
scarlet: the medieval royal robes hanging above a field of poppies. The
modern-dress Chorus (Tony Britton) wears a Remembrance-Sunday poppy in his
coat, and Henry V (Iain Glen) puts on the royal red during his first scene.
The connection of kingship and bloodshed is explicit, as is the contrast
between time present and time past.
Visually, the Agincourt scenes have immense, multi-faceted eloquence. While
the battle rages - on a ramp centre-stage, before an azure sky - hooded
bystanders plant poppies on the margins of the stage; and disparate pieces
of armour, like severed limbs, descend and hang eerily in the air. At the
end of Act Five - before the spreading cornfields and mountains of France -
the stage action freezes, just as Catherine signs the marriage contract;
while, from the sides, the Chorus comes forward to draw the play to a close.
Iain Glen, as the young King, has star quality. He looks and sounds noble,
intelligent, virile, sensitive, appealing, handsome. He arrives with strong
Shakespearian credentials (having won awards for his Glasgow Macbeth and
Bristol Hamlet; he played Edgar at the Royal Court and in the recent
Gielgud/Branagh recording). He brings to Henry a very interesting nervous
intensity, and he develops - maturing vocally from high, clear tenor to
shadowed baritone - from cautious cool to tempered assurance.
However, he has as yet no stillness. Even when praying to God before the
battle, he employs so restless a variety of inflection that his actual words
hardly strike home. But Glen's potential is obviously vast. His sheer
nobility is something rare on our stages, and the way it is combined with
intensity, attack, variety, is rarer.
The contrast between Glen's Henry and Britton's Chorus - between warrior and
mourner, action and recollection - is excellent. Spruce, silver-haired, his
voice full-toned, he does rather too much. There are some uneconomical
gestures with his walking-stick, and consciously 'poetic' vocal effects. But
he is both authoritative and detached.
Of the other players, two of the youngest made an especially sure impression
 -Daniel Evans as the Boy (Welsh); and Julia Crane as a bespectacled
attendant at the French court. Elsewhere Warchus has not brought out all the
characters' human complexity. But Linal Haft, though he sometimes reduces
Fluellyn to a comic turn, is generally fine and funny. Monica Dolan, as
Catherine of France, plays her charming scenes with an unusually keen
energy.
In repertory at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until
January

FT  12 MAY 94 / Arts: Starry Carmen, withered Faust - Opera in London and
Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Opera is hosting two of the so-called 'three tenors' at present,
writes John Allison. Alongside Jose Carreras in Fedora, Placido Domingo has
arrived to sing Don Jose - his first performances of the role at Covent
Garden since 1973 - in the last four Carmens of the season. Nuria Espert's
1991 production has seen countless changes of cast since it was revived in
January, and Tuesday's line-up was a strong one.
Domingo was on fine form, conveying Don Jose's unbridled infatuation both
vocally and in his acting. His tone remains virile, he can still muster
pleasing pianissimos. Domingo has often been criticised for stepping into
productions as a guest on little rehearsal, sometimes in parts unsuited to
his voice, but he is a veteran Don Jose and knows this production well,
having sung in it in Los Angeles and conducted it in Seville.
In Los Angeles he appeared opposite Denyce Graves, for whom the title role
has become a calling card. Her Covent Garden debut in January, postponed for
a few days due to illness, was not reported on this page, and Tuesday's
performance explained her reputation as a sultry Carmen. She has smoky tone
to match her glamorous looks, but as an actress relies too much on
sensuality.
The Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu made an unscheduled appearance in her
first Covent Garden Micaela, replacing an indisposed Marie McLaughlin. Her
vibrant singing underlined a portrayal of the character as tougher than
usual. Gino Quilico, a preening Escamillo, completed a team of principals
who make up as good a Carmen cast as one is likely to encounter.
All seemed galvanised by Jacques Delacote in the pit. In contrast to the
lumpen account presided over by Jeffrey Tate in January, the music now
sounds fiery and exciting. Delacote brings a light Gallic touch that makes
even the clumsy production seem less oppressive. The Hispanicised Hose has
been corrected to Jose, suggesting that Covent Garden has at last recognised
Carmen as a French opera.
While the Royal Opera was performing a traditional Carmen, writes Richard
Fairman, the City of Birmingham Touring Opera was giving its own very
different treatment to another French classic, Gounod's Faust. In the past
these slimmed-down productions have been at the cutting edge of opera in
England, but this time the sharpness of intellect has become dulled.
The outline plan remains the same. The opera is performed by a small team,
suitable for touring. There is no chorus, which means losing a proportion of
the score (including some favourite numbers). The orchestra is reduced to
about 15 players and this time the arranger, Ian McQueen, has not merely
re-orchestrated Gounod, but also added ideas of his own.
He replaces the original prelude with a more disturbing introduction, to
which he alludes at crucial turning-points later in the opera. Horn trills
shudder ominously as Faust drinks his potion, while at the end wrenching
discords disrupt the comfort of Gounod's saccharine ending. It is arguable
what benefit this brings, but McQueen's re-writing is the most striking
feature in an otherwise tired evening.
The production team (Matthew Richardson producer and Jon Morrell designer)
have nothing to offer beyond the stock ideas and bare scenery encountered in
any low-budget production. The pacing of the drama is unvaried, at odds with
the spirited conducting of Dominic Wheeler.
Fortunately there are some decent voices on hand to carry the performance
along, notably Jane Leslie MacKenzie's soaring Marguerite and Andrew
Slater's able Mephistopheles. Colin McKerracher dutifully sings Faust's most
awkward music, but at the price of strangulated tone. Karl Morgan Daymond
gets to deliver a hitherto unknown solo as Valentin. Otherwise, like the
flowers under the devil's spell, this Faust has unexpectedly withered at the
touch.
Carmen performances, with further cast changes, on May 14,17, 20 (the last
relayed to the Big Screen in the Piazza). Sponsored by Daiwa Europe and The
Linbury Trust.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Arts: Portrait of Edith Wharton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What has caused the present boom in the work of Edith Wharton nearly 60
years after her death? Reissues of her novels followed by two films, The Age
of Innocence and Ethan Frome, are crowned by Irene Worth's skilfully
assembled Portrait.
Consisting simply of extracts spoken in front of a lectern against a black
backcloth, this hour and a half of uninterrupted exposure to the mind of
Wharton is completely absorbing. The years have left Irene Worth wholly
undimmed; she remains a glowing presence, as if she had just stepped out of
a full-length oil by Whistler. She throws herself into the personality of
Wharton with a fine spontaneity.
Wharton was a captivating storyteller who revealed hidden sources of power
in seemingly vulnerable women. Worth shows how Wharton's own life serves as
a singular example of the feminine struggle in the 20th century. The opening
anecdote is taken from her autobiography A Backward Glance, the show's chief
source. Little Edith is walking along Fifth Avenue with her father. Worth
describes how a kiss was planted on the little girl's cheek by her small boy
cousin. She gently mimes the gesture of his lifting her veil to reach the
target.
Each subsequent extract describes the lifting of a further veil or
psychological barrier as we follow Wharton's progress from the moneyed world
of her parents, marriage to the rich Teddy Wharton, professional authorship,
chic life in Paris and London alongside the likes of Henry James, divorce
and sexual awakening in the arms of the rascally American journalist
Fullerton.
She recites with commensurate passion a fragment commemorating this unhappy
affair then breaks the tension with the throwaway line - 'But then I see
everything from the woman's point of view'. That is the basis for Wharton's
current success.
At the Cottesloe at 8 pm on May 12, 13 and at 4 pm on May 18, 19.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Technology: Abbey gears up for D-Day - The UK bank's new
computer system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Monday, Philip Hallatt, director of shareholder services at Abbey
National, will know whether the project on which he has spent most of the
past two years can be counted a success.
May 16 is D-day for Abbey - the day when its 2.6m shareholders must receive
their dividends. It will give the greatest test yet to the newly-installed
computer system set up when Abbey decided to carry out its own registration
services in-house. When Abbey converted from being a building society to a
bank in July 1989, it bought in registration services from Lloyds Bank, the
market leader in registration.
But, Hallatt says, Abbey always intended to consider moving registration
in-house - conscious that, having begun with 5.5m shareholders, there was a
clear prospect of economies of scale not available to all plcs.
At first the plans were based on the implementation of Taurus - the London
stock exchange's paperless trading system. But when Taurus was scrapped,
Abbey knew it would have to look at a system which could cope with a
continuing dependence on paper, at least for a while, and chose Computer
Management Group, as its adviser in devising a custom-built system.
The fact that 95 per cent of Abbey's shareholders are among its 12m
customers increased the need to get the system right - because there was
more to lose than the mainly small individual shareholdings if they were
dissatisfied. 'We had to look at standardising the service provided,'
Hallatt says.
But that same fact also enhanced the benefits of developing a system which
could cross-reference shareholders in their capacity as customers. In time,
Abbey is looking to be able to achieve full cross-referencing -
facilitating, for example, direct payment of a dividend into a savings
account, or share dealing from accounts.
One of the most important features of the system is that it is based on
relational database theory and techniques. This means that the software can
obtain information from the system in a very complex way. As Hallatt
describes it, the system should be able to provide information in a way that
it was not expected to be able to access when it was set up. 'It's a way of
being able to meet unspecified future requirements,' he says.
But the greatest technological development, as Abbey sees it, is in the
system's use of document image processing. Abbey is by no means the first
organisation to use document imaging - essentially a means of storing paper
on screen - but it is the first to use the technology to do more than allow
the system to act as a 'cupboard'.
'No other organisation in Europe is using DI technology in this way,' says
Hallatt. 'In the UK we only see people using DI in storage and retrieval
mode, not in interacting.' One relatively straightforward example of how
this interacting works can be seen in the handling of change of address
forms.
A shareholder fills in a form at a branch: when this document is fed into
the system, the system itself will check that the shareholder's unique
number has been filled in and that the form has been signed.
If the form is not properly completed, the system will automatically reject
it and send it back to the individual with a standard letter - bearing an
electronic signature - explaining what is missing or wrong.
If, when the computer checks the form it sees that it is correctly filled
out, it will route the screen image to one of the work areas. A screen
operator will not see the whole image of the document - he or she will see
only the new address to be typed into the database.
The system has proved much quicker than previous methods of processing such
routine information. Although the processing office, in Sheffield, has been
open only since the end of February, it is already turning round inquiries
more quickly than Lloyds did.
The Sheffield office employs, at present, some 125 staff, while at different
times Lloyds had had between 150 and 250 people dealing with Abbey's work.
After a 2 1/2 week backlog at Lloyds, Hallatt says, the new system has
brought matters 'almost entirely up to date' in most areas.
It does, however, raise some issues for management.
One is the creation of an environment in which staff are confident in
relying entirely on the system. The destruction of the paper forms after a
month or so is less striking in this regard than the fact that an individual
operator will see only part of the form he or she is processing, and will
have to trust that the system has done its part properly. The system will
not satisfy the instinctive inclination just to cast a quick glance over the
rest of the form.
The other issue is how to use constructively the welter of management
information that the system will provide. Hallatt is very conscious of the
effect on staff morale of finding after a long day's work that the number of
transactions waiting to be dealt with has actually increased.
The system's ability to provide information down to the level of the
individual operator about how long documents take to be processed may also
be a mixed blessing. It is an advantage if it is seen as a way of reducing
backlogs by shifting the flow of work to teams of operators who are less
busy, but it could have an adverse effect on morale if it is seen as a
threat by management hanging over an operator.
The project should pay for itself within two to three years: although the
set-up costs ran into millions, they still amounted to around one year's
fees paid to Lloyds.
And there could be a further payback. Hallatt says that over the past 18
months, Abbey has been discussing its system with some other large PLCs. 'At
the moment, our priority is to ensure that the changeover and aftermath goes
smoothly,' he says. 'We believe that by the beginning of next year, we will
be in a position to take on other registers on a commercial basis.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Technology: Olive-grove innovators - Kerin Hope reports on
Greece's efforts to build on its scientific successes by forging closer
links with industry, in a continuing research series
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Research Centre of Crete keeps a low profile on an island best known for
its beaches and ancient ruins. Concealed among olive groves outside
Heraklion, the capital, it is staffed mostly by Greek scientists who
returned from jobs abroad with a brief to focus on applied as much as basic
research.
However, Eleftherios Economou, who heads the centre, acknowledges that
building links with industry is a struggle in Greece, 'where company
practice of taking the short-term view and importing technology in a black
box is only just starting to change'.
Greece spends only 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product on research, the
lowest percentage in the European Union. The government provides about half
the funds allocated, with less than one-tenth coming from the private
sector.
Dimitris Daskalopoulos, chairman of Delta Dairies, Greece's biggest food
processor, summed up the prevailing attitude: 'The perception is that
researchers aren't really worth much because they work too slowly and aren't
truly product-oriented. It's only among companies that want to be
competitive on a European scale that you find more awareness.'
Delta's own R&amp;D department has become a key part of the company's
operations, Daskalopoulos says, since it decided to build a Dr16bn (Dollars
64m) yoghurt plant near Athens, with the aim of developing high-quality
products for distribution in the rest of the EU. 'It's no longer enough just
to pay royalties for know-how.'
The centre in Heraklion houses four out of the seven institutes belonging to
the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas. Forth was set up in the
mid-1980s with government funds to improve Greece's research capability and
develop collaborative projects with industry.
It was deliberately hived off from Greek universities and other
government-backed research institutes which were reputed to disdain projects
with commercial applications, in order to foster a new, more practical,
scientific culture in Greece.
The institutes on Crete have attracted high-calibre researchers and a
sizeable percentage of non-government funding, including increasing amounts
of EU money - about Dr2bn this year. But their relative isolation is a
handicap.
Growth in tourism and agriculture has overshadowed industrial development in
Crete in the past decade, while the difficulties of keeping in close touch
with Athens and Thessaloniki, the country's main manufacturing centres,
proved a deterrent to forming partnerships with industry.
Given the shortage of potential collaborators, scientists at the centre
decided to set up several locally-based companies to handle product
development and sales. While some products won recognition for innovation,
Economou says, the centre has been unable to penetrate markets effectively -
'you can't necessarily guarantee that you'll have both scientific and
entrepreneurial talent simultaneously'.
The centre's institute for molecular biology, which has come up with several
biomedical products, has transferred responsibility for marketing and
exports to a commercial partner, whose expertise and contacts in Greece and
abroad should speed up product development in the future.
The experience suggests that research with medical applications may hold the
greatest potential for Greece, Economou says. 'It's one area where we have
the resources to leapfrog existing weaknesses in R&amp;D, and it's a
fast-growing market that doesn't need heavy investment.'
Biomedical companies based in Greece can tap the skills of a relatively
large number of scientists trained abroad, while salaries for research staff
are still less than half those in the rest of the EU.
The molecular biology institute has set up a joint venture with an
Athens-based company that distributes diagnostic products in Greece and
abroad. Nida Biometria makes and sells veterinary diagnostic kits, including
pregnancy tests for cows and pigs, as well as kits for screening viruses in
potatoes, carnations and young fruit trees.
Pavlos Leakos, managing director of Biometria, the parent company, says:
'The animal pregnancy tests are practical for this region as they're
designed to be carried out by small labs with minimal equipment. The plant
virus tests are timesavers as one kit can test hundreds of samples in less
than an hour.'
The institute is also developing links with another Athens-based company,
Diagnostic Genetic Centre, which offers testing services for genetic
disorders such as Mediterranean anaemia or cystic fibrosis; until recently,
these were not available in Greece to local physicians.
Costas Pangalos, the medical geneticist who set up DGC, says the aim is for
the researchers on Crete to develop a set of probes - small sections of DNA
serving as markers to detect mutations that cannot be directly determined -
that can help identify genetic disorders. 'It should be the right
interchange, with us supplying laboratory testing facilities and the
capacity to make their products commercial.'
However, the centre has not given up efforts to forge links with companies
on Crete. It has set up a technology park outside Heraklion, due to start
operating later this year. Six companies, both Crete- and Athens-based, are
already committed to participating.
Plastika Kritis, a Heraklion-based company that makes plastic sheeting for
greenhouses and polyethylene pipes for drip irrigation systems, was among
the first to join the technology park. The company says it spent 2 per cent
of turnover amounting to Dr5.6bn last year on R&amp;D.
Manolis Lembidakis, managing director, says: 'To develop high value-added
products in our sector, you can't depend on other people's technology.'
Next week: South Korea.

FT  12 MAY 94 / People: Wathen resurfaces at NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Wathen, who left Midland Bank last month after his job as managing
director of branch banking and was eliminated in a reshuffle has reappeared
at National Westminster Bank as general manager in charge of human
resources.
The appointment is against the trend; clearing banks have been recruiting
outsiders from different industries, and NatWest was sifting through
non-bankers for its vacant post when Wathen unexpectedly appeared on the job
market. Derek Wanless, NatWest's chief executive, says it is 'not common to
find someone available with this breadth of experience at a senior level'.
He says NatWest approached Wathen when it heard that he had left Midland.
Wathen will join the executive group at NatWest's group head office which
comprises Wanless, senior group executives such as John Melbourn, the deputy
chief executive, and the heads of the bank's operating divisions such as
branch banking.
Wanless says that NatWest was not merely putting Wathen into his new post in
the short-term. 'He will be able to contribute as a member of the team, but
he is coming to do a particular job for the foreseeable future.'
Wathen, 48, has experience of human resources, having been group personnel
director of Midland before becoming managing director of branch banking.
Before that, he was in charge of handling its relationship with Hongkong
Bank.
The job of handling NatWest human resources became vacant in February when
Stuart Chandler, the general manager who was responsible for human resources
and strategic development, became deputy chief executive for branch banking.

FT  12 MAY 94 / People: Salaried Leith
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'I find to my surprise that I like being an employee,' says Prue Leith, the
restaurateur and cookery writer who once took it upon herself to uncurl the
British Rail sandwich.
Last summer she sold her empire, with an annual turnover of Pounds 17m, to
Eurest International, part of the French Accor group and the biggest
contract caterer in Europe.
This week her husband Rayne Kruger conducted his last board meeting as
chairman of Leith's, retiring at the age of 72. He has been her business
partner and chairman for 30 years. Kruger, 15 years older than his wife,
will be retreating to his study to pursue his passionate interest in ancient
Chinese history.
Leith will be combining the role of managing director and chairman from next
month. She claims that since selling the business, which she started from an
Earls Court bedsit in 1962, she has been devoting more time to it. She is
looking forward to Eurest's plans to expand the company by moving further
into the tough contract catering market, where it will be competing with
Compass and Gardner Merchant.
However, closer involvement with Leith's over the past year has not
precluded her other activities - she is on the boards of Argyll Group and
Leeds Permanent Building Society, is chairman of the Restaurateurs'
Association of Great Britain and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.

BT has appointed Alan White as director, group property.
White takes charge of one of the UK's largest property portfolios, which is
undergoing a period of heavy rationalisation to meet the changing
requirements of BT.
Technological change and the decline of BT's traditional activities is
forcing BT to dispose of substantial amounts of its 75m sq ft of operational
space, which currently consists of more than 92,000 UK and 500 overseas
properties.
White was formerly head of group property operations at BT, which he joined
in 1991 from TSB, where he was director of premises.
Before that, he was group estates manager of Grand Metropolitan between 1987
and 1990, having worked as group estates manager of Dee Corporation and of
Booker.

Stanley Honeyman has been appointed chairman of STANHOPE, following the
death of Lord Sharp of Grimsdyke last week.
Honeyman, 70, a chartered surveyor, joined the board of Stanhope in 1989.
His involvement followed Olympia &amp; York's acquisition of a 33 per cent stake
in the company in 1988; he had been closely involved with Olympia &amp; York,
both as a consultant on Canary Wharf and a director of a number of O&amp;Y's
subsidiaries.
His career has included a number of directorships of large property
companies; in 1970, he joined the board of the English Property Corporation,
becoming chief executive in 1978, a year before the company was bought by
Olympia &amp; York.
When EPC was sold to MEPC in 1985, he joined MEPC's board for a year.
Between 1975 and 1985, he was a director of Trizec Corporation of Canada and
was also a director of WH Smith until 1992.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: A conservative view from the north side
 -Andrew Jack suggests Coopers &amp; Lybrand's new chairman will seek organic
rather than radical change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two expensive arch-roofed, high-technology structures stand facing each
other in central London. Both sit on the River Thames, on opposite banks.
Both span railway tracks. The similarities do not end there.
On the south side is the temporary terminal for the long-postponed Channel
Tunnel, trial runs of which began this month.
On the north side is Embankment Place, British headquarters of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, which acquired a new boss at the
start of this month.
Judging by the views of Mr Peter Smith, Coopers' newly-appointed chairman,
his organisation is as likely to experience lengthy delays to plans for
change as is its neighbour.
Sitting last week in his office overlooking the Thames and reflecting on his
first few days, Mr Smith lists themes familiar to his firm and those of his
competitors, rather than providing any hint of radical change in the coming
months. 'You won't suddenly have people here with pink-spotted ties,' he
says.
Smith was elected late last year to a five-year term (which he hopes will be
renewed) in Coopers' first contested battle for the top job in the firm. He
joined in 1967 after gaining a degree in economics from Southampton
University, became a partner in 1975 and rose to become head of the London
office in 1989.
He is politically active, holding several jobs with the Beaconsfield
Constituency Conservative Association and is lead partner for the firm's
work as auditor and adviser to Conservative Central Office.
Internally, he puts forward three objectives for Coopers during his time in
office: being the best; remaining a full service firm rather than
concentrating on niches; and bringing together multi-disciplinary teams
organised around business sectors so that 'it is the client who is supreme'.
He says he will not have been judged to have done his job unless the firm
expands at a greater pace than the forecast rate of growth in the UK economy
of 2 to 3 per cent a year. He also aims to 'grow profits'.
Smith's approach sounds very similar to that of many of his rivals. The
question is whether he can achieve it in an enormous, and some say unwieldy,
organisation of 700 partners, which last year reported fee income down 4.2
per cent to Pounds 553m.
The stronger international networks are epitomised by Arthur Andersen's
single worldwide organisation, and echoed in recent restructurings by Price
Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young. The 'industry-facing' groups have already been
most prominently adopted by KPMG Peat Marwick.
There are some distinguishing characteristics. Smith suggests that Coopers
will have 'priority markets' where it believes there will be greatest
growth, including telecoms, insurance, retailing and the regulated
industries.
He also highlights (like the Andersen organisation) what he calls 'human
resource advisory services', providing actuarial and personal tax advice,
and other management services related to the installation of new systems and
corporate restructuring.
'There was a period when there was an element of jumping on the bandwagon -
that if you don't do this you may lose your position,' he says. 'Now we are
looking for growth in key markets. The 1990s is going to be distinctly
different.'
The success of Coopers' strategy will partly depend on Smith himself, who
highlighted the results of a personality test he had taken in a manifesto
circulated to his partners during last year's election contest.
The test classified him as 'introverted sensing with thinking',
characterised among other things as like people who are: 'Serious, quiet,
matter-of-fact, logical, realistic and dependable. Make up their own minds
as to what should be accomplished and work toward it steadily regardless of
protests and distractions'.
In the manifesto, which he described as a 'Maoist style self-criticism', he
said he had worked to improve his listening skills since the test, but
warned he could be 'tough and decisive when the need arises'.
Smith argues that there will be growing differentiation between the large
accountancy firms, as they gravitate into markets where the competition
comes from non-accountants. This will make fee income tables comparing the
firms meaningless.
'The old measuring points are beginning to be a bit redundant. They are a
bit of a pig's breakfast at the moment. I don't see that it makes sense to
aggregate high level intellectually-based consultancy services with hangers
of people running computers,' he says.
Internally, he is fostering more work to develop non-financial indicators to
assess performance. 'Financial numbers have become totems. I am anxious to
avoid the feeling that people are driven by the need to sell services.
Otherwise they get very close to being double-glazing salesmen.'
One transformation he emphasises is the growing dominance of technology
within Coopers. 'The service firms poured millions of pounds into technology
but it's very unclear whether they gained advantage in internal management.
The secretarial resource level is as it was.'
He says Coopers has signed agreements for the development of customised
software to support its work in areas such as tax and auditing. He wants to
see all working papers put on computer.
Smith sees no return to the 'profligate' 1980s when people were collected by
the firms, but he expects recruitment of students more closely tied to the
firm's objectives to begin rising gently again, coupled with a commitment to
greater training.
Organisationally, he says there are no plans for a change in the number of
offices around the UK, but he predicts that each will become less a fiefdom
in its own right with most services provided regionally.
On two of the firm's more notorious episodes in recent years, Smith is
defensive. Last month Coopers was issued with writs by the administrators to
Maxwell Communication Corporation in connection with its audits of the
company for 1987 and 1989.
'We have done our reviews. We are content with the work that was done,' he
says. 'The joint monitoring unit (the audit regulators) has reviewed certain
parts of our business and concluded that nothing requires rectification.
They probably found the odd thing but have not cast any doubt on our
underlying procedures. I have no problem with the quality of the Coopers
audit.'
Two Coopers partners were also reprimanded by their professional body for
accepting the administration of Polly Peck International when the firm was
already working for the company and Mr Asil Nadir, its former chairman.
'Our conflict of interest procedures at the time of the merger (with
Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells) didn't give us the information that was
necessary,' he says. 'We are in compliance to the full now. I don't think it
impinges in any way on the firm's integrity.'
That leaves Smith with two more public campaigns. The first is his support
for the big firm's call to limit their liability in audit negligence
lawsuits. The second is his desire to restore judgment to a profession being
driven by an increasing number of rules, notably in accounting standards -
two issues that will be welcomed by his accounting competitors.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): 'Asian Delight'
tempts Thai palates - How Lever Brothers has benefited from the growth of
ice cream consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike some of Bangkok's raunchier roadside advertisements, the enormous
billboards depicting a woman's red lips invitingly parted have nothing to do
with the sex industry; they are selling Wall's ice cream.
Japanese corporations dominate south-east Asian markets for cars and
consumer electronics, but western companies such as the Anglo-Dutch Unilever
 -owner of the Wall's brand - are influential players in Asia when it comes
to branded foods and household goods.
Lever Brothers (Thailand), wholly-owned by Unilever, has been operating in
the country for more than 60 years and says it is dominant in six of the
nine markets in which it competes, including ice cream and hair care
products (dominance is defined as having a market share at least 50 per cent
bigger than your nearest rival).
Thai demand for branded shampoos is well-established - Kao of Japan is
credited with opening the market more than 20 years ago and Lever took a
dominant position by the end of the 1980s - but the growth of ice cream
consumption is a phenomenon of the 1990s. Although Thailand's economy has
been expanding steadily for 40 years, only recently has the disposable
income of most Thais been able to stretch to ice cream.
'Until 1990 the market was very basic and primitive,' says Viroj Phutrakul,
chairman of Lever Brothers (Thailand). 'Availability was not good and
visibility was awful.' The main ice cream company in Thailand was Foremost,
originally introduced to cater for American servicemen during the Vietnam
war.
Then in the 1990s, Viroj says, 'the market absolutely exploded'. Consumption
rose from 20m litres a year to the current 55m, which is worth about Dollars
100m (Pounds 68.40m) at ex-factory prices. In the long term, the market
could increase fivefold from the present level.
Lever entered the fray four years ago by making 5m litres a year and found
that its factory was producing at full capacity within a year. Now the
company can produce 35m litres and is increasing capacity to 50m by July. In
1992, Lever bought Foremost, and recently shut down the Foremost factory.
Lever now claims a dominant 67 per cent share of the Thai ice cream market,
and says it is especially strong in the profitable 'impulse buying' sector.
Ice cream helped raise Lever's overall Thai turnover last year by 25 per
cent to about Dollars 440m - pre-tax profit was about Dollars 40m - and
sales this year are expected to rise another 18 per cent.
Viroj, 59, who graduated in economics from Sheffield University and worked
his way up the Unilever ranks, says Thailand is a particularly good market
for a multinational company because it has a large, young and culturally
homogeneous population; most of the country's 58m people are ethnic Thai
Buddhists who share similar tastes in food.
Multinationals, however, still need to adapt their international strategies
to local tastes. Just as Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisees offer
extra-spicy meals to suit the Thai palate, so Lever adjusts the ingredients
and the brands of Wall's ice cream for Asian markets. Ice cream in Thailand
has a lower fat content than the formulation used in colder climates, and
Lever has introduced an 'Asian Delight' Wall's brand in red bean or taro (a
type of sweet potato) flavours.
There are some difficulties in distributing ice cream in Thailand, including
the high proportion of people living in far-flung parts of the countryside
and Bangkok's notorious traffic jams; the take-home market is limited by the
fact that ice cream often melts in the car before shoppers can reach their
houses.
But the hot climate and the increasing wealth of Thai consumers makes
Thailand a tempting and accessible market. No less than 95 per cent of
Bangkok households have television, and 60 per cent of Lever's overall sales
in the capital now go through modern supermarkets and stores rather than the
small shops more common in the provinces. Lever has doubled its budget for
research into Thai consumers in the last three years.
An entrepreneurial economy also means that companies can conceive and launch
brands in 18 months or two years, compared with as much as five years in
Europe, says Viroj.
So much so, indeed, that Lever is unlikely to be allowed to maintain its ice
cream dominance: Nestle is rumoured to be attempting to buy one of the
smaller Thai ice cream manufacturers.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Skoda's sales drive
is no joke - The Czech company's use of the Volkswagen connection to
reposition its Favorit brand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why does a Skoda have a heated rear windscreen? So you can keep your hands
warm while you're pushing it. The Skoda has all the charm of the typical
eastern European product in the British mind - a dubious car of comical
design, renowned only for its joke status.
The complete repositioning of the brand, which Skoda is currently bravely
attempting, must amount to one of the most daunting marketing challenges of
recent years.
The impetus for Skoda to attempt the seemingly impossible comes as a result
of Volkswagen taking control of the Czech company three years ago and, in
the UK, the establishment last year of Skoda Automobile UK, a new
wholly-owned subsidiary to import the cars.
The old Estelle model - the traditional Skoda of the joke - was superseded
by the Favorit in 1989, and, over the past three years, Volkswagen has been
further improving the specification and quality control of the Favorit range
(priced between Pounds 5,600 and Pounds 7,700). Skoda proudly quotes a
recent BBC television programme which gave the Favorit a test drive and
found it 'completely free of rattles and squeaks'.
Skoda has never had more than 1 per cent of the UK car market - now the
objective under the new Volkswagen management is to increase that share to 2
per cent by the end of the decade.
Robin Woolcock, managing director of Skoda Automobile UK, had no illusions
about the magnitude of the job: 'It was clear to me very early on that this
was a major marketing task. It wasn't about distribution strategy or
retailing capacity - it was about changing the perception of a company that
had come to epitomise eastern Europe.'
In the UK, the brand is a victim partly of its own success: the jokes exist
because Skoda has a considerable presence in the market. Elsewhere in
western Europe, the jokes would be meaningless and have therefore not taken
root, says Woolcock.
A tight marketing budget meant that objectives had to be clearly defined and
focused. With no marketing department, Woolcock's first stop was a market
research consultancy called Quadrangle, which carried out qualitative
studies among three groups: current Skoda owners; 'susceptibles' who might
be persuaded to buy a Skoda; and 'rejecters' who would be unlikely to
purchase.
Simon Lidington, a Quadrangle partner, discovered there was nothing odd
about Skoda owners. 'They were just normal people who were characterised by
being honest, straightforward and disliking hype. They had a very
clear-sighted view of the kind of purchases they wanted to make, wanting to
pay no more than they needed.'
Skoda owners loved their Skodas and had even come to love the jokes, says
Lidington. The only problem was that there weren't enough owners, which is
why the next group, the 'susceptibles', became so important.
Susceptibles were 'attitudinally similar to Skoda owners', found Lidington.
'They had been put off by the jokes and by their lack of awareness of the
Favorit. If conditions were right, and they felt other people weren't going
to laugh at them, they'd jump at the chance of owning a Skoda.'
Working alongside Lidington was the advertising agency GGK, whose job it
became to develop a strategy for awakening the interest of the susceptibles.
Steve Green, a GGK director, discovered it was not enough merely to point
out the merits of the Favorit to potential purchasers.
'There was such a huge dissonance between what people - even susceptibles -
have in their head about what Skoda is and means, and what we were
presenting to them,' he says.
The most important lever has turned out to be the fact that Volkswagen -
with its strong reputation for quality - now controls the company, says
Green. 'The Volkswagen connection lit lights, hit the spot. People
immediately latched on to it. It allowed susceptibles a route into the
brand,' he says.
Press, poster and television advertising - currently showing - has all led
on the VW link. After an outlay of Pounds 6m on press and poster
advertisements last year, and Pounds 4.5m for the current TV campaign,
Woolcock believes the benefits are beginning to materialise: after the first
week of TV adverts, dealers are reporting a 50 per cent rise in sales, he
says.
The final ingredient in the campaign has been public relations. PR company
Shandwick has the task of monitoring press coverage and listening out for
the jokes. Journalists, comedians, disc jockeys and other careless Skoda
joke artists are likely in future to find themselves threatened with a test
drive.
Says Shandwick: 'We don't intend to overreact but if anyone does make an
ill-informed comment about Skoda, we will be offering them an opportunity to
reconsider their views. We're also trying to educate the public that we're
not a soft touch any more - we're not going to lie back and take comments
that affect the brand value.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Recovery found to be spreading to all regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial recovery has spread to all regions, with manufacturing companies
throughout the country reporting an increase in orders for the first time
since early 1989.
Yet the latest quarterly regional industrial trends survey from the
Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies, a regional
consultancy, suggests that the improvement, although widespread, is not
strong enough to offset all adverse local factors.
A positive balance of companies in the 11 regions said orders rose in the
four months to April, but returns pointed to a small decline in overall
demand in northern England and Scotland in the four months to July.
By contrast, the south-east and west Midlands, where companies experienced a
severe recession, appeared to be in the forefront of recovery. This was a
sign of the upturn becoming more firmly rooted, the survey says.
Output increased in all regions except Northern Ireland in the four months
to April: the first such rise in all mainland Britain for four years. Output
is expected to rise everywhere except Scotland and the north during the four
months to July.
Mr Charles Burton, Business Strategies joint managing director, said
Scotland and the north were hit by a reduction in North Sea oil investment.
A boom in Scottish electronic production appeared to be ending, while
industries in the north were hit by pit closures.
The survey, carried out between March 25 and April 13, found that the east
and west Midlands, the south-east and Wales had experienced 'appreciable'
increases in demand during the past four months. The four regions, together
with the north-west, East Anglia and Northern Ireland, expected continued
strong order growth in the present four-month period.
A positive balance of companies in all regions expected export order growth
in the four months to July. Only Yorkshire and Humberside reported a net
drop in export orders in the four months to April.
The survey found companies in eight of the 11 regions planning to increase
investment in plant and machinery in the next 12 months. Investment is still
expected to fall slightly in the south-east, the biggest region, reflecting
the depth of the recession. This set a low base for the recovery which so
far has generated no powerful motive for investment.
Manufacturing industry continued to shed jobs in most regions in the second
quarter, although employment in-creased in Wales and the west Midlands
compared with a year ago.
The survey says that increases in demand and output are not leading to any
marked increase in price pressures.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Record number of pupils stays on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 7 per cent of UK 16-year-olds went into full-time employment last year,
the lowest figure ever, a report from county council careers services shows
today.
Instead the survey of school-leavers' destinations by the heads of the
careers services shows that a record 68 per cent chose to stay in education
full-time. Further education is increasingly chosen instead of training
schemes.
Just 12 per cent entered Youth Training schemes using training credits,
while 3 per cent chose employment which involved some planned training
outside the YT scheme. In 1989, 21 per cent of 16-year-olds used training
credits, but the scheme's popularity has fallen every year since.
The total unemployed was 6 per cent, down from 9 per cent in 1992, although
this was helped by a 3.9 per cent fall in the relevant age group.
The careers services also note a 'slight but worrying' increase in the
percentage of children whose position is not known, which now stands at 6
per cent. Many may be unemployed, and not involved in training or education.
Careers heads also voice concerns over regional variations, with the
northern region - including Cleveland, Durham, and the Tyne and Wear
metropolitan authorities - having the lowest take-up of further education at
56 per cent.
Other wide regional differences include north-west London having the highest
staying-on rate - 86 per cent of 16-year-olds in Harrow were staying on
followed by 85 per cent in Barnet. Southwark in south London had the highest
unemployment (21 per cent) while Knowsley on Merseyside had the lowest
staying-on rate, at only 46 per cent.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Surprise fall in March industrial output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of industrial recovery remains relatively firm although it may have
been exaggerated by government figures in the first two months of the year,
production figures from the Central Statistical Office suggested yesterday.
Seasonally adjusted industrial production in March fell by 0.6 per cent
compared with the previous month, the CSO said.
The fall took the markets by surprise after industrial production grew 0.9
per cent and 0.6 per cent in January and February respectively. Market
analysts had expected March growth of about 0.2 per cent.
Officials yesterday said that monthly figures were volatile and stressed
that the quarterly results, regarded as a better indicator of trends,
pointed to continuing economic recovery.
Industrial production - which includes manufacturing and the energy and
water sectors - rose by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year
against the previous quarter, and 3.8 per cent compared with the first
quarter of last year.
Manufacturing output was up 1.4 per cent in this year's first quarter
against the previous quarter - the strongest quarterly growth for five
years.
This left the quarterly manufacturing index at its highest level for more
than three years - but still 4 per cent below the all-time high recorded
during the second quarter of 1990.
The Treasury said the trend of manufacturing output continued firmly
upwards. The CSO said it saw no reason to revise its trend estimate of 3 per
cent annual growth in manufacturing output - an optimism reflected in the
City.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Saloman Brothers, said: 'This is not a
slow-down. But it does tend to bring you back to a steady growth scenario
rather than the 'boom, boom' headlines we had in January and February.'
Some economists suggested the fall may have been due to distortions in the
new trade statistics, or the fact that the Easter holidays fell partly in
March this year.
The CSO said the main element in the drop came from the food and electronics
sectors failing to sustain their February 'spurt'.
March's figures for the food and tobacco sector, for example, recorded a
monthly fall because the February figure was boosted by a 50 per cent surge
in sugar production.
Production of computers and other electronic goods also fell back slightly
after a large rise in January and February.
In spite of these falls, the CSO pointed out that the investment goods
sector - which includes electronics manufacturing - recorded a strong 4.1
per cent growth over the quarter.
Other branches of engineering grew strongly, with a 4.5 per cent rise in the
machinery and equipment sector and a 4.7 per cent rise in rubber and
plastics.
These rises were counterbalanced by a 1.5 per cent drop in quarterly car
production and flat results from other consumer sectors.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Fears on government competence cloud sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proportion of business leaders reporting increased sales volumes and
profits rose sharply last month, but their optimism about the economy fell,
largely as a result of political uncertainty.
In the Institute of Directors' bi-monthly survey of business opinion, based
on some 300 interviews, 70 per cent of directors reported an increase in the
volume of their company's business compared with six months earlier - up
from 61 per cent in February.
There was also a rise in directors reporting increased profits, to 59 per
cent in April from 52 per cent in February.
However, the balance of directors more optimistic about the economy over
those less optimistic fell to 33 percentage points in April, from 38 points
in February.
Twenty-four per cent - the biggest single group - of those who were less
optimistic cited government incompetence as their main reason. A further 15
per cent pointed to lack of demand, and 9 per cent to tax increases.
Of those who were more optimistic, mainly as a result of increased economic
activity, 6 per cent said factors such as political uncertainty and
government incompetence had restrained their optimism.
Thirty-four per cent said the April tax increases had made them less
optimistic about the UK economy and only 2 per cent said they had made them
more optimistic.
Fifty-eight per cent of directors in the north, 63 per cent in the Midlands
and 64 per cent in the south reported greater optimism about their own
companies' prospects.
Greatest confidence was reported in the services sector, where 72 per cent
of directors were more optimistic, followed by distribution, at 70 per cent,
and business services, at 62 per cent. In mining and construction the
proportion of directors reporting greater optimism about their own company's
prospects fell from 69 per cent in February to 55 per cent in April.
The biggest increase in optimism was among directors of medium-size
companies, employing between 101 and 200 people. These companies were also
the most likely to take on new employees during the next six months, with 55
per cent expecting increased employment levels and none expecting to cut
jobs.
The overall proportion of companies expecting to take on new employees rose
to 44 per cent in April, from 37 per cent in February.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Start to fight, Scots Conservatives urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Conservatives, cowed by their disastrous performance in last week's
regional council elections, were urged yesterday to fight back and 'stop
taking opposition insults and smears on the chin like gentlemen'.
The call for a more aggressive approach was issued on the opening day of the
party's conference in Inverness by Mr Adrian Shinwell, its Scottish
president. The sentiment was echoed by party activists milling around the
conference hall.
Mr Shinwell said the party needed to 'assess policy matters to see if they
stand up to objective scrutiny'. That required a 'period of examination and
reflection'. The party 'desperately needs to assess and improve our
presentation of ourselves and our policies'.
Although Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, referred to the regional
elections as a 'sideshow' in comparison with the European elections, it was
a line which several delegates rejected in private conversation.
The Conservatives finished in fourth place - behind Labour, the Liberal
Democrats and the Scottish National party - with less than 14 per cent of
the vote. This result could not be brushed off, one delegate said. The
issues which had made the party so unpopular last week would surface again
in the European elections.
For her and other delegates the most damaging thing the government had done
was to levy value added tax on domestic fuel. 'I don't think people in the
south realise what that means to us in Scotland. We still have some of our
radiators on in May and put the central heating back on in early September.'
A senior Tory dignitary was dismayed at the way the party had permitted the
opposition to set the agenda for nearly two years on the intensely sensitive
issue of water, which dogged the local election campaign.
Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems had planted the idea in the public mind
that the Tories intended to privatise Scotland's water - now controlled by
the regional councils. When the government belatedly rejected that policy,
it had not done so forcefully enough.
'We failed to educate the Scottish electorate in the basic facts about water
 -that it does not come free, that it will cost a lot to improve it and that
we were trying to find a way of doing that (which) would not cost the
council taxpayer too much.'
Another Tory from the central belt wondered if the mastery which Mr Ian
Lang, the Scottish secretary, enjoys over the opposition in the House of
Commons had not lulled the Scottish party leadership into a false sense of
security, which had been blown away by last week's elections. 'I think they
all need to be more combative,' he said.
That was the message from Mr Shinwell. But although this Glasgow lawyer is a
nephew of the doughty Labour MP, the late Emmanuel Shinwell, he does not
project a particularly combative image, and both Mr Lang and Sir Michael
Hirst, the Scottish party chairman, are men of reason rather than political
street-fighters.
In any case, in spite of Mr Hurd's encouragement, the European elections
will be very difficult for the Scottish Tories. They hold no Scottish
Euro-seats and have realistic hopes of winning only one, north-east
Scotland.
As Tories in the tea room noted, the elections are likely to be presented by
the opposition as a referendum on the government, and damaging policies such
as VAT will still be in place, whatever 'examination and reflection' Mr
Shinwell might like to see.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Tories confront Heseltine on mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday faced
opposition from his backbenchers over plans to privatise the Post Office.
Mr Robert Hicks, Cornwall South East, said there was 'genuine apprehension'
that fundamental changes to the Post Office could affect the sub-post office
network and the Royal Mail's uniform charge.
Sir Donald Thompson, Calder Valley, voiced his concern about the effects of
privatisation on rural post offices, many of which rely on a subsidy from
the Post Office.
Mr Hugh Dykes, Harrow East, said previous privatisations had been of
companies that had been by and large unsuccessful and lossmaking.
'In this case that is not so, and provided the Post Office can be freed from
Treasury bondage . . . there is no need to have the upheaval you have in
mind.'
Mr Heseltine, who favours privatisation of Royal Mail and the parcels arm,
said that a flotation would not affect the universality of delivery and the
universal charge for letters.
He pointed out that a significant competitor to the Post Office - the Dutch
Post Office - was about to have its shares floated and denied that previous
privatisations had only taken place because the companies had been in the
red.
'Privatisation has changed nationalised industries, serving a domestic
market from a monopoly base, to becoming competitive, world-class companies,
trading across the face of the earth to the greater benefit of the British
economy,' he said.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, attempted to reassure
backbenchers that the rural network of post offices would be safe
irrespective of privatisation.
Mr Colin Baker, general secretary of the Federation of Sub-Postmasters,
which represents 18,000 sub-postmasters, welcomed the speech.
However, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, warned that post
offices were still under threat because they were prevented from expanding
their commercial activities.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Ashdown rails at main parties over Europe referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, last night accused the
Conservatives and Labour of being 'afraid to consult the people' over Europe
by refusing to offer a referendum on the next stage of integration.
Launching his party's campaign in the west country for the June 9 European
elections, Mr Ashdown said that his pledge of a referendum did not undercut
the Liberal Democrats' fundamental commitment to Europe.
He told a rally in Exeter that the people's assent to significant
constitutional changes in Britain's relations with the European Union would
reinforce its place in a strong, successful Europe.
He added: 'Our message is simple. Europe matters because if we want a
strong, successful Britain, we need a strong successful Europe.'
But Mr Ashdown rejected what he called Conservative 'smears' that his party
wanted a centralised European superstate. Instead it argued for a
decentralised EU where decisions were taken at the lowest possible level of
govern-ment.
His speech came as Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, gave a
fore-taste of what is expected to be a bitter election campaign by accusing
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, of lying.
In a letter to Mr Hurd he said that the foreign secretary had used a speech
yesterday to the Tory conference in Inverness to 'tell lies' about Labour's
policy towards Europe.
Rejecting the charge that the opposition would give up the national veto, Mr
Cunningham said he totally supported Britain's right to maintain the veto on
defence, foreign policy, taxation, and the European budget.
In unusually vituperative language, Mr Cunningham added: 'You and your
colleagues lied throughout the 1992 general election. We do not intend to
let you get away with lying throughout the European elections.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Political Notebook: Sharing out the protest vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The discordant din from Mr John Major's government may have obscured the
fact, but the warring factions in the Tory party are not the only
participants in the European elections. One or two other parties will field
candidates on June 9.
Remember the Greens? They won a startling 15 per cent of the vote in 1989.
Mainstream politicians woke up horrified to discover that environmental
fears had spread beyond long-haired folk in sandals.
The Green party is still around. It intends to contest again all the 84
seats available to British members of the Strasbourg assembly. But there is
no chance of another triumph for the little people. Their best ideas were
stolen by ministers and supermarket chains. Voters anyway lose interest in
saving the planet when they are struggling with economic recession.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats expect to fare rather better this time
round. The party has no seats in Strasbourg at present. In 1989 it was on
the verge of extinction after the break-up of the old Liberal/SDP alliance.
After its recent success in the local elections, the party should win
anything up to a dozen seats in a swathe of southern England stretching
eastwards from Cornwall.
The Liberal Democrats are fervent pro-Europeans - unashamed federalists,
though in the German rather than the corrupted English sense of the word. Mr
Ashdown is committed to a single European currency, and his party wants a
stronger European parliament.
It believes that majority voting in the council of ministers should be the
rule. It wants an end to the 'pillared' struc-ture of intergovernmental
co-operation established at Maastricht. Foreign and defence policies should
be treated, like the single market, as responsibilities of the Union.
On the face of it that is a fairly clear agenda. But there is a snag. The
Liberal Democrats need votes from disaffected Tories. The opinion polls are
clear that however fed up they are with Mr Major, those voters are not keen
on transferring more powers to Europe.
Hence Mr Ashdown's pledge of a referendum on the next stage of European
integration. At a stroke the Liberal Democrat message was conveniently
blurred. We may be federalists, those Tory voters will be told, but don't
worry, you can always vote against us in a referendum.
The move was opposed by several of Mr Ashdown's senior colleagues. But
politics is about votes. Mr Ashdown prevailed.
Then there is Mr John Smith's Labour party. Divining its stance is not easy.
So far it has preferred to say as little as possible. The best one member of
the shadow cabinet could offer was that it was 'pro-European'. Pressed, he
said the phrase spoke for itself.
There is another starting point. Labour has signed up to the platform of the
Socialist Group, the most powerful multinational force in the Strasbourg
assembly.
The group's manifesto is as integrationist as any that can be found. It
wants a single currency, majority voting as the rule in the council,
much-extended social legislation, tax harmonisation and much more.
But it is not quite as simple as that. Mr Smith has obscured the extent to
which the manifesto commits his party. Like Mr Ashdown, he senses a
chauvinistic mood in the country.
Labour is unequivocal in its backing for extension to Britain of
Maastricht's social chapter. But it has refused to endorse more detailed
pledges on, for example, mandatory restrictions of working hours.
The party is for a single currency if it comes - but does not want to sound
enthusiastic about getting rid of sterling. Mr Smith's stance on an eventual
referendum is indistinguishable from that of Mr Major. Mr Jack Cunningham,
shadow foreign secretary, insists that Labour would not get rid of the
national veto.
For many in the Labour party (and one must exclude from this the party's
diminished but still vocal band of anti-marketeers led by Mr Peter Shore) it
is enough to be called pro-European.
The isolationism of the wilderness years of the early 1980s has been
replaced by the mantra that if something is good enough for France or
Germany it is good enough for Britain. Never mind that our partners
occasionally get it wrong.
So the Labour manifesto will be 'safe' above all. Much better to let the
Tories tear themselves apart and pick up the anti-Major protest vote than
risk the media spotlight being turned on a distinctive opposition policy.
Perhaps the Greens will not do so badly after all.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Thatcher may face Pergau quiz: MPs want aid link explained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baroness Thatcher, who as prime minister approved a donation of aid to
Malaysia for the Pergau dam project, has been invited to appear before a
leading Commons committee and be questioned on the affair.
Members of the foreign affairs committee yesterday sent an invitation to the
former prime minister asking her to appear before them in public and explain
the link between the UK's offer of Pounds 234m of aid to the Malaysian
government and a Pounds 1bn arms deal.
Lady Thatcher's appearance would be the first by any former prime minister
before a select committee of the Commons. It would mark the highlight of the
committee's investigation, in which three former members of her cabinet have
already been interrogated.
Parliamentary rules state that, as a member of the House of Lords, Lady
Thatcher is not obliged to accept the invitation. But Mr Dennis Canavan,
Labour MP for Falkirk West, who is on the committee, said yesterday that it
would 'look bad' if she turned it down.
Some Tory MPs on the committee argued strongly yesterday that an invitation
should not been sent because it was unclear whether the former prime
minister had been aware of the link between the arms and aid deals when they
were made in 1988. It is alleged that the linkage broke Whitehall guidelines
on aid provision.
In his evidence to the committee, Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary,
said that the decision to link the two had been taken entirely by Lord
Younger, then defence secretary. Lord Howe also suggested that attempts to
break the link between the two deals had been mainly led by himself.
Another Tory MP argued that the invitation to Lady Thatcher would delay
progress in completing the committee's report into the affair.
However, Labour MPs said there was strong documentary evidence that Lady
Thatcher had played an important role in attempts to hide the connection
between the aid and arms deals.
In June 1988 she wrote a letter to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, confirming that the offer of aid would go ahead but also
expressing her hope that the defence contract could be signed later that
year.
Members of the committee also want to know why Lady Thatcher gave a green
light to the offer of aid for the dam earlier in the year, although Foreign
Office officials had been given only two days to carry out a project
assessment.
Members of Lady Thatcher's staff could give no indication last night of
whether she would attend.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Naval dockyards advertised for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence is today advertising the Devonport and Rosyth naval
dockyards for sale in the national press.
The ministry said it had taken the unusual step of advertising in the
national press to gain interest from as wide a group of potential purchasers
as possible.
Most MoD contracts are advertised in the ministry's contracts bulletin.
It was intended that the sale should be more like a conventional
privatisation than most other ministry tenders.
The MoD is initially inviting companies to register an interest, before May
27, in buying the two yards, and a formal invitation to tender will then
follow.
A trade sale direct to the private sector is expected to be completed by
1996.
Detailed negotiations are likely in coming months over the assets likely to
be included in the package, as well as the liabilities any acquiring company
would have to take on.
These would include how much land is included in the sale of the two yards,
responsibility for any environmental liabilities, and the cost of any
redundancies.
The two yards are run under management contracts. Rosyth, in Fife, is run by
Babcock Thorn; and Devonport, in Plymouth, is run by DML Management. Most
redundancy costs are met by the ministry.
Issues such as who would be responsible for any future redundancy costs will
be central to the negotiations.
As well as the incumbent management teams, several other companies are
thought to be interested in buying the yards. British Aerospace, GEC, and
VSEL are all potential bidders - both GEC and VSEL already own construction
yards.
Devonport recently won the contract to refit all of Britain's nuclear
submarines after a fierce two-year battle with Rosyth.
In the subsequent arguments over the yard's future, Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, awarded Rosyth a large package of surface ship work.
While both yards have work for the rest of the decade, analysts question
whether the reduction in the size of the Royal Navy will leave sufficient
work for both yards in the long term.
Devonport is known to be short of work on surface ships, having recently
completed a refit of the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious.
It is expected to announce about 500 job losses in support and
administration personnel in the next few weeks. Some surface ship workers
are also likely to go.
Analysts believe that further cuts in the workforces are almost inevitable,
and that one of the yards may eventually close.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Authorities shake-up could boost spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local government reorganisation in England and Wales could bring a sharp
rise in spending and hamper managerial reforms, the Audit Commission warns
today.
In England and Wales the government plans to replace the current two-tier
system of counties and districts with new single-tier 'unitary' authorities,
based on amalgamations of districts, in 1996 and 1997. The commission, which
acts as a watchdog for the public sector, says this will be the most complex
local government reorganisation yet attempted.
But councils are not preparing for the change, it says, and some newly
created authorities 'could start life in a financial crisis, possibly
inheriting high spending commitments and low balances from outgoing
councils'.
'Outgoing' authorities, whose abolition is certain, may wish to enter into
'costly and long-term' commitments, unimpeded by any need for long-term
budgeting, according to the commission's report.
Figures for building new swimming pools - a local government responsibility
 -suggest that outgoing local authorities spent freely before the last
reorganisation to affect non-metropolitan England and Wales, in 1974.
In that year, 160 new swimming pools were opened, and more than 100 the next
year. But from 1977 to 1990, the number opened never exceeded 50.
The report says: 'The Audit Commission is aware that some councils facing
reorganisation are already planning to commission new projects.'
Reallocating needs-based government grants to the new councils could also be
expensive. Mr Bob Chilton, director of local government studies for the
commission, said grants to county councils were currently redistributive,
because they tended to spend equally across the areas they covered.
If smaller unitary authorities were created, needier districts would receive
more, while the wealthier areas would receive less, under the government's
formula. Mr Chilton suggested that the government might be forced to pay out
extra funds to reduce the effects on the 'loser' councils.
Compulsory competitive tendering of white-collar services could also be
damaged, and delayed. Mr Chilton said: 'There are two separate reform
processes which do not mesh.'
He said some authorities were using impending reorganisation as an excuse
not to prepare for the next round of tendering, which is scheduled to start
18 months after the new councils are formed.
More basic preparations are also lacking. By the end of last year, 40 per
cent of district and 30 per cent of counties had still failed to compile
full registers of council assets - supposed to be completed nine months
earlier.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Low asset recovery rate expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
expect to be able to realise only a third of the stated assets of its
English operations, an official report revealed yesterday, Andrew Jack
writes.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, said it had realised Dollars 749.6m
(Pounds 513.4m) and estimated that a further Dollars 344.2m could be
recovered from a book value of Dollars 3.2bn, according to the annual return
filed with the Department of Trade and Industry.
The low proportion gives an indication of the poor degree of loan management
or the extent of falsification in the figures reported in BCCI's accounts in
the final year before it was closed in a worldwide swoop by regulators in
July 1991.
Total receipts in the English liquidation to January 15 this year are
Dollars 882.4m, including Dollars 132.8m in interest and tax refunds.
Most of the realisations are from the BCCI loan book - with a reported value
of Dollars 1.7bn - which included more than 63,000 overdrawn accounts.
The DTI report shows that there have been 34,799 claims on the English BCCI
branch assets from creditors around the world totalling Dollars 3.17bn.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Backers sought for new Pounds 10m business newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Mail on Sunday journalist is trying to raise money to launch a
specialised business, industrial and financial newspaper.
Mr Clive Wolman - the Mail on Sunday's City editor and a former Financial
Times journalist - is seeking about Pounds 10m.
The idea was suggested to Associated Newspapers, which owns the Mail on
Sunday, a year ago, and was researched in detail and rejected.
The idea then was for a single paper which would be printed at 5am to get
late-breaking news missed by conventional newspapers, and then delivered by
motorcycle to offices in the City.
The editorial content would concentrate on niche areas such as commodities,
which Mr Wolman believes are not given enough weight in the existing press.
The concept now is for something closer to a daily trade newspaper - or
series of daily trade newspapers - than a conventional national news-paper.
'It would only be a national newspaper in the sense that it would be
available in more than one city,' said Mr Wolman yesterday. 'To see it as a
new national newspaper misses the whole point.'
Mr Wolman conceded that he did not yet have any financial backing for the
paper. It would probably have a common core and different specialist
segments aimed at particular markets such as, for instance, oil and energy.
Emap, the publishing and exhibitions group which also owns a large number of
business magazines, has taken an interest in the concept and has discussed
it with executives at Mirror Group Newspapers.
Mr David Montgomery, the MGN chief executive, is however considered very
unlikely to get involved in such a new publishing venture while he is still
involved in integrating the business management of The Independent and
Independent on Sunday with MGN.
Mr Wolman conceded yesterday: 'I'm really under pressure now when nothing
much is happening.'
Meanwhile another senior Associated Newspapers journalist is believed to be
working on the concept of an afternoon financial newspaper for the City of
London, although little is known about how real the project is.

FT  12 MAY 94 / BCCI fraudster is jailed: Judge mitigates Virani sentence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nazmudin Virani, the former property entrepreneur convicted of fraud over
his business dealings with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
was jailed for 2 1/2 years at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Passing sentence, Mr Justice Hutchison said the gravity of the offences Mr
Virani had been found guilty of demanded an immediate prison sentence.
However, the judge said the mitigating circumstances in Mr Virani's case,
such as his charity work and impressive character references, meant he was
reducing the sentence from the level he had initially considered.
These references included one from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat
leader, commending Mr Virani's work for the Asian community.
Mr Virani was convicted earlier this month of six counts of furnishing false
information to Price Waterhouse, the BCCI auditors, and one of false
accounting.
By signing bogus audit confirmation reports which deceived Price Waterhouse
and pretended companies in the Virani group owed money to BCCI, Mr Virani
was able artificially to boost BCCI's profits by some Pounds 11m.
Mr Justice Hutchison said that in the context of the massive fraud
perpetrated by BCCI and its senior management, the offences committed by Mr
Virani were relatively modest.
However, their gravity was demonstrated by the fact that he had deceived
Price Waterhouse into thinking the bank's financial health was far greater
than it was.
Other people had contributed to the fraud on a much grander scale, the judge
said. Yet he told Mr Virani: 'I cannot exclude the possibility that yours
was the brick in the wall that kept the edifice standing longer than it
would have done otherwise.'
There was also no doubt that Mr Virani had benefited from the fraud by
receiving very favourable treatment from BCCI, he said.
The judge did not disqualify Mr Virani from being a company director in
future and dismissed a claim by the businessman's lawyers that prison would
'break' him.
'I don't believe that. I believe you are of sterner stuff. I believe that on
your release you will resume an honest and useful life in the business
community,' he told Mr Virani.
Earlier, he had said that Mr Virani had earned considerable respect for the
way he had built up a successful business career after being expelled from
Uganda. 'That fact makes all the more tragic your fall,' he said.
The judge also made no order for Mr Virani to pay part of the Pounds 2.2m
costs incurred by the Serious Fraud Office in bringing the prosecution. The
court heard that although Mr Virani had two Swiss bank accounts containing a
total of Pounds 3.6m, these had both been frozen and his debts to the BCCI
liquidators totalled almost Pounds 7m. His Pounds 800,000 house in south
London had been transferred into his wife's name in 1992.
Mr Virani's lawyers afterwards said that they intended to appeal against
both his conviction and sentence.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Speculative office projects return to City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work is beginning on the first large speculative office projects to be built
in the City of London since the property market went into recession more
than three years ago.
London and Manchester Group, a life insurance company, is building a 214,000
sq ft building at Finsbury Pavement that will include 125,000 sq ft of
offices and a 96,000 sq ft department store for Marks and Spencer.
The site, bought by London and Manchester in 1987, was sold to Land and
Property Trust, a company now in liquidation, for Pounds 75m in 1989. London
and Manchester repurchased the site for Pounds 17.5m in 1992.
The company has cleared the site and work is expected to begin at the end of
the month. The glass and steel building has been designed by architects
Sheppard Robson.
The building is one of a handful of speculative City developments where work
has or is about to begin. Wates City of London Properties has started work
on a 57,000 sq ft office scheme at Cheapside, while British Land is
installing the foundations for a 160,000 sq ft office scheme at the Corn
Exchange in the City.
Developers are reacting to improved demand from tenants and a reduction in
the number of good-quality vacant properties. 'There have been no
speculative office developments in the City of London for several years and
the supply of good quality, well-located office schemes is now declining
quite rapidly,' said Mr David Low, group property manager of London and
Manchester Assurance.
Mr John Weston Smith of British Land said: 'There will be a shortage of
space by the time our building is ready for leasing up in early 1996.'
Richard Ellis, a firm of chartered surveyors, estimates that 2.8m sq ft of
space was taken up by tenants during the first three months of this year -
the highest quarterly take-up since 1989. Central London office vacancy
rates have fallen by 26 per cent during the year to 19m sq ft.
The improvement in the City office market is encouraging other developers to
bring forward proposals. Mirror Group Newspapers has applied for planning
permission to redevelop its old headquarters on Holborn Circus.
MGN intends to build three self-contained buildings designed by Sir Norman
Foster, comprising 818,435 sq ft gross of offices, 12,782 sq ft of shops and
16,000 sq ft for a pub. The proposed building, which would have nine storeys
and be 50m high, would obstruct the view of St Paul's Cathedral less than
the existing building which is 12 storeys and 70m high.
In the past year, the take-up of offices has focused on modern space,
according to Richard Ellis. The availability of new developments in central
London has fallen by 45 per cent since March 1993, whereas the amount of
second-hand space on the market has dropped by only 17 per cent.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Creditors continue the waiting game: How much and when they
will be paid is shrouded in uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The annual question is when and how much the creditors will be paid,' said
Mr Christopher Morris, a liquidator of the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, yesterday. 'The answer is still shrouded in
uncertainty.'
Nearly three years after BCCI was closed by regulators in July 1991, those
who lost money will still need a good deal more patience before seeing much
sign of redress.
While some fresh information was provided yesterday by Touche Ross, BCCI's
liquidator, in the annual filing with the Department of Trade and Industry,
many gaps remain.
While some creditors have received partial interim payments through
compensation schemes, there is no sign of any quick disbursement from BCCI's
diminishing assets.
The liquidators have never revised their original estimate that creditors
may ultimately receive 30p-40p in the pound. Mr Morris said yesterday there
was 'no reason to change it'.
The total value of claims against BCCI remains unclear. So far there are
creditors demanding nearly Dollars 3.2bn against the English assets alone.
Many may not identify themselves until the prospect of a dividend looms.
Other claims may come from legal actions against the bank, including Dollars
2.2bn allegedly stolen from the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority
shareholder, unless the liquidators successfully conclude an agreement with
it.
The final figure will also depend on how many of the separate national BCCI
liquidations around the world decide to 'pool' their assets with the English
liquidation. This will in turn depend on the level of any revised dividend.
A number of models have been developed by the liquidators to juggle these
elements. One such calculation suggests possible total claims in the range
of Dollars 9bn to Dollars 9.5bn.
The assets to be distributed are equally hazy - although certainly far
smaller. Total estimated realisations from BCCI's stated assets in the UK,
Isle of Man and Luxembourg are Dollars 1.2bn. More will come from interest,
less a large proportion spent on professional fees and running costs.
If other parts of BCCI - notably BCCI Overseas - join the pooling agreement,
their assets will also swell the pot available for distribution by several
hundred million dollars. A further Dollars 750m-Dollars 1bn may come from
assets and the share in out-of-court settlements negotiated with the US
authorities by BCCI and other related parties.
The government of Abu Dhabi earlier this year provisionally agreed to a
revised deal in which it would pay Dollars 1.8bn to creditors in exchange
for a waiver of litigation against it by the liquidators.
Mr Morris said yesterday that it may take another two months before the
detailed legal agreement is completed. It must then be submitted to the BCCI
creditors' committees for approval, and then ratified in the English,
Luxembourg and Cayman Islands courts.
In total, these sources might provide a total of assets available relatively
soon for distribution to creditors of a maximum of something over Dollars
4bn.
Any further realisations will come from litigation, which could take many
years. Touche Ross has sued Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part
of Ernst &amp; Young, as auditors to the bank, for Dollars 11bn. It has sued the
Bank of England for more than Pounds 550m.
Writs have also been issued against the National Commercial Bank of Saudi
Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer;
the IML, the Luxembourg banking regulator; BCCI's directors; and the Gokal
brothers, controllers of the Gulf shipping group which proved one of BCCI's
largest debtors. Mr Morris said yesterday that further legal actions were
also likely.
All this means that on the most optimistic view creditors are unlikely to
receive a dividend until well into next year. This could total 15p-20p in
the pound. Further payments will be subject to considerable uncertainty and
delay.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Sunday betting go-ahead welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bookmakers yesterday expressed delight at the decision to allow Sunday
betting on horse-racing in England and Wales, but warned that the industry
faced strong competition from rival attractions such as do-it-yourself
stores and garden centres.
The Commons approved Sunday betting by a majority of 101 on Tuesday night.
Evening betting, which began last year, has provided a substantial boost to
bookmakers, which now hope Sunday racing will do the same.
William Hill, the second biggest bookmaking chain with 1,700 shops, said the
horse-racing industry would have to introduce new enthusiasts to the sport
rather than simply moving weekday customers to Sundays.
William Hill said it was not yet clear whether there would be a net increase
in race meetings or whether existing fixtures would be moved to Sundays.
It is too late to organise betting on Sunday racing this year. Next year
bookmakers expect about 12 meetings to take place on Sundays, and say the
real effect will not be felt until 1996.
A small number of Sunday races without betting have been taking place since
1992. Mr Chris Bell, assistant managing director of Ladbroke Racing, said
these have demonstrated that it will be possible to bring new customers to
horse racing and betting.
Mr Bell, whose company is the biggest bookmaking chain with 1,923 shops,
said spectators at Sunday events had been different from those attending
races on other days - there had been significantly more families and
children.
He warned, however, that Sunday was already the main family leisure day. 'We
will have to compete with the rest of the leisure industry. The primary
opposition will be do-it-yourself, garden centres, pubs and time with the
family.'
Mr John Morgan, managing director of Coral Racing, said he expected the
racing industry to add other attractions to their events, as has happened in
other countries with Sunday racing. These could include shopping outlets and
parachute jumps.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Fingerprint decision near
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Home Office is close to deciding on the final shortlist of companies to
implement the first comprehensive national automated fingerprint recognition
system.
The system, which will cost Pounds 45m at present prices, will be used by
the 43 police forces in England and Wales.
The 18 tenderers have been reduced to 10 - Arvin Calspan, Digital Equipment,
Electronic Data Systems, International Business Machines, SAIC, TRW and
Unisys of the US, Groupe Bull of France, ICL, owned by Fujitsu of Japan, and
Siemens Nixdorf of Germany.
On Monday the list will be reduced to four and a final decision will be made
in October for the system, which will be introduced in three years.
A number of police forces are already making use of an IBM automated
fingerprint recognition service.
The intention is that the new system will for the first time combine
identification of fingerprints discovered at the scene of a crime and
personal identification - comparing a suspect's prints with those held on
the database.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Major locks horns with Smith over Scott affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister and the Labour leader were last night locked in a furious
row over standards of conduct in government after a minister who admitted
misleading parliament was reprieved by the Speaker of the Commons.
Mr John Major gave full backing to Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security
minister, after the Speaker declined to refer him for disciplinary action
over a false statement that he had made in a debate on rights for the
disabled.
Mr John Smith pressed home calls for the minister's resignation, claiming
that the government had 'disgracefully deceived' disabled people by plotting
to wreck legislation that would have given them new rights.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said she would not ask the Commons
committee on privileges to rule whether Mr Scott was guilty of 'contempt' of
the House. Her decision caused consternation among Labour MPs, some of whom
asked her to reconsider the ruling.
But ministers privately admitted that the tactics which the government had
used to defeat the bill had done serious damage to the Tories' credibility
before the European elections.
Mr Scott apologised to the Commons on Tuesday, withdrawing a statement that
his department had had 'no part' in helping Tory backbenchers draw up the
amendments that scuppered the bill.
Mr Major said in a letter to the Labour leader yesterday that he regarded
the apology as an end to the matter. Downing Street officials also stressed
that Mr Scott had 'inadvertently' misled parliament, and had not been in
full possession of facts relating to the amendments during last Friday's
debate.
But Mr Smith retorted that the government's tactics in defeating the private
member's bill - and its unwillingness to sack Mr Scott - were 'a squalid
affair'.
As ministerial colleagues rallied to his defence, Mr Scott's daughter
Victoria, who works for the Royal Association for Disability and
Rehabilitation, accused the government of 'lying' over the bill.
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I have spoken to him (Mr Scott) and
I hope to talk about it again.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Thefts of trucks 'cost Pounds 500m'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Truck theft costs British industry more than Pounds 500m a year, the Freight
Transport Association said yesterday. More than one in three operators had a
vehicle stolen last year.
An association survey of 1,200 companies found that security devices
generally had only a limited effect on the numbers of thefts. One company
reported 107 vehicles broken into or stolen.
Some companies found novel ways of beating the thieves: one painted its
vehicles bright pink, and another carried raw sewage.
The survey found that 45 per cent of vehicles stolen were fitted with
alarms; nearly half the thefts took place at home depots; and that most
thefts were in the north-east of England with London, Birmingham and Bristol
being other badly hit areas, and Scotland the most theft-free area.

FT  12 MAY 94 / De-regulation post demands rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night rejected demands that an opposition MP should head
the new Commons committee which is to scrutinise a faster procedure for
repealing legislation that imposes unnecessary burdens on commerce and
industry.
Mr Nick Brown, from the Labour front bench, and Mr Archie Kirkwood, for the
Liberal Democrats, maintained that the committee's stature would be enhanced
if its chairman were appointed from the opposition benches.
The new committee, composed of 16 MPs, will examine proposals by ministers
to use powers provided by the de-regulation bill to remove redundant acts
from the statute book by parliamentary orders instead of through new primary
legislation.
Mr Brown said he feared that the de-regulation bill would be used to remove
important legislative safeguards ensuring essential safety standards for
workers, and promised that it would be repealed by the next Labour
government.
Sir Peter Emery, Tory chairman of the procedure committee, said the
de-regulation scrutiny committee would have sufficient power to alert the
Commons if there was any possibility of the new powers provided by the bill
being abused.
Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, warned that a
'Conservative placeman' would be appointed to chair the new committee, and
that the committee would provide no real protection whatever.

Britain lacks a long-term agenda to develop technology and industry, and the
Treasury is taking too complacent a view of recovery, the Engineering
Employers Federation said yesterday.
A federation report, published before the government's white paper on
competitiveness which is due on Monday, says the trade deficit and the
consumption/investment imbalance will not be solved merely by recovery.
Mr Graham MacKenzie, federation director-general, said: 'There is an urgent
need for strategic decisions.'
Manufacturing is receiving good support from the government, the report
says, but it is critical of the lack of strategy for energy and transport
infrastructures.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Expenses come under tax reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies will be required to provide employees with details of their
expenses and benefits-in-kind each year under proposals for the new tax
system of self-assessment unveiled yesterday by the Inland Revenue.
They will have to provide full information to staff on pay and tax deducted
by May 19 after the end of the tax year, and submit expenses and benefits
information by July 6.
The details are contained in a consultative document on the implications of
self-assessment for employers and employees just circulated.
Self-assessment, which begins in the 1996-97 tax year, will affect an
estimated 9m taxpayers who submit tax returns, including many in the
Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system in the upper-rate tax band or with complex tax
affairs.
The system was proposed in 1991, ratified by the last two chancellors, and
many of the details were passed in the most recent finance act which became
law last month.
The focus so far has been on the self-employed, but the latest proposals
provide further details for those on PAYE who will still be ensnared by the
new system.
The Revenue recommends that the employer should include information on the
cash equivalent for any benefit-in-kind provided to the employee. Companies
would face fines if they fail to provide employees with the information.
Comments on the document are invited by July.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Minister protects cable TV from BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An early lifting of the controversial ban on British Telecommunications
carrying entertainment over its network was ruled out yesterday.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, communications minister, told the Commons trade and
industry committee: 'Any premature review of that policy would have a
devastating impact on the investment of the cable companies.'
Cable companies - mostly US owned - are building combined cable TV and
telephone networks in urban areas. They have gained nearly 400,000
customers, and plan to invest Pounds 6bn in the next five years.
The first flotation of a cable company - Telewest - is about to take place
on the London Stock Exchange, and analysts believe the ban on BT carrying
entertainment until at least 1998 is important to sustaining investor
confidence.
BT says the ban is likely to delay its investment in 'superhighway'
broadband technology - notably the laying of fibre in local networks.
The government emphasised yesterday that the encouragement of competition in
telecommunications was its chief priority.
Pressed by MPs, Mr McLoughlin said the government would 'seriously consider'
the case for targets to be set obliging companies building fibre local
networks to wire up public-sector institutions such as schools and
hospitals.
Mr McLoughlin also affirmed the government's commitment to a universal
telecommunication service, amid fears that the cable companies'
concentration on urban Britain would leave rural areas without advanced
services.
BT said it regretted the government's stance. 'We firmly believe that the UK
needs a seamless broadband network, and BT is uniquely placed to provide
it.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Landlords call for repeal of lease law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Property Federation, a landlords' association, has called on the
government to repeal a law which gives tenants the right to renew leases at
the end of their term.
Mr Roger Carey, president of the federation, yesterday described the right
as an 'anachronism', brought in to protect tenants at a time when property
was scarce and tenants' awareness low.
The federation's proposals are an attempt to improve the position of
landlords if the government presses ahead with its intention to abolish
privity of contract, a law that may make a former occupier of a building
responsible for paying rent if a subsequent tenant defaults.
The government is expected to back a private members bill abolishing privity
of contract, which is due to be published later this month. Lord Mackay, the
Lord Chancellor, has stated his support for the measure in relation to new
leases.
The bill is being brought forward by Mr Peter Thurnham, a Conservative MP,
and is backed by the British Retail Consortium, which says privity of
contract puts an unfair burden on commercial tenants.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said yesterday that an
announcement on commercial property lease reform - the subject of a
consultation paper - would be made 'as soon as possible'.

The number of homes in England and Wales that had water supplies
disconnected for not paying bills fell by a third to 12,452 in the 12 months
to the end of March 31, from 18,636 in the previous period, water watchdog
Ofwat said.
This compares with 21,282 in the peak period for disconnections, the 12
months to March 1992, which lead to widespread criticism of the privatised

FT  12 MAY 94 / Smith 'incandescent' as Speaker reprieves Scott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas Scott, the minister who admitted misleading parliament in a
debate on rights for the disabled, yesterday won a reprieve from the speaker
of the Commons after she decided not to refer his case for disciplinary
action.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, told MPs she would not initiate an
inquiry by the Commons Privileges Committee into whether Mr Scott had been
'in contempt' of the House during a debate last week.
Downing Street officials hoped the ruling would end pressure on the social
security minister to resign.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was reported to be 'incandescent' that Mr
Scott had appeared to lie to the Commons without losing his post. A
spokesman for Mr Smith said he regarded the case as 'one of the clearest
indications yet of how little public accountability there is in John Major's
government'.
In a letter to Mr Smith, the prime minister firmly backed Mr Scott. 'I now
consider the matter closed,' he said.
In reply, Mr Smith referred to the affair as 'a squalid episode'.
Tory MPs said the government's image had been dented by claims that the
minister had used 'dirty tricks' to defeat a bill to improve rights for
disabled workers.
Mr Scott apologised to the Commons on Tuesday for saying that his department
had had 'no part whatsoever' in helping Tory backbenchers draw up the
amendments that had scuppered the bill.
Several Labour MPs criticised the ruling, saying Mr Scott had lied to the
House.
Downing Street officials stressed that Mr Scott had 'inadvertently' misled
parliament, and had not been in full possession of the facts relating to the
amendments during last Friday's debate.
But as ministerial colleagues rallied to his defence, Mr Scott's daughter
Victoria, who works for the Royal Association for Disability and
Rehabilitation, accused the government of 'lying' over the bill.
'I have spoken to him (Mr Scott) and I hope to talk about it again,' she
said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'I am very angry with him on behalf
of 6.5m disabled people, but we remain very good friends.'

FT  12 MAY 94 / Search starts for way to revive CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers and business leaders yesterday began an urgent search for a means
of reviving the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project for a cross-London rail link
after its surprise rejection by a Commons committee on Tuesday.
The government is studying three possible options for overturning the
four-man private bill committee's controversial decision: relaunching the
proposal as a hybrid bill; promoting it through the new and untried
Transport and Works Act; or sending it back to the committee.
Whichever method is chosen the project is expected to suffer considerable
extra delays.
Downing Street last night underlined the government's commitment to
CrossRail. A spokesman said ministers would be addressing the situation with
'urgency' because of the time involved in bringing forward a new bill. The
Treasury has been told it cannot divert the Pounds 200m earmarked for
preliminary work to other projects.
Labour and members of the business community also reaffirmed their support
for the plan, which would link Paddington station in west London and
Liverpool Street station in east London by an underground rail tunnel.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, urged the government to put a
motion before the Commons sending the bill back to the committee and
instructing them to look at it again. There was a precedent in the shape of
a bill to build the South West Durham Railway which was returned to a
private bill committee in 1836, Labour said.
More likely options are the restarting of the parliamentary process by means
of a hybrid bill - so named because it involves both public and private
interests. This requires a second committee stage - during which objections,
known as petitions, are considered - and is a lengthy procedure.
The Transport and Works Act of 1992 would involve the sponsors requesting Mr
John MacGregor, the transport secretary, to lay an order before parliament.
Objections are then heard at a public inquiry or inquiries along the route.
The Corporation of London said it was working to mobilise City backing for
the project. Mr Michael Cassidy, policy chairman, said the corporation would
be happy if parliament would approve the principle of the CrossRail link,
allowing modifications to the present plans to be made. The proposal has
been criticised for failing to provide interchanges with the planned Channel
tunnel rail link and with the Heathrow Express link.
CrossRail said its 350 staff would continue work on the project's design
until a decision was taken on its future. Spending so far amounts to Pounds
109m.
The private bill committee has given no reasons for its decision but it is
believed to have been swayed by an engineers' report which said the link
would not be justified by demand until 2010.
The private bill procedure was chosen because the bill's backers were
British Rail and London Underground and it involved an infrastructure
project that could damage property rights.

An investment consortium led by Bell South of the US yesterday won Israel's
public tender to provide nationwide cellular phone services.
It was in competition with Motorola-Bezek, the Israel state-owned telephone
company, which had a monopoly till now.
The entry of a second player in the cellular phone market is part of the
Israeli government's ongoing liberalisation programme intended to encourage
efficiency and competition.
The communications ministry said the Bell South Consortium - which includes
the Safra family of bankers, Discount Investments of Israel, and Israel
Aircraft Industries - had won the tender because it had submitted the lowest
price customers will pay for services.
Israel expects the consortium to invest Dollars 85m (Pounds 57m) to Dollars
130m (Pounds 87m) in the expanding cellular phone market and to start
operating within 15 months.
The country has 60,000 cellular phone users and the communications ministry
predicts that the national market will increase to 350,000 within 10 years.
Motorola-Bezek's licence, which had been due to expire this year, was
extended until 2010 after the state-owned group had agreed to lose its
monopoly.

FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Magnesium imports 'harmful to US groups'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US International Trade Commission, examining foreign exporters' dumping
of magnesium at below cost, said yesterday US companies appear to have been
damaged, Reuter reports from Washington.
The finding was the first step of an anti-dumping inquiry involving
magnesium imports from China, Russia and Ukraine.
The case now goes to the commerce department, which will investigate whether
the metal was sold at unfairly low prices in 1993.
If it decides dumping occurred, the ITC would be asked to make a final
determination of injury and countervailing duties could be collected.
The complaint was brought by Magcorp and two labour unions at the end of
March.
Magcorp and the unions say the fair price for magnesium from the three
nations was from Dollars 1.41 to Dollars 1.49 per pound, but Russia sold
magnesium for as low as 41 cents per pound.
The ITC said imports of pure and alloy magnesium from China and Russia
should be investigated. They also supported an investigation of pure
magnesium from Ukraine but rejected an investigation of alloy-grade
magnesium from that country.
Pure magnesium is used in making aluminum and in desulfurisation.
Alloy-grade magnesium is used in die casting.
Imports of magnesium surged from 1991-93 and prices fell. Shipments from the
three nations totalled 23,758 metric tons in 199.
The complaint was the second time US producers have moved against a flood of
metals exports from former Soviet states. In the other instance, they acted
in concert with other nations to curb voluntarily global aluminium
production.

FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Andean Pact still split on outside tariff
 -FT writers on a growing market's oldest problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade is growing rapidly among the five countries of the Andean Pact but its
member governments remain divided over an issue that has dogged them since
the trade grouping was founded 25 years ago - a common external tariff.
Preliminary estimates from the group - comprising Bolivia, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela with a combined gross domestic product of more
than Dollars 130bn - show a 30 per cent jump in trade among its members in
1993 after an increase of 20 per cent in 1992. Intra-regional trade,
including fuel products, reached a record Dollars 2.89bn last year, against
only Dollars 1bn as recently as 1989.
The grouping has been particularly important for a growing band of small and
medium-sized companies selling non-traditional products. Colombian
businesses view the Andean region as a good testing ground for more
difficult markets and see the enlarged market as important in encouraging
foreign investment and cross-border joint ventures.
Colombia is the chief exporter to other countries within the group,
responsible for 41 per cent of all intra-regional exports last year. With
imports to Colombia from Ecuador and Venezuela also rising rapidly,
infrastructure on these two borders is already under strain.
Special border posts created by the pact provide frontier services for
transporting goods but there are still many difficulties caused by
differences in national legislation. Air services between all Andean
countries have improved substantially, with several regional carriers now
flying between the main cities.
More good news for the pact came last month with the decision by the
Peruvian government of President Alberto Fujimori, which temporarily
withdrew in August 1992, to return as a fully-fledged member by the end of
the year.
Its withdrawal had been prompted by what it called unfair competition.
Ministers criticised the subsidies they claimed Venezuela and Colombia were
granting to exporters and said Peruvian companies were put at a disadvantage
by higher energy costs and public service tariffs.
Although it is not clear that these issues have been resolved, Peru has said
it will gradually rejoin the free trade zone, applying from this month a
zero tariff to products previously paying 5 per cent and by December to
products now paying 10 per cent.
The central relationship within the pact is that between Venezuela and
Colombia: trade between the two rose 45 per cent in 1993 and Colombia's
President Cesar Gaviria said last week that bilateral trade would reach an
annual Dollars 2bn very soon.
The two are also talking to Mexico over the establishment of the so-called
Group of Three, which would join Colombia and Venezuela in a trade accord
with Mexico. Ecuador has already said it would like to join once it gets off
the ground.
Final negotiations over the G3 have proved slower than expected, in part
because the three-month-old Venezuelan government of President Rafael
Caldera has had other priorities. When Mr Caldera met Mr Gaviria last week -
the latter's eighth visit to Caracas - the two leaders re-confirmed their
commitment to a G3 agreement.
Venezuelan officials say Mr Caldera recognises the importance of free trade
with Colombia and has indicated he will not let problems - such as border
disputes, transhipment of cocaine and Colombian guerrilla action along the
border - hurt trade relations.
Despite the perception that relations with Venezuela are more important, Mr
Gaviria's administration has also kept up pressure for the Andean common
external tariff to come into effect as soon as possible. The common tariff
was supposed to have been effective at the start of 1992, but a decision has
been postponed several times and it is far from clear an accord can be
reached soon.
The talks centre on a a four-tier external tariff of between 5 and 20 per
cent, which some external observers regard as excessively complicated.
Bolivia already has a two-tier tariff structure with a maximum of 10 per
cent, and is likely to keep it despite the potential for Bolivia to be used
as a platform for entry to the free trade zone.
Ecuador has been insisting on important exceptions to the common external
tariff which others find unacceptable. The Peruvian government wants it set
at a flat 15 per cent - the rate it now levies on 98 per cent of imports.
Most of Peru's manufacturers and exporters would prefer a staggered regime -
but the Fujimori government is committed to a flat rate, which the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank also favour.
Some observers reckon that the longer the decision on the external tariff is
delayed, the less likely it will be that an agreement will be secured.
While growing fast, trade among Andean countries is still a relatively small
proportion - about 5 per cent - of the region's overall trade. Meanwhile,
other groupings - such as the G3 and Mercosur, the southern cone market
which Bolivia wants to join - are also growing in significance and exerting
a centrifugal force on the pact's members.

Four US companies were selected yesterday to take a total shareholding of
22.2 per cent in a consortium that will operate South Korea's second mobile
telephone network.
This deal is the latest example of South Korea demanding technology
transfers in return for allowing foreign companies market access.
The US companies were chosen because of their willingness to transfer
hardware and operating software for the code-division multiple access (CDMA)
system, which is competing against the European Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM)
standard for advanced digital telecommunications.
The four US partners are AirTouch Communications, the wireless
communications company which was spun off from Pactel and which has a 10 per
cent stake, Southwestern Bell (7 per cent), GTE (4 per cent), and Qualcomm
(1.2 per cent).
Pohang Iron and Steel and the Kolon textile group are the biggest
shareholders in the Sinsegi mobile telecom network, which also includes
Korea's leading telecommunications equipment manufacturers among the 221
domestic companies in the consortium.
South Korea is one of the first countries to embrace CDMA technology. Korean
companies hope to sell CDMA equipment to other markets. The Sinsegi network
is to go into operation by the end of 1995 and will compete against Korean
Mobile Telecom (KMT).
The number of cellular telephone subscribers in Korea has grown by almost 90
per cent a year since 1988 and reached 500,000 this year.

'Mr Hata said we should seek ways to re-engage, and the president agreed,'
Mr Kantor said.
This came amid growing optimism in the Clinton administration that Japan is
ready to re-start the talks, which broke down in February when Mr Morohiro
Hosokawa, then the Japanese prime minister, met the US president in
Washington.
A senior administration official said he believed there was now 'a real
possibility' of resuming preparatory talks with Japan before the meeting of
Group of Seven government leaders at Naples in July.
US officials believe Mr Clinton and Mr Hata will discuss some of the issues
in Naples but they doubt substantive negotiations will be possible until
after the summit.
Mr Kantor emphasised that the US was being 'sensitive and careful' in its
dealings with Japan and had already succeeded in opening Japanese markets to
a variety of foreign products.
However, he said, 'we will enforce our trade laws' if no agreement is
reached by September 30, the date by which the US must, under recently
revived Super 301 trade legislation, designate for possible sanctions the
biggest barriers to US exports around the world.
Mr Kantor conceded that, while the US would seek resolution of more disputes
multilaterally after the Uruguay Round trade agreement comes into effect
next year, 'a number' was not covered by the Gatt.
In these areas, the US remained free to apply unilateral trade sanctions.
He cited as an example cases where countries' failure to enforce national
competition laws allowed anti-competitive practices to pose a barrier to
foreign imports.
Senior US officials partly attribute their renewed optimism about an
agreement with Tokyo to Mr Hata's pragmatic attitude and to their belief
that Japan is no longer opposing US demands as a matter of principle.

FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gatt chief warns over China's status with
US

US failure to extend China's preferential trade access to the US market
would complicate negotiations over Beijing's bid to rejoin the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt director
general, said yesterday.
He said that, although the issues of Gatt and Most Favoured Nation trading
status were not 'directly related', the US posture on MFN would be critical
to a successful outcome of the negotiations.
Mr Sutherland, in Beijing for an international business seminar, told
reporters: 'The US attitude is of central importance and that attitude will
be signalled in one way or the other by events on the MFN issue.'
Since his arrival in Beijing on Tuesday, the Gatt chief has urged a speedy
conclusion of China's negotiations to resume Gatt status and prepare itself
to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation when that is formed
next year.
But the director general also made clear that contracting parties to the WTO
would insist that China continue to pursue trade liberalisation and other
steps required to facilitate access to its huge domestic market.
He said that among particular concerns were the lack of transparency in
China's trade rules, haphazard application of the trade regime, an absence
of certainty in the treatment of imports (including the imposition of hidden
quotas), and the anti-competitive activities of the Chinese monopolistic
state trading corporations.
'I believe that China would be well advised to take these concerns
seriously,' he said.
US President Bill Clinton is due, by early next month, to rule on whether to
extend MFN to China for another year. He has indicated in the past week that
he favours an extension.
US and European negotiators are preparing for bilateral discussions with the
Chinese on Gatt issues, in preparation for a meeting of the China 'working
party' on Gatt, due for in Geneva late next month.
Gatt negotiations can be expected to accelerate after MFN renewal.
Mr Sutherland has indicated that he hopes China may be in a position to sign
a draft protocol within the next few months.

<TEXT>
Ten consortia of contractors made up of local and foreign groups have been
shortlisted to carry out work on a new international airport outside Kuala
Lumpur.
The consortia include groups from France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and
the US, but none from Britain.
In late February the Malaysian government imposed a ban on giving government
contracts to British groups after reports critical of the Malaysian
leadership appeared in the British press.
Kuala Lumpur's new airport, which is priced at between MDollars 9bn and
MDollars 12bn (Pounds 2.35bn - Pounds 3.1bn) is one of southeast Asia's
biggest infrastructure projects.
The 10 consortia are competing for a MDollars 3bn contract for work on the
airport's main terminal building.
The airport is due to be open by the end of 1997 but there are doubts it can
be completed by then.

Japan has given approval to US apple farmers' pest control measures which
had for long prevented US apple exports, the centre of a long trade dispute
between the two countries, reports Emiko Terazono from Tokyo.
Japanese agricultural officials said they hoped an agreement on procedural
matters with the US would be reached by the end of this month and the first
US apple imports would start in September.
The decision follows recent criticism from the US government over Japan's
unfair trade practices.
Japan officially liberalised its apple market in 1971, but kept foreign
apples out through strict quarantine rules about pests and diseases.

The White House yesterday condemned the installation of a new president in
Haiti but denied reports that it had already decided to remove the Caribbean
republic's military junta by force, if tougher sanctions agreed last week by
the United Nations do not work.
US officials said, however, that some kind of UN security force, including a
significant US component, would be needed, even if the sanctions do force
out General Raoul Cedras and his colleagues.
Haitian legislators had named Supreme Court Justice Emile Jonassaint as
interim president. This is seen as further defiance by the military regime
and its associates of UN efforts to restore the exiled President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
'We expect him to return (to Haiti) at some point,' said a White House
official, calling the legislators' move 'cynical, unconstitutional and
illegal.'
The Haitian embassy in Washington said the installation of Justice
Jonassaint was 'designed to protect (the junta's) personal interests,
further increase the suffering of the Haitian people, and plunge the country
deeper into chaos.'
President Bill Clinton has been careful in recent statements not to rule out
the use of US military force to remove the junta that ousted Father Aristide
in 1991. However, US officials are anxious to give sanctions some time to
work.
'There has been no decision to send in a small force to purge the military,'
said Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN.
The sanctions are to go into effect if Gen Cedras and his colleagues have
not left Haiti by May 21. US officials declined to say how long they planned
to wait to see whether the sanctions work.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Dominican president faces close contest
</HEADLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Joaqun Balaguer of the Dominican Republic is facing a surprisingly
stiff challenge in his attempt to win election on Monday to a seventh term
at the head of the Caribbean nation.
The latest opinion polls show the president, who leads the conservative
Reformist Social Christian party, second to Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of
the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary party.
The polls put Mr Pena Gomez at 37 per cent of the vote, Mr Balaguer at 34
per cent and Mr Juan Bosch, the president's usual main political rival, at
14 per cent. Other support is split among smaller parties.
Mr Balaguer's supporters, however, argue that the polls do not indicate the
likely outcome on Monday. They say the president has always benefited by
late surges in support and that undecided voters - the polls say about 9 per
cent - will back the incumbent.
A win for Mr Pena Gomez, 57, would be a departure in Dominican politics.
The many battles between Mr Balaguer and Mr Bosch, have dominated the
political scene for decades, but they are now aged 87 and 84 respectively
and this is expected to be the last election for both.
Mr Pena Gomez has been helped by having as running-mate Mr Fernando Alvarez
Bogaert, once a senior functionary in Mr Balaguer's party.
The social democratic party's officials say that they have their doubts
about the lead shown by the polls - earlier soundings had given Mr Pena
Gomez an even wider margin.
In previous elections, Mr Balaguer has always managed 'to come from behind
at the last moment, helped by fickle voters and the vagaries of the
Dominican election machinery,' said one official.
Losing candidates in the Dominican Republic have frequently contested the
integrity of the electoral system. After the last election, Mr Bosch, who
lost by a few thousand votes, claimed that the presidency had been stolen
away.
These concerns, and the deaths of more than 30 people in campaign incidents,
have created a tense atmosphere.
In an effort to ease this, church leaders brought the presidential
candidates together on Tuesday night to sign a compact committing them to a
peaceful election and to respect for the results. These are expected for the
end of next week.
The social democratic party has also complained that its opponents have
introduced 'verbal racism' into the campaign. Questions about the competence
in the presidency of Mr Pena Gomez, whose only public office has been the
mayoralty of the capital Santo Domingo, have frequently been accompanied by
reference to the fact that he is black, party officials said.
Dominicans remain concerned that a close victory by any candidate could lead
to disputes and to political violence. They have been stocking up with food,
fuel and other essentials.
The winner, who is to be inaugurated in August, will face an immediate and
difficult task in righting an economy which has gone off course. Mr Pena
Gomez is offering no dramatic changes for the economy based on tourism,
agriculture, and gold and nickel mining.

Under the Governor's Island agreement reached in New York last year, the US,
with other countries, was to provide military trainers and civil engineers
to help a return to civilian rule in Haiti. The ship carrying those trainers
turned away when a small mob organised by the military prevented it from
docking.
Officials insist a new force would have a similar role to that envisaged in
the accord but the trainers are likely to be more heavily armed.
Haitian legislators have named Supreme Court Justice Emile Joanaissaint as
interim president. This is likely to be seen as further defiance of UN
efforts to restore Father Aristide to power.

President Bill Clinton's search for a new Supreme Court justice to succeed
the retiring Harry Blackmun, on which an announcement is imminent, appears
to have narrowed to a shortlist of three.
All white male law graduates of Harvard University, they comprise, in
uncertain order of preference, Mr Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the
interior, and two sitting federal judges, Richard Arnold from Arkansas and
Stephen Breyer from Massachusetts. Also said to be not out of the final
running are Judges Jose Cabranes from Connecticut and Amalya Kearse from New
York.
The late entrant into the short list is Judge Breyer, 55, the federal
appeals court judge based in Boston, who got as far as an interview with the
president last summer before he settled on Mrs Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the
Court. His re-emergence as a candidate reflects both his high reputation as
a consensus-building jurist and some problems with picking either Judge
Arnold or Mr Babbitt.
Mr Arnold, 58 and chief judge on the federal appeals court based in Little
Rock, is known for the distinguished quality of his written legal opinions,
which have generally remained sufficiently in the broad mainstrean to have
impressed Democrats and Republicans alike. He is a former law clerk to
retired Justice William Brennan, the liberal jurist still influential behind
the scenes of the Court, and an old acquaintance of Mr Clinton.
But doubts have been raised about his health (he suffers from lymphoma and
takes periodic radiation treatment) and his state of origin. Mr Clinton
could be accused of cronyism for choosing him and may be reluctant to
subject Arkansas, already under the Whitewater miscroscope, to further
minute examination. Some women's groups have questioned his commitment to
preserving the right to abortion.
Mr Babbitt, 55 and a former governor of Arizona, is the sort of 'real world
politician' Mr Clinton has often said he would like to see on the Court,
much in the manner of the late chief justice Earl Warren, who served from
1953-69. Mr Babbitt, like Judge Breyer, was considered last year and had
appeared to take his name out of consideration when Justice Blackmun
retired.
But it is his politics which have attracted opposition, noteably from
Senator Orrin Hatch from Utah, ranking Republican on the judiciary
committee. He charged Mr Babbitt would be liable to influence by the 'far
left' and predicted Western senators, long unhappy with his environmental
policies at the interior department, would oppose him. But two of these,
Democrats Harry Reid from Nevada and Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado,
promised to back Mr Babbitt.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Venezuela gets a dual forex market
</HEADLINE>

   CARACAS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A dual market in foreign exchange has emerged in Venezuela for the first
time in five years following new rules introduced this month that have
rationed central bank sales of dollars.
The gap between the value of the bolivar on Venezuela's official market,
where the central bank sells dollars to banks and exchange houses and that
on the parallel foreign exchange markets has widened to 15 per cent over the
last week.
This widening spread is worrying the government. Mr Julio Sosa, minister of
finance, said the government was 'concerned' over the exchange differential
and the central bank should 'take some type of action.' When he made his
remarks on Tuesday banks were selling dollars obtained from the central bank
auction at 131.5 bolivars, while rates on the still legal parallel market
ranged to 148 bolivars or more.
On May 4, the central bank replaced open sales of dollars under a crawling
peg-type system, in effect since 1989, with daily auctions, which have met
only part of Venezuela's dollar demand. A parallel market in dollar trading
developed almost immediately, especially for corporate buyers.

Christie's offered the finest group of Impressionist and modern paintings
seen on the market for four years at its New York auction room on Tuesday
evening, but the results were disappointing. Only half the 76 lots found
buyers.
The auction totalled Dollars 50.7m with the best prices paid for a group of
seven paintings acquired over 30 years ago by a European collector and fresh
on the market. They were expected to make Dollars 15m between them and
actually sold for Dollars 17.87m.
A rare Fauve landscape of 1906 by Maurice de Vlaminck was the star lot: it
sold for Dollars 6.8m, double its estimate, while Picasso's Cubist 1913
masterpiece 'Violon, bouteille et verre' was at the top of its estimate at
Dollars 6.27m.
In contrast paintings from the collection of the retailing magnate Mr
Meshulam Riklis, whose McCrory Corporation has filed for bankruptcy law
protection, found few bidders, apart from one lot, an imaginative 1932
Picasso portrait of his young mistress Marie-Therese Walter which sold for
Dollars 4.6m.
Mr Michael Findlay, Christie's specialist in the field, was at a loss to
explain the poor result. 'Interest suddenly ebbed on Monday afternoon,' he
said.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Dove who shook Rabin's machine: Julian Ozanne profiles the
man who caused a political earthquake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
His enemies dubbed him a traitor and political opportunist. His friends said
he was the brilliant rising star of the Labour party, but yesterday all
Israelis agreed Mr Haim Ramon was now the man to watch.
The sweeping victory of the 44-year-old lawyer in nationwide elections to
lead the Histadrut, the country's trade union federation and Labour party
powerbase, is viewed in Israel as a political earthquake.
For the first time in 73 years, Histadrut control has been wrested from
Labour. Mr Ramon, standing on a hastily put-together independent list, has
defeated the well-oiled political machine of the Labour party and humiliated
the old-guard leadership.
By so doing, he has catapulted a younger generation eager for reform into
the political limelight.
Born in a working-class neighbourhood in Jaffa, he has also emerged as
heir-apparent to Mr Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister. 'A sweeping victory of
the new Israeli generation,' an editorial in yesterday's Yediot Ahronot
said. 'The vote was a protest against conservatism. The change now has to be
deep, a revolution in the Histadrut and in the foundations of the whole
Israeli political structure.'
Mr Ramon immediately promised to introduce the health bill he tried to push
through when Labour's health minister, aimed at breaking
the link between compulsory Histadrut membership and the health service. He
also promised to slash Histadrut's bureaucracy, sell off many assets and
companies and introduce a new pension scheme.
'People will rise free all around the country, free of the apparatus of
fear, free of political terrorism,' he said.
Since entering politics 20 years ago, Mr Ramon has shaped himself as a dove
on the peace issue and a reformer in social matters. He favours reforming
the Labour movement. One of his targets has been the dominant power of
organised labour. He advocates a social market philosophy.
The affable Mr Ramon was elected to the Knesset (parliament) in 1983.
Between 1988-1992 he was chairman of the Labour parliamentary faction,
before Mr Rabin chose him as health minister. Mr Ramon has always been in
the peace camp. He claims to have been the first, in 1987, to propose an
Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. As a member of the cabinet, he
pressed Mr Rabin to open a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, then still a taboo in Israeli politics.
Mr Ramon emerged as the charismatic leader of the 'Group of Eight', young
left-wing Labour politicians including Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign
minister, who met as a virtual shadow cabinet to discuss how to change the
party. But until February Mr Ramon was determined to fight from within. When
the cabinet refused to back his health bill, he quit.
'He could have ended up in the political wilderness,' says a friend. 'But he
had a brilliant sense for what ordinary people want; he grasped their desire
for change.' Now, Mr Ramon can call the shots.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Banda may still outwit a united opposition: Malawi's
Congress party could extend its 30-year rule in elections on Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent electoral pact has consolidated the United Democratic Front's
position as opposition front-runner in Malawi's elections next Tuesday in a
campaign dominated by personalities rather than issues.
Although it is not the analysts' favourite, President Hastings Banda's
Malawi Congress party may yet extend its 30-year rule into the new,
democratic era by exploiting remaining opposition divisions.
Small parties, none of which has a distinctive political identity, have
withdrawn their presidential candidates in favour of the UDF's Mr Bakili
Muluzi.
Withdrawals have also been agreed in most constituencies where the small
parties were fielding candidates for the 177-seat parliament.
The UDF is expected to win most of the 76 seats in the populous southern
region. The central region, traditional heartland of the MCP, has 68 seats.
In the north, there are only 33 seats, and these are likely to be swept up
by the Alliance for Democracy (Aford), led by trade unionist Chakufwa
Chihana.
Campaigning has come up with little to persuade people to vote on other than
regional or ethnic lines. Mr Muluzi accepts that the three contenders are
'very close' on social and economic policy. He emphasises 'managed'
liberalisation, with some protection for national industries; whereas Mr
Chihana emphasises 'cushioning the impact on the poor' of structural
adjustment.
But both men favour export-led growth within a liberalised economy, which is
precisely the policy direction the MCP is already following, under pressure
from foreign donors.
Debate has therefore centred on qualifications for government. Mr Chihana,
who was thrice imprisoned by Dr Banda's government and who is closely
identified with the early campaign for democracy, describes the election as
'a contest between morality and the forces of darkness'.
His close aide and author of the Aford manifesto, Mr Mapopa Chipeta,
reflects that 'Banda used to boast at rallies that he had killed his
opponents. And people cheered, they thought it was normal. They laughed at
us when we said you can't do that. But now Malawi has changed.'
Pinning its hopes on a moral crusade, Aford has launched a vitriolic attack
on the character of Mr Muluzi. As an MCP government minister and secretary
general of the party in the 1970s, he is easy to denounce as a 'recycled'
politician, although he responds that he tried to work for change within the
system, enduring considerable personal risk as a result.
More damagingly, Aford has claimed that Mr Muluzi was convicted of petty
theft in 1968, and subsequently embezzled money from the MCP while in their
employ. Mr Muluzi has not denied the allegations, made in an Aford newspaper
which quoted court records and MCP memorandums. Although campaigning
vigorously on the hustings, he has become shy of the local press and
declined challenges to radio debates with other candidates. There have also
been ill-concealed attempts by other members of the UDF executive to unseat
him.
Aford's blow of moral superiority has been considerably undermined by
suggestions that, as a Moslem, Mr Muluzi would 'Islamicise' Malawi. His
status as a strictly secular politician is not in doubt.
Aford strategists believe that the anti-Muluzi campaign may win Mr Chihana
the presidency even if the UDF wins most parliamentary seats. But doubts
about Mr Muluzi are likely to favour the ruling party more than Aford.
Last June's referendum produced a 37 per cent pro-government vote: not
enough to keep the one-party state in place, but a solid support base on
which to build. Some believe that the vote then was influenced by MCP
intimidation, and that support has since crumbled.
Infused with new blood recruited from the opposition, the MCP has been
arguing that those responsible for past abuses have left - mostly to join
the UDF, whose leadership is dominated by MCP 'refugees'.
The argument does not address the popular belief that power has long lain
with the de facto prime minister John Tembo, uncle of President Banda's
consort 'Mama' Cecilia Kadzamira. Nor are the party's prospects improved by
the fact that Dr Banda is too elderly and frail to make more than rare and
brief public appearances.
But he has appeared often enough to endorse his running mate, Gwanda
Chakuamba, who served 13 years in jail for sedition, as apparent successor.
Dr Banda is not hated in Malawi. Most people blame his abuses on 'bad
advice'.

FT  12 MAY 94 / North Yemen hints at mediation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Yemen's northern leadership would consider mediation in an effort to end the
country's civil war, now in its second week, the newly-installed prime
minister, Mr Mohammad Said Attar, said yesterday. But any mediation must
take place within the framework of a unified and democratic Yemen, he
insisted.
Mr Attar's comments followed reports of an apparent halt in the advance of
northern military units towards Aden and in other parts of the former South
Yemen.
Observers in Sanaa said the halt may reflect a slightly more conciliatory
attitude among the northern leaders, although General Ali Abdullah Salheh,
the northern leader, last night vowed to avenge the 'cowardly, treacherous'
Scud missile attack on Sanaa which yesterday killed 23 people and injured
30.
The presumed target of the attack was a nearby palace belonging to Gen
Saleh. Northern officials claim that the south has now launched some 20 Scud
missiles against targets in the north.
Arab League officials were due to arrive in Sanaa last night in an attempt
to broker a ceasefire. The small delegation, led by Mr Mohammed Said
al-Bereqdar, the league's assistant secretary-general for military affairs,
left southern Saudi Arabia by road yesterday. League officials said the
delegation would also attempt to contact leaders in the south.
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Oman have each in the past few days appealed to
leaders in north and south Yemen to resume dialogue. However, in Aden
yesterday Vice-President Ali Salem Al-Baidh, Gen Saleh's rival, said he did
not expect the war to end soon and said northern forces should retreat to
their positions before the start of the war.
Military observers in Sanaa confirmed yesterday that northern forces had
been beaten back as they tried to enter Aden from the east. One observer
said the northern Amaaliga Brigade had come under heavy attack from a
combination of southern air, sea, and ground forces. The northern brigades
had also been halted about 30 miles north of Aden.
In Sanaa, despite the new attacks, life is returning to normal. Electrical
supplies have been restored, but the authorities have yet to resume direct
telecommunications links in an effort to control sensitive military
information. Links between Aden and the outside world appear to be fully
restored, with reports indicating the mood remains calm.
Mr Attar claimed yesterday that northern forces had so far shown
considerable restraint towards the south, particularly Aden. He said the
northern leadership had no animosity towards the southern people, or the
southern-based Yemen Socialist party. He insisted the northern government
was opposed only to certain elements within the YSP.
But Mr Attar also referred to the southern opposition as rebels and
secessionists. The northern leadership, he said, was the party of
constitutional legitimacy. Gen Saleh last week insisted that the conflict
was an internal affair and he warned against any outside intervention.

pervert the course of justice, Nikki Tait reports from Sydney.
On Monday, a jury acquitted the businessman of conspiring to fix the 1983

paying Mr Danny Hobby, a former jockey, around ADollars 500,000 (Pounds

The United Nations nuclear watchdog agency will visit communist North Korea
in the next few days to resume monitoring its secretive nuclear facilities,
South Korea's foreign ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Seoul.
A ministry spokesman said Mr Hans Blix, director general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), had announced the inspection trip
in a letter to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, a copy of which
was sent to Seoul.
He said the IAEA had also invited North Korea to send a delegation to its
Vienna headquarters to discuss a timetable for inspections.
The announcement raises hopes that the stalinist North may be willing to
compromise on its earlier refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to sample spent
fuel rods. These will shortly be removed from a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon
north of Pyongyang.
The IAEA said last week it would not send an inspection team to North Korea
until Pyongyang allowed experts to carry out full tests on the spent nuclear
fuel, to see if any has been diverted for a covert nuclear weapons
programme.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Socialists urge Japanese poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's opposition Social Democratic party yesterday called for an early
general election, as the only way to achieve a stable government.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, party chairman, suggested the minority five-party
coalition and opposition parties should agree to an early poll under the
current multi-seat constituency electoral system.
This is the clearest sign yet the socialists want to bring down the
government before the establishment, possibly by late autumn, of the new
electoral system, a mixture of single-seat districts and proportional
representation.
The SDP's move came as the Bank of Japan also called for the new government
to show leadership, a reflection of anxiety that political turmoil of the
past few months might spill into the economy. 'We want the government to
show leadership in tackling domestic and international economic issues
confronting the Japanese economy, such as deregulation and market-opening
measures,' Mr Yasushi Mieno, central bank governor, said.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new prime minister, rebuffed the demands: 'There are
undoubtedly people who don't really want to see political reform. The
coalition government is still in place and it's not the time to dissolve the
house.'
However, the Liberal Democratic party, the largest opposition group,
yesterday showed it was also preparing for an early poll by opening a
campaign headquarters.
Demand for credit continues to weaken, according to the Federation of
Bankers' Associations of Japan. It reported yesterday that outstanding loans
by the the 11 top commercial banks fell 0.4 per cent in the year to April,
the fourth month of decline.

FT  12 MAY 94 / CFA adjusts to devaluation: Ivory Coast imposes commodity
export tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr N'Goran Niamien, Ivory Coast's new finance minister, is putting a brave
face on the devaluation which halved the value of his currency, the West
African CFA franc, last January.
'It was not an easy measure to take, but it has pulled our economy out of a
recession,' he said yesterday, during the annual general meeting of the
African Development Bank in Nairobi. 'Our economy should grow by 2 per cent
this year, and by 5 per cent in 1995.'
A new export tax on cocoa and coffee, Ivory Coast's biggest foreign exchange
earners, will replenish the treasury's empty coffers with 190bn CFA francs
(Pounds 223m) this year, according to Mr Niamien. This will let the
government repay its debts to private sector contractors, freeing resources
for private investment.
Last January, 13 central and west African states devalued their CFA franc,
which had been fixed at 50 to the French franc since 1948. The new parity
was fixed at 100 CFA to the french franc. The devaluation was virtually
imposed by western donors concerned at the loss of competitiveness of the
CFA trading bloc. The CFA franc continues to be freely convertible and
backed by the French treasury.
The international community has stepped in to soften the blow. For Ivory
Coast, whose Dollars 20bn external debt makes it the world's most indebted
nation in per capita terms, donors have put together a financial assistance
package worth 650bn CFA francs. The Paris Club of creditor nations have also
rescheduled Ivory Coast's obligations and written off part of its debt.
For the remaining CFA countries, help is at hand. France has promised to
write off more than one-quarter of the FFr80bn (Pounds 9.4bn) owed by its
former colonies. The IMF pledged up to FFr10bn to mitigate the impact of
devaluation.
The IMF is also rushing through soft-loan agreements - Senegal, Niger and
Ivory Coast have already benefited - which can pave the way for debt relief
at the Paris Club.
The World Bank says it is fully committed to co-finance economic growth in
the CFA zone now that devaluation has made genuine structural adjustment
possible.
Mr Mamadou Diallo, director of debt at the Senegalese Treasury, also sees
some encouraging responses to the devaluation. 'The tourism sector has
rebounded with considerable strength,' he said yesterday in Nairobi. But
unlike Ivory Coast, Senegal has resisted slapping taxes on exports. 'We want
our exports to become more competitive,' he says, 'a tax would defeat the
logic of the devaluation.'
Like many finance officials in the CFA zone, Mr Diallo does not see the
devaluation as a panacea for their countries' ills: 'We need new investment
to make our industries more competitive; but where will this money come
from?'
Perhaps the worst impact of the devaluation, however, is the emergence of
inflation in countries which had never felt its destabilising effect because
of the stability and convertibility of their currency.
In Cameroon, where civil servants are already reeling from a 50 per cent pay
cut, the government has increased prices for basic foods and drugs by up to
75 per cent. In Senegal police have been ordered to control hoarding by
traders. They closed some shops in Dakar and seized stocks. Mr Diallo
estimates inflation will rise to 40 per cent by the end of 1994. Ivory Coast
has telephone hotlines to report unjustified price increases. But it too is
struggling with inflation now running at an annualised rate of 30 per cent.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Buthelezi gets home affairs portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN and GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, South Africa's new president, yesterday named Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, his main black political rival, to an influential post
in his government of national unity. The move lends substance to the call
for political reconciliation he made at his inauguration on Tuesday.
Chief Buthelezi accepted the post of home affairs minister, a portfolio
which is likely to give him authority over a large part of the civil
service. However, control over the country's police force and other security
services has been retained by Mr Mandela's African National Congress, which
would also be expected to monitor closely the chief's ministerial decision -
making.
The appointment of Chief Buthelezi is one of three full ministerial
positions allocated to his Inkatha Freedom party, which decided to
participate in South Africa's first all-race elections only 10 days before
polling started last month. The other two Inaktha portfolios will be arts
and sciences, and correctional services.
Under the country's interim constitution agreed after multi-party talks last
year in which Chief Buthelezi did not participate, all parties which won
more than 5 per cent of the vote were entitled to cabinet representation.
Cabinet posts yesterday also went to six members of the new parliament from
the National party of Mr F W de Klerk, who will serve as second
vice-president.
As expected, the respected Mr Derek Keys retains the finance ministry, a
decision on which local equity and currency markets had been counting. His
deputy will be Mr Alec Erwin, an influential white economist in the ANC who
has been closely associated with the party's planned reconstruction and
development programme.
Mr Pik Botha, the veteran foreign minister, moves to mineral and energy
affairs following the appointment last Friday of Mr Alfred Nzo to his former
post.
Mr Roelf Meyer, the National party's chief negotiator in the tortuous
constitutional talks, becomes minister for provincial affairs and
constitutional development.
One surprise appointment was that of Mrs Winnie Mandela, President Mandela's
estranged wife who is head of the ANC's Women's League and has a strong
following among radical ANC youth.
Mrs Mandela becomes deputy minister for the arts and sciences. Another was
the choice as deputy environment minister of General Bantu Holomisa,
military ruler of the disbanded Transkei 'homeland' where he retains a power
base among the rural poor.
Although neither portfolio in itself carries much power, the appointments
are seen as an attempt to prevent the two from becoming destabilising forces
within the party.
However, one of Mrs Mandela's allies, Mr Peter Mokaba, former leader of the
ANC youth league who had been widely tipped to be given the tourism
portfolio, was left out of the cabinet. Instead that job will go to Mr
Trevor Manuel in addition to his previously announced responsibilities as
trade and industry minister.

The British intelligence service has bugged Iran's embassy in London,
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Nicosia.
Mr Rafsanjani, quoted by Iran's official news agency IRNA, said Iranian
embassy staff had discovered 'the hidden microphones installed by the
British MI6'.
The agency said in a brief report that Mr Rafsanjani made the charge in a
speech in Tehran. 'The British government has launched propaganda moves in
order to overshadow the issues,' it quoted him as saying.
Last month Britain accused Iran of holding secret contacts with the Irish
Republican Army, fighting to oust Britain from northern Ireland. Tehran
denied the charge.
Ties between the two countries are also strained by Iran's call for the
death of British novelist Salman Rushdie whose book The Satanic Verses is
condemned as blasphemous by many Moslems.

FT  12 MAY 94 / China steps up reform of state sector
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China plans to earmark some 10,000 state-owned enterprises for an appraisal
of their stocks and assets, including real estate, as part of a new drive to
reform the ailing state sector.
Mr Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and Reform Commission,
speaking at an international business seminar in Beijing yesterday, unveiled
proposals to speed a process of corporatisation, a Chinese half-way house
between rigid state control and privatisation.
Mr Wang's remarks were the most detailed exposition of China's plans to
rationalise its debt-burdened state sector, and indicate that the
authorities may have advanced further than expected with their plans for
enterprise reform.
The Chinese official also disclosed that 'watchdog' supervisory boards will
be imposed on some 1,000 state enterprises as part of attempts to improve
their economic performance.
Some 100 state-owned enterprises would become shareholding companies under a
pilot programme to facilitate their removal from stifling state management
control. The states' share in these enterprises would be assessed according
to a valuation of their assets.
Mr Wang identified difficulties in establishing the value of assets and a
redefinition of the relationship between the state as a substantial
shareholder and the managers of enterprises as one of the largest challenges
to far-reaching reforms of the state sector.
He discounted the possibility of any rush to privatisation, saying the
'state economy could not be replaced by other sectors of the economy'
without undermining the system.
'Our enterprise reform will, on the premise of adhering to public ownership,
explore the approach of accelerating the development of enterprises and
effectively realise the form of public ownership,' he said.
Mr Wang noted that China's 11,000 large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises accounted for 0.16 per cent of total industrial enterprises in
the country, yet their output value and tax were respectively 36.67 per cent
and 51.6 per cent of the total.
He did not provide details of the 10,000 state enterprises chosen for an
appraisal of their assets. Estimates of numbers of large, medium-size and
smaller enterprises range between 150,000 and 200,000.
China's State Statistical Bureau reported that at the end of March nearly 50
per cent of China's state enterprises were in the red, compared with 32 per
cent a year earlier. Losses to March amounted to Yuan15.6bn (Pounds 1.2bn),
up 80 per cent on the same period last year.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Berlusconi approves Fininvest watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister, yesterday approved
measures at his first cabinet meeting to establish a three-man watchdog
committee to monitor the conflict of interest between his Fininvest media
empire and his role as head of government.
Twelve days ago, on being asked to form a government, he announced the
committee and named its three components. His move yesterday, immediately
after his 25-person cabinet was sworn in, underlined his concern to allay
fears over the potential conflict of interest between Fininvest, Italy's
second largest private group, and his position as prime minister.
The men chosen have been criticised by the opposition for being too close to
Mr Berlusconi and Fininvest's interests. Mr Agostino Gambino, a commercial
law professor, has worked for Fininvest on several cases including the
battle for publishers Mondadori. A second member, Mr Antonio La Pergola, a
former head of the constitutional court, has lobbied in Brussels on behalf
of commercial television in matters of advertising slots. The committee has
been given until the end of September to draw up recommendations on changing
existing anti-trust laws. They could also look further into the idea of
creating a blind trust for Mr Berlusconi's proprietary interests. So far Mr
Berlusconi has only resigned from Fininvest.
The conflict of interest issue was also brought up on several occasions by
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro during Mr Berlusconi's tortuous efforts to
form a government. This led to a block on Mr Cesare Previti, Mr Berlusconi's
personal and Fininvest lawyer, going to the justice ministry. It was deemed
unacceptable for the justice portfolio to be held by Mr Previti when
magistrates in several Italian cities were investigating the activities of
Fininvest.
This block, coupled with an open warning to Mr Berlusconi on the conduct of
his government, soured yesterday's swearing-in ceremony.
The warning, contained in a letter, said the new government must support
Italy's traditional foreign policy of support for Europe, avoid tampering
with the unity of Italy and preserve social peace. This was seen as an
implicit reminder that members of the new right-wing government are
Euro-sceptics and favour federalism and economic deregulation that could
lead to social strife.
Most press comments yesterday said Mr Berlusconi had been obliged to make
big concessions to his allies, the populist Northern League and the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. The League forced him to concede the
interior ministry and five other portfolios.
Mr Lamberto Dini, the new treasury minister and number two at the Bank of
Italy, indicated he would resign shortly from his position at the central
bank. Yesterday's half percentage point cut to 7 per cent in the discount
rate was welcome news for him and could even remove the need for a
mini-budget before the summer.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Interest rates cut as French sense recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Bank of France yesterday took a further step in easing monetary
conditions, trimming its key short-term interest rate, amid signs that
economic recovery is gaining momentum and that inflationary pressures remain
weak.
The decision to lower the intervention rate, the floor for money market
rates, from 5.6 per cent to 5.5 per cent, is the third small cut in three
weeks and reflects the central bank's strategy of easing borrowing costs in
line with the reduction in Germany's repo rate.
The move coincided with the release of encouraging industrial production
data. According to Insee, the national statistics office, industrial
production rose by 0.6 per cent in February, compared with January. The
increase in industrial production was supported by strong manufacturing
output, which has risen in each of the past four months, partly reflecting
the impact of a sharp increase in car sales.
Economists said they saw little evidence that reviving economic activity was
re-kindling inflation, although data released yesterday showed a slight rise
in annualised inflation in April to 1.7 per cent. 'Inflation is very low,
and I think it will remain at about the 1.5 per cent level for this year,'
said one economist at a French merchant bank.
The trends will be welcomed by the prime minister, Mr Eduard Balladur, whose
decline in opinion polls has begun to reverse in the past few weeks.
Officials at the economy ministry said that the statistics confirmed their
predictions of progressive recovery this year after the 1 per cent
contraction of gross domestic product in 1993. 'We are seeing a gradual, but
steady improvement,' said one official, who said that the government's
forecast of 1.4 per cent GDP growth this year was likely to be surpassed.
France's improved economic recovery has, however, made little impact on
unemployment, which currently stands at 12.2 per cent of the workforce. A
spokesman for the economy ministry said that the unemployment statistics of
the past few months had shown a stabilisation in the jobless rate. But he
added that a further increase was possible during the summer as school
leavers arrive on the labour market.
Private sector economists in Paris endorsed this view, stressing the gradual
nature of France's economic recovery and the caution expressed by industry.
Companies such as Rhone Poulenc, the pharmaceuticals and chemicals group,
say they see signs of recovery but that a strong improvement in demand is
not expected until the end of this year.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Man with a finger on Italy's pulse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As deputy prime minister and interior minister, Mr Roberto Maroni is the
linchpin of the Northern League's presence in the new government. His
working relationship with prime minister Silvio Berlusconi will also be
central to the smooth functioning of the cabinet.
The 39-year-old lawyer from Varese, with a permanent cheeky grin and a
grubby beard, has emerged over the past two years as one of the most
formidable political talents in the country. He has demonstrated an unusual
flare for second-guessing his garrulous and unpredictable leader, Mr Umberto
Bossi.
His smooth tongue has constantly been needed either to take the sting from
Mr Bossi's comments or give them a diplomatic spin.
He is genuinely loyal to Mr Bossi with whom he has shared more than a decade
in the political wilderness, building up a grassroots movement in Lombardy
against all odds, and with virtually no money. He revealed recently that Mr
Berlusconi had tried to persuade him to leave the League and join Forza
Italia; but he insists his loyalties are with the League and the movement's
commitment to write a new federal constitution.
He has certainly played his hand well with Mr Bossi to obtain the interior
ministry. The League set its sights on this portfolio because it controls
the pulse of the nation through the network of prefects and because it
oversees local government. Now he will now have to absorb the innate
tensions between the League and Mr Berlusconi. These will surface after the
European elections since the League risks being submerged by Forza Italia.
As an accomplished jazz saxophonist he may well find himself playing the
blues on several occasions in coming months.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Euro-sceptic who takes Chicago line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike one new minister swapped from eight different portfolios during the
gestation of the new Italian cabinet, Mr Antonio Martino was always
favourite for just one job - the one he got, foreign minister.
The 51-year-old Mr Martino is a 'Euro-sceptic' and instrumental in bringing
the ideas of the Thatcher-inspired Bruges group to Italy. However, it would
be wrong to see Mr Martino as anti-European. Rather he is a European who has
imbibed the free market economic teachings of the Chicago School to become
according to one colleague 'more Chicago Boy than the Boys themselves'. He
sees the Maastricht treaty and monetary union as constraints on a genuine
single market.
Unlike Mrs Thatcher, whom he admires, Mr Martino regards himself as an
old-fashioned liberal. Though Forza Italia is the first political party he
has joined, he was to his embarrassment a member of the secret Masonic
lodge, P2( Mr Berlusconi was also a member). He says when he realised the
scope of P2 he immediately renounced membership.
He caught the attention of the prime minister-designate while venting his
forthright opinions on Italy's over-regulated economy in the column's of the
media magnate's daily, Il Giornale. For the past year he has been Mr
Berlusconi's economic adviser and played this role throughout the elections.
One of the mysteries behind the formation of this cabinet is the way once
the elections were over his name did not surface as candidate for one of the
three economic portfolios. Perhaps other members of the economic team were
out of sympathy with Mr Martino's radicalism, or he himself preferred the
challenge of the foreign ministry.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Brussels puts UK behind on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in the UK will lag behind the rate of economic expansion in Germany,
France and Italy by as early as next year as higher taxes take their toll on
British consumers, the European Commission said yesterday.
In its latest assessment of economic prospects for the 12 member states of
the European Union, the Commission said it was confident recessionary forces
were dissipating and that the projected recovery would be 'widespread'. The
Union's GDP is now expected to expand by 1.6 per cent this year and 2.5 per
cent in 1995.
But for the UK, where consumer spending has been the motor behind the
recovery, last month's tax increases are expected to slow the rate of
overall growth from 2.5 per cent this year to 2.3 per cent in the next by
hitting the pace of consumer spending. The forecasts are not significantly
out of line with the UK Treasury's own projections but have been downgraded
from the previous set of commission figures. In spite of the rosier outlook
for growth, Mr Henning Christophersen, vice-president of the Commission,
warned that the recovery would have little impact on Europe's grim
unemployment figures. This year nine, and next year six, of the member
countries will experience increases in unemployment.
'In 1995 France and Italy could join Denmark, Ireland and the UK in
registering a moderate decline in unemployment,' said the commission.
Inflation is likely to ease further over the next two years dropping to an
overall 3.3 per cent this year and 3.9 per cent in 1995. Mr Chistophersen
said that a 'broad majority' of member countries was expected to respect the
inflation criterion contained in the Maastricht treaty next year. Greece,
Spain and Portugal were the exceptions. Falling real labour unit costs,
institutional changes in wage setting procedures and steps to establish the
independence of central banks were all helping to shore-up the favourable
outlook for inflation.

The International Monetary Fund yesterday approved a 19-month loan agreement
for Romania worth Dollars 700m (Pounds 479.4m), its first new loan to the
country in nearly two years. Under the deal, Romania has agreed to bring
annual inflation down to two digits by the end of the year from the present
265 per cent, to speed up privatisation and restructuring of the state
sector, which still accounts for more than 90 per cent of industry, and to
maintain internal convertibility of the leu, the national currency. IMF
approval of the loan package, agreed in principle last December, was delayed
due to the government's slowness in drafting new tax laws and its 1994
budget.

The United Nations yesterday appealed for Dollars 532m (Pounds 364.3m) for

ex-Yugoslavia. The UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), on behalf of
11 UN agencies, said the priority was still 'basic survival needs for the

to rehabilitation and reconstruction if political developments allowed. The
UN refugee agency, which is asking for Dollars 236m for the remainder of the
year, is spending humanitarian assistance in former Yugoslavia.

Mr Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in the dispute between Greece and Macedonia,
will make a fresh attempt today to persuade Greece to lift a trade blockade
against the former Yugoslav republic. While there are few signs of a
breakthrough, Mr Vance's revised version of a draft accord, rejected by both
sides last month, avoids the difficult issue of Macedonia's name, while
meeting both Greek and Macedonian conditions for re-starting talks. Mr Vance
will have separate meetings with Mr Christos Zacharakis, secretary general
of the Greek foreign ministry, and Mr Stevo Crvnkovski, Macedonian foreign
minister. The draft provides for Greece to raise its trade embargo.
Macedonia would drop the Vergina star, associated with the ancient
Macedonian dynasty in northern Greece, from its flag, and declare it had no
territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia.

Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday signalled that his
forces might move to widen their land corridor, renewing fears of an
escalation in the fighting around the Serb town of Brcko, north-eastern
Bosnia. The statement followed UN confirmation of a Moslem attack on Brcko
on Tuesday night which killed three people. As the Bosnian Serb assembly met
for the second day in Brcko, Mr Karadzic said: 'The corridor must be
strategically deep enough to defend.' His remarks heightened fear of clashes
because the corridor is 6km wide and not thought of as 'defensible'. He
warned that the 'criminal behaviour of the Moslems and Croats' will make the
'Serbs cede much less land than they hope for'. Last night Bosnian Serbs
accused the Moslems of a new attack on Brcko while two separate artillery
attacks were launched on the Moslem town of Tuzla, killing two people and
wounding five.

Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel company, will not buy eastern
Germany's largest steel mill under the terms of the current contract, the
Treuhand privatisation agency indicated yesterday.
After failing yesterday to broker an agreement between Riva and IG Metall,
the engineering union, the Treuhand, desperate to keep Riva on board, agreed
with the Italian company to start drawing up a completely new contract,
although any successful outcome cannot be guaranteed. In a move which could
now jeopardise the entire future of Ekostahl, Riva wants to buy only the
assets of the company, instead of its original intention to create a joint
stock/share company. The disagreement between Riva and IG Metall had focused
on how the workforce would be reduced by 700 to 2,300 by the end of this
year, what would happen to the small companies which had been hived off from
Ekostahl, but are still dependent on the mill for orders, and the
composition of the supervisory board.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany yesterday pulled back from an immediate ban on British beef imports
but warned that a ban on 'mad cow' beef was now official government policy
and would be enforced if European Union agriculture ministers did not come
up with a solution at their next meeting in late May.
The cabinet has told Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, that he can
impose a four-year ban on all cattle over three years old after final
consultations with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The foreign and agriculture
ministries and the farmers' union have argued that a ban is unenforceable as
British beef can reach Germany via third countries. The ban may also be
illegal under European law, but a health ministry spokesman said the measure
had been approved by the justice ministry and is 'most definitely legal'.
EU agriculture ministers have so far resisted restrictions on the movement
of beef and a Bonn official said he was 'very, very sceptical' that after
five months of 'very intensive' negotiations any additional measures would
be agreed. Mr Seehofer said he had received countless reports that meat
imports from Britain had fallen in recent months, given the media coverage
of the subject. In 1992, the last year for which figures are available,
Germany imported 2,092 tonnes of British beef.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Belgians prepare for 'short and sober' poll: The
Euro-parliament election in Belgium won't take anyone's breath away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On June 9 when Belgians cast their votes in the European elections the
turnout will be high. Very high.
Not because Belgians are fiercely interested in European affairs, nor
particularly because they wish to pass judgment on the domestic government.
The votes will pour in because Belgium is one of only three countries in the
European Union where voting - whatever the election - is compulsory.
So, like the young man lethargically cutting the grass in the capital's
pretty Parc de Bruxelles (who had not even heard of the European elections),
many Belgians will go to the polls simply to avoid paying a fine.
'I won't put anything on my paper,' he says. 'I'll pick it up and put it
straight in the box.'
The general indifference towards next month's elections is partly because
the political parties have yet to launch their campaigns. There are no
political hoardings and scant leafleting. With restrictions on how much the
parties can spend on their campaigns now in place, the hustings are anyway
likely to be 'short, sober and without any fuss', as the Libre Belgique
newspaper put it yesterday.
When the campaigns do begin, the election will be presented as more of a
test for Belgium's political parties in the regions than for the
two-year-old federal coalition government, in spite of opposition parties'
inevitable attempts to dress up the elections as a 'national test'.
The government has crawled back up the polls from a low-point last June when
high unemployment, labour unrest and the European currency crisis sent
support for the fragile coalition down to 18 per cent of the population.
Rumours that Mr Jean Luc Dehaene would succeed Mr Jacques Delors as
president of the European Commission have enhanced the Belgian prime
minister's personal standing.
In Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, the ruling Socialist
party faces its first electoral test since three of its senior politicians
were forced to resign their ministerial posts over alleged involvement in a
shady arms deal with the Italian company Agusta. Support in the region has
drifted down to around 30 per cent with Ecolo, the French-speaking Greens,
expecting to capitalise most on the Socialists' disarray.
In the Dutch-speaking Flanders region, the revamped Flemish Liberal Democrat
party (VLD) is hoping to win more seats than the ruling CVP Christian
Democrats - Mr Dehaene's party - which has been in power in Flanders since
the Second World War.
'These may be European elections, but the national debate is more important
than the European debate,' said Mr Willy De Clercq, a Belgian Euro-MP who
represents the VLD. 'If we do well in these elections, and then repeat the
score in October's local and provincial elections, that will put heavy
pressure on the federal government.'
In Brussels, Belgium's third region, the balance has also been disturbed by
scandals. Here, the PSC, the French-speaking Christian Democrats, has lost
most support as a result, although its descent has not been as sharp as the
PS in Wallonia.
One last source of interest will be the performance of the extreme right -
represented by the Vlaams Blok in Flanders - reminiscent of South Africa's
die-hard racist community - and by the National Front in Brussels and
Wallonia. Although support for the extreme right has dwindled over the past
year, one in 10 say they would support it in Brussels and Flanders, and one
in 20 in Wallonia.

Dutch inflation is continuing to slow. In the year to April, the consumer
price index rose by 2.8 per cent, compared with a 2.9 per cent increase in
March and 3.0 per cent in both January and February, the Central Statistical
Office said. The April rise partly reflected higher telephone charges and
increased government duties on alcohol and petrol. The statistical office
also reported yesterday a rise in Dutch consumer spending to 2.5 per cent in
real terms in the year to March. This compared with a 0.9 per cent rise in
February and a 1.4 per cent decline in January. The sharp increase is partly
because there were five Thursdays in the month compared with four in March
1993. Shops in many Dutch cities stay open late on Thursdays.
March retail sales in Germany rose a seasonally adjusted 1 per cent from
February in both nominal and real terms and rose a real 2 per cent and
nominal 3 per cent year on year, the Federal Statistics Office said.
Sweden's consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent in April from March bringing
the annual inflation rate to 1.8 per cent in April, unchanged from a month
earlier but down from 5.1 per cent in April 1993, the national statistics
agency SCB said.
Austria's merchandise trade deficit widened significantly in March, to
Sch12.3bn, 21 per cent higher than in February and 29 per cent higher than
in March, 1993, the Austrian National Bank reported yesterday.

European parliament elections / EU politicians are preparing to alter
Maastricht terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In Britain, the issue of economic and monetary union (Emu) has lit a fuse
along the European election trail. In the rest of the continent, the subject
is being given a lot less attention. None the less, the question of whether
policies aimed at establishing Emu are consistent with efforts to bring down
unemployment has explosive potential.
Across the continent, the fiercest discussions over whether Emu will take
place by the Maastricht target dates of 1997 or 1999 are taking place in
northern Europe.
Despite Britain's 'opt-out' from participation in a single currency,
'Eurosceptics' in the UK Conservative party this week have focused on the
Emu plan in their calls for a referendum on the shape of Europe.
In Germany and France, left- and right-wing anti-Maastricht parties are
aiming for support on the somewhat contradictory basis that the Emu plan
will undermine both German and French sovereignty.
In France, support for the franc fort policy remains solid among the
political establishment. Yesterday's  1/2 point cut in Bundesbank interest
rates will give the Bank of France more leeway to bring down interest rates
and speed recovery from France's longest period of economic doldrums since
the second world war.
On the other hand, if anti-Emu parties - including dissident conservatives
led by Mr Philippe de Villiers, the right-wing National Assembly deputy -
gain more than 20 per cent of the votes on June 12, that could unsettle
France's pro-Maastricht stance.
By contrast, public debate on Emu in southern countries is far more muted.
In Italy and Spain - traditionally strong supporters of Emu but beset by
domestic political uncertainties - Emu comes well down the list of election
issues.
The new government in Rome headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi appears likely to
take a more nationalistic line in promoting Italian interests in Brussels.
Pushing for the lira's early return into the mainstream of European monetary
integration is not expected to be one of them.
Nevertheless supporters of Emu across the continent have recovered their
poise after setbacks caused by the ERM exit of Britain and Italy in
September 1992 and the emergency widening of fluctuation bands to 15 per
cent last August. By deterring speculators, wider ERM bands have reinforced
currency stability.
Since last summer, ERM central banks have lowered interest rates only
gradually rather than resorting to competitive devaluations.
'The spread (of interest rates) between Belgium, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg, France and Germany is now so small that we are virtually in a
monetary union,' says one central bank governor.
One problem is that the Maastricht treaty limits Emu participation to
currencies which respect 'the normal fluctuation bands for two years.'
However, in coming months European finance ministers are expected to agree a
generous interpretation of this condition. They are likely simply to apply
the test of whether exchange rate movements have been minimal.
The European Commission has set up a study group to prepare the change to
the Ecu as a new European currency. An advisory report is due by the end of
October. Commission officials say they are using Britain's 'exemplary'
decimalisation in 1971 as a model for a single currency.
A large stumbling block is, however, the slow recovery from recession.
Sluggish economic performance and rising government borrowing and debt
levels have seriously impeded EU states' ability to fulfil some of the most
important 'convergence criteria' set down at Maastricht to determine
countries' eligibility to take part in Emu.
The treaty lays down four numerical criteria determining countries' Emu
suitability, concerning inflation rates, budget deficits, interest rates and
debt levels. No EU state last year fulfilled all four criteria, although
four - France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK - satisfied three of them.
For watchers of the Maastricht criteria, Germany is a worry. Germany
satisfied only two of the criteria last year, and German public sector debt
will exceed the target of 60 per cent of GDP in 1995 because of extra debt
stemming from German unification.
Even for some low inflation countries, rigid adherence to the Maastricht
debt targets will be very difficult.
An analysis by Belgium's finance ministry shows Belgium would need a primary
budget surplus (the budgetary balance before interest charges) of 6 per cent
of GDP a year for the next 15 years to reduce public sector debt to 60 per
cent of GDP by 2009.
The Maastricht treaty does allow for a liberal interpretation of whether
member states comply with the criteria. Countries deemed as tackling their
deficits seriously would have a chance of joining Emu if they can prove that
their public finances are moving in the desired direction.
But to supporters of Emu, Belgium remains a natural candidate for a 'hard
core' currency club, despite its high government debt. This point was made
in Paris last month by Mr Alain Lamassoure, the French minister for European
affairs, who said forcefully the convergence criteria had to be
'complemented by political considerations'.
Public statements like this, however, can be counter-productive. In the
light of public worries in Germany about the replacement of the D-Mark by a
European currency, politicians in Germany are allergic to suggestions that
the convergence criteria could be diluted.
In a ruling firmly backed by the Bonn government, the German constitutional
court laid down last October that Emu could go ahead only on the basis of
strict adherence to the criteria. One senior German politician says in
private: 'Anyone who thinks he can circumvent them (the criteria) by
political considerations will have to go before our High Court' - a sign of
the political battles over Emu in store.

FT  12 MAY 94 / EU and Russia close to partnership pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union and Russia are preparing a 'partnership' agreement which
should lead to a common free trade zone towards the end of the century,
European Commission officials said yesterday.
The two controversies which have snagged the negotiations for 18 months,
over Russian uranium exports and Moscow's treatment of European banks
operating in Russia, have been ironed out, and the agreement now awaits
endorsement by European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on
Monday.
'We have a written agreement from the Russians,' said an aide to Sir Leon
Brittan, the trade commissioner who last week arrived at a formula with Mr
Alexander Shokin, Russia's deputy prime minister.
France, the EU's largest producer as well as consumer of enriched uranium
for its nuclear power plants, has been concerned about being undercut by
Russian exports of nuclear fuel. The EU as a whole has insisted that
Russia's December 1993 decree restricting activities of foreign banks went
against the grain and scope of the partnership agreement.
On Monday, EU foreign ministers are expected to agree that a safeguards
regime against sudden influxes of Russian uranium should operate until 1997.
The safeguards would be triggered only after consultations with the Russian
authorities, who have agreed to stabilise export flows.
In the banking sector, the 1993 decree will not apply to the five banks -
ABN Amro, ING, Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale and Dresdner Bank - already
operating in Russia before it came into force, and with small exceptions,
newcomers will get the same treatment as Russian banks. The main
restriction, to be reviewed after five years, will be that EU banks cannot
exceed 12 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Russian banking
system.
The decision on whether conditions are ripe for setting up a full-scale free
trade zone will be taken in 1998, although since February most EU quotas on
Russian imports have already been removed.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Yeltsin seeks improved G7 and Nato deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday called for full participation by Russia in
the international organisations of the west, including an expanded Group of
Seven industrialised nations, and for a special deal to be negotiated with
Nato recognising the size and strength of its armed forces.
In exchange, he promised that he would not approve any increase in military
spending above the level of 1993, and reluctantly accepted that the ceremony
to mark the final departure of Russian troops from Germany would be separate
from the rest of the western allies.
He also specifically endorsed Germany's attempt to become a permanent member
of the UN security council.
Mr Yeltsin, on the first day of a three-day official visit to Germany, won
the backing of Chancellor Helmut Kohl in his call for full membership of a
G8 from next year. Mr Kohl also called for rapid moves to bring Russia into
the Gatt, and the Council of Europe.
However, Mr Kohl stopped short of offering Mr Yeltsin any precise
improvement in the 'partnership for peace' package proposed by the Nato
allies for all central and east European states.
The strains in relations between Russia and Nato were underlined yesterday
when Air Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, the chairman of the alliance's
military committee, abruptly shelved plans to visit Moscow.
While the postponement was officially attributed to 'scheduling problems',
it is understood that the Russian side was reluctant to delegate anyone of
sufficient seniority to organise the air marshal's reception.
This would suggest that even those Russian defence officials who feel
relatively sympathetic to Nato are reluctant, in the new nationalist
climate, to be seen holding high-profile meetings with western officials.
The two leaders were at great pains to stress their excellent personal
relations, in spite of the host of sensitive issues between them.
The Russian president admitted that the question of the departure ceremony
for Russian troops from Germany, scheduled for August 31, was one which
could 'destabilise the political situation in Russia'.
In the event, the two agreed to abandon an initial ceremony in the historic
town of Weimar - close to the site of the Buchenwald concentration camp -
and focus everything on a 'dignified ceremony' to be held in Berlin. Final
details have yet to be hammered out, but it will obviously stop far short of
the joint military ceremony with the other western allies sought by the
Russian commanders.
In return, Mr Kohl gave his endorsement to the Russian bid for full
membership of an expanded G7, instead of the current arrangement which gives
Russia involvement only in 'political' questions at the forthcoming Naples
summit.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Efficiency 'must be priority for EU policy': Questions on
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edzard Reuter, 66, chairman since 1987 of German industrial group
Daimler-Benz. A long-standing member of the Social Democratic Party, Reuter
has presided over Daimler-Benz's diversification into the high technology
and aerospace business.
Can Germany give a lead in attempting to steer Europe out of its political
and economic difficulties? There can be no doubt that Germany has an
important role to play, as Europe's largest country in terms of population
and with its sound economic basis. No European nation alone can face all the
challenges. These are problems we need to solve together - because they are
European problems. We must remember that Europe does not just consist of the
EU. The development of social and economic stability in eastern Europe will
greatly influence the future of Europe as a whole.
Should the European parliament be given greater powers? An integrated legal
system is a pre-requisite for effective relationships with partners outside
the EU. I believe that the EU is developing from an economic community into
a political union, an internationally recognised political force. This has
brought with it many rights, but also many duties, in particular a duty
towards political integration incorporating a strong democracy.
Where do you think the EU should place its greatest priorities in economic
and social policy during the next three to four years? We must strive to
improve the structures and efficiency of our economies. That means
developing innovative products and gaining access to new markets. We have to
exploit our creativity and increase our flexibility. The sooner we do this,
the better. Protectionism does not help anyone. We need to be in a position
to stand up to worldwide competition.
Should the EU during the next few years give priority to deepening the
current level of integration of the 12 members, or to widening it towards
eastern Europe?
Both goals must be pursued simultaneously.
What is the earliest EU membership by the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland
might be practicable? We must take care not to put the existing community
under unnecessary strain. The expansion of the EU must be carried out step
by step and not overnight.
Is the aim of economic and monetary union by 1997 or 1999 still practicable?
Yes - and that I can say with every confidence. The concept for European
monetary union revolves around the principle of stability, ruling out the
possibility of sudden fluctuations which can produce destructive effects in
business. Monetary integration is without a doubt an integral element of
economic as well as political integration.
What other objectives should the EU follow? Economic integration alone will
not be enough to create a stable European Union. The other objectives of the
Maastricht Treaty, a common foreign and security policy, must be implemented
without undue delay.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Hurd seeks truce with rebels before European election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd yesterday sought to call a truce with the Tory Euro-sceptics
before next month's European elections and insisted that Mr John Major would
defeat any attempt to oust him as prime minister even if the party suffered
heavy losses.
'He will continue as prime minister. He will not be defeated. He will not
resign,' the foreign secretary told the Scottish Conservative conference in
Inverness.
Mr Hurd's unqualified support for Mr Major reflects a growing consensus
among senior cabinet ministers that the party would be seriously damaged by
a leadership election in the autumn.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, is expected to deliver a
similar pledge of loyalty when he addresses the conference today.
Significantly, Mr Major was also given outspoken support by Mr Michael
Forsyth, the Thatcherite employment minister, who is tipped to enter the
cabinet as Scottish secretary if Mr Ian Lang becomes party chairman in a
summer reshuffle.
Mr Forsyth called Mr Major 'a man of steel', and warned 'windy backbenchers
and retired generals' to give their advice 'in private, not transmitted
through enemy lines'.
Mr Hurd warned the conference that the Conservatives would avoid disaster in
the elections on June 9 only if the party stopped 'scratching at old wounds'
over Europe.
Mr Hurd tried to appeal to Euro-sceptics by pointing out that the European
Union was increasingly accepting the need for 'variable geometry' - code for
a more flexible community of nation states. He said: 'This is a multi-track,
multi-speed, even multi-layered approach which will increasingly be the way
of the future. It threatens no one.'
Mr Hurd said the EU was already developing an emphasis on competitiveness,
deregulation and subsidiarity which would be encouraged by the accession of
Austria and three Nordic applicants next year.
He said the union's growing flexibility was reflected in Britain's opt-outs
from the Maastricht agreements on monetary union and social policy, and the
exclusion of some EU members from the Western European Union defence
agreement and the Schengen border treaty.
There was no question of Britain being left in a 'slow lane or outer circle'
of the EU. 'There may be areas in which some members of the union see
advantage in closer integration, while others choose to stand aside. Beyond
the core disciplines, we want Europe to develop in tune with the sentiments
and interests of its separate peoples.'
Mr Hurd's speech, however, followed an acrimonious debate in which
Euro-sceptics demanded a referendum on any move towards British
participation in a single European currency, and accused the party hierarchy
of trying to stamp out dissent.

FT  12 MAY 94 / UK upturn continues despite fall in March production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British manufacturing output dropped slightly in March after two months of
strong growth, surprising economists who had expected a rise in production,
and highlighting the uneven nature of the UK recovery.
But in spite of this monthly dip, official figures for the first three
months of 1994 showed that British business recorded its largest rise in
manufacturing output for five years, indicating that economic recovery
continues.
Output in March was 0.5 per cent lower than February, seasonally adjusted
figures from the Central Statistical Office showed yesterday.
This compares with rises of 0.4 per cent in February and nearly 1.5 per cent
in January, and was markedly lower than market expectations of a monthly
gain of about 0.3 per cent for March.
The main reason for the fall was the failure of the food, drink, tobacco and
engineering sectors to sustain their production surges recorded in the first
two months of the year.
But monthly production figures are volatile, and officials insisted that the
quarterly figures provide a better guide to the trend. These showed that
manufacturing output rose by 1.4 per cent during the first three months
compared with the final quarter of last year - the fastest growth since
March 1989 during the economic boom.
Last night, Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, suggested
that Britain's economic recovery was becoming 'more robust and
broadly-based' than the consumption-led growth that had characterised the
past two years.
'There are now hopeful signs that, as tax increases act to moderate the
growth of consumer spending, the company sector - which has enjoyed rising
profitability and an increasing financial surplus - will now increase its
investment spending,' he told the annual dinner of British factors and
discounters. Britain's trade should also 'begin to benefit from the emerging
recovery on the continent', he added.
Mr George's upbeat analysis was yesterday echoed in two new business
studies, which showed companies across the country reporting increased
business activity.
The latest regional survey from the Confederation of British Industry and
Business Strategies, a consultancy, said businesses in all UK regions have
booked increased orders over the past four months - again for the first time
since 1989.
An opinion survey by the Institute of Directors shows that 70 per cent of
directors during March and April reported increased volumes of business, up
from 61 per cent during the previous two months.
But as a sign of the uneven pace of recovery, directors have become less
optimistic about the prospects for the UK economy, mainly because of concern
about UK political instability. Nearly a quarter blamed this for falling
confidence - while only 9 per cent cited April's taxes.

FT  12 MAY 94 / Rivals claim they underbid AT&amp;T for Saudi contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Controversy over the award by Saudi Arabia of a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn)
telecommunications contract to AT&amp;T erupted into a bitter war of words
yesterday, with rival suppliers claiming that they significantly underbid
the US company.
Two of the companies also alleged that technical evaluation of the bids was
not completed before the contract was awarded earlier this week.
The contract, one of the largest in telecoms history, is for the
modernisation of the kingdom's telecommunications, including 1.5m new phone
lines and a new cellular mobile network.
All the losers - Northern Telecom of Canada, Alcatel of France, Siemens of
Germany and Ericsson of Sweden - believe the contract was awarded on
political grounds, following intense lobbying by the Clinton administration
and Saudi concern not to alienate the US.
Mr Graham Burke, Saudi Arabian general manager of Northern Telecom, said:
'We were all surprised by the outcome. Where I come from, you don't reward
third-placed finishers.'
The company claimed that its bid for the 1.5m telecoms lines amounted to
Dollars 3.2bn, with a five-year installation period - as against AT&amp;T's
winning bid of Dollars 3.9bn with a seven-year installation period.
AT&amp;T dismissed the claims as 'naive', and said the Saudi telecommunications
ministry stated that AT&amp;T won on cost, competence and technical superiority.
Mr Dan Hesse, chief executive of AT&amp;T's international network systems,
accepted that political pressure was a factor, but added: 'For many years
the US government has not supported US companies as have our foreign
competitors. Now that the US is also supporting American companies abroad,
we are hearing these complaints.'
At the opening of the bids for the initial tender last September, AT&amp;T's bid
was significantly higher than those of Northern Telecom, Ericsson and
Alcatel. Comparative and technical evaluation followed, but - the losers
claim - was abandoned a month ago.
'All of sudden, the evaluation groups stopped, and we heard a rumour that
the number of lines was to be increased from 500,000 to 1.5m - for which we
were not invited to bid,' a senior Siemens executive said.
The award, as part of the deal, of a contract for AT&amp;T to build a cellular
mobile phone network to the pan-European GSM standard aroused particular
resentment.
AT&amp;T has only one other public GSM contract in progress, in the United Arab
Emirates, whereas the other suppliers are well established. Siemens has
already installed a private GSM network in the kingdom for the royal family.

FT  12 MAY 94 / German rates cut to five-year low: Bundesbank's half-point
reduction improves prospects for European recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER, PHILIP GAWITH and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German Bundesbank cut its leading interest rates by half a percentage
point yesterday to the lowest levels for five years, improving prospects for
European economic recovery.
The Bundesbank reduced its key discount rate to 4.5 per cent, the lowest
since June 1989. Six other European central banks also eased interest rates.
The Lombard rate, which sets a ceiling for German money market rates, was
cut to 6 per cent.
The Bundesbank said the move, accelerating the pace of German interest rate
cuts, was justified by the domestic outlook for inflation, now down to 3.1
per cent in west Germany. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, welcomed
the cuts and said they would strengthen Germany's economic recovery.
In an explanation marking a shift in its traditional response to the
fast-expanding money supply, the Bundesbank said the cut would help reduce
monetary growth by encouraging investors to move funds away from bank
deposits into bonds.
On the foreign exchanges, the Bundesbank's move failed to strengthen the
dollar. The US currency rose to a high for the day of DM1.6820 after the
rate cut, but then slid by nearly a pfennig to close in London at DM1.6735.
In New York the dollar fell to DM1.66825.
Analysts said this showed the dollar would not rise without a tightening of
monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, generally expected to be
imminent. In Europe, the D-Mark finished firmer against the French franc,
closing at FFr3.430 from FFr3.424.
On European bond markets, the cuts triggered initial rallies but overall
gains on the day were held in check as traders and investors took profits.
Among other countries that eased credit yesterday, central banks in Italy,
Denmark and Austria cut their discount rates to 7 per cent from 7.5 per
cent, to 5 per cent from 5.25 per cent and to 4.5 per cent from 4.75 per
cent respectively.
The Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to 5.1 per cent from
5.3 per cent. Belgium cut the central rate to 5.35 per cent from 5.45 per
cent. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate to 5.5 per cent from 5.6
per cent before the Bundesbank council met yesterday.
The Bundesbank cuts took many economists by surprise. Broad money supply, or
M3, grew at a revised annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 15.4 per cent
in March, well above its 1994 target of 4 to 6 per cent, although the
expansion has slowed from the 20 per cent-plus rate earlier this year.
German economists said, however, that the reductions were understandable in
the light of recent dollar weakness. 'The Bundesbank has taken advantage of
an ideal constellation of circumstances,' said Mr Martin Hufner, chief
economist at the Bayerische Vereinsbank.
Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the International Bank of Japan in
Frankfurt, said the monetary easing was consistent with last week's
Bundesbank's intervention to support the dollar.
The Bundesbank believes this year's money supply figures have been distorted
by special factors. Some economists, however, questioned the logic of the
Bundesbank's argument that reducing short-term rates would damp money supply
growth by encouraging depositors to move money into long-term funds.

FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs bounce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong push by NatWest Securities transformed the recently battered
electricity sector.
Yesterday, NatWest advised its clients that the steep falls in share prices
had gone far enough and that a prospective yield premium of 30 per cent in
the regional electricity companies (recs) made them a 'strong buy'.
The broker said the recent heavy selling was caused by a leaked letter from
Offer to all the recs hinting at possible price cuts of 20 per cent or more
as the basis for opening negotiations for the electricity distribution
review now taking place. NatWest stressed, however, that the letter was
merely an opening gambit in the negotiating process and that the recs will
be able to negotiate their way to a better deal.
East Midland, up 19 1/2 at 567p, was NatWest's prime selection, after the
big job cuts and Dollars 80m assets writedown. The broker also recommended
Norweb, 7 1/2 firmer at 612p, Seeboard, up 4 1/2 at 310p, and Midlands, 13
1/2 stronger at 572p.
Lasmo shares attracted persistent keen buying interest, with dealers hinting
at further support from some of the market's leading long term investors.
The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has announced that it has built a
declarable stake of almost 22m shares in Lasmo, while Philips &amp; Drew Fund
Management is thought to have continued to buy the stock, as has Legal &amp;
General. Lasmo closed 2 1/2 up at 151 1/2 p after turnover of 7.1m.
Royal Bank of Scotland put on another powerful display in front of this
morning's interims; the shares jumped 12 1/2 more to 440 1/2 p, with bank
specialists confidently expecting an interim dividend increase of around 25
per cent.
The composite insurance sector's first-quarter reporting season started on a
rather subdued note as General Accident produced profits in line with
expectations, but disappointing figures for its solvency margin and net
asset value.
One analyst said the solvency margin, excluding its life interest, dipped
from 57 per cent to 47 per cent. GenAcc settled 4 ahead at 563p.
A broadcasting deal struck between the BBC and Pearson lifted the latter 28
to 650p.
The reporting season in the drinks sector was kicked off by Vaux, its
figures being in line with market expectations, although there was some
disappointment over the size of the dividend. The shares slid 9 to 278p.
Vaux's good hotel performance helped Greenalls add 8 at 475p. Sentiment in
Guinness was said to have been helped by BSN's purchase of a Spanish beer
group. Guinness, which has extensive Spanish interests, climbed 5 to 489p.
Discount food retailer Kwik Save eased 2 to 570p after reporting a one per
cent drop in like-for-like value sales since mid-March, although interim
profits for the 28 weeks were up 7.2 per cent to Pounds 65.4m.
The announcement that J. Sainsbury was backing down in its row over its own
label cola with Coca-Cola, which had complained over the supermarket's aped
product design, left the market unruffled and the shares gained 5 1/2 at 391
1/2 p.
British Aerospace firmed 2 1/2 to 476p as it hosted an analysts visit to its
defence operations. The stock was also helped by a positive note from
NatWest Securities. The broker said: 'Our valuation suggests a further 20
per cent share upside.'
Strong trading in British Steel brought volume of 9.6m by the close and the
shares hardened 1 3/4 to 151 1/4 p after Kleinwort Benson was said to have
recommended the stock.
Cable and Wireless added 19 at 463p as the market responded to a recent
upgrade for Hong Kong Telecom - a subsidiary of C&amp;W - by Goldman Sachs, and
the upturn in Hong Kong markets overnight, a move which was said to have
broken a trend relative to the US market.
Telecoms specialists also pointed out that Hong Kong Telecom's preliminary
figures are due on May 19, with those of C&amp;W expected a week later. 'C&amp;W are
cheap on fundamentals,' said an analyst.
Turnover in Tomkins rose to 7.3m and the shares firmed 2 to 239p after
recommendations from UBS and Nomura.

FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Do It All cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited restructuring announcement from Do It All, the home
improvement group owned by WH Smith and Boots, disappointed the market and
shares in the parent groups retreated.
Around 100 stores are to be closed or sold and provisions of Pounds 60m will
be taken by Boots and Smith. But retail analysts commented that contracts
had been exchanged on only about half of the 40 stores actually sold, and
expressed concern over the likelihood of many more being bought. There were
also worries over further trading provisions to come from the unsold stores.
Smith shares were the worst hit, tumbling 9 1/2 to 506 1/2 p, mainly because
Do It All is a bigger part of the company's trading than Boots. The latter,
which rose 12 initially with the market, closed 3 up at 556p.
Smith is likely to remain in the news, with stores specialists predicting an
announcement from the retailer in the next few weeks that it is to
restructure its shares.
Smith 'B' shares, which receive one fifth of the dividend of the 'A' stock,
are currently trading at a 16 per cent premium to the 'A's. A move to
consolidate the shares would probably involve a slight dilution of the 'A's
and could be accompanied by a dividend or share issue sweetener.

FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong demand for Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas was by far the most actively traded FT-SE 100 constituent as the
market delivered a positive verdict to the joint Department of Trade/Ofgas
report on competition and pricing in domestic gas supply.
The report was published on Monday afternoon, after which Gas closed
marginally higher. But yesterday saw a surge in Gas shares, which jumped 11
1/2 to 296 1/2 p in exceptionally heavy turnover of 24m.
Hoare Govett, Gas's broker, described the report as 'encouraging', while Mr
Stephen Turner at Nomura was much more forthright, issuing his first buy
recommendation on Gas for more than two years. 'The lack of detail in the
DTI/Ofgas paper suggests that the government is losing its enthusiasm for
competition in the domestic gas market,' he said.
The Nomura analyst also pointed out that Gas's earnings are conservatively
stated and that under generally accepted accounting policies net income
would be 20 per cent higher, putting the shares on a 20 per cent discount to
the market multiple in 1995.

FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rally in European bond markets led to strong trading in the derivatives
sector, which in turn pulled the cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, dealers had expected a slow start to trading in the June
contract on the FT-SE 100. However, buying from a US house and a leading
independent trader helped it open strongly at 3,112.
The reduction in the German interest rates, together with the renewed
strength in European bonds, only served to fuel the rise in the June future,
and sent the cash market higher. June reached the peak of the day at around
1pm when it stood at 3,171.
Profit-taking after lunch saw it ease off the top but further buying was
seen following a firm opening on Wall Street.

FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shift in rate views takes Footsie
sharply higher - Market Report
</HEADLINE>

London followed other European markets yesterday in turning strongly
positive on the chances that the Bundesbank may cut German rates again while
the US Federal Reserve is preoccupied with its Dollars 29bn refunding
programme. With US bonds firmer and the Bundesbank due to meet this morning
after trimming repo rates yesterday, British government bonds and stock
index futures led UK equities to a 38-point Footsie gain on the session.
A modest check to the advance came in late trading when uncertainties over
the domestic political scene resurfaced.
Share prices opened easier but were driven forward when the stock index
futures market opened with a burst of strength. 'It is quite clear that the
institutions are heavy supporters at the Footsie 3,100 mark,' commented one
trader. The FT-SE 100 Index moved from 3,097.4 to 3,102.2 as soon as the
June Footsie contract opened for trading.
Equities then moved ahead steadily, taking their lead from UK bonds and
derivatives and from the cut in German repo rates. At best the FT-SE 100 was
40.9 ahead. London received a further boost when Wall Street opened with a
20-point gain on the Dow and US Federal bonds moved higher.
The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at 3,136.3 for a net advance of 38.5.
Once again, the action in the stock index future put the focus on the
Footsie stocks, and the second line issues played a more subdued role. At
3,753.3, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 11.2 ahead.
Stock Exchange statistics confirmed that selling pressure had been very
light on Monday when the market came under pressure from bond prices.
Monday's Seaq volume was only 480.6m shares and was worth a mere Pounds
912.9m at retail level, the lowest genuine daily investment total this year.
Yesterday, Seaq turnover jumped to 728.9m shares and traders were confident
that retail value, which will be known today, will show a similar increase.
Analysts suggested that London, like other European markets, had shown clear
signs yesterday that it was decoupling from US Federal bonds. But some
pointed out that global markets are under special pressures this week.
With many European markets closed tomorrow for a religious holiday and the
Federal Reserve pinned down for two days by its refunding programme, today's
Bundesbank policy meeting has a clear market horizon. Markets are hopeful
for a 25 to 50 basis-point cut in the German discount rate.
However, Thursday and Friday will bring a heavy flow of economic data in the
US and this could renew pressure on the Fed to raise rates.
Traders stressed that technical factors played a significant role yesterday.
The very thin trading volumes recorded on Monday, when the market appeared
to be below the bottom of its trading range, indicated that marketmakers had
been unable to attract much business at these levels.
Since marketmaking firms cannot prosper by avoiding business, they were
ready to mark prices higher yesterday as soon as the clouds lifted.
Any move today by the Bundesbank will have a positive effect on markets, but
the more significant investment decisions may be held back until the end of
the week when the Federal Reserve scans the statistics on US producer and
retail prices, the consumer price index and jobless claims.

FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities rally as Treasury
prices rebound

Wall Street
A big rally in the Treasury market helped US share prices rebound from
Monday's losses yesterday, but investors remained concerned about rising
interest rates and the possibility of another monetary policy tightening by
the Federal Reserve, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.37 at 3,656.41. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 regained 3.69 at 446.01, while the
Nasdaq composite rose 2.04 to 725.00. Trading volume on the New York SE
amounted to 295.6m shares, while advances outpaced declines by 1,316 to 881.
A semblance of calm was restored to the equity markets yesterday after the
previous day's gyrations and heavy losses. Shares were aided by a sharp
snap-back in Treasury prices, which were boosted by strong demand for US
government securities from overseas buyers - particularly Japanese and
Middle Eastern - a stronger dollar, and by a successful afternoon auction of
three-year Treasury notes. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year
government bond was up by more than 1 1/2 points, and the yield had dropped
to just under 7.5 per cent.
Analysts said that another factor boosting stocks was the feeling among some
institutional investors that the market had become slightly 'oversold' in
recent days, a feeling which prompted some bargain hunting yesterday.
In spite of the gains, the mood was not particularly upbeat, said traders.
Investors' main concern - that interest rates will continue to rise as the
Fed acts to slow the rapidly expanding economy and bond investors continue
to express their doubts about the central bank's ability to control
inflation - continued to undermine sentiment.
Among individual stocks, AT&amp;T advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53 in heavy
trading of 6.06m shares after the company announced that it had won a
Dollars 4bn contract from Saudi Arabia to rewire the country for advanced
telecommunications services.
In a similar move, shares in IDB Communications, which are quoted on the
Nasdaq market, forged ahead Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 in volume of
2.7m shares after the company signed an agreement to provide direct
long-distance telephone services between the US and Saudi Arabia.
Computer stocks were in demand. Hewlett-Packard climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 78 1/2 , Compaq added Dollars 2 at Dollars 109, IBM firmed Dollars 1
to Dollars 58 and Digital Equipment rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/4 .
Auto stocks were also higher as a group, with Ford up Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 59 1/4 , General Motors Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 55 1/2 and
Chrysler Dollars 1 3/8 better at Dollars 46 1/8 .
PDA Engineering jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 5 5/8 after
MacNeal-Schwendler (up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 12 1/2 on the American Stock
Exchange) agreed to buy the company for Dollars 6.85 a share.
Canada
Toronto stocks ended on a mixed note, with traders saying the market will
remain edgy until the US Federal Reserve unveils its rate plans.
The TSE 300 composite index gained 10.8 at 4,189.9 but declines outpaced
advances by 381 to 348, with 326 issues holding their ground. There was a
moderate trade of 48.7m shares valued at CDollars 506m.
Of the TSE's 14 sub-sectors, 11 ended higher. But the gains were muted by a
tumble in precious metals shares. The gold and silver index fell 203.6, or
2.10 per cent, to 9,511.6 as gold prices were whacked by strong gains in the
US dollar.
A trader said the low volume could be an indication that the market has
bottomed. But others said it is chiefly a sign of burgeoning investor fears.
Active issues were topped by PWA Corp, the airline holding company still in
the throes of a painful restructuring. PWA was steady at CDollars 0.55.
South Africa's financial markets were closed yesterday for the inauguration
of Mr Nelson Mandela as president.
